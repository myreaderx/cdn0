You offer something similar — but, of course, much better.</p>  \n<p>Then, suddenly, your competitor's product is <em>everywhere</em>. News articles, online reviews, best-of lists, buyers' guides, even TV segments.</p> \n<p>How is this happening? And your real question: why isn't it happening to <em>you</em>?</p> \n<p>To compete against your competitors, there's one thing you'll need in your wheelhouse: a media kit.</p> \n<p>Here, we'll explore what a media kit is, and how it can help you increase brand awareness and, ultimately, sales.</p> \n<p>Plus, how to make one for your own brand.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=0adc0556-31bd-4bf1-924b-6a0e48a4bedb&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Download Now: Free Media Kit Template\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/0adc0556-31bd-4bf1-924b-6a0e48a4bedb.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<p>Media kits may live fully-online as responsive online <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/agency/perfect-press-page\"><span>press pages</span></a>. Or, businesses may choose to make their press kits available as static, downloadable resources, like a presentation deck.</p> \n<p>Whatever format you choose, this much is clear: businesses of all sizes benefit from having a professional, readily-accessible media kit. This vital resource is a key to the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-earned-media-faqs\"><span>earned media coverage</span></a> all businesses covet — from massive Fortune 500 corporations all the way down to individual influencers and solopreneurs.</p> \n<p>A comprehensive media kit should include a description of the company or individual, contact information, social media statistics, case studies, information on partnerships and collaborations, and testimonials from past customers.</p> \n<p>Basically, it's all the information a journalist would need to feature your brand in a breaking news story — without the headache of a last-minute information request.</p> \n<h2 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">How to Make a Media Kit: What to Include</h2> \n<p>So, you want press coverage and partnerships (what brand doesn't?). And you understand how a media kit helps make this all possible. But how do you <em>make</em> a media kit?</p> \n<p>Here's some good news: most of the content and creative assets you need to create your press kit likely already exist.</p> \n<p>Key elements of a media kit include a bio or About Us page, social media statistics, case studies, partnerships and collaborations, and testimonials. To make it even easier for the press to cover your work, you'll want to include high-quality brand identity images (think both logos, and other brand images or product/service images).</p> \n<p>It's up to you to (1) find this information, (2) make it look spectacular, and (3) make it painfully easy to find on your site. The rumors you've heard about journalists and how overworked they are? Entirely true.</p> \n<p>To catch the attention of someone on tight deadlines with an internet full of story prospects, you're going to want to make this simple. Most brands choose a direct page name like \"Press\" or \"Media\" –– or, if they're really fancy, \"Newsroom\" –– and make it accessible directly from their homepage (often in the Footer).</p> \n<p>Even if you prioritize a web version, having a downloadable media kit or deck is worth the time investment. Some media users might prefer the traditional form of this resource, and it gives you the best opportunity to control your pitch and tailor content to all audiences.</p> \n<h3>Biography or About Us</h3> \n<p>Let's start with the star of your media kit: <em>you</em>. Here's where you introduce your name, your logo, your mission. Make sure your media kit design reinforces your overall brand identity, utilizing the colors, fonts, and other visual hallmarks set out in your branding guide.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://evernote.com/about-us\"><span>Evernote</span></a> goes all-out in this section, housing their press kit information within the broader \"About Us\" portion of their website. All the essentials for journalists and partners are there too, but the organization's values take center stage.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Media%20Kit_Evernote-min.png?width=1205&amp;name=Media%20Kit_Evernote-min.png\" alt=\"Evernote's media kit homepage\" width=\"1205\" style=\"width: 1205px;\"></p> \n<h3>Social Statistics</h3> \n<p>For social stats, you'll need to conduct a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/customers/check-pulse-digital-strategy-social-media-audit\"><span>social media audit</span></a> or collect this data from whoever manages your social channels. Remember your audience for the press kit: media and PR professionals.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>Your media kit needs to effectively pitch your brand to people who specialize in getting people's attention. So show them you're capable of sparking conversation — and show them there's <em>already</em> an audience eager for stories about you and your work.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/help/brand_assets\"><span>Kickstarter</span></a> puts a unique stamp on this section of their media kit page, highlighting a few top metrics that show massive engagement with their service.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Media%20Kit_Kickstarter-min.png?width=2138&amp;name=Media%20Kit_Kickstarter-min.png\" alt=\"Kickstarter's media kit social media statistics\" width=\"2138\" style=\"width: 2138px;\"></p> \n<p>Media kits aimed at partnerships and collaborations should prioritize <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/vanity-metrics-to-stop-measuring-and-better-alternatives\"><span>engagement rates and similar actionable metrics</span></a> alongside the bread-and-butter statistics like follower counts. Savvy marketers want to partner with brands and influencers that move people to action.</p> \n<p>[Note: If you are a HubSpot Social user, you can use <a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/social-media-user-guide-v2/how-to-use-the-social-reports-tool\"><span>Reports</span></a> to analyze the performance of your social posts and determine how well your social media efforts are performing.]</p> \n<h3 style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Partnerships and Case Studies</h3> \n<p>This section is your chance to let past partnerships and brand collaborations speak for themselves. Let the old adage \"<em>show; don't tell</em>\" be your guide here. Featuring the right partnerships –– either via logos or through short case studies –– is a subtle but powerful tool for positioning your brand.</p> \n<p>International football influencers <a href=\"http://thef2.com/campaigns/\"><span>The F2</span></a> highlight past campaigns, putting reputable brand names and logos front-and-center.

Only a few lines of text (even just a single short quote) and a single related image gets the point across, lending your pitch greater credibility thanks to <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaysondemers/2015/02/19/the-importance-of-social-validation-in-online-marketing/#50f51463364d\"><span>social validation</span></a>.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://briogeohair.com/pages/press\"><span>Briogeo</span></a> does a fantastic job highlighting testimonials on its Press &amp; Buzz page, right below the rewards section for easy access:<br><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/briogeo.png?width=1388&amp;name=briogeo.png\" alt=\"briogeo's media kit homepage with testimonials\" width=\"1388\" style=\"width: 1388px;\"></p> \n<h3 style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Visual Assets (Downloadables)</h3> \n<p>Your media kit isn't a style guide, but it should pull in the most essential elements of your visual brand. Want your logo and that slick product screenshot to display correctly?</p> \n<p>Provide exactly the images and files you want featured. Have a killer data visualization, infographic, or product video? Include that, too.</p> \n<p>Journalists will especially appreciate portraits of your management team. They're most likely to cover stories involving people, so show them the people they'll want to write about.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.birchbox.com/press/news\"><span>Birchbox</span></a> makes this easy. They highlight \"Press Materials\" and link to a short but comprehensive set of resources.

Remember, the audience for your media kit is especially busy and juggling lots of competing priorities. Jump to the top of their \"potential posts\" pile by making their job as easy and painless as possible.</p> \n<p>(Added bonus: your external media resources are easily updated –– sparing you anxiety about outdated media kits and image files misrepresenting your brand.)</p> \n<h2>Media Kit Design</h2> \n<p>Now that you know what to include in your media kit, you might be wondering how to put all of that valuable information together so that it’s navigable and easy to understand. You’ll do this through a table of contents.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The way your table of contents looks can vary depending on how you design your media kit. On Slack’s website, its media kit has a table of contents that features summaries of each section with hyperlinks that bring users to a separate page, as shown in the image below.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/slack%20website.jpg?width=1480&amp;name=slack%20website.jpg\" alt=\"slack website media kit table of contents\" width=\"1480\" style=\"width: 1480px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"https://slack.com/media-kit\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>If you download Slack’s media kit as a PDF, the table of contents lists a page number for each section, so viewers can quickly scroll to the page they need or type the page number into the search bar.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/slack%20image%202.jpeg?width=1650&amp;name=slack%20image%202.jpeg\" alt=\"slack downloadable media kit table of contents\" width=\"1650\" style=\"width: 1650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"https://slack.com/media-kit\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Regardless of how you present your kit, it needs to be designed for ease of access. Aim to create distinct sections for the content you’re including, and create a form of navigation that helps those making inquiries quickly find what they need.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Let’s go over some high-quality examples of media kits that you can use for inspiration when creating one for your business.&nbsp;</p> \n<h2>Media Kit Examples</h2> \n<h3>1. Hinge</h3> \n<p>Hinge, a dating app, has a straightforward and easy to navigate press kit that gives those doing media inquiries quick access to critical information, like internal press releases:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/hinge%20image%201.jpg?width=2642&amp;name=hinge%20image%201.jpg\" alt=\"press kit example: hinge media kit\" width=\"2642\" style=\"width: 2642px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"https://hinge.co/press/\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>As well as external news articles, employee profiles, business background, and image downloads (logo, screenshots, etc.).</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/hinge%20image%202.png?width=2752&amp;name=hinge%20image%202.png\" alt=\"press kit example: hinge media kit downloadables\" width=\"2752\" style=\"width: 2752px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"https://hinge.co/press/\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<h3>2.

Market researchers investigate several areas of the market, and it can take weeks or even months to paint an accurate picture of the business landscape.</p> \n<p>However, researching just one of those areas can make you more intuitive to who your buyers are and how to deliver value that no other business is offering them right now.</p> \n<p>Certainly you can make sound judgment calls based on your experience in the industry and your existing customers. However, keep in mind that market research offers benefits beyond those strategies. There are two things to consider:&nbsp;</p> \n<ol> \n <li><strong>Your competitors also have experienced individuals in the industry and a customer base.</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>It's very possible that your immediate resources are, in many ways, equal to those of your competition's immediate resources. Seeking a larger sample size for answers can provide a better edge.&nbsp;</li> \n <li><strong>Your customers don't represent the attitudes of an entire market.</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>They represent the attitudes of the part of the market that is already drawn to your brand.&nbsp;</li> \n</ol> \n<p>The market research services market is growing rapidly, which signifies a strong interest in market research as we enter 2022.

By understanding your buyer's problems, pain points, and desired solutions, you can aptly craft your product or service to naturally appeal to them.</p> \n<p>Market research also provides insight into a <em>wide</em> variety of things that impact your bottom line, including:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Where your target audience and current customers conduct their product or service research</li> \n <li>Which of your competitors your target audience looks to for information, options, or purchases</li> \n <li>What's trending in your industry and in the eyes of your buyer</li> \n <li>Who makes up your market and what their challenges are</li> \n <li>What influences purchases and conversions among your target audience&nbsp;</li> \n <li>Consumer attitudes about a particular topic, pain, product, or brand</li> \n <li>Whether there's demand for the business initiatives you're investing in</li> \n <li>Unaddressed or underserved customer needs that can be flipped into selling opportunity</li> \n <li>Attitudes about pricing for a particular product or service</li> \n</ul> \n<div> \n <div> \n  <div> \n   <p>Ultimately, market research allows you to get information from a larger sample size of your target audience, eliminating bias and assumptions so that you can get to the heart of consumer attitudes. As a result, you can make better business decisions from knowing the bigger picture.</p> \n  </div> \n </div> \n</div> \n<p></p> \n<p>As you begin honing in on your market research, you'll likely hear about primary and secondary market research. The easiest way to think about primary and secondary research is to envision to umbrellas sitting beneath market research: one for primary market research and one for secondary market research.</p> \n<p>Beneath these two umbrellas sits a number of <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/market-research-buyers-journey-guide#types-of-market-research\">different types of market research, which we'll highlight below</a>. Defining which of the two umbrellas your market research fits beneath isn't necessarily crucial, although some marketers prefer to make the distinction.</p> \n<p>So, in case you encounter a marketer who wants to define your types of market research as primary or secondary — or if you're one of them — let's cover the definitions of the two categories next. Then, we'll look at the different <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/market-research-buyers-journey-guide#types-of-market-research\">types of market research in the following section</a>.&nbsp;</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>Primary vs. Secondary Research</h2> \n<p>To give you an idea of how extensive market research can get, consider that it can either be<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>qualitative</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>or<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>quantitative</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>in nature — depending on the studies you conduct and what you're trying to learn about your industry.</p> \n<p>Qualitative research is concerned with public opinion, and explores how the market feels about the products currently available in that market. Quantitative research is concerned with data, and looks for relevant trends in the information that's gathered from public records.</p> \n<p>There are two main types of market research that your business can conduct to collect actionable information on your products, including primary research and secondary research. Let's dive into those two types, now.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>Primary Research</h3> \n<p>Primary research is the pursuit of first-hand information about your market and the customers within your market. It's&nbsp;useful when <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-segmentation\">segmenting</a> your market and establishing your buyer personas. Primary market research tends to fall into one of two buckets: exploratory and specific research.</p> \n<h4>Exploratory Primary Research</h4> \n<p>This kind of primary market research is less concerned with measurable customer trends and more about potential problems that would be worth tackling as a team. It normally takes place as a first step — before any specific research has been performed — and may involve open-ended interviews or surveys with small numbers of people.</p> \n<h4>Specific Primary Research</h4> \n<p>Specific primary market research often follows exploratory research and is used to dive into issues or opportunities the business has already identified as important. In specific research, the business can take a smaller or more precise segment of their audience and ask questions aimed at solving a suspected problem.</p> \n<h3>Secondary Research</h3> \n<p>Secondary research is all the data and public records you have at your disposal to draw conclusions from (e.g. trend reports, market statistics, industry content, and sales data you already have on your business). Secondary research is particularly useful for <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/competitive-analysis-kit\">analyzing your competitors</a>. The main buckets your secondary market research will fall into include:</p> \n<h4><strong>Public Sources</strong></h4> \n<p>These sources are your first and most-accessible layer of material when conducting secondary market research. They're often free to find and review — lots of bang for your buck here.</p> \n<p>Government statistics are one of the most common types of public sources according to <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/encyclopedia/secondary-market-research\">Entrepreneur.</a> Two U.S. examples of public market data are the <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/\">U.S. Census Bureau</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/\">Bureau of Labor &amp; Statistics</a>, both of which offer helpful information on the state of various industries nationwide.</p> \n<h4><strong>Commercial Sources</strong></h4> \n<p><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">These sources often come in the form of market reports, consisting of industry insight compiled by a research agency like <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/\">Pew</a>, <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en\">Gartner</a>, or <a href=\"https://go.forrester.com/\">Forrester</a>. Because this info is so portable and distributable, it typically costs money to download and obtain.</span></p> \n<h4><strong>Internal Sources</strong></h4> \n<p><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Internal sources deserve more credit for supporting market research than they generally get. Why? This is the market data your organization already has! </span></p> \n<p><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Average revenue per sale, customer retention rates, and other historical data on the health of old and new accounts can all help you draw conclusions on what your buyers might want right now.</span></p> \n<p>Now that we've covered these overarching market research categories, let's get more specific and look at the various types of market research you might choose to conduct.&nbsp;</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>1. Interviews</h3> \n<p>Interviews allow for face-to-face discussions (in-person and virtual) so you can allow for a natural flow or conversation and watch your interviewee's body language while doing so.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Your interviewees can answer questions about themselves to help you design your buyer personas. These buyer personas describe your ideal customer's age, family size, budget, job title, the challenges they face at work, and similar aspects of their lifestyle. Having this buyer profile in hand can shape your entire marketing strategy, from the features you add to your product to the content you publish on your website.</p> \n<h3>2. Focus Groups</h3> \n<p>Focus groups provide you with a handful of carefully-selected people that you can have test out your product, watch a demo, provide feedback, and/or answer specific questions.</p> \n<p>This type of market research can give you ideas for product differentiation, or the qualities of your product that make it unique in the marketplace. Consider asking your focus group questions about (and showing them examples of) your services, and ultimately use the group's feedback to make these services better.</p> \n<h3>3. Product/Service Use Research</h3> \n<p>Product or service use research offers insight into how and why your audience uses your product or service, and specific features of that item. This type of market research also gives you an idea of the product or service's <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/usability-testing\">usability</a> for your target audience.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2020/08/user-fountains-2020-usability-testing-industry-report.php\">2020 report</a>, respondents rated usability testing most highly in terms of usefulness for discovering user insights (rating it 8.7 out of 10). By comparison, digital analytics was rated 7.7, and user surveys 6.4.</p> \n<h3>4. Observation-Based Research</h3> \n<p>Observation-based research allows you to sit back and watch the ways in which your target audience members go about using your product or service, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/qualitative-research-methods\">what works well in terms of UX</a>, what roadblocks they hit, and which aspects of it could be easier for them to use and apply.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>5. Buyer Persona Research</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/buyer-persona-research\">Buyer persona research</a> gives you a realistic look at who makes up your target audience, what their challenges are, why they want your product or service, what they need from your business and brand, and more.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>6. Market Segmentation Research</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/customers/how-to-segment-and-nurture-your-customers-with-hubspot\">Market segmentation</a> research allows you to categorize your target audience into different groups (or segments) based on specific and defining characteristics — this way, you can determine effective ways to meet their needs, understand their pain points and expectations, learn about their goals, and more.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>7. Pricing Research</h3> \n<p>Pricing research gives you an idea of what similar products or services in your market sell for, what your target audience expects to pay — and is willing to pay — for whatever it is you sell, and what's a fair price for you to list your product or service at. All of this information will help you define your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/pricing-strategy\">pricing strategy</a>.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>8. Competitive Analysis</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/competitive-analysis-kit\">Competitive analyses</a> are valuable because they give you a deep understanding of the competition in your market and industry. You can learn about what's doing well in your industry, what your target audience is already going for in terms of products like yours, which of your competitors should you work to keep up with and surpass, and how you can clearly <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/competitor-analysis-guide\">separate yourself from the competition</a>.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>9. Customer Satisfaction and Loyalty Research</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/what-is-customer-satisfaction\">Customer satisfaction</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-loyalty\">loyalty</a> research give you a look into how you can get current customers to return for more business and what will motivate them to do so (e.g. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-loyalty-program\">loyalty programs</a>, rewards, remarkable customer service). This research will help you discover the most-effective ways to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-delight\">promote delight among your customers</a>.</p> \n<h3>10. Brand Awareness Research</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/brand-awareness\">Brand awareness</a> research tells you about what your target audience knows about and recognizes from your brand. It tells you about the associations your audience members make when they think about your business and what they believe you're all about.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>11. Campaign Research</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-campaigns\">Campaign</a> research entails looking into your past campaigns and analyzing their success among your target audience and current customers. It requires experimentation and then a deep dive into what reached and resonated with your audience so you can keep those elements in mind for your future campaigns and hone in on the aspects of what you do that matters most to those people.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Now that you know about the categories and types of market research, let's review how you can <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/market-research-buyers-journey-guide\">conduct your market research</a>.</p> \n<a></a> \n<p>Here's how to do market research step-by-step. </p> \n<div> \n <div> \n  <h3>1. Define your buyer persona.</h3> \n </div> \n <div> \n  <div> \n   <p>Before you dive into <em>how</em> customers in your industry make buying decisions, you must first understand <em>who</em> they are.</p> \n   <p>This is where your buyer personas come in handy. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/buyer-persona-definition-under-100-sr\">Buyer personas</a> — sometimes referred to as marketing personas — are fictional, generalized representations of your ideal customers.</p> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/make-my-persona?hubs_post-cta=pillar_allphrase\"><em>Use a free tool to create a buyer persona that your entire company can use to market, sell, and serve better.</em></a></p> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/make-my-persona?hubs_post-cta=image\"><img alt=\"How to do market research defining your buyer persona\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/define-your-buyer-persona.png?width=1500&amp;name=define-your-buyer-persona.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 1500px;\" width=\"1500\" /></a></p> \n   <p>They help you visualize your audience, streamline your communications, and inform your strategy. Some key characteristics you should be keen on including in your buyer persona are:</p> \n   <ul> \n    <li>Age</li> \n    <li>Gender</li> \n    <li>Location</li> \n    <li>Job title(s)</li> \n    <li>Job titles</li> \n    <li>Family size</li> \n    <li>Income</li> \n    <li>Major challenges</li> \n   </ul> \n   <p>The idea is to use your persona as a guideline for&nbsp; how to effectively reach and learn about the real audience members in your industry. Also, you may find that your business lends itself to more than one persona — that's fine! You just need to be&nbsp; thoughtful about each specific persona when you're optimizing and planning your content and campaigns.</p> \n   <p>To get started with creating your personas, check out these <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/persona-templates\">free templates</a>, as well as <a href=\"http://makemypersona.com/\">this helpful tool.</a>&nbsp;</p> \n  </div> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div> \n <div> \n  <h3>2. Identify a persona group to engage.</h3> \n </div> \n <div> \n  <p>Now that you know who your buyer personas are, use that information to help you identify a group to engage to conduct your market research with — this should be a representative sample of your target customers so you can better understand their actual characteristics, challenges, and buying habits.</p> \n  <p>The group you identify to engage should also be made of people who recently made a purchase or purposefully decided not to make one. Here are some more guidelines and tips to help you get the right participants for your research.&nbsp;</p> \n  <h4>How to Identify the Right People to Engage for Market Research</h4> \n  <p>When choosing who to engage for your market research, start by focusing on people who have the characteristics that apply to your buyer persona. You should also:</p> Aim for 10 participants per buyer persona. \n  <p><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">We recommend focusing on one persona, but if you feel it's necessary to research multiple personas, be sure to recruit a separate sample group for each one.</span></p> \n  <h6><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Select people who have recently interacted with you.</span></h6> \n  <p><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">You may want to focus on people that have completed an evaluation within the past six months — or up to a year if you have a longer sales cycle or niche market. You'll be asking very detailed questions so it's important that their experience is fresh.</span></p> \n  <h6>Gather a mix of participants.</h6> \n  <p style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem;\">You want to recruit people who have purchased your product, purchased a competitor's product, and decided not to purchase anything at all. While your customers will be the easiest to find and recruit, sourcing information from those who aren't customers (yet!) will help you develop a balanced view of your market.&nbsp;</span></p> Here are some more details on how to select this mix of participants: \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Pull a list of customers who made a recent purchase. </strong><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; font-weight: 400;\">As we mentioned before, this is usually the easiest set of buyers to recruit. If you're using a CRM system, you can run a report of deals that closed within the past six months and filter it for the characteristics you're looking for. Otherwise, you can work with your sales team to get a list of appropriate accounts from them.</span></li> \n   <li><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Pull a list of customers who were in an active evaluation, but didn't make a purchase.</strong> You should get a mix of buyers who either purchased from a competitor or decided not to make a purchase. Again, you can get this list from your CRM or from whatever system your Sales team uses to track deals.</span></li> \n   <li><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Call for participants on social media.</strong> Try reaching out to the folks that follow you on social media, but decided not to buy from you. There's a chance that some of them will be willing to talk to you and tell you why they ultimately decided not to buy your product.</span></li> \n   <li><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Leverage your own network.</strong> Get the word out to your coworkers, former colleagues, and LinkedIn connections that you're conducting a study. Even if your direct connections don't qualify, some of them will likely have a coworker, friend, or family member who does.</span></li> \n   <li><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Choose an incentive.</strong> </span><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; font-weight: 400;\">Time is precious, so you'll need to think about how you will motivate someone to spend 30-45 minutes on you and your study. On a tight budget? You can reward participants for free by giving them exclusive access to content. Another option? Send a simple handwritten 'thank you' note once the study is complete.</span>&nbsp;</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div> \n <div> \n  <h3>3. Prepare research questions for your market research participants.</h3> \n </div> \n <div> \n  <div> \n   <p>The best way to make sure you get the most out of your conversations is to be prepared. You should always create a discussion guide — whether it's for a focus group, online survey, or a phone interview — to make sure you cover all of the top-of-mind questions and use your time wisely.</p> \n   <p>(Note: This is not intended to be a script. The discussions should be natural and conversational, so we encourage you to go out of order or probe into certain areas as you see fit.)</p> \n   <p>Your discussion guide should be in an outline format, with a time allotment and open-ended questions for each section.</p> \n   <p><em>Wait, all open-ended questions? </em></p> \n   <p>Yes — this is a golden rule of market research. You never want to \"lead the witness\" by asking yes and no questions, as that puts you at risk of unintentionally swaying their thoughts by leading with your own hypothesis. Asking open-ended questions also helps you avoid one-word answers (which aren't very helpful for you).</p> \n   <h4>Example Outline of a 30-Minute Survey&nbsp;</h4> \n   <p>Here's a general outline for a 30-minute survey for one B2B buyer. You can use these as talking points for an in-person interview, or as questions posed on a digital form to administer as a survey to your target customers.</p> \n   <h5>Background Information (5 Minutes)</h5> \n   <p>Ask the buyer to give you a little background information (their title, how long they've been with the company, and so on). Then, ask a fun/easy question to warm things up (first concert attended, favorite restaurant in town, last vacation, etc.).</p> \n   <p>Remember, you want to get to know your buyers in pretty specific ways. You might be able to capture basic information such as age, location, and job title from your contact list, there are some personal and professional challenges you can really only learn by asking.</p> \n   <p>Here are some other key background questions to ask your target audience:</p> \n   <ul> \n    <li>Describe how your team is structured.</li> \n    <li>Tell me about your personal job responsibilities.</li> \n    <li>What are the team's goals and how do you measure them?</li> \n    <li>What has been your biggest challenge in the past year?</li> \n   </ul> \n   <p>Now, make a transition to acknowledge the specific purchase or interaction they made that led to you including them in the study. The next three <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/what-is-the-buyers-journey\">stages of the buyer's journey</a> will focus specifically on that purchase.</p> \n   <h5>Awareness (5 Minutes)</h5> \n   <p>Here, you want to understand how they first realized they had a problem that needed to be solved without getting into whether or not they knew about your brand yet.</p> \n   <ul> \n    <li>Think back to when you first realized you needed a [name the product/service category, but not yours specifically]. What challenges were you facing at the time?</li> \n    <li>How did you know that something in this category could help you?</li> \n    <li>How familiar were you with different options on the market?</li> \n   </ul> \n   <h4>Consideration (10 Minutes)</h4> \n   <p>Now you want to get very specific about how and where the buyer researched potential solutions. Plan to interject to ask for more details.</p> \n   <ul> \n    <li>What was the first thing you did to research potential solutions? How helpful was this source?</li> \n    <li>Where did you go to find more information?</li> \n   </ul> \n   <p>If they don't come up organically, ask about search engines, websites visited, people consulted, and so on. Probe, as appropriate, with some of the following questions:</p> \n   <ul> \n    <li>How did you find that source?</li> \n    <li>How did you use vendor websites?</li> \n    <li>What words specifically did you search on Google?</li> \n    <li>How helpful was it? How could it be better?</li> \n    <li>Who provided the most (and least) helpful information? What did that look like?</li> \n    <li>Tell me about your experiences with the sales people from each vendor.</li> \n   </ul> \n   <h5>Decision (10 Minutes)</h5> \n   <ul> \n    <li>Which of the sources you described above was the most influential in driving your decision?</li> \n    <li>What, if any, criteria did you establish to compare the alternatives?</li> \n    <li>What vendors made it to the short list and what were the pros/cons of each?</li> \n    <li>Who else was involved in the final decision? What role did each of these people play?</li> \n    <li>What factors ultimately influenced your final purchasing decision?</li> \n   </ul> \n   <h5>Closing</h5> \n   <p>Here, you want to wrap up and understand what could have been better for the buyer.</p> \n   <ul> \n    <li>Ask them what their ideal buying process would look like. How would it differ from what they experienced?</li> \n    <li>Allow time for further questions on their end.</li> \n    <li>Don't forget to thank them for their time and confirm their address to send a thank-you note or incentive.</li> \n   </ul> \n  </div> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div> \n <div> \n  <h3>4. List your primary competitors.</h3> \n </div> \n <div> \n  <div> \n   <p>List your primary competitors — keep in mind listing the competition isn't always as simple as Company X versus Company Y.</p> \n   <p>Sometimes, a <em>division</em> of a company might compete with your main product or service, even though that company's brand might put more effort in another area.</p> \n   <p>For example. Apple is known for its laptops and mobile devices but Apple Music competes with Spotify over its music streaming service.</p> \n   <p>From a content standpoint, you might compete with a blog, YouTube channel, or similar publication for inbound website visitors — even though their products don't overlap with yours at all.</p> \n   <p>And a toothpaste company might compete with magazines like Health.com or Prevention on certain <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/blog-topic-generator\">blog topics</a> related to health and hygiene even though the magazines don't actually sell oral care products.</p> \n   <h4>Identifying Industry Competitors</h4> \n   <p>To identify competitors whose products or services overlap with yours, determine which industry or industries you're pursuing. Start high-level, using terms like education, construction, media &amp; entertainment, food service, healthcare, retail, financial services, telecommunications, and agriculture.</p> \n   <p>The list goes on, but find an industry term that you identify with, and use it to create a list of companies that also belong to this industry. You can build your list the following ways:</p> \n   <ul> \n    <li><strong>Review your industry quadrant on G2 Crowd:</strong>&nbsp;In certain industries, this is your best first step in secondary market research. <a href=\"https://www.g2crowd.com/categories/\">G2 Crowd</a> aggregates user ratings and social data to create \"quadrants,\" where you can see companies plotted as contenders, leaders, niche, and high performers in their respective industries. G2 Crowd specializes in digital content, IT services, HR, ecommerce, and related business services.</li> \n    <li><strong>Download a market report:</strong>&nbsp;Companies like Forrester and Gartner offer both free and gated market forecasts every year on the vendors who are leading their industry. On Forrester's website, for example, you can select \"Latest Research\" from the navigation bar and browse <a href=\"https://go.forrester.com/\">Forrester's</a> latest material using a variety of criteria to narrow your search. These reports are good assets to save on your computer.</li> \n    <li><strong>Search using social media:</strong>&nbsp;Believe it or not, social networks make great company directories if you use the search bar correctly. On LinkedIn, for example, select the search bar and enter the name of the industry you're pursuing. Then, under \"More,\" select \"Companies\" to narrow your results to just the businesses that include this or a similar industry term on their LinkedIn profile.</li> \n   </ul> \n   <h4>Identifying Content Competitors</h4> \n   <p>Search engines are your best friends in this area of secondary market research. To find the online publications with which you compete, take the overarching industry term you identified in the section above, and come up with a handful of more specific industry terms your company identifies with.</p> \n   <p>A catering business, for example, might generally be a \"food service\" company, but also consider itself a vendor in \"event catering,\" \"cake catering,\" \"baked goods,\" and more.</p> \n   <p>Once you have this list, do the following:</p> \n   <ul> \n    <li><strong>Google it:</strong>&nbsp;Don't underestimate the value in seeing which websites come up when you run a search on Google for the industry terms that describe your company. You might find a mix of product developers, blogs, magazines, and more.</li> \n    <li><strong>Compare your search results against your buyer persona:</strong>&nbsp;Remember the buyer persona you created during the <em>primary research</em> stage, earlier in this article? Use it to examine how likely a publication you found through Google could steal website traffic from you. If the content the website publishes seems like the stuff your buyer persona would want to see, it's a potential competitor, and should be added to your list of competitors.</li> \n   </ul> \n   <p>After a series of similar Google searches for the industry terms you identify with, look for repetition in the website domains that have come up.</p> \n   <p>Examine the first two or three results pages for each search you conducted. These websites are clearly respected for the content they create in your industry, and should be watched carefully as you build your own library of videos, reports, web pages, and blog posts.</p> \n  </div> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div> \n <div> \n  <h3>5. Summarize your findings.</h3> \n </div> \n <p>Feeling overwhelmed by the notes you took? We suggest looking for common themes that will help you tell a story and create a list of action items.</p> \n <p>To make the process easier, try using your favorite presentation software to make a report, as it will make it easy to add in quotes, diagrams, or call clips.</p> \n <p>Feel free to add your own flair, but the following outline should help you craft a clear summary:</p> \n <ul> \n  <li><strong>Background: </strong>Your goals and why you conducted this study.</li> \n  <li><strong>Participants: </strong>Who you talked to.

Disney uses kid-centric focus groups to test new characters and ideas.</h3> <p>The Walt Disney Company can spend millions crafting what its Animation Studio team believes is a worthwhile story, but it wisely focuses on its intended audience — children — when testing how well a character or topic performs.&nbsp;</p> <p>A few times each year, Disney executives meet with preschoolers and kindergartners in <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324050304578412771510068366\"><span>kid-centric focus groups</span></a> to get their opinions and insights on TV episodes, Disney characters, and more.&nbsp;</p> <p>Why is this an effective market research strategy? Because children are ultimately the audience Disney hopes to delight — so collecting their feedback is invaluable to iterating on their existing content and ensuring it continues to meet its audiences' preferences.</p> <h3>2. KFC tested its meatless product in select markets before launching nationwide.</h3> <p>In 2019, KFC began developing and testing a new meatless version of its chicken. Rather than instantly rolling the product out nationwide, however, it started small: In <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/kfcs-plant-based-fried-chicken/story?id=65196504\"><span>select stores in the Atlanta, Georgia area</span></a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>This is an easy, effective example of conducting market research to determine how well a new product sells on a smaller scale before dedicating too many resources to it. If the meatless chicken flopped in Georgia, KFC would need to change the product before re-launching it to the market.</p> <h3>3. Yamaha conducted a survey to determine whether they should use knobs or sliding faders on the Montage keyboard.</h3> <p>When Yamaha, a Japanese-based corporation that produces a variety of products ranging from motorcycles to golf cars to musical instruments, began developing its new Montage keyboard, the team was unsure whether to use knobs or sliding faders on the product.</p> <p>So <a href=\"https://www.qualtrics.com/customers/yamaha/\"><span>Yamaha used Qualtrics to send a survey</span></a> to their customers, and received 400 responses in a few hours.&nbsp;</p> <p>Using survey feedback helped Yamaha ensure it was designing a product that exactly fit its audiences' preferences.</p> <h3>4. The Body Shop used social listening to determine how they should re-position brand campaigns to respond to what their customers cared most about.</h3> <p>The Body Shop has long been known for offering ethically sourced and natural products, and proudly touts \"sustainability\" as a core value.&nbsp;</p> <p>To dive deeper into the sustainability sub-topics that meant the most to their audiences, the team at <a href=\"https://www.brandwatch.com/case-studies/the-body-shop/view/\"><span>The Body Shop tracked conversations</span></a> and ultimately found their audiences cared a lot about refills.&nbsp;</p> <p>Using this information helped the Body Shop team feel confident when relaunching their <a href=\"https://www.thebodyshop.com/en-us/about-us/brand-values/sustainability/refill-program/a/a00048\"><span>Refill Program across 400 stores globally in 2021</span></a>, and another 400 in 2022. Market research proved they were on the right track with their refill concept, and demonstrated increased efforts were needed to show Body Shop customers that the Body Shop cared about their customers' values.&nbsp;</p> </br></br>\n</div> \n<h2>Conduct Market Research to Grow Better</h2> \n<p>Conducting market research can be a very eye-opening experience.

But what exactly is an RFI and what does this acronym stand for?</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>RFIs are important because they reduce blind spots and empower your team to make better decisions. With more information at your disposal, you can understand the marketplace and get a better sense of the questions you'll need to ask as you move forward in the procurement process. &nbsp;</p> \n<h3>How does an RFI work?</h3> \n<h4>Step 1: The buyer develops the RFI.</h4> \n<p>RFIs are written documents with the goal of collecting information from sellers. This information can be used to help buyers make a purchasing decision. The questions that are included in an RFI are specific and straightforward so that the sellers understand what the buyer is asking for.</p> \n<p>Sellers can find an RFI on the company's website, in databases like <a href=\"https://www.procore.com/sem/demo-b?utm_id=528311810289&amp;utm_campaign=G_US_S_Brand_Alpha&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=paid-search&amp;utm_term=procore&amp;utm_adgroup=procore&amp;_bt=528311810289&amp;_bk=procore&amp;_bm=e&amp;_bn=g&amp;_bg=76078372997&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAgbiQBhAHEiwAuQ6BklSgLuratqXkmqODN_-EyuqzMOGhP3SQOoznoP1jnfGYM3PbLQpwUhoCchkQAvD_BwE\">Procore</a>, and government web pages like <a href=\"https://www.grants.gov/\">grants.gov</a>.</p> \n<h4>Step 2: Sellers draft responses to the RFI.</h4> \n<p>Once a seller finds an RFI, they have a window of time specified by the buyer in which to complete it.</p> \n<p>The information that is collected in the RFI is organized in such a way that it can be compared and contrasted against the information that other sellers submit.</p> \n<h4>Step 3: The buyer reviews all the sellers' responses.</h4> \n<p>After the deadline for RFIs closes, the buyer reviews all of the responses submitted by the sellers. In this step, the buyer is looking for information about the companies, the products or services they offer, its history and background, and other factors that can impact how well the seller can deliver on the project.</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Note:</span> Price, budget, timeline, and other specific information aren't covered in an RFI since it's a part of step one in the overall procurement process.</p> \n<h4>Step 4: The buyer moves onto the next stage in the procurement process — the RFP.</h4> \n<p>After the buyer has determined which of the RFI submissions meets the preliminary qualifications for the project, they'll move on to the next step in the process which is an RFP (Request for Proposal).</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>An RFI is the initial step a company takes to solicit information from potential <span style=\"background-color: #ffff64;\">sellers</span>, as described above. Its main objective is to obtain information, not to make a final decision. Once the RFIs are submitted, the company will review them and shortlist the best options, armed with more insight. Then, they'll send an RFP to that short list of <span style=\"background-color: #ffff64;\">sellers</span>&nbsp;that satisfied the requirements of the RFI.</p> \n<p>A <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/rfp-template\">Request for Proposal is a formal request </a>for the selected vendors or sellers to respond to a specific contract opportunity. The document specifies the scope and price so potential <span style=\"background-color: #ffff64;\">sellers</span>&nbsp;can put together a bid for the work.</p> \n<p>These bids are then compared to understand each <span style=\"background-color: #ffff64;\">seller</span>'s strengths and weaknesses, and the best fit is chosen. RFPs are a decision document, so the questions are more targeted and specific.</p> \n<p>After an RFP, the company may be contacted with an RFQ or Request for Quote that breaks down the project even further into specific cost structures and deliverables.</p> \n<h2>Request for Information Template</h2> \n<p>And RFI is similar to an RFP, but with less detail.

What should you ask for? What information does the <span style=\"background-color: #ffff64;\">seller</span>&nbsp;need to know? To help answer those questions, use this simple guide to get the most out of the RFI process.</p> \n<h3>1. Draft an overview or statement of need.</h3> \n<p>Outline your goals and objectives, along with some general information about your company. This section should be short and provide an overview of your project to someone with no background information.</p> \n<h3>2. Add context about your organization.</h3> \n<p>Including additional information about your organization can help the <span style=\"background-color: #ffff64;\">seller</span>&nbsp;tailor their response to your needs. You may want to mention which department is leading the project, who your customers are, and what your company values are, among other things.</p> \n<h3>3. Finalize the details.</h3> \n<p>What problem are you looking to solve? What information do you need? Here's where you can detail what you're looking for. Include any additional information a <span style=\"background-color: #ffff64;\">seller</span>&nbsp;might need to know to develop a thorough RFI response. That may include:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Any necessary skills and credentials the respondent may need to be successful</li> \n <li>Timelines or general scope</li> \n <li>What you're not looking for</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>4. Mention information about the process.</h3> \n<p>Explain how interested parties should respond to the RFI. Attach a response template if you have one, outline any deadlines, and note if and when you'll reply to respondents after the RFIs have been gathered. You may want to mention any evaluation criteria you'll use when creating the shortlist for RFPs.</p> \n<h2>Best Practices for RFI Documentation</h2> \n<p>The more thoughtful you are about your RFI document, the better quality responses you will get back. Instead of casually emailing a sales rep and asking for information, creating RFI documentation will ensure that you get exactly the information you need. In that document, be sure to:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Clearly state the information you're requesting.</li> \n <li>Be specific about how and when you want to receive seller responses.</li> \n <li>Keep an open mind so that sellers can provide additional information that they think is relevant.</li> \n <li>Be brief and respectful of the sellers' time.</li> \n</ul> \n<h2>RFI Examples</h2> \n<p>Need more inspiration? Read through the following examples of RFIs for more ideas on what to include in yours. These three RFIs all come from different industries and have different needs, so they are a good overview of the options available to you.</p> \n<h3>1. U.S. General Services Administration</h3> \n<p>In 2021, the U.S. General Services Administration collaborated with the U.S. Department of Energy to issue an RFI supporting a project to reduce commercial building greenhouse gas emissions. The overall goal that the GSA and DOE were aiming to reach was net-zero carbon emissions within these buildings and the RFI focused on three specific areas that would allow this goal to be achieved. &nbsp;Sellers who had technology to meet the requirements of this RFI were required to propose measurable success criteria across several categories.</p> \n<h3><img alt=\"RFI Example: U.S. General Services Administration\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/RFIs%20The%20Simple%20Guide%20to%20Writing%20a%20Request%20for%20Information-1.png?width=450&amp;name=RFIs%20The%20Simple%20Guide%20to%20Writing%20a%20Request%20for%20Information-1.png\" title=\"\" width=\"450\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 450px;\"></h3> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.gsa.gov/governmentwide-initiatives/climate-action-and-sustainability/center-for-emerging-building-technologies/request-for-information\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>In addition to the RFI requirements on the webpage, the GSA and DOE hosted a webinar, provided an FAQ, and made the presentation slides from the webinar available on the webpage so that all sellers had access to the information they'd need to submit the best response.</p> \n<p>What makes this RFI example stand out is that it's kept up to date frequently. New information is added frequently. When the deadline is passed, that is notated clearly at the top of the RFI so sellers can move on to other requests that are accepting submissions. This is a great example of the best practice we mentioned earlier about respecting the sellers' time when asking for RFI submissions.</p> \n<h3>2. NASA</h3> \n<p>When NASA retires parts of their space shuttles, they like to display them at museums or other educational institutions. To gauge interest and understand the potential options for an upcoming retired part, they <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/297529main_SSP_RFI.pdf\">opened up an RFI</a>. Here's a sample of the document:</p> \n<p>\"This RFI is being used to gather market research for NASA to make decisions regarding development of strategies for placement of Space Shuttle Orbiters and Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSMEs) for public display after conclusion of the SSP. NASA is seeking information from educational institutions, science museums, and other appropriate organizations about the community's ability to acquire and display a Space Shuttle Orbiter after the vehicles are retired from flight status.\"</p> \n<p>We like this RFI example because it provides a straightforward overview of the purpose of the RFI, and outlines what NASA wants to learn from the process.</p> \n<h3>3. Government of Canada</h3> \n<p>Government websites are a great place to find RFI examples because they are required to make all procurement processes publicly available. The following example is from an <a href=\"https://buyandsell.gc.ca/cds/public/2021/03/15/2bd19b672e6943f1da0afc6c614a821c/rfi-000379-eng.pdf\">RFI for financial planning software.</a></p> \n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/RFIs%20The%20Simple%20Guide%20to%20Writing%20a%20Request%20for%20Information.png?width=550&amp;name=RFIs%20The%20Simple%20Guide%20to%20Writing%20a%20Request%20for%20Information.png\" title=\"\" width=\"550\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 550px;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://buyandsell.gc.ca/cds/public/2021/03/15/2bd19b672e6943f1da0afc6c614a821c/rfi-000379-eng.pdf\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>The requirements section of this RFI is a great example of how to explain what you do and don't need in the responses. While the government of Canada is looking for financial planning software, they will be keeping their CRM and data lake provider.</p> \n<h3>4. University of Ottawa</h3> \n<p>In the following RFI except, the University of Ottawa <a href=\"https://www.merx.com/oupma/uottawa/solicitations/Strategic-Discussions-for-ERP-Integration-Software-Solutions/0000178401?innerTabId=docs-items\">is looking for an ERP integration solution.</a>&nbsp;What's unique about this RFI is how they want to receive responses. Rather than collecting written responses or documents, the U of O is scheduling strategy discussions with suppliers. This is a unique way to gather information, but helpful when you don't have enough knowledge in the area to put together a scope of work yet.</p> \n<p>\"The University of Ottawa (University) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to schedule strategy discussions (via a conference call) from interested Suppliers with experience in ERP Integrations.</p> \n<p>The intent of these discussions is to obtain feedback from Suppliers to assist the University in developing a more accurate Scope of Work and overall approach for an upcoming Request For Proposal (RFP) for ERP Integration solutions.\" &nbsp;</p> \n<h2>Request for Success</h2> \n<p>Every RFI will be unique to your organization and the information you require. Use the template above as a guide to creating an RFI that will save you time in evaluating potential solutions.</p> \n<p>With the right information being sent your way, all you need to do is read up! You'll be well on your way to procuring the best solution for your team's needs.</p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in April 2021 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=829fc772-c965-4a48-97e6-5e4b362b0f6a&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"rfp templates\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/829fc772-c965-4a48-97e6-5e4b362b0f6a.png\"></a></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Frequest-for-information-rfi&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 04 Mar 2022 12:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/71a652c6-0219-4ab9-98fc-169cb554b308.png","linkMd5":"ca1a87e1f2b886a84ae9059298113566","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn44@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-26-48-431_e4bdffd32f851ed7.webp","destWidth":412,"destHeight":60,"sourceBytes":4057,"destBytes":6350,"author":"Sarah Chambers","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/71a652c6-0219-4ab9-98fc-169cb554b308.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn44@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-26-48-431_e4bdffd32f851ed7.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Request%20for%20Project%20Proposal%20(RPT)%20Template,%20Blog%20Image.jpg?width=350&name=Request%20for%20Project%20Proposal%20(RPT)%20Template,%20Blog%20Image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn75@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-26-57-073_a336e87ab58adf02.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/RFIs%20The%20Simple%20Guide%20to%20Writing%20a%20Request%20for%20Information-1.png?width=450&name=RFIs%20The%20Simple%20Guide%20to%20Writing%20a%20Request%20for%20Information-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn3@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-26-52-014_cbe682b3d81950ce.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/RFIs%20The%20Simple%20Guide%20to%20Writing%20a%20Request%20for%20Information.png?width=550&name=RFIs%20The%20Simple%20Guide%20to%20Writing%20a%20Request%20for%20Information.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn22@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-26-51-182_57b83dd8f3e41301.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/829fc772-c965-4a48-97e6-5e4b362b0f6a.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn51@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-26-50-373_d2dc9881f95749a1.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Frequest-for-information-rfi&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn85@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-26-55-025_99b5c9e170ae2f6b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647246408214},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:26:48","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:26:48","title":"Which Instagram Story Formats Really Engage Viewers [New Research]","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-story-formats","description":"<p>In 2021, Instagram reported over <a href=\"https://www.omnicoreagency.com/instagram-statistics/#:~:text=Instagram%20Stories%20statistics,after%20seeing%20it%20in%20Stories.\">500 million users</a> viewed Stories.&nbsp;</p>  \n<p>Since <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-stories\">launching in 2016</a>, the Stories feature alone has made Instagram more popular than other Story and mobile video platform competitors including <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/snapchat-discover-examples\">Snapchat</a>, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-tiktok\">TikTok</a>, and its owner's own platform: <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/preferred-story-platforms\">Facebook Stories</a>.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=55f44553-d63a-43bd-8957-63ac11fbcdb3&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Access Now: 22 Free Business Instagram Templates\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/55f44553-d63a-43bd-8957-63ac11fbcdb3.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Even if you've already published a handful of branded Stories, you still might want to up your game by making them even more engaging. After all, Stories can provide great benefits related to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-stories\">audience engagement, brand awareness, and even purchase-related conversions</a>.</p> \n<p>Despite the growing number of benefits that Instagram Stories offers brands, crafting good content still takes time, energy, and brainstorming. Even when you put your best efforts into creating a Story, you might still find that it falls flat, sees a high drop-off, or shows other signs of low engagement.</p> \n<p>As you build your social media content strategy for 2022, you might be asking yourself, \"What type of Instagram Story format do people actually engage with?\"</p> \n<p>In this post, I'll highlight what consumers said about their favorite Instagram Story formats, the trends marketers are noticing, and show you examples along the way.</p> \n<h2>Which Formats Marketers Are Leveraging [HubSpot Blog Data]</h2> \n<p>The HubSpot Blog surveyed over 1,000 marketers to learn more about their marketing strategies in 2022. According to this survey, 78% of marketers leverage Instagram Stories in their roles. Of those who use Instagram Stories, 43% post on behalf of their brand multiple times per week. The marketers in this survey note audience viewership of Instagram Stories declines after four to six Instagram Story pages.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>According to the marketers we surveyed, here are the most common Instagram Story types subjects that result in the greatest ROI.</p> \n<h3>Content That Reflects Brand Values</h3> \n<p>Per the HubSpot Blog survey, 18% of marketers indicated Instagram Story content that reflected their brand’s values produced the greatest ROI. Considering <a href=\"https://smallbiztrends.com/2020/02/brand-values-alignment.html\"><span>71% of consumers</span></a> want to buy from brands that align with their personal values, this piece of data isn’t surprising.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>When companies are upfront about their core values related to topics such as diversity, inclusion, sustainability, and human rights, buyers are able to quickly determine a brand’s stance on a particular topic.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Similarly, it’s important that consumers know why your brand exists, and how you can serve them. Regularly incorporating your company’s mission and vision into your content can also help your audience feel more connected to your brand.</p> \n<h3>Product-Focused Content</h3> \n<p>Consumers want to see your product in action! Whether it is through regular demonstrations by your team, user-generated content from other happy customers, or positive reviews, product-related content can deliver positive results. When crafting Instagram Stories, find creative ways to present your products that appeal to your audience.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>Interactive Content</h3> \n<p>On Instagram Stories, interactive frames have a specific call-to-action or way viewers can get involved from within the app. This often includes using Instagram’s Poll or Quiz sticker, inviting users to share a specific piece of content themselves, or a game. Here’s an example from <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/fentybeauty/\">@fentybeauty</a>, who used Instagram’s slide feature to poll their audience.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Interactive-Content-Example.jpg?width=200&amp;name=Interactive-Content-Example.jpg\" alt=\"Instagram Story Format: an example of an interactive Instagram Story\" width=\"200\" style=\"width: 200px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<h3>Trendy Content</h3> \n<p>Trend-related content entails coverage of a recent cultural moment or news story. This type of content can range from informative (breaking news) to humorous (posting a meme related to a recent event). Trendy content is well-suited for Instagram Stories because of it is best consumed quickly and while relevant. Unlike a feed post that can take days to reach an audience, the 24-hour period an Instagram Story is live can be a great place to share content that is only relevant for a short period of time.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Now that we know what content marketers are prioritizing in Instagram Stories, let’s look at what formats consumers prefer and engage with most often.</p> \n<h2>Which Format Consumers Are Actually Watching</h2> \n<p>While some brands and users post Stories focused purely on interactive features, others might post visual storytelling content such as short narratives or longer video stories that feel more like documentaries.</p> \n<p>But, which one of the many Instagram Story formats is most intriguing to people? To get to the bottom of which Story style is most engaging, I surveyed 350 people using <a href=\"https://luc.id/\">Lucid</a> software to learn more about their favorite Story formats, sound preferences, and ideal Story length.</p> \n<p>I asked consumers, \"Which Instagram Story are you most likely to tap all the way through until the end?\"</p> \n<p>At this point, you may have your own predictions of how people might have voted. While research says that interactive stickers, such as Quizzes, Polls, or Questions are highly engaging, you might also be thinking about the times you've tapped through an influencer or brand's behind-the-scenes videos via their Story. So which, ultimately did people choose?</p> \n<p>Stories centered around Quiz or Poll stickers were one of the most popular formats with 15% of the votes. However, 35% of consumers <em>actually</em> prefer short narratives with a mix of photos, text, and videos.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Instagram%20Story%20Formats.png\" alt=\"Which types of Instagram Stories do you tap all the way through?\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Data Source: </em><a href=\"http://luc.id/\">Lucid Software</a></p> \n<h3>Short Narrative Stories</h3> \n<p>Short narratives are basically articles translated for a more visual audience. They rely on brief paragraphs and bullet points of text, accompanied by related visuals, to tell a story in a few cohesive short slides. Here's a great example of a short story that swipes up to a longer piece of web content from <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-story-examples\">Harvard Business Review</a>:</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Instagram%20Story%20Formats-3.png?width=600&amp;name=Instagram%20Story%20Formats-3.png\" alt=\"Harvard Business Review Instagram Story\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>This strategy is a great way to get more eyes on your blog content without asking people to leave the Instagram app.</p> \n<p>Aside from informing your audience of a topic related to your industry, you can also take a note from HBR and other publishers by using Stories as a traffic generator. In the example above, HBR — which has a verified account — has adapted a long-form article into a short Story and included the full post at the end as a swipe-up link.</p> \n<p>With this tactic, the Instagram Story serves as a teaser as viewers who are very interested in the topic can swipe up to read more about it on HBR.org.</p> \n<h3>Quiz or Poll-Centered Stories</h3> \n<p>Another strong Story format uses Quiz or Poll stickers. Essentially, these Stories feel like they are just created to quiz the viewer by including the Quiz sticker on most pages, or brands can leverage Stories with polls primarily on each page to get their audience's insights on a topic.</p> \n<p>These Stories are intriguing and entertaining to viewers because it allows them to test themselves and learn about a new topic interactively, or vote in a poll and see what other audiences think about a certain topic or theme. Here's an example of an interactive Story from HubSpot which centered around a Poll-styled quiz and revealed the answers at the end.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Instagram%20Story%20Formats-4.png?width=600&amp;name=Instagram%20Story%20Formats-4.png\" alt=\"HubSpot Poll Instagram Story\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>While you can also use an actual Quiz sticker, which will immediately tell viewers quiz questions, HubSpot's strategy also works as it allows viewers to get a glimpse at what others guessed and see a rundown of the actual answers at the end. This might keep viewers engaged, entertained, and in the Story for longer if they know that there will be a payoff on the last page.</p> \n<p>While fewer people voted for Stories centered around <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-questions\">Question stickers</a>, this feature could still be a great feature to experiment with as it can help you interact with and learn more about your audience in a more open-ended way that Polls.</p> \n<p>Here's an example of a Question sticker in a HubSpot Story. After this page, the Story went on to share the answers that viewers submitted.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Instagram%20Story%20Formats-11.png?width=200&amp;name=Instagram%20Story%20Formats-11.png\" alt=\"HubSpot Questions INstagram Story\" width=\"200\" style=\"width: 200px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>Although open-ended questions seem like a great way to learn about and interact with your audience, keep in mind that viewers will need to take time to fill out answers rather than simply tapping on a Poll or Quiz sticker. This means that if your audience isn't as interested in the topic or question, you might run into issues getting responses.</p> \n<p>If you'd like to learn more about how to use and leverage the Instagram Questions sticker in your Stories, check out <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-questions\">this helpful guide</a> which includes examples of brands that used the feature successfully.</p> \n<h3>Demos and Tutorials</h3> \n<p>Brands can also leverage tutorials and demos, which was the fifth most popular Story style. This tactic might be especially helpful if you're interested in ecommerce or purchase-related conversions as a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/video-marketing\">growing number of people prefer to learn more about products via video.</a> Here's an example of a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/social-media-product-research\">tutorial from Kylie Cosmetics</a>, where CEO Kylie Jenner puts on a new lip liner from the brand.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Instagram%20Story%20Formats-8.png?width=200&amp;name=Instagram%20Story%20Formats-8.png\" alt=\"Kylie Cosmetics Instagram Story Tutorial\" width=\"200\" style=\"width: 200px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>Story formats that include demos or tutorials can be advantageous to brands because it allows them to show off how their products work. Additionally, if you have <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/add-link-instagram-story\">over 10,000 followers or are a verified user</a>, you can link these Stories to your ecommerce site or a purchasing page for the products shown. This way, if a viewer is impressed by a tutorial or demo, they can simply swipe up to learn more about or purchase the product.</p> \n<h3>A Mix of Content</h3> \n<p>Because many people don't have a preference or prefer a mix of multiple elements in Instagram Stories, be sure to add a bit of variation to your content strategy. For example, brainstorm ways to add interactive features, such as Quiz or Poll stickers to narratives, tutorials, or other types of Story content. This will add an extra layer of engaging content to a Story that might already be interesting to viewers.</p> \n<p>Here's an example of a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-story-examples\">Story from Starbucks</a> that mixes in storytelling and interactive stickers to announce the return of a popular seasonal beverage:</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Instagram%20Story%20Formats-5.png?width=600&amp;name=Instagram%20Story%20Formats-5.png\" alt=\"Starbucks Instagram Story\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<h2>Other Instagram Story Formats</h2> \n<p>When it came to the Story styles with lower rankings, consumers were actually less interested in behind-the-scenes content, mini-documentaries, and Stories that center around customer testimonials.</p> \n<p>This might hint that marketers on these platforms might want to be thinking more creatively when launching content on Instagram Stories. Rather than just focusing on your product or customer testimonials, you might want to test out creating informative short narratives or interactive Stories that relate strongly to your brand. While this will engage Instagram audiences, it might also show off your company's expertise in its industry.</p> \n<p>While this poll deemed a few Story formats less engaging, I still encourage you to mix things up and experiment with some of these styles just in case they work for you. Here are a few to try.</p> \n<h3>Customer Testimonials</h3> \n<p>Although customer testimonials aren't as interesting to consumers, this doesn't mean that you should scratch them entirely. In fact, they're still a commonly used tactic in many brands and industries, despite consumer preferences. For example, a number of companies, like <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-story-examples\">Planet Fitness</a>, have built their strategy around testimonials. Here's an example:</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Instagram%20Story%20Formats-7.png?width=600&amp;name=Instagram%20Story%20Formats-7.png\" alt=\"Planet Fitness Instagram Story\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>In the above scenario, the customer testimonial strategy works for Planet Fitness because it helps gym prospects feel less intimidated and more motivated to take on physical fitness after seeing a customer's success story.</p> \n<h3>Behind-the-Scenes Stories</h3> \n<p>No, behind-the-scenes Stories don't necessarily talk about your product front and center, but they can give prospects an idea of what your company is like, the inner workings of your industry, and a look at the staff that customers could work with.</p> \n<p>Behind-the-scenes videos allow you to show off how hardworking or relatable your business might be, which might make viewers feel more comfortable working with you.</p> \n<p>One example of a brand that uses this technique is the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-story-examples\">NBA</a>. The basketball league regularly <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-story-examples\">shares videos of professional basketball players behind the scenes</a> at games or celebrations. In the image below, they shared an Instagram Story video of basketball players taking a photo with the rapper Drake:</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Instagram%20Story%20Formats-1.png?width=200&amp;name=Instagram%20Story%20Formats-1.png\" alt=\"NBA Instagram Story\" width=\"200\" style=\"width: 200px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<h3>Mini-Documentaries</h3> \n<p>Like narrative-style Instagram content, mini-documentaries tell journalistic stories that are slightly more complex and primarily centered on video -- like a documentary that you tap through.</p> \n<p>These are often higher-quality and incredibly informative, so they are more prominently used by publishers such as National Geographic. Here's just the beginning of a long documentary-styled Story where NatGeo visits NASA's offices to uncover facts about the first moon landing:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/image-3750.png?width=600&amp;name=image-3750.png\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" alt=\"NASA Instagram Story\"></p> \n<p>If you're a small to medium-sized business that's just ramping up your Instagram strategy, you might want to stick to a short narrative Story, like the ones noted at the beginning of this post. These will allow you to similarly show a combination of videos, photos, and text without as much production time and effort. However, if you're a content creator or feel like covering an event or newsworthy topic in your industry might boost brand awareness, you might want to experiment with this longer-form, in-depth visual storytelling style.</p> \n<h2>Ideal Story Length</h2> \n<p>For years, social media managers have been trying to determine how long the perfect Instagram Story should be. This has been such a major question that marketing blogs and publications have <a href=\"https://medium.com/swlh/the-biggest-instagram-stories-research-study-done-to-date-552662f6952b\">done further research on the matter</a>.</p> \n<p>If you're a small to medium-sized business marketer, Story length is a valid thing to consider, especially if you have low time or resources. While you ideally want to engage people with low dropoff throughout your entire Story, you might not want to spend time making incredibly long pieces of content with multiple pages if you know people in your industry usually only tap through a small number of pages.</p> \n<p>So, what exactly is a good Story length? To get some added insight on this, I surveyed the 350 consumers and asked them, \"On average, how many pages of an Instagram Story will you tap through before swiping out?\"</p> \n<p>Before looking at the results, you might think \"The ideal Story should be as short as possible,\" simply because it's content on a fast-paced social media platform. But, then, you might also remember that a number of publications, like Harvard Business Publishing and The Washington Post have leveraged Stories as a way to share long-form content.</p> \n<p>So, which approach is right and which is wrong?'</p> \n<p>It seems that there are solid themes in ideal Story length, however, there still might not be an ideal number of pages in this type of content.</p> \n<p>According to the poll, 63% of consumers will tap through six pages or less, with 34% saying they tap through four to six pages on average. This data aligns with the feedback we got from marketers through our HubSpot Blog survey. However, more than one-third of consumers will tap through stories with more than seven pages, with 20% saying they'll tap through 10 or more.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Instagram%20Story%20Formats-6.png?width=600&amp;name=Instagram%20Story%20Formats-6.png\" alt=\"How long should an Instagram Story be?\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Data Source: </em><a href=\"http://luc.id/\">Lucid Software</a></p> \n<p>The results above are similar to research published by Buffer which noted that Stories made up of <a href=\"https://medium.com/swlh/the-biggest-instagram-stories-research-study-done-to-date-552662f6952b\">seven or fewer pages are the most engaging</a>. However, the fact that a large chunk of Lucid respondents will watch beyond seven pages hints that you might not need to shrink down your content to ensure that it's seen.</p> \n<p>When determining the best Story length for your audience, we encourage you to consider the age group of your audience, the type of topics they engage with, and how fast-paced their lifestyles might be. If you have an idea for a great topic that your audience will love and is compatible with interactive Story features, you might be able to get away with a longer Story.</p> \n<p>If you have a topic that you worry might feel dry or too complex to explain on Stories, you might want to format this as a smaller Story with a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-swipe-up-removal\">sticker linked to longer-form content</a>.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>As you start posting regular Instagram Stories, you should also experiment with both long and short Stories. Then, look at the drop-off rate of each Story. If many people seem to drop out of one long story but not another, this might be due to the topic or the writing rather than the length. However, if people regularly drop out of your longer-form Stories around a certain page number, you might want to limit your Story content to that number of pages.</p> \n<h2>Telling an Engaging Visual Story</h2> \n<p>Regardless of what topic you're publishing a Story about, or which format you decide on using, make sure it informs the audience about something they care about, provides entertainment value, and highlights your brand's credibility in your industry.</p> \n<p>If you're unsure about how you can leverage Instagram Stories to better market your brand, it can be helpful to look at examples from similar companies in your industry.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=5848cf64-d1ce-4245-8440-eaffd08f875a&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px;

not yet started, in progress, or completed. I want to create a drop-down menu so I can easily go in and change the status of the campaign as time goes on.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"table in google sheets with a drop-down menu\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/google%20sheets%20drop%20down-Feb-17-2022-08-18-52-02-PM.png?width=553&amp;name=google%20sheets%20drop%20down-Feb-17-2022-08-18-52-02-PM.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 553px;\" title=\"\" width=\"553\"></p> \n<p>Before going through the steps, it might be helpful to see what a drop-down menu looks like so you can contextually understand each instruction. The gif below shows a final drop-down menu and how it applies to the sample data set.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/completed%20drop%20down%20menu.png?width=571&amp;name=completed%20drop%20down%20menu.png\" alt=\"completed drop down menu\" width=\"571\" style=\"width: 571px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>Let’s go over how to add a drop-down list to your Sheet.</p> \n<p>1. In the toolbar header, click <em>Data</em>.</p> \n<p>2. In the drop-down menu, as shown in the image below, select <em>Data validation</em>.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"google sheets drop-down menu step 1: select data in the header toolbar\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/google%20sheets%20drop%20down-1.png?width=249&amp;name=google%20sheets%20drop%20down-1.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 249px;\" title=\"\" width=\"249\"></p> \n<p>3. In the <em>Data validation</em>&nbsp;dialog box, enter the range of cells you want to have a drop-down menu in <em>Cell range</em>. For this example, I’m entering B2:B10 for cells 2-10 in column B.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"google sheets drop-down menu step 3: add your cell range\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/google%20sheets%20drop%20down-2.png?width=439&amp;name=google%20sheets%20drop%20down-2.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 439px;\" title=\"\" width=\"439\"></p> \n<p>4. The next step is to enter the data range that you want to be included in the drop-down menu. Select <em>List of items</em>, and add in your menu values. For this example, this is where I would input Not yet started, In progress, and Complete.</p> \n<p>Once you’ve entered your values, click save.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"google sheets drop-down menu step 4: enter your list item criteria\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/google%20sheets%20drop%20down-4.png?width=509&amp;name=google%20sheets%20drop%20down-4.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" title=\"\" width=\"509\"></p> \n<p>5. Each of your cells should now have a clickable down arrow, as shown in the image below.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"google sheets drop-down menu arrows\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/google%20sheets%20drop%20down-Feb-17-2022-08-18-52-84-PM.png?width=579&amp;name=google%20sheets%20drop%20down-Feb-17-2022-08-18-52-84-PM.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 579px;\" title=\"\" width=\"579\"></p> \n<p>For the example table, I can click on each down arrow and change the status of my campaigns as time goes on.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/step%206-1.gif?width=569&amp;name=step%206-1.gif\" alt=\"step 6-1\" width=\"569\" style=\"width: 569px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<h2>How to Edit a Drop-down List in Google Sheets</h2> \n<p>If you need to make changes to your drop-down menu, the process is rather simple.</p> \n<p>1. In the toolbar header, click <em>Data</em>&nbsp;and then <em>Data validation</em>.</p> \n<p>2. In the <em>Data validation</em>&nbsp;dialogue box, simply input the changes you want to make. For example,</p> \n<ul> \n <li>If you want to change the items in your drop-down menu, navigate to <em>Criteria</em>, and make your desired changes.</li> \n <li>If you want to change the column the drop-down menu is in, change the cell numbers in <em>Cell range</em>.</li> \n <li>If you want to delete your drop-down menu altogether, select the column the menu is currently in and click <em>Remove validation</em>.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Always click save after making all changes.</p> \n<h2>Color Code a Drop-down List in Google Sheets</h2> \n<p>Color coding is helpful when it comes to interpreting results at a glance. You can do this with your drop-down list by creating conditional formatting rules, and below we’ll explain how.</p> \n<p>1. Select the cells your drop-down menu is in and click <em>Format</em>.</p> \n<p>2. Select <em>Conditional formatting</em>&nbsp;from the dialogue box, as shown in the image below.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"color code google sheets drop down menu step 2: click format in header toolbar\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/google%20sheets%20drop%20down-3.png?width=265&amp;name=google%20sheets%20drop%20down-3.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 265px;\" title=\"\" width=\"265\"></p> \n<p>3. In the <em>Conditional formatting rules</em>&nbsp;sidebar on the right-hand side of your screen, navigate to the <em>Format rules</em>&nbsp;section.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"color code google sheets drop down menu step 3: select format rules\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/google%20sheets%20drop%20down.png?width=247&amp;name=google%20sheets%20drop%20down.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 247px;\" title=\"\" width=\"247\"></p> \n<p>4. In the <em>Format cells</em>&nbsp;if menu, select <em>Text contains…</em></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"color code google sheets drop down menu step 4: select text contains\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/google%20sheets%20drop%20down-Feb-17-2022-08-18-53-08-PM.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" title=\"\"></p> \n<p>5. Enter the first element in your drop-down list that you want color-coded. In the image below, I’ve entered Completed<em>&nbsp;</em>as my value and set the color to Green.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/google%20sheets%20drop%20down-Feb-17-2022-08-18-52-29-PM.png?height=343&amp;name=google%20sheets%20drop%20down-Feb-17-2022-08-18-52-29-PM.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" title=\"\" height=\"343\"></p> \n<p>6. To set a color for each of your list items, select <em>+ Add another rule </em>and repeat step 5 for each value. For my chart, I’ve set In progress to Blue, and Not started to gray.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"color coded google sheets drop-down menu\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/google%20sheets%20drop%20down-Feb-17-2022-08-18-52-59-PM.png?width=624&amp;height=292&amp;name=google%20sheets%20drop%20down-Feb-17-2022-08-18-52-59-PM.png\" style=\"margin-left: 0.00px;\" title=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"292\"></p> \n<p>7. After you set each of your rules, changing the drop-down menu item to a different value will automatically change it to the correct color. For example, if I change Not yet started to In progress, it turns from gray to blue.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/step%2019.gif?width=600&amp;name=step%2019.gif\" alt=\"step 19\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px;

More businesses are exploring the platform.</h3> \n<p>According to HubSpot Blog Research, TikTok is the number one platform marketers are increasing their investments in for 2022.</p> \n<p>For a long time, businesses didn’t take TikTok seriously. They saw it as a platform for Gen-Z to make short, funny videos.</p> \n<p>However, when its popularity (and user growth) peaked in 2020, businesses gave it a second look.</p> \n<p>Today, marketers say it’s the fourth most effective social media platform behind Instagram, FB, and YouTube. That puts it ahead of established platforms like Twitter and Pinterest.</p> \n<p>What makes TikTok special is its ability to build community. In fact, 78% of users agree that the best brands on TikTok are ones that work together with users, according to <a href=\"https://ads.tiktok.com/business/creativecenter/whats_next.html\">TikTok’s 2021 \"What’s Next\" report</a>.</p> \n<p>The report also found 67% of users feel inspired to shop even when they weren’t originally planning to.</p> \n<p>Brands are starting to realize that while users may first go on the platform for funny videos, they stay for the authenticity and community building – which are great pillars for brand loyalty.</p> \n<h3>2. TikTok users are consuming less of other content.</h3> \n<p>What would you do with your audience’s undivided attention?</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/business/en/blog/time-well-spent\">According to Kantar research</a>, 46% of users engage with content on the platform without any other distractions.</p> \n<p>More specifically, 41% of<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/tiktok-influencer-agency-tips-for-creating-gen-z-content\"> Gen Z TikTok users</a> say they listen to fewer podcasts after joining TikTok and 33% say they watch less TV.</p> \n<p>This is an incredible opportunity for social media marketers to capitalize on this attention to reel in their audience and drive more engagement.</p> \n<h3>3. Sounds are more important than hashtags.</h3> \n<p>On no other social media platform does sound play such a pivotal role.</p> \n<p>88% of people on TikTok report that the sound on the platform is central to the overall app experience, according to TikTok’s \"What’s Next\" report.</p> \n<p>The report also revealed that sounds saw 47% higher video view rates on 2021 from the \"For You\" page when compared to hashtags.</p> \n<p>Furthermore, <a href=\"https://invideo.io/blog/tiktok-brand-marketing-report/\">Invideo’s TikTok Brand Marketing Report</a> found that 80% of the top videos had music, with upbeat songs being the most popular TikTok music choice by far.</p> \n<p>With this in mind, brands should prioritize the use of sounds when <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/when-to-post-tiktok\">posting on the platform</a>. While hashtags are effective in helping you reach your target audience, choosing the right sound will likely be more effective.</p> \n<h2>How to Find TikTok Trends</h2> \n<h3>1. The \"Discover\" Tab</h3> \n<p>One of the best ways to find trends on Tiktok is through the \"Discover\" tab.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"tiktok discover tab to find trends\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/TikTok%20Trends%20B2B%20and%20B2C%20Marketers%20Should%20Watch%20in%202022-1.jpeg?width=250&amp;name=TikTok%20Trends%20B2B%20and%20B2C%20Marketers%20Should%20Watch%20in%202022-1.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 250px;\" title=\"how to find tiktok trends: the discover tab\" width=\"250\"></p> \n<p>On this tab, you can scroll through popular sounds, hashtags, and topics along with a preview of the top videos within the category.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"tiktok discover tab to find trends\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/TikTok%20Trends%20B2B%20and%20B2C%20Marketers%20Should%20Watch%20in%202022-4.jpeg?width=250&amp;name=TikTok%20Trends%20B2B%20and%20B2C%20Marketers%20Should%20Watch%20in%202022-4.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; width: 250px; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" title=\"\" width=\"250\"></p> \n<p>You can also see how many videos fall within that category, which gives you an insight into which trends are rising and which ones have already blown up.</p> \n<h3>2. The \"For You\" Page</h3> \n<p>TikTok’s \"For You\" page is like Instagram’s Explore page. It looks different for every user based on the content they engage with the most.</p> \n<p>With that said, it’s also where trending topics make their rounds.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"tiktok for you page to find trends\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/TikTok%20Trends%20B2B%20and%20B2C%20Marketers%20Should%20Watch%20in%202022-2.jpeg?width=250&amp;name=TikTok%20Trends%20B2B%20and%20B2C%20Marketers%20Should%20Watch%20in%202022-2.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; width: 250px; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" title=\"\" width=\"250\"></p> \n<p>If a video has hundreds of thousands of likes or views, it’s worth digging a bit to see if it’s related to a particular trend. Your first step should be checking the sound, located on the bottom left corner of the video.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"tiktok for you page\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/TikTok%20Trends%20B2B%20and%20B2C%20Marketers%20Should%20Watch%20in%202022-3.jpeg?width=300&amp;name=TikTok%20Trends%20B2B%20and%20B2C%20Marketers%20Should%20Watch%20in%202022-3.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 300px;\" title=\"how to find tiktok trend for you page\" width=\"300\"></p> \n<p>Once you click on it, you’ll see the name of the song, the number of videos that use it, and scroll to see the videos that feature it. With all this information, you’ll know how popular a sound is and how other users are leveraging it.</p> \n<h3>3. The \"Search\" Tab</h3> \n<p>TikTok’s search tab is another great way to discover new trends.</p> \n<p>Before you start typing in the search bar, TikTok auto-populates suggested searches based on trending topics.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"tiktok search bar to find trends\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/TikTok%20Trends%20B2B%20and%20B2C%20Marketers%20Should%20Watch%20in%202022.jpeg?width=300&amp;name=TikTok%20Trends%20B2B%20and%20B2C%20Marketers%20Should%20Watch%20in%202022.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 300px;\" title=\"\" width=\"300\"></p> \n<p>All you have to do is then click on relevant searches and see what videos have been created surrounding these topics.</p> \n<h3>4. The #TrendAlert Hashtag</h3> \n<p>Now, let’s say you leverage all the strategies mentioned above and you’re still struggling to identify trends.</p> \n<p>Well, there are a ton of users on TikTok who are already on top of it. All you have to do is follow them or the hashtag #TrendAlert.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"tiktok-embed\" cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@strategisewithcare/video/7066856216848387334\" style=\"max-width: 605px; min-width: 325px;\"> \n <a title=\"@strategisewithcare\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@strategisewithcare\">@strategisewithcare</a> \n <a title=\"socialmediamanageruk\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/socialmediamanageruk\">#socialmediamanageruk</a> \n <a title=\"trendalert\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/trendalert\">#trendalert</a> \n <a title=\"contentcreatortips\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/contentcreatortips\">#contentcreatortips</a> \n <a title=\"smallbusinesstips_\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/smallbusinesstips_\">#smallbusinesstips_</a> \n <a title=\"trendpredictions\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/trendpredictions\">#trendpredictions</a> \n <a title=\"trendingnow\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/trendingnow\">#trendingnow</a> \n <a title=\"tiktoktips\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/tiktoktips\">#tiktoktips</a> \n <a title=\"trendalert2022\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/trendalert2022\">#trendalert2022</a> \n <a title=\"contentideas\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/contentideas\">#contentideas</a> \n <a title=\"♬ original sound - Betelgeusethestar\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7064658646256651009\">♬ original sound - Betelgeusethestar</a> \n</blockquote>  \n<p>As shown in the video, you can leverage this hashtag to discover new trends and how to use them.</p> \n<h2>How to Do TikTok Trends</h2> \n<h3>1. Jump in early.</h3> \n<p>The thing about trends is that they come and go very quickly. If you don’t jump in early, you might miss the boat altogether.</p> \n<p>So, as soon as you identify a TikTok trend you want to participate in, start brainstorming some ideas.</p> \n<p>Keep in mind that you don’t need fancy videography to succeed on the platform. Often, all it takes is some creative thinking, good lighting, some lip-syncing skills, and a phone.</p> \n<p>Authenticity is essential on a platform like TikTok. If you keep that at the forefront, your odds of success are that much higher.</p> \n<h3>2. Find a relatable angle.</h3> \n<p>On TikTok, you only have up to three minutes to make an impression but a good chunk of videos that go viral are 30 seconds or less.</p> \n<p>This means you have a short ramp-up period to get viewers to stop and watch your video. One way to do this? Create relatable content.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"tiktok-embed\" cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@thelipbar/video/6826854225931193606\" style=\"max-width: 605px; min-width: 325px;\"> \n <a title=\"@thelipbar\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@thelipbar\">@thelipbar</a> I mean... it’s hard to resist our \n <a title=\"fastface\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fastface\">#fastface</a> makeup system 😍 \n <a title=\"thelipbar\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/thelipbar\">#thelipbar</a> \n <a title=\"easymakeup\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/easymakeup\">#easymakeup</a> \n <a title=\"vegan\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/vegan\">#vegan</a> \n <a title=\"vegancosmetics\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/vegancosmetics\">#vegancosmetics</a> \n <a title=\"fyp\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fyp\">#fyp</a> \n <a title=\"foryou\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/foryou\">#foryou</a> \n <a title=\"♬ original sound - Makayla\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-6776283960856169222\">♬ original sound - Makayla</a> \n</blockquote>  \n<p>Think about the challenges your audience faces on a day-to-day. That’s a great place to get inspiration from.</p> \n<p>You can also get inspired by your competitors and the content they’re creating.</p> \n<h3>3. Know when to bow out.</h3> \n<p>Every day, there’s a new TikTok trend.</p> \n<p>With this in mind, not every trend is worth joining in.

It all boils down to making yourself available to support and advise someone when they need it, delivering that support in a way that makes sense to them, and always keeping that person's best interests in mind.</p> \n<p>So, what value does a mentor bring? It depends on who you ask.</p> \n<p>For <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/vrnda-levalley\">Vrnda LeValley,</a> customer training manager at HubSpot, it’s a shift in perspective.</p> \n<p>\"My mentor provides a perspective that isn’t riddled with the same self-doubt and stereotype sensitivities that I desperately want to avoid and handicap me,\" she says, \"and a broader view of the implications of action versus inaction because they have a better vantage point from their upstream position within the company.\"</p> \n<p>She adds that her mentor has been able to step in and correct narratives that muddy her ability to make the most strategic decisions.</p> \n<p>For Legal Specialist at HubSpot <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ronjay77\">Jason Perry,</a> one of the benefits of mentorship is the opportunity to extend your network.</p> \n<p>\"I most value the trust and confidence they extend to me by granting me access and recommending me to their broader networks,\" he said.</p> \n<p>Beyond that, there’s a certain freedom that comes with having a mentor.</p> \n<p>\"I think it allows for an open space to be vulnerable with someone who is more senior in their career but does not have direct control over your career growth,\" said <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/chloewashington\">Chloe Washington</a>, chief of staff to the CMO at HubSpot. \"You can be more transparent and ask questions you may not feel comfortable asking your manager or another co-worker.\"</p> \n<p>With that said, the mentorship doesn’t just benefit the mentee, it’s a two-sided relationship.</p> \n<p>\"I am constantly inspired by what my mentees are doing, their ambition, and their goals,\" Washington said. \"It motivates me as I continue along my career journey. It also allows me to form relationships with people that I may have not otherwise been able to speak with as much or as often.\"</p> \n<div>\n <iframe style=\"border: none; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\" src=\"https://listen.hubspot.com/embed/v2/smallPlayer/f0d5558d\" width=\"600\" height=\"337.5\"></iframe>  \n</div> \n<p></p> \n<h3>1. Understand what you want out of the relationship.</h3> \n<p>As we’ve mentioned, mentorship isn’t a one-way relationship. This means that just like the mentee, you should know the type of relationship you’re seeking and what you want to gain.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlene-strain-813a5a104\">Charlene Strain</a>, marketing manager at HubSpot, serves as a mentor and suggests asking yourself these questions to get started:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Do you view it as a two-way street, player-coach relationship where you learn from them as much as they learn from you or something else?</li> \n <li>How can you sharpen your area of expertise?</li> \n <li>Do they have connections or gaps of knowledge for you as well?</li> \n <li>How does taking on a mentorship role strengthen you as a leader in your personal and professional life?</li> \n</ul> Knowing these answers will help you frame your mentorship strategy and start with clear intentions.\n<br> \n<h3>2. Set expectations together in the very beginning.</h3> \n<p>Once you know what you want out of the relationship as a mentor, setting expectations is the next natural step.</p> \n<p>Every mentor-mentee relationship is unique. So, when you first start out, discuss expectations with your mentee and determine if you’re ready for that commitment.</p> \n<p>\"Everyone works and receives feedback differently, so it's important to understand if the relationship is a fit for both parties [based] on what they're looking for,\" said Strain.</p> \n<p>Here’s what Strain recommends discussing:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Is there a time limit on when the mentorship ends?</li> \n <li>How often should you meet, and why?</li> \n <li>What resources can the mentor provide for the mentee to do some work on their own?</li> \n <li>What metrics are being used to measure success?</li> \n <li>How hands-on should the mentor be?</li> \n</ul> \n<p>You should come to these answers as a duo and it’s OK if it takes a little bit to figure it out. The time you put in at the beginning will pay off in the long term.</p> \n<p>Some expectations are pretty straightforward, Perry says: professionalism, punctuality, clear communication, and organization. However, some expectations will be shaped by the mentee.</p> \n<p>\"A mentee should be able to tell me as the mentor exactly what they'd like me to do for them, whether it 's to provide information, make an introduction, write a recommendation or provide advice,\" says Perry. \"The relationship is theirs to shape and build and that starts with a clear, direct ask of some sort.\"</p> \n<p>When Washington works with mentees, her first session focuses on goal setting, setting up a meeting cadence, and discussing ground rules.</p> \n<p>\"For example, if there is a big topic to discuss, I request that they give me a heads up a few days before so that I can come fully prepared to discuss my point of view and not waste their time formulating my thoughts on the fly,\" she said.</p> \n<p>From there, she creates a running agenda doc to keep track of notes and have a place they can refer back to once the mentorship ends.</p> \n<h3>3. Take a genuine interest in your mentee as a person.</h3> \n<p>A mentor/mentee relationship is a very personal one.</p> \n<p>You can give mediocre advice without really knowing a person, but to stand out as an amazing mentor, you're really going to have to get to know your mentee on a personal level.</p> \n<p>You probably have some of the more career-oriented questions down: what their working style is, their dream job, goals for their current job, and so on and so forth. But what about the stuff that makes them ... <em>them? </em></p> \n<p>Getting to know your mentee on a deeper level will help you build a strong relationship, and it'll also help you understand who they are as a person and how they interact with others, and so on.</p> \n<p>One great way to get to know someone?<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/active-listening-guide\"> </a><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/active-listening-guide\">Become an active listener</a>. This is easier said than done: It means making a conscious effort to really, truly pay attention to what your mentee is saying, instead of thinking about what you're going to say next.</p> \n<p>\"Two<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/mentor-traits\"> traits that are helpful for someone to be a successful mentor</a> are good listening skills and the ability to connect like-minded people,\" said Strain. \"Our professional lives are not in a silo, they're a web. So, anyway I can truly listen to a mentee's goals, their journey, and where they see themselves will help me connect them with other people or businesses with the same mission.\"</p> \n<p>You might worry that you need to come up with something helpful right away, when in fact, the best thing you can do for your mentee is to listen closely to what they're saying, ask open questions to dig deeper and act as a sounding board.</p> \n<h3>4. Build trust.</h3> \n<p>In the last section, we stressed the vulnerability that comes with mentorship. To continue fostering a safe environment in which your mentee can share their concerns and challenges, you need to build trust.</p> \n<p>That can happen in a few different ways. For Solutions Engineer at HubSpot<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sagaille\"> Jeremy Sagaille</a>, it’s transparency.</p> \n<p>\"I feel like I can really be myself in front of my mentor and I don't feel like I have to do the typical corporate political BS,\" he said, \"which is something that I've definitely had to tiptoe through in the past and haven't done well with.\"</p> \n<p>For LeValley, it’s the ability to see beyond the circumstance to assess the core issues, challenges, and opportunities.</p> \n<p>\"Those can get cloudy when you are on the road to a destination you have never visited before,\" she says. \"It makes all the difference when avoiding pitfalls and finding solid shortcuts.\"</p> \n<p>She adds that truth-telling is another valuable trait in a mentor.</p> \n<p>\"Many people haven’t been given the hard messages required for growth, due to lack of investment or lack of courage from those around them,\" she says. \"Personally, the best thing my mentor told me was to check in with my growth mindset and read a book. Not what I wanted to hear but it was 100% what I needed to hear.\"</p> \n<p>Once you build trust with your mentee, your relationship will be able to go that much deeper.</p> \n<h3>5. Know when to give advice.</h3> \n<p>When you're mentoring someone, you might feel pressured to give them advice straight away. But not all feedback is helpful feedback, and knowing the difference is key.</p> \n<p>A good mentor knows when to hit 'pause' during a conversation, says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rebeccacorliss\">Rebecca Corliss</a>, former director of marketing at HubSpot.</p> \n<p>\"If you don't have the right information, experience, or emotional state to react to a scenario properly, hit 'pause,\" she said. \"That will give you a chance to get more information, talk to your resources, and come back with a clear and valuable response.\"</p> \n<p>Here’s what that might look like in a real conversation.</p> \n<p><em>\"Thanks for sharing this with me. I'm going to take some time and give this some serious thought before we continue. It's important to me that I'm giving you the best possible solution. Why don't we continue talking about it [tomorrow/next week/next time we meet]? I'll book some time.\"</em></p> \n<h3>6. Don’t assume anything about your mentee – ask.</h3> \n<p>Biases cloud our judgment whether we realize it or not. While we can work to uncover and dismantle them, some are so ingrained that they peak out without us realizing it.</p> \n<p>To combat this issue with your mentee, breakthrough common assumptions by asking questions and digging deeper. This is especially important if you're mentoring someone who's in the early stages of their career</p> \n<p>Say you're mentoring someone who's having trouble getting through to their manager. Instead of launching into a story about a time you had communication issues with a manager of yours, spend time asking questions that draw out the important details of their problem.</p> \n<p>\"Your job is to facilitate advancement and movement, not just chat,\" says LeValley. \"Your words can change their lives so you must choose them carefully.\"</p> \n<p>Only once you've gotten an honest background on a problem can you share helpful, relevant feedback – without making decisions <em>for</em> your mentee.</p> \n<h3>7. Share your journey.</h3> \n<p>Being open to sharing your own mistakes and failures is one of the best gifts a mentor can give.</p> \n<p>Not only is it helpful information for problem-solving purposes, but it also builds trust and strengthens the relationship.</p> \n<p>\"Junior employees don't always feel comfortable owning up to a mistake or admitting that they're struggling in a certain area,\" says former Managing Director at HubSpot<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/emmajsnider\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/emmajsnider\">Emma Brudner</a>. \"If you cop to your failures and struggles, you make it OK for them to chime in and help them share with you.\"</p> \n<p>Sagaille says that before his mentor, he often thought the struggles he faced were unique. However, he was reassured by his mentor, who had experience in his exact role.</p> \n<p>\"I'm just excited that I have a window into the future a little bit because she's dealt with similar issues and she's had some setbacks because of those issues,\" he says, \"so, she's able to steer me in the direction so I can avoid those pitfalls.\"</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lesliezye\">Leslie Ye</a>, content designer at HubSpot, suggests reflecting on the roadblocks you faced when you were in your mentee’s stage in life or career.</p> \n<p>\"Hearing how someone else approached a challenge is always helpful for someone going through it for the first time,\" she says. \"Even if you don't solve problems the same way as your mentee, it's always useful to hear multiple perspectives.\"</p> \n<p>Perry echoes this sentiment.</p> \n<p>\"Take time to tap into your own story,\" he says, \"Especially for Black mentors, it's important to relate and establish an interpersonal bond that fosters real talk – be a true resource in all facets.\"</p> \n<p>He adds that adversity of any kind our response to them is a foundational way to create relatability. Strain agrees, pointing to her non-traditional tech background before transitioning to the B2B Saas space.</p> \n<p>\"I'm extremely transparent about my own journey with a mentee. As I climb up the ladder as a Black woman in tech, it's important for me to continue reaching back down and helping others up as well,\" she says. \"If it wasn't for some of my own incredible mentors throughout my career, I wouldn't be a mentor now as well.\"</p> \n<h3>8. Celebrate their achievements.</h3> \n<p>Because people often look for or call upon a mentor to help them with tough situations, many mentorship conversations revolve around the stressful stuff.</p> \n<p>When you take the time to highlight and even celebrate your mentee's successes and achievements, you're also building your mentee's confidence and keeping them motivated.</p> \n<p>\"I've worked in a lot of places in the past that were very reserved with positive feedback and very lavish with constructive or negative feedback,\" said Sagaille. \"So I think that's something my mentor does really, really well – it's a nice balance.\"</p> \n<p>Some mentees also seek approval from their mentors. Acknowledging their success is a way to satisfy that psychological need for recognition.</p> \n<p>If you’re wondering <em>how </em>to celebrate their achievements, consider asking them what their love languages are. Those aren’t just helpful for personal relationships, they also work for professional ones as well.</p> \n<p>For instance, you may want to congratulate your mentee on a win by sending them a gift. However, if they value words of affirmation more, that’s the better way to go.</p> \n<h3>9. Seek out resources to help your mentee grow.</h3> \n<p>Great mentors look for situations – and some even create situations – to help their mentees get closer to their goals.</p> \n<p>It can be anything from connecting them with someone with experience in their dream job to recommending a conference they might be interested in. Take note of the areas in which your mentee wants to grow, and always be looking for opportunities to point them in the right direction.</p> \n<p>If you work at the same company as your mentee and have some involvement in their experience, Corliss suggests introducing new projects to them over time as a way to build a strong foundation.</p> \n<p>\"First, start with something that gives context. This could be something that requires research and is genuinely valuable,\" she says. \"Then, handoff something small that you normally do for your intern or mentee to own. This will help your mentee learn how to develop ownership over something, including how to execute and reach a goal on his or her own. Then, build upon that foundation.\"</p> \n<h3>10. Be sure you have the bandwidth.</h3> \n<p>LeValley believes mentorship is best when it’s approached as a calling instead of a task. With that in mind, it’s important to consider if you have the bandwidth to take it on.</p> \n<p>\"Be honest with yourself about what extent you are willing to give of your time and expertise,\" Strain says. \"This will help you manage your own workload and personal life easier without guilt or stretching yourself too thin.\"</p> \n<p>Washington echoes this sentiment and adds that it’s OK to bow out if you realize you don’t have the bandwidth.</p> \n<p>\"The relationship needs to be mutually beneficial and if you feel like you would be burdened by taking on the relationship, then be respectful to your prospective mentee and tell them that you’re not able to take on the relationship,\" she says. \"It’s better to be upfront than to waste anyone’s time.\"</p> \n<p>At the end of the day, being a great mentor takes practice and patience. The more you work with a given mentee, the more you'll learn a lot about them: their communication style, how they process feedback, how they go about pursuing their goals.</p> \n<p>The best part?

But before we get to that, let's talk about key elements that should serve as building blocks for your plan.</p> \n<p>For some entrepreneurs, the thought of writing a business plan sounds like a chore — a necessary means to an end. But that's a bad take.</p> \n<p>A solid business plan is a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/why-business-plan-important\">blueprint for success</a>. It's key to securing financing, presenting your business, outlining your financial projections, and turning that nugget of a business idea into a reality.</p> \n<p>At the core, your business plan should answer two questions: why your business and why now?</p> \n<p>Investors want to know why your business is entering the market, i.e. what problem it's solving and how it's different from what's currently out there. They also want to know why now is the right time for your type of product or service.</p> \n<p>At a minimum, your plan should:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Be more realistic than idealistic: </strong>Too often, business plans focus too much on how things could be instead of how they are. While having a vision is important, your plan needs to be rooted in research and data.</li> \n <li><strong>Legitimize your business idea</strong>: If an idea fails on paper, it's a signal to go back to the drawing board. In doing so, you avoid losing precious time or money chasing an unrealistic idea.</li> \n <li><strong>Position your business for funding:</strong> To get your business off the ground, chances are you'll need financial backing. Even with a solid business idea, investors, lenders, and banks still need convincing. An effective business plan will outline how much money you need, where it's going, what targets you will hit, and how you plan to repay any debts.</li> \n <li><strong>Lay the foundation:</strong> Investors focus on risk – if anything looks shaky, it could be a dealbreaker. Ideally, your business plan will lay down the foundation for how you'll operate your business — from operational needs to financial projections and goals.</li> \n <li><strong>Communicate your needs:</strong> It's nearly impossible to communicate your needs if you don't know what they are first. Of course, a business’ needs are always changing — but your plan should give you a well-rounded view of how your business will work in the short and long term.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>So back to the question of why and why now – consider three things:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Your industry </strong>– How does your product or service fit within your industry? Are you targeting a specific niche? Where do you see the industry going in the next five to 10 years?</li> \n</ul> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/target-audience\"><strong>Your target audience </strong></a>– Who are you targeting? What challenges are they facing? How will your product or service help them in their daily lives?</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/unique-selling-proposition\"><strong>Your unique selling proposition</strong></a><strong> (USP) </strong>– What sets you apart from your competitors? Is it your product/service features? Your company values? Price?</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Once you know the answers to these questions, you'll be equipped to answer the question: why your business and why now.</p> \n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Featured Resource: <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/business-plan-template?hubs_post-cta=body\">Free Business Plan Template</a></h3>  \n<h3>1. Cover Page</h3> \n<p>Your business plan should be prefaced with an eye-catching cover page. This means including a high-resolution image of your company logo, followed by your company's name, address, and phone number.</p> \n<p>Since this business plan will likely change hands and be seen by multiple investors, you should also provide your own name, role in the business, and email address on the cover page.</p> \n<p>At the bottom of this page, you can also add a confidentiality statement to protect against the disclosure of your business details.</p> \n<p>The statement can read as follows: \"<em>This document contains confidential and proprietary information created by [your company name]. When receiving this document, you agree to keep its content confidential and may only reproduce and/or share it with express written permission of [your company name]</em>.\"</p> \n<p>Remember to keep your cover page simple and concise — and save the important details for other sections.</p> \n<p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>First impressions are everything, and a clean cover page is the first step in the right direction.</p> \n<p><strong>Example of a Cover Page</strong></p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/k8btRjGJKYsvYZZaky97fQJJmc7xyb2hrYgN2RrYH7YAIfTiYppqyFYYuOCVyh6wI3O-1s-FakM2vuNdeoN8Jzq2U9zrrPoVZbaxMEYnA4KVCQhhy7jWKnsEPTfc4V91rlvUxIPQ\" width=\"550\" alt=\"Business Plan Template: Cover Page\" style=\"margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; font-size: 11px; font-family: AvenirNext, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; width: 550px;\"></p> \n<h3>2. Executive Summary</h3> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/executive-summary-examples?__hstc=45788219.a88006fb12c47b02d3536e8c93c7f945.1626194230804.1626194230804.1626194230804.1&amp;__hssc=45788219.1.1626194230805&amp;__hsfp=3989423374\">executive summary</a> of your business plan provides a one- to two-page overview of your business and highlights the most crucial pieces of your plan, such as your short-term and long-term goals.</p> \n<p>The executive summary is essentially a boiled-down version of your entire business plan, so remember to keep this section to the point and filled only with essential information.</p> \n<p>Typically, this brief section includes:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>A mission statement.</li> \n <li>The company's history and leadership model.</li> \n <li>An overview of competitive advantage(s).</li> \n <li>Financial projections.</li> \n <li>Company goals.</li> \n <li>An ask from potential investors.</li> \n</ul> \n<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> The executive summary is known as the make-or-break section of a business plan. It influences whether investors turn the page or not — so effectively summarizing your business and the problem it hopes to solve is a must.</p> \n<p>Think of the Summary as a written elevator pitch (with more detail). While your business plan provides the nitty-gritty details, your Summary describes — in a compelling but matter-of-fact language — the highlights of your plan. If it's too vague, complicated, or fuzzy, you may need to scrap it and start again.</p> \n<p><strong>Example of an Executive Summary Introduction</strong></p> \n<p><em>\"The future looks bright for North Side Chicago, particularly the Rock Hill Neighborhood. A number of high-end commercial and residential developments are well on their way, along with two new condo developments in nearby neighborhoods.</em></p> \n<p><em>While the completion of these developments will increase the population within the neighborhood and stimulate the economy, the area lacks an upscale restaurant where residents and visitors can enjoy fine food and drink. Jay Street Lounge and Restaurant will provide such a place.\"</em></p> \n<h3>3. Company &amp; Business Description</h3> \n<p>In this section, provide a more thorough description of what your company is and why it exists.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/1hHCPipsTYKN2hKZtSGM3tzx8fDbCtVJcdQDJrOuQR3iPd6kRmYD64otOq6lkZ7Jio1MiQnFJVhF_fNKCdGxQTS3cjfxvF2-n9sp9Rt5v3Vf7W5UF6b_RAp-_jHkAu8A5dru9GPV\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" alt=\"Business Plan Template: Business Description\"></p> \n<p>The bulk of the writing in this section should be about your company's purpose – covering what the business will be selling, identifying the target market, and laying out a path to success.</p> \n<p>In this portion of your business plan, you can also elaborate on your company's:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Mission statement</li> \n <li>Core values</li> \n <li>Team and organizational structure</li> \n</ul> \n<p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>Investors look for great structures and teams in addition to great ideas. This section gives an overview of your businesses' ethos. It's the perfect opportunity to set your business apart from the competition — such as your team's expertise, your unique work culture, and your competitive advantage.</p> \n<p><strong>Example of a Values/Mission Statement</strong></p> \n<p><em>\"Jay Street Lounge and Restaurant will be the go-to place for people to get a drink or bite in an elegant, upscale atmosphere. The mission is to be North Side's leading restaurant, with the best tasting food and the highest quality service.\"</em></p> \n<h3>3. Product &amp; Services Line</h3> \n<p>Here's where you'll cover the makeup of your business's product and/or services line. You should provide each product or service's name, its purpose, and a description of how it works (if appropriate). If you own any patents, copyrights, or trademarks, it's essential to include this info too.</p> \n<p>Next, add some color to your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/sales-strategy\">sales strategy</a> by outlining your pricing model and mark-up amounts.</p> \n<p>If you're selling tangible products, you should also explain production and costs, and how you expect these factors to change as you scale.</p> \n<p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>This section contains the real meat of your business plan. It sets the stage for the problem you hope to solve, your solution, and how your said solution fits in the market.</p> \n<p>There's no one-size-fits-all formula for this section. For instance, one plan may delve into its ability to market in a more cost-effective way than the competition, whereas another plan focuses on its key products and their unique features and benefits.</p> \n<p>Regardless of your angle, it's critical to convey how your offerings will differ from the competition.</p> \n<p><strong>Example of a Product/Service Offering</strong></p> \n<p><em>\"The menu at Jay Street Lounge and Restaurant will focus on Moroccan cuisine. The stars of the menu (our specialties) are the Moroccan dishes, such as eggplant zaalouk, seafood bastilla, tagine, and chickpea stew. For those who enjoy American dishes, there will also be a variety of options, from burger sliders and flatbread pizza to grilled steak and salads.</em></p> \n<p><em>The food at Jay Street will have premium pricing to match its upscale atmosphere. During the summer months, the restaurant will have extra seating on the patio where clients can enjoy a special summer menu. We will be open on all days of the week.\"</em></p> \n<h3>4. Market Analysis</h3> \n<p>The market analysis section is where you'll provide details about the audience to which you're marketing your business. This should encompass the size of your total addressable market, your market's demographics and psychographics, and location analysis for your business' operating space.<img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/n6dfNVcYzMAFLHsNEMUbrCtXIsqdjmiKOGRDF6CveYLUp-4PV6lQEFZQnYNl8qEzwS0bD6R1CsUnQoy3SMgtOBqpKFtm1pXN-J0smQbQ31DX7SgOYq43X76ml_dZoi4tMchD1Ix8\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" alt=\"Business Plan Template: Market Analysis\"></p> \n<p>It helps to reference your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/market-research-buyers-journey-guide\">market research</a> documentation in this section, like a Porter's Five Forces Analysis or a SWOT Analysis (<a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/market-research-kit?__hstc=45788219.a88006fb12c47b02d3536e8c93c7f945.1626194230804.1626194230804.1626194230804.1&amp;__hssc=45788219.1.1626194230805&amp;__hsfp=3989423374\">templates for those are available here</a>). You can also include them in your appendix.</p> \n<p>If your company already has buyer personas, you should include them here as well. If not, you can create them right now using the <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/make-my-persona?__hstc=45788219.a88006fb12c47b02d3536e8c93c7f945.1626194230804.1626194230804.1626194230804.1&amp;__hssc=45788219.1.1626194230805&amp;__hsfp=3989423374\">Make My Persona Tool</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>Having an awesome product is, well, awesome — but it isn't enough. Just as important, there must be a market for it.</p> \n<p>This section allows you to dig deeper into your market, which segments you want to target, and why. The \"why\" here is important, since targeting the right segment is critical for the success and growth of your business.</p> \n<p>It's easy to get lost (or overwhelmed) in a sea of endless data. For your business plan, narrow your focus by answering the following questions:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>What is my market? In other words, who are my customers?</li> \n <li>What segments of the market do I want to target?</li> \n <li>What's the size of my target market?</li> \n <li>Is my market likely to grow?</li> \n <li>How can I increase my market share over time?</li> \n</ul> \n<p><strong>Example of a Market Analysis</strong></p> \n<p><em>\"Jay Street Lounge and Restaurant will target locals who live and work within the Rock Hill Neighborhood and the greater North Side Chicago area. We will also target the tourists who flock to the many tourist attractions and colleges on the North Side.</em></p> \n<p><em>We will specifically focus on young to middle-aged adults with an income of $40,000 to $80,000 who are looking for an upscale experience. The general demographics of our target market are women between 20 to 50 years old.</em></p> \n<p><em>A unique and varied Moroccan-American menu, along with our unique upscale atmosphere, differentiates us from competitors in the area. Jay Street will also set itself apart through its commitment to high-quality food, service, design, and atmosphere.\"</em></p> \n<h3>5. Marketing Plan</h3> \n<p>Unlike the market analysis section, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-plan-template-generator\">your marketing plan</a> section should be an explanation of the tactical approach to reaching your aforementioned target audience. List your advertising channels, organic marketing methods, messaging, budget, and any relevant promotional tactics.</p> \n<p>If your company has a fully fleshed-out marketing plan, you can attach it in the appendix of your business plan. If not, <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/marketing-plan-template?__hstc=45788219.a88006fb12c47b02d3536e8c93c7f945.1626194230804.1626194230804.1626194230804.1&amp;__hssc=45788219.1.1626194230805&amp;__hsfp=3989423374\">download this free marketing plan template</a> to outline your strategy.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=e9d2eacb-6b01-423a-bf7a-19d42ba77eaa&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"→ Download Now: Free Business Plan Template\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/e9d2eacb-6b01-423a-bf7a-19d42ba77eaa.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>Marketing is what puts your product in front of your customers. It's not just advertising — it's an investment in your business.</p> \n<p>Throwing money into random marketing channels is a haphazard approach, which is why it's essential to do the legwork to create a solid marketing plan.</p> \n<p>Here's some good news — by this point, you should have a solid understanding of your target market. Now, it's time to determine how you'll reach them.</p> \n<p><strong>Example of a Marketing Plan Overview</strong></p> \n<p><em>\"Our marketing strategy will focus on three main initiatives:</em></p> \n<ul> \n <li><em>Social media marketing. We will grow and expand our Facebook and Instagram following through targeted social media ads.</em></li> \n <li><em>Website initiatives. Our website will attract potential visitors by offering updated menus and a calendar of events.</em></li> \n <li><em>Promotional events. Jay Street will have one special theme night per week to attract new clients.\"</em></li> \n</ul> \n<h3>6. Sales Plan</h3> \n<p>It doesn't matter if your sales department is an office full of business development representatives (BDR) or a dozen stores with your products on their shelves.</p> \n<p>The point is: All <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/ultimate-guide-creating-sales-plan\">sales plans</a> are different, so you should clearly outline yours here. Common talking points include your:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Sales team structure, and why this structure was chosen.</li> \n <li>Sales channels.</li> \n <li>Sales tools, software, and resources.</li> \n <li>Prospecting strategy.</li> \n <li>Sales goals and budget.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Like with your marketing plan, it might make sense to attach your completed sales plan to the appendix of your business plan. You can <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/sales-plan-template?__hstc=45788219.a88006fb12c47b02d3536e8c93c7f945.1626194230804.1626194230804.1626194230804.1&amp;__hssc=45788219.1.1626194230805&amp;__hsfp=3989423374\">download a template for building your sales plan here</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Among other things, investors are interested in the scalability of your business — which is why growth strategies are a critical part of your business plan.</p> \n<p>Your sales plan should describe your plan to attract customers, retain them (if applicable), and, ultimately, grow your business. Be sure to outline what you plan to do given your existing resources and what results you expect from your work.</p> \n<p><strong>Example of a Sales Plan Overview</strong></p> \n<p><em>\"The most important goal is to ensure financial success for Jay Street Lounge and Restaurant. We believe we can achieve this by offering excellent food, entertainment, and service to our clients.</em></p> \n<p><em>We are not a low-cost dining option in the area. Instead, the food will have premium pricing to match its upscale feel. The strategy is to give Jay Street a perception of elegance through its food, entertainment, and excellent service.\"</em></p> \n<h3>7. Legal Notes</h3> \n<p>Your investors may want to know the legal structure of your business, as that could directly impact the risk of their investments. For example, if you're looking for business partners to engage in a non-corporation or LLC partnership, this means they could be on the line for more than their actual investment.</p> \n<p>Because this clarification is often needed, explain if you are and/or plan to become a sole proprietor, partnership, corporation, LLC, or other.</p> \n<p>You should also outline the steps you have taken (or will need to take) to operate legally. This includes licenses, permits, registrations, and insurance.</p> \n<p>The last thing your investor wants to hear after they've sent you a big chunk of change is that you're operating without proper approval from the local, state, or federal government.</p> \n<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> The last thing your investor wants to hear after they've sent you a big chunk of change is that you're operating without proper approval from the local, state, or federal government.</p> \n<p><strong>Example of Legal Notes</strong></p> \n<p><em>\"Jay Street Lounge and Restaurant is up-to-date on all restaurant licenses and health permits. Our business name and logo are registered trademarks, presenting the possibility of expanding locally.\"</em></p> \n<h3>8. Financial Considerations</h3> \n<p>Ultimately, investors want to know two things:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>When they will earn their money back.</li> \n <li>When they will start seeing returns on their initial investment.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>That said, be clear, calculated, and convincing in this section. It should cover:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Startup costs.</li> \n <li>Sales forecasts for the next several months/quarters.</li> \n <li>Break-even analysis for time and dollars.</li> \n <li>Projected profit and loss (P&amp;L) statement.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Facts and figures are key here, so be as specific as possible with each line item and projection. In addition, explain the \"why\" behind each of these sections.</p> \n<p>However, keep in mind that information overload is a risk, especially when it comes to data. So, if you have pages upon pages of charts and spreadsheets for this section, distill them into a page or two and include the rest of the sheets in the appendix. This section should only focus on key data points.</p> \n<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> One of the most important aspects of becoming \"investor ready\" is knowing your numbers. More importantly, you need to <em>understand</em> how those numbers will enhance your business.</p> \n<p>While it's easy to write a number down on paper, it's more important to understand (and communicate) why you need capital, where it's going, and that your evaluation makes sense.</p> \n<p><strong>Example of Financial Projections</strong></p> \n<p><em>\"Based on our knowledge and experience in the restaurant industry, we have come up with projections for the business.</em></p> \n<p><em>Starting with an expenditure of $400,000 in year 1, we forecast sales of $1,500,000 and $2,800,000 for years two and three. We expect to achieve a net profit of 15% by year three.\"</em></p> \n<h3>9. Appendix</h3> \n<p>A detailed and well-developed business plan can range anywhere from 20 to 50 pages, with some even reaching upward of 80.</p> \n<p>In many cases, the appendix is the longest section. Why? Because it includes the supportive materials mentioned in previous sections. To avoid disrupting the flow of the business plan with visuals, charts, and spreadsheets, business owners usually add them in the last section, i.e. the appendix.</p> \n<p>Aside from what we've already mentioned – marketing plan, sales plan, department budgets, financial documents – you may also want to attach the following in the appendix:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Marketing materials</li> \n <li>Market research data</li> \n <li>Licensing documentation</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/branding\">Branding assets</a></li> \n <li>Floor plans for your location</li> \n <li>Mockups of your product</li> \n <li>Renderings of your office space or location design</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Adding these pieces to the appendix enriches the reader's understanding of your business and proves you've put the work into your business plan without distracting from the main points throughout the plan.</p> \n<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> An appendix helps the reader do their due diligence. It contains everything they need to support your business plan.</p> \n<p>Keep in mind, however, that an appendix is typically necessary only if you're seeking financing or looking to attract business partners.</p> \n<h2><strong>Use a Business Plan Template to Get Started</strong></h2> \n<p>Writing a business plan shouldn't be an insurmountable roadblock to starting a business.

Do not buy email addresses.</h3> \n<p>I know what you're thinking: In the early stages of an <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/email\">email marketing</a> newsletter, you want to do whatever it takes to kickstart the campaign and get eyeballs on your business. I get it. Whatever options you see online, however, you should resist the urge to <em>purchase</em> an email list.</p> \n<p>There are lots of ways to buy an email list, but none of them will actually benefit your campaign. Why? Since the owners of these email addresses didn't explicitly agree to receive content from you, there's no telling how interested they are -- or if they're even a fit for what you have to offer. A bought email list is also in violation of GDPR (we'll talk more about this in just a minute).</p> \n<p>Purchasing email lists is always a bad idea. Get more reasons why in <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/32892/why-purchasing-email-lists-is-always-a-bad-idea.aspx\">this blog post</a>.</p> \n<h3>2. Abide by CAN-SPAM rules.</h3> \n<p>CAN-SPAM (<strong>C</strong>ontrolling the <strong>A</strong>ssault of <strong>N</strong>on-<strong>S</strong>olicited <strong>P</strong>ornography <strong>A</strong>nd <strong>M</strong>arketing) is an act <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-can-spam-ht\">that was passed in 2003</a>. Essentially, it's a law that establishes the rules for commercial email and commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have a business stop emailing them, and outlines the penalties incurred for those who violate the law.</p> \n<p>In order to be CAN-SPAM compliant, it's important that your email messages follow these rules, which are <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business\">available on the FTC's website</a>.</p> \n<p>A few highlights:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Include your valid physical postal address in every email you send out.</li> \n <li>Give recipients a clear and obvious way to opt out (i.e., unsubscribe) of every email you send. (<strong>HubSpot customers: </strong>Don't worry -- you can't save an email template unless it includes this element.)</li> \n <li>Use clear \"From,\" \"To,\" and \"Reply to\" language that accurately reflects who you are.</li> \n <li>Avoid \"no-reply\" or similar sender names, which prevent recipients from opting out of an email newsletter if they'd like to.</li> \n <li>Avoid selling or transferring any email addresses to another list.</li> \n</ul> \n<p><strong>Note:</strong><em> Because I am not a lawyer, please do not construe the contents of this article as official legal advice. <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business\">Check out the FTC's website</a> for extensive advice on this subject, and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/30594/A-Marketer-s-Guide-to-Getting-Past-Email-Spam-Filters.aspx#sm.0000o5c3iom8gdkipdw2l236rj19q\">read this blog post</a> for more tips on improving email deliverability.</em></p> \n<div class=\"video-container-responsive\"> \n <iframe style=\"margin: 0px auto; display: block;\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/cm6Dnaqiyso\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</div> \n<h3>3. Ensure your opt-in process complies with GDPR.</h3> \n<p>You've probably heard of the <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/data-privacy/gdpr\">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a>, a new law enacted across Europe in May 2018 to better protect internet users' personal data.</p> \n<p>We don't expect you to have this long piece of legislation memorized. However, if some of your email recipients live in Europe, there is one key guideline by which you should develop your email marketing campaigns:</p> \n<p>When your website users land on a page that solicits their personal information, tradition might tell you to include a pre-checked box that opts the user into an email campaign so they can receive updates and special offers related to your business. Today, having this box pre-checked is in violation of GDPR. <strong>So, to comply with GDPR, make sure your European users and customers are given the clear option to opt into your email newsletter themselves -- don't make the decision for them</strong>.</p> \n<p>This rule might sound like bad news for your email marketing campaign, but it can actually improve your open and clickthrough rates. Limiting your subscriber list to just those who specifically asked to join you will ensure only the most interested people are receiving your messages. This maximizes the chances that you'll convert readers to qualified leads as a result of an email send.</p> \n<h3>4. Email new contacts within 24 hours.</h3> \n<p>It's important to take advantage of the window of opportunity when your company or brand is at the top of your prospects' minds. You can really get a pulse of what future engagement will look like by what people do when you email then within 24 hours of their subscribing to your newsletter, signing up for an offer, and so on. Plus, it's a great opportunity for branding and setting expectations.</p> \n<p>If you don't have any automated email workflows set up, you're likely missing out on some major opportunities to nurture and engage your existing contacts.</p> \n<p>(<strong>HubSpot customers: </strong><a title=\"HubSpot's Workflows tool\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing-automation\">Use HubSpot's Workflows App</a> to create personalized, automated email workflows that can get triggered in a number of different ways: when a contact gets added to a list, submits a form on your website, clicks a link in an email, views a page on your blog, clicks on one of your AdWords ads, or becomes a marketing qualified lead.)</p> \n<h3>5. Send your emails from a real person, not your company.</h3> \n<p>When you send email from a real person, your email open rate increases. Plain and simple. This is because -- based on past tests we've conducted -- recipients are typically more likely to trust a personalized sender name and email address than a generic one. People are so inundated with spam nowadays, they often hesitate to open email from unfamiliar senders -- and they're more likely to trust a personalized sender name and email address than a generic one.</p> \n<p>At HubSpot, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/31634/A-B-Testing-in-Action-3-Real-Life-Marketing-Experiments.aspx\" title=\"we've found\">we found that </a>that emails sent from \"Maggie Georgieva, HubSpot\" perform better in terms of open <em>and </em>clickthrough rate than emails sent from just \"HubSpot.\" So, it may be best to do this ...</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Sender name: Paul Smith</li> \n <li>Sender email address: <a href=\"mailto:psmith@company.com\">psmith@company.com</a></li> \n</ul> \n<p>... instead of this:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Sender name: Marketing Team</li> \n <li>Sender email address: <a href=\"mailto:marketing@company.com\">marketing@company.com</a></li> \n</ul> \n<p>(<strong>HubSpot customers:</strong> <a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/articles/kcs_article/email/how-do-i-personalize-the-from-name-and-address-in-an-email?_ga=1.205947027.1866822358.1456501228\">Click here</a> to learn how to personalize the \"From\" name and email address.)</p> \n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Our tests showed personalization works, but we've also found that a combination of a person's name and a company name together in the sender name works well, too. You've just got to <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/an-introduction-to-ab-testing\">A/B test what works best</a> for your particular company, brand, and industry as well as what's ideal based on to whom you're sending emails.</p> \n<h3>6. Pre-set the preview text.</h3> \n<p>Email clients like the iPhone Mail app, Gmail, and Outlook will display the first few lines of text from the body of your email alongside the subject line. In other words, it's a text preview of the content inside the email. The exact amount of text shown depends on the email client and user settings.</p> \n<p>Use it to provide a short, to-the-point synopsis of what you're offering -- and keep it to 50 characters or less.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/email-preview-text-in-inbox.png?width=690&amp;height=54&amp;name=email-preview-text-in-inbox.png\" alt=\"email-preview-text-in-inbox.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"54\" /></p> \n<p>When you don't set the preview text, the client will automatically pull from the body of your email, which not only looks messy, but is also a wasted opportunity to engage your audience.

Write clear and clickable subject lines.</h3> \n<p>Speaking of the subject line ... your marketing emails have a lot to compete with in recipients' inboxes. The best way to stand out is to write compelling, \"can't-help-but-click-on-this\" subject lines.</p> \n<p>To entice readers to click, be sure your subject lines:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Are super clear and understandable.</li> \n <li>Are fewer than 50 characters so they don't get cut off, particularly by mobile devices.</li> \n <li>Use language and messaging that <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33491/Everything-Marketers-Need-to-Research-Create-Detailed-Buyer-Personas-Template.aspx\">your target buyer persona</a> is familiar with and excited about.</li> \n <li>Include verbs and action-oriented language to create a sense of urgency and excitement.</li> \n <li>Include an exclusive value proposition (like 20% off an item or a free ebook) so people know what they're getting.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/30594/A-Marketer-s-Guide-to-Getting-Past-Email-Spam-Filters.aspx#sm.0000o5c3iom8gdkipdw2l236rj19q\">Avoid spam triggers</a> like “Cash,” “Quote,” and “Save.\"</li> \n <li>Are timely, if applicable. (One of <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-email-subject-lines-list\">my favorite subject lines</a> came from Warby Parker and read: \"Uh-oh, your prescription is expiring\".)</li> \n <li>Include their first names sometimes (it could <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/the-science-of-email-marketing\">increase clickthrough rates</a>), or even add something about their specific location. (You'll want to do this sparingly, like for your most important offers, rather than over-doing it and being repetitive or intrusive.)</li> \n</ul> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/improve-your-email-subject-line\">Read this blog post</a> for more tips on writing clickable, delightful subject lines.</p> \n<h3>8. Keep your emails concise.</h3> \n<p>Everyone's busy and their inbox is already full. Why add to the problem with a longwinded email? People generally like short, concise emails better than long ones because concise emails have an obvious focus. Plus, when your users are scanning through all their emails in a short amount of time, they're more likely to find the overall message before deciding to take any action.</p> \n<p>Another reason to keep your emails short? Too much copy is actually a red flag for spam filters, too.</p> \n<p>To keep your emails short and compelling, write your email like you were talking to someone in real life. If your email <em>has </em>to be on the long side, break it up into multiple paragraphs to provide visual breaks. This'll make skimming it much easier on your reader. (<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/32606/The-9-Must-Have-Components-of-Compelling-Email-Copy.aspx#sm.0000o5c3iom8gdkipdw2l236rj19q\">Read this blog post on how to write compelling emails</a> for more tips.)</p> \n<p>Here's a great example of a concise email:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/free-lattes-concise-email-language.png?width=647&amp;height=886&amp;name=free-lattes-concise-email-language.png\" alt=\"free-lattes-concise-email-language.png\" width=\"647\" height=\"886\" /></p> \n<h3>9. Include one call-to-action button per email.</h3> \n<p>Remember when I said a lot of your email recipients will scan your email without reading all the copy? That's why you want to have a clear call-to-action (CTA) button that's easy to spot for even the quickest of email scanners. Without a CTA button, you won't be calling on your recipients to take any action that actually benefits them -- and the growth of your business.</p> \n<p>You'll want to place your CTA in a location where it's easily visible and where it makes sense for someone to click on it. For example, you might put a CTA to download a free ebook in an email that describes new strategies for using your product.</p> \n<p>Once you've determined where you want to put your CTA, it's time to create the button itself. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/call-to-action-templates-free-download-ht\">Click here to download 50 free CTA button templates</a> to get you started.

Add alt text to your CTA image.</h3> \n<p>Many email clients block images -- including your CTA buttons -- by default. That means a good chunk of your audience may not see your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/call-to-action-optimization-ht\">beautiful, optimized CTA</a>. Instead, they see this:</p> \n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-388144872-png/Screen_Shot_2013-11-21_at_10.02.52_AM.png\" alt=\"\" /></p> \n<p>When you set an image's alt text, though, you let recipients who can't view images in their email know exactly where to click to complete the action:</p> \n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"This is what an image with alt-text looks like.\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-385628288-png/Screen_Shot_2013-11-21_at_9.58.55_AM.png\" alt=\"CTA image with alt-text in an email.\" /></p> \n<p>You can either edit the alt text in your email tool's rich text editor (just right-click the image and edit away), or you can manually enter it in the HTML editor of your email tool like this:</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: 'courier new', courier;\"><em>&lt;a href=\"<strong>HTTP://YOURLINKHERE.COM</strong>\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"<strong>YOUR CTA BUTTON IMAGE SOURCE HERE.JPG</strong>\" alt-text=\"<strong>YOUR ALT-TEXT GOES HERE</strong>\"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</em></span></p> \n<h3>11. Hyperlink your emails' images.</h3> \n<p>Your ultimate goal in email marketing is to get people to click through to a web page. One way to increase the clickthrough rate without littering the copy with links is to hyperlink the images in your email to the webpage that corresponds with the content of the image.</p> \n<p>If you're inviting readers to download an ebook, for example, and you have a picture of the ebook included in the email, don't just hyperlink the text next to the image telling people to \"download it here.\" Hyperlink the ebook's picture, too. People are drawn to images much more commonly than text, and you want to give your email subscribers as many options to get your ebook as you can.</p> \n<p>You can simply click on the image and then use your email tool's \"Insert/Edit Link\" option, or you can link an image in the HTML editor using the following code:</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'courier new', courier; font-size: 16px;\"><em>&lt;a href=\"<strong>HTTP://YOURLINKHERE.COM</strong>\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"<strong>YOUR IMAGE SOURCE HERE.JPG</strong>\"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</em></span></p> \n<h3>12. Include noticeable text links.</h3> \n<p>In general, it's a good idea to link to your featured offer in multiple places in addition to the clear and focused call-to-action button. In addition to your main CTAs and images, consider including a noticeable text link (or two) when applicable, as having more links increases the opportunity for engagement.</p> \n<h3>13. Place at least one clickable item above the fold.</h3> \n<p>One way to make your emails more clickable? Place one or more of your clickable elements -- whether it's a CTA button, a text link, or a clickable image -- near the beginning of your email.</p> \n<p>This is especially useful for mobile users. Mobile tends to require a lot of scrolling, and sometimes squinting, pinching, and zooming. Giving a recipient something actionable that is seen upon opening can lead to more clicks in this environment.</p> \n<h3>14. Add alt text to all of your images.</h3> \n<p>Again, a lot of email clients out there block images by default. (<a href=\"https://www.campaignmonitor.com/dev-resources/will-it-work/image-blocking/\">Here's the full list</a> from Campaign Monitor.) In those cases, images won't load unless the recipient clicks a button to show them or change their default settings.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-add-alt-text-to-email-images-ht\">Adding alt text to your email images</a> helps recipients understand your message -- even if they can't see the images right away. (<strong>HubSpot customers:</strong> <a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/articles/kcs_article/cos-pages-editor/how-do-i-add-alt-text-to-my-image\">Click here</a> to learn how to add alt text to your email images in HubSpot.)</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/add-alt-text.png?width=690&amp;height=301&amp;name=add-alt-text.png\" alt=\"add-alt-text.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"301\" /></p> \n<p>You might consider making the language in your alt text actionable, such as \"Click here to download the ultimate content creation kit.\" Actionable alt text will essentially turn every linked image into another CTA. So, even if someone doesn't see the snazzy GIF of my latest offer (or if they hover their mouse over an image that <em>does </em>show up), the alt text will beckon them to click.</p> \n<h3>15. Avoid background images.</h3> \n<p>This is especially important if your target buyers tend to use Outlook as an email client.</p> \n<p>Microsoft Outlook doesn't recognize background images, period. Given that <a href=\"https://emailclientmarketshare.com/\">Outlook is the fifth most-used email client</a> with 7% of the market share -- and that's in total; your industry might have a lot more -- it's best to avoid using background images altogether.</p> \n<p>Instead, use a background color and use images in other ways in your email, like Harry's did in their email below:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/harrys-email-example.png?width=580&amp;height=1630&amp;name=harrys-email-example.png\" alt=\"harrys-email-example.png\" width=\"580\" height=\"1630\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><em>Image Credit: <a href=\"http://beautiful-email-newsletters.com/emails/harrys-our-most-popular-gift-is/\">Beautiful Email Newsletters</a></em></span></p> \n<h3>16. Add social sharing buttons.</h3> \n<p>Increasing the number of people who see your link will increase the number of people who click on it. So, be sure to extend the life of your email by <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/29544/The-Ultimate-Cheat-Sheet-for-Creating-Social-Media-Buttons.aspx\">adding social sharing buttons</a>.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/29544/The-Ultimate-Cheat-Sheet-for-Creating-Social-Media-Buttons.aspx\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Social Sharing Buttons\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-388230117-png/linkedin-share-button-above.png?width=300&amp;name=linkedin-share-button-above.png\" alt=\"Social Sharing Buttons\" width=\"300\" /></a></p> \n<p>Many email tools will come with templates that have built-in social sharing buttons that make it easy -- just fill in the destination URL and you're good to go. If you don't have built-in capabilities, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/29544/The-Ultimate-Cheat-Sheet-for-Creating-Social-Media-Buttons.aspx\">here is a cheat sheet for easily creating your own social sharing buttons</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> If you want to increase clicks, you want to add <em>sharing</em> buttons, not <em>follow</em> buttons. The former will allow your email recipients to pass along the offer URL in your email to their followers. The latter will prompt them to Like, follow, or add your company social media channels.</p> \n<h3>17. Simplify sharing with ready-made tweets.</h3> \n<p>People are far more likely to take an action if you make it really, really easy for them. For recipients out there who are too lazy to tweet the wonderful content you sent them via email, you can make it easy for them by creating what we call a \"lazy tweet.\"</p> \n<p>One simple way to do this? Using ClickToTweet, a free custom tweet link generator. First, <a href=\"https://clicktotweet.com/basic\">go to ClickToTweet's basic tweet generator</a>. Then, type in your tweet, desired (<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-are-utm-tracking-codes-ht\">trackable</a>) destination URL, and hashtags:</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 669px;\" title=\"click-to-tweet-example.png\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/click-to-tweet-example.png?width=669&amp;name=click-to-tweet-example.png\" alt=\"click-to-tweet-example.png\" width=\"669\"><br>Click \"Generate New Link,\" and then grab that link. Then you can link it to your Twitter sharing button. Or, if you're <a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/contacts-user-guide-v2/how-lists-help-you-segment-your-contacts\">segmenting your list by attributes</a> such as \"has Twitter\" or \"topic of recent conversion: social media\" (you'll need marketing intelligence software <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/email\">like HubSpot</a> for this), you can even include it in your main email copy, like this:</br></img></p> \n<h3><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Premade tweet copy example\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-388186477-png/Screen_Shot_2013-11-21_at_10.28.40_AM.png?width=600&amp;name=Screen_Shot_2013-11-21_at_10.28.40_AM.png\" alt=\"Premade tweet copy example\" width=\"600\" /></h3> \n<h3>18. Add an email forwarding option.</h3> \n<p>Another way to extend the clicks on your email beyond its shelf life is to prompt your audience to forward the offer. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/why-people-forward-emails-data\">The folks at Litmus found that</a> <strong>the most forwarded emails were 13X more likely than the typical email to include “Share With Your Network” calls-to-action. </strong>By including forward-to-a-friend (or social sharing links, as we discussed above), you put it in recipients' minds to share.</p> \n<p>You can add a little post-script to the end of your email copy, such as \"Not responsible for your company's social media? Feel free to forward this ebook to a friend or colleague using social media marketing.\" Link the call-to-action to a pre-made email, complete with subject and body text. That way, all someone has to do is enter their associates' email addresses and hit \"Send.\"</p> \n<p>You can highlight text or an image and add the URL via your email tool's rich text editor and then enter a mailto:? link. Here's what this looks like:</p> \n<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><em><span style=\"font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;\">mailto:?subject=Your%20subject%20here%20&amp;body=Your%20email%20body%20text%20here.</span></em></span> \n<p>You can also create this in your HTML editor. Here's how to attach a mailto:? link to text:</p> \n<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><em><span style=\"font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;\">&lt;a href=\"mailto:?subject=<strong>Your%20subject%20here%20&amp;body=Your%20email%20body%20text%20here</strong>.\"&gt;</span></em></span> \n<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><em><span style=\"font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;\">forward this ebook&lt;/a&gt;.</span></em></span> \n<p>And here's how to attach your mailto:? link to an image, such as a sleek call-to-action button that says \"Email This Offer\":</p> \n<span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><em><span style=\"font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;\">&lt;a href=\"mailto:?subject=<strong>Your%20subject%20here%20&amp;body=Your%20email%20body%20text%20here.</strong>\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"<strong>YOUR IMAGE SOURCE HERE.JPG</strong>\" alt-text=\"<strong>YOUR ALT-TEXT GOES HERE</strong>\"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</span></em></span> \n<p>Just make sure you use the \"%20\" tag to separate words! Otherwise, your message willreadlikethis (not too appealing, right?).</p> \n<h3>19. Clean up the plain-text version of your emails.</h3> \n<p>Not every recipient is going to see the beautiful, HTML, rich-text version of your email. Some clients don't support HTML-rich emails, while other times, a person may simply choose to only view messages in plain text.</p> \n<p>When you don't optimize the plain-text version of your email, this is what happens when someone views it:</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Plain-text email done wrong.\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hub/53/file-388686490-png/Screen_Shot_2013-11-20_at_2.12.38_PM.png?width=403&amp;name=Screen_Shot_2013-11-20_at_2.12.38_PM.png\" alt=\"Plain-text email done wrong.\" width=\"403\" /></p> \n<p>Scary, isn't it? I don't think many people are going to bother to read through this garbled mess.</p> \n<p>So, cut out the extra text, replace long tracking URLs with shortened ones, and keep the body simple. Taking the five extra minutes to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/32643/Why-Marketers-Must-Optimize-Emails-for-HTML-AND-Plain-Text-Infographic.aspx\">optimize your email's plain-text version</a> could help you reach more of your target segment and keep you out of the spam folder.</p> \n<p><strong>Note:</strong> When you're cleaning up your plain-text emails, don't change the actual copy much at all or you'll risk it getting marked as spam.</p> \n<h3>20. Optimize your emails for mobile users.</h3> \n<p>In <a href=\"https://litmus.com/blog/mobile-rises-to-56-market-share-longest-sustained-growth-in-2016\">Litmus' analysis of over a billion email opens</a>, they reported that <strong>56% of opened emails were opened on mobile devices in April 2016. </strong>This figure represents an 8% increase in mobile opens in the past year.</p> \n<p>\"This represents a peak for mobile market share,\" they wrote, \"and the longest sustained growth we’ve seen after the holiday season.\"</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p> \n<img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/mobile-email-opens-litmus.png?width=690&amp;height=420&amp;name=mobile-email-opens-litmus.png\" alt=\"mobile-email-opens-litmus.png\" width=\"690\" height=\"420\"> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><em>Image Credit: <a href=\"https://litmus.com/blog/mobile-rises-to-56-market-share-longest-sustained-growth-in-2016\">Litmus</a></em></span></p> <p>As more and more people use their mobile devices to read email and surf the web, it's more important than ever that marketers design their emails with mobile users in mind. Otherwise, their user base will be significantly affected.</p> <p>How? Here's a visual example of what happens when images aren't optimized for mobile (first) versus when images are optimized for mobile (second):</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/email-not-optimized-for-mobile.png?width=300&amp;name=email-not-optimized-for-mobile.png\" alt=\"email-not-optimized-for-mobile.png\" width=\"300\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/email-optimized-for-mobile.png?width=300&amp;name=email-optimized-for-mobile.png\" alt=\"email-optimized-for-mobile.png\" width=\"300\" title=\"email-optimized-for-mobile.png\" style=\"width: 300px; height: 628px;\" /></img></p> <p>Isn't the second image a much better user experience?</p> <p>Here are a few ways to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/optimize-email-mobile-list\">optimize your emails for mobile devices</a>:</p> \n <ul> \n  <li><strong>Reduce your images' file sizes</strong> to make up for mobile devices' generally slower download speeds. (HubSpot customers don't need to worry about it -- images uploaded to HubSpot's software are automatically compressed. Otherwise, tools like <a href=\"https://tinypng.com/\">TinyPNG</a> will help you reduce file size.)</li> \n  <li><strong>Ensure the CTA buttons and links are larger than 45-57 pixels </strong>for the best user experience. Why? <a href=\"http://touchlab.mit.edu/publications/2003_009.pdf\">According to an MIT study</a>, the average size of an adult index finger is 1.6-2 cm, which translates to 45-57 pixels on a mobile device.</li> \n  <li><strong>Invest in responsive email templates.</strong> Creating your own responsive template may be beyond your particular skill set or bandwidth. Sometimes, the most economical solution is to just license or buy email templates from the people who do it best.</li> \n </ul> <p><strong>HubSpot customers:</strong> HubSpot's default email templates are all optimized for mobile using responsive design. To access these templates, create a new email and look for the responsive option in the \"folders\" drop-down in the top left.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/responsive-email-1.png?width=287&amp;height=159&amp;name=responsive-email-1.png\" alt=\"responsive-email-1.png\" width=\"287\" height=\"159\" /></p> <h3>21. Preview and test your emails before sending them.</h3> <p>When you're finally ready to hit \"Send\" on your email, make a habit of double-checking one last time whether your emails look as good as you think they do. If your <a href=\"https://ecommerce-platforms.com/articles/email-marketing-services\">email marketing tool</a> lets you, go ahead and preview what your email looks like in different email clients and devices that are popular with your audience.</p> <p>(<strong>HubSpot customers:</strong> You can preview what your emails look like in 30+ email clients right in the HubSpot Email App, as well as preview what your emails will look like on any device -- including desktop, tablet, or mobile devices. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/customers/how-to-preview-your-emails-in-30-different-inboxes\">Click here to learn how</a>.)</p> <p>You should also send out a test version of your email before you send out the real deal to ensure it's working properly for everyone on your email list. Start incorporating these as final steps in your email review process. (<strong>HubSpot customers:</strong> <a href=\"https://help.hubspot.com/articles/KCS_Article/Email/How-do-I-send-a-test-email\">Learn how to test your emails here</a>.)</p> <h3>22. Don't be afraid to 'clean up' your contact list.</h3> <p>It's tempting to keep every subscriber you win on an email campaign until they personally choose to opt out. But just because they haven't opted out of an email newsletter doesn't mean they're still interested, and subscribers who have become inactive can kill your emails' open and clickthrough rates.</p> <p>To make sure you're only sending emails to the people who want to read them, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/26404/4-tips-to-keep-your-email-list-squeaky-clean.aspx\">clean up your email list</a> so that it excludes recipients who haven't opened a certain amount of emails in the campaign's recent history. This makes sure your emails' open and clickthrough rates reflect only your most interested readers, allowing you to collect more effective data on what is and isn't working in each email you send.</p> <p>On top of that, a good&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zerobounce.net/\">email list cleaning service</a> removes other email addresses that pose a risk to your inbox placement. “Invalid, abuse, and temporary emails will affect your sender reputation, so it’s best to weed them out,” says Liviu Tanase, CEO of ZeroBounce. “Your desire to grow your list is only natural, but you can’t afford to expand it at all costs. Emailing only valid and active addresses allows you to connect with people who care about your brand, and that’s what every email marketer wants,” Tanase adds.</p> <p>(<strong>HubSpot customers:</strong> Lists that add and remove members based on their email behavior are called smart or \"active\" lists. Learn how to create them in <a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/lists-user-guide/how-to-create-a-list-of-your-contacts\">HubSpot Academy</a>.)</p> <h3>23. Monitor each email's performance.</h3> <p>What's working in your email campaign this month might not work quite as well next month, and it's imperative that you check in on your emails' open and clickthrough rates for opportunities to improve your copy (to do this, of course, you'll need a tool to <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/email\">track your email analytics</a>).</p> <p>If after a month of email sends, for instance, you find 10 messages are getting double the engagement as the other 20, analyze them. What did you do differently in the higher performers? Was it the imagery? The subject line? Maybe you have more than one audience segment and one of them just isn't as interested in your current email content.</p> <p>Use your email performance data to run A/B tests that are designed to show you what your email recipients really want out of your newsletters, and steer into the trends that you see to make your email campaigns more desirable.</p> <p>Email marketing can be tough at times -- I'm right there with you. But by sending compelling offers to the right target segments and paying attention to the little details that go into an email, you can increase the opens clicks in your emails and generate more leads.

You'll find out how to write one that gets read, what to include, and browse tons of templates to gain inspiration.</p> \n<p>You can dive straight in, or jump to the section you'd like to read.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<h2>How long should a cover letter be?</h2> \n<p>OK, so you're all fired up and ready to craft the cover letter of the hiring manager's dream. But how do you manage the fine balance between in-depth and overwhelming?</p> \n<p>A good cover letter is long enough to communicate why the recruiter should pick you but not long enough to bore them.</p> \n<p>One page is usually enough to cover everything you'll need to include, without losing the recruiter's attention. Let's go into those items in more detail:</p> \n<h3>Your Name and Address</h3> \n<p>Kick-off your cover letter by adding your name and address to the document.</p> \n<p>This step is pretty self-explanatory, but it allows the recruiter to easily connect your cover letter to your resume (especially if they're being printed).</p> \n<p>Your name and address also make it easier for the recruiter to get in touch with a job offer. And that's the aim of our letter, right?</p> \n<h3>Their Name and Address</h3> \n<p>Similarly, you should add the name and address of the company or person you're writing to.</p> \n<p>This shows you've done your research and allows the hiring manager to receive your letter if it's sent to a generic company email address.</p> \n<h3>The Date of Writing</h3> \n<p>Make it easier for the hiring manager to file your application by including the date on your cover letter.</p> \n<p>Even if you're not successful this time around, the company might store your letter and refer back to it when they're hiring for another position.</p> \n<h3>Why You're Writing the Letter</h3> \n<p>We know that the aim of a cover letter is to persuade the hiring manager you're the best fit for their job.</p> \n<p>Before you get to the good stuff, be sure to highlight the role you're applying for, as that can get lost.</p> \n<p>Something like this will usually do the trick:</p> \n<p><em>\"I'm writing to discuss the content strategist role at HubSpot.\"</em></p> \n<h3>Why You're a Perfect Fit for the Job</h3> \n<p>The next section of a cover letter structure is the fun part. It's where you'll convince the hiring manager they should hire you.</p> \n<p>In this section, answer these questions:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Why should this company hire you?</li> \n <li>What skills do you have that will help complete the job better than anyone else?</li> \n <li>What makes you a good employee?</li> \n <li>What qualifications do you have that are relevant to the role?</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Once you've answered these, the recruiter will have a solid understanding of who you are, and (hopefully) be convinced to bring you on for an interview.</p> \n<h3>What You Can Offer the Company</h3> \n<p>Have you ever heard the advice to \"always sell yourself in a job application\"? That concept can be applied to cover letters as well.</p> \n<p>Businesses measure success in terms of results. The company looking for a new employee will want to know what they bring to the table and how you fit into their business goals. New candidates are rarely brought on board solely for the<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/soft-skills\"> </a><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/soft-skills?_ga=2.185839593.1527963336.1644028103-1253290474.1644028103\">soft skills listed in their resume</a>.</p> \n<p>That's why this part of your cover letter structure is arguably the most important.</p> \n<p>In two paragraphs or less, show the business what you can do — and provide examples of how you've done it before.</p> \n<p>Not only does this give you the opportunity to show off your skills, but the company can picture the success you'll bring to their business by hiring you.</p> \n<h3>Your Availability</h3> \n<p>In the marketing world, we're always told the importance a call-to-action can make.</p> \n<p>Great cover letters end with a brief section on the candidate's earliest start date.</p> \n<h2>How to Format a Cover Letter</h2> \n<h3>How to Address a Cover Letter</h3> \n<p>Earlier, we mentioned the importance of addressing the hiring manager by their name and address. This proves you've done your research and ensures the cover letter lands in the right place.</p> \n<p>Personalized letters will always outperform generic ones, so including the first name of the recruiter can go a long way.</p> \n<p>But in a world where privacy is held close to our chest, you might need to do a bit of digging before finding the hiring manager's name.</p> \n<p>Luckily, you can use the power of the internet to do this.</p> \n<h4><strong>How to Find a Hiring Manager's Name</strong></h4> \n<p>Head over to LinkedIn and find the company's profile page.</p> \n<p>You can do this by entering their name into the search bar or searching for a link to their LinkedIn page on their company website.</p> \n<p>Then, click the number of employees to see all employees who are on LinkedIn:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"how to look up employer details to format cover letter\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/The%20Ultimate%20Guide%20to%20Writing%20a%20Cover%20Letter.jpeg?width=600&amp;name=The%20Ultimate%20Guide%20to%20Writing%20a%20Cover%20Letter.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 600px;\" title=\"\" width=\"600\"></p> \n<p>You'll then see a list of all employees along with their titles. Simply work your way through this list to find the most relevant contact.</p> \n<p>Keep in mind that some employees do not have LinkedIn profiles, so you may not find them using this tactic. If you're unable to track down the hiring manager's name, a simple \"Dear Hiring Manager\" will work.</p> \n<h3>How to Open a Cover Letter</h3> \n<p>After you've addressed the cover letter to the most relevant person, you'll want to:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Introduce yourself.</li> \n <li>List the role you're interested in.</li> \n <li>Explain your interest.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Here's an example:</p> \n<p>\"<em>Dear Hiring Manager, </em></p> \n<p><em>As an avid reader of the HubSpot Blog for the past five years, I am thrilled to submit my application for the content strategist role. I believe that my five years of experience working for B2B SaaS companies have equipped me with the skills needed to thrive in this role.\"</em></p> \n<p>In the next two paragraphs, highlight your relevant experience and include key details from each role.</p> \n<h3>How to Close a Cover Letter</h3> \n<p>Once you've covered</p> \n<p>Here are some great options:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Looking forward to hearing from you</li> \n <li>Sincerely</li> \n <li>Best Regards</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Then, sign the cover letter with your full name.</p> \n<h3>Should you include salary requirements?</h3> \n<p>The cover letter should focus on why you are a good fit for the role. Discussing salary requirements doesn’t fit at this stage of your application.</p> \n<p>Instead, it’s best to wait until you speak to a recruiter or someone from HR to discuss your expectations.</p> \n<h2>Are cover letters necessary?</h2> \n<p>Today, in many industries, cover letters are listed as optional. The question is, should you include one if it's optional?</p> \n<p>The answer isn’t exactly clear-cut.</p> \n<p>Some research would suggest that cover letters may not hold the same weight as they once did. However, a cover letter can help you stand out among the competition.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Are cover letters necessary job seekers believe getting a job will be harder than in previous years\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/The%20Ultimate%20Guide%20to%20Writing%20a%20Cover%20Letter-1.jpeg?width=500&amp;name=The%20Ultimate%20Guide%20to%20Writing%20a%20Cover%20Letter-1.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 500px;\" title=\"\" width=\"500\"></p> \n<p>In a 2021 Job Seeker Nation Report by JobVite, <a href=\"https://www.jobvite.com/lp/2021-job-seeker-nation-report/\">69% of surveyed workers</a> believed getting a job will be much harder or somewhat harder than in previous years.

If there's an option to upload one when applying for any job, do it — even if it's not required.</p> \n<h2>How to Write a Cover Letter</h2> \n<p>Writing a cover letter can be tricky. Even the best writers can struggle with communicating their skills in the right manner, but these tips will help you create a job-winning document.</p> \n<p>The structure of your cover letter is arguably the most important thing about writing one.</p> \n<p>Not only does a good structure help you to organize your points effectively, but it can help a hiring manager to quickly review the details you're sharing.</p> \n<h5 style=\"color: #666666; font-size: 18px;\"><span style=\"color: #425b76; font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;\">Featured Resource:<a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/cover-letter-templates?hubs_post-cta=header\"> </a><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/cover-letter-templates?hubs_post-cta=header\">5 Free Cover Letter Templates</a></span></h5> \n<p><img alt=\"Cover-Letter-Templates\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/The%20Ultimate%20Guide%20to%20Writing%20a%20Cover%20Letter.png?width=250&amp;name=The%20Ultimate%20Guide%20to%20Writing%20a%20Cover%20Letter.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 250px;\" title=\"\" width=\"250\"></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/cover-letter-templates?hubs_post-cta=imagebottom\">Download these free cover letter templates</a> to write a stand-out cover letter.</p> \n<h2>7 Tips for Writing Great Cover Letters</h2> \n<p>So, you've crafted a cover letter and you're almost ready to hit send.</p> \n<p>Before attaching to your resume and hoping for the best, use these seven tips to make sure your cover letter is as great as can be.</p> \n<h3>1. Keep it succinct.</h3> \n<p>Earlier, we mentioned how the best cover letters strike the perfect balance in their length.</p> \n<p>Our best tip for writing cover letters is to avoid adding fluff that fails to add value. Every line should highlight why you're the best fit for the role.</p> \n<p>In addition, cut the jargon and corporate-speak that hiring managers have heard before.</p> \n<p>Yes, professionalism is important, but be harsh and critical when editing your cover letter. If a sentence doesn't add value, get rid of it.</p> \n<h3>2. Tailor it for the company and position you're applying for.</h3> \n<p>The one-size-fits-all approach doesn't fit well with cover letters.</p> \n<p>You're applying for different roles at various companies, but don't let a change in name and address be the only updates you make.</p> \n<p>Remember that a cover letter should explain why you should be hired for a specific role instead of anyone else. It's highly unlikely that multiple companies will hire for exactly the same position, so take some time to personalize your cover letter for every position you're applying for.</p> \n<h3>3. Don't repeat what's on your resume.</h3> \n<p>Although cover letters are submitted along with resumes, be wary of making them carbon copies of one another.</p> \n<p>Instead, use the documents to compliment each other by:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Including new skills.</li> \n <li>Elaborating on how your qualifications would help you in the role.</li> \n <li>Sharing how specific experience gives you an advantage over other candidates.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>If you need to include the same thing in both documents, add \"as listed in my resume …\" rather than copy and pasting the same content.</p> \n<h3>4. Include data-backed examples.</h3> \n<p>When referencing experience from your resume, use your cover letter as an opportunity to explain in detail — with examples.</p> \n<p>Examples allow the company to picture the success you could bring if they hired you, rather than the person next in their resume pile. But, data-backed examples give an extra edge.</p> \n<p>Let's use an example. Which of these options is more impressive?</p> \n<ol start=\"1\"> \n <li>I increased leads for the company.</li> \n <li>I increased leads by 35% in one month through a single blog post, which became the company's highest lead driver.</li> \n</ol> \n<p>It's option B, right? That's because it's descriptive and shows results.</p> \n<h3>5. Tell a story.</h3> \n<p>Following on from the previous step, you could elaborate on your data-backed examples by telling a story.</p> \n<p>Storytelling helps with relatability and gives a hint of your personality in a cover letter. It also makes the recruiter remember your cover letter amongst a sea of other one-page documents in their review pile.</p> \n<p>However, this cover letter tip comes with a warning: Don't overdo it and make sure it's relevant.</p> \n<h3>6. Get a second pair of eyes on it.</h3> \n<p>Even the best writers make mistakes, but they can leave a negative first impression.</p> \n<p>That's why our sixth cover letter tip is to get a second pair of eyes on it.</p> \n<p>Email it to a friend or ask a family member to glance over it before you hit \"send.\" Ask them to highlight any spelling mistakes or suggestions to improve how you're communicating with the person reading it.</p> \n<p>You never get a second chance to make a first impression. Seeing as though a cover letter is one of the first documents a recruiter sees, try to make it perfect.</p> \n<h3>7. Be unique.</h3> \n<p>Finally, make your cover letter unique.</p> \n<p>If you're applying for a creative role, experiment with colors, subheadings, and layouts.</p> \n<p>If you're applying for more of a traditional role, be wary. Not everyone is a fan of bright, bold cover letters, but you can scope your limits by getting a feel of their company culture.</p> \n<p>Are they strict and professional, or does the company like to have fun?

Below, we’re covering the top reasons why brands lose followers on Instagram and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/gain-instagram-followers\">how to regain them</a>.</p> \n<h2>Why am I losing so many followers on Instagram?</h2> \n<h3>1. You’re not posting often enough or posting too much.</h3> \n<p>When <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/hubspot-blog-social-media-marketing-report\">we surveyed Instagram marketers</a>, 40% said that not posting enough is the number one reason why brands lose followers.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, 33% said posting too much can have the same impact.</p> \n<p>When it comes to posting, it’s all about striking the right balance. You want to post enough to make sure you’re reaching your target audience and not disappearing in a sea of posts.</p> \n<p>However, you don’t want to post too much that your audience is getting flooded with your posts all over their timeline.</p> \n<p>Here are a few guidelines: First, post at least once a day on the platform – whether it’s on Instagram Stories, Reels, or in-feed. If you have to choose, Stories is probably the best option as marketers surveyed say it’s the second-best way to gain followers behind going live.</p> \n<p>Second, share an in-feed post two to three times a week. You can increase this cadence based on how your audience responds but you probably shouldn’t lower it.</p> \n<h3>2. You’re being too sales-y.</h3> \n<p>The second most popular reason why your brand is losing followers is that your content is too focused on selling, according to 39% of Instagram marketers surveyed.</p> \n<p>Our survey found that content centered around a brand’s products/services is leveraged by 39% of IG marketers and has the second-highest ROI.</p> \n<p>However, if it’s the only type of content you post, you might alienate your audience.</p> \n<p>Again, balance is the keyword here.</p> \n<p>In addition to posts that highlight your products and/or services, you should also post content that:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Reflects your brand values.</li> \n <li>Invites conversation.</li> \n <li>Builds community.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Another effective content strategy? Make your audience laugh.</p> \n<p>Our survey revealed that funny content is the most effective for getting followers, shares, and engagement on Instagram.</p> \n<h3>3. You had bot followers.</h3> \n<p>If you <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/buy-instagram-followers\">purchased bot followers</a>, you’ll be in for a rude awakening when they all disappear and your follower list tanks.</p> \n<p>39% of Instagram marketers surveyed say this is the third most popular reason why brands lose followers.</p> \n<p>While it’s tempting to buy bots to give the semblance of a strong follower base, this practice will only hurt you in the long run.</p> \n<p>Instead, focus on building a follower list organically through a consistent posting schedule, sharing valuable content, following trends, and listening to your data.</p> \n<p>It doesn’t have to take long either. Only 1% of marketers we surveyed say it took over a year to grow their followers by 1K. Most marketers (65%) said it took anywhere from one to six months.</p> \n<p>And 13% actually did it in less than a month.</p> \n<p>This is all to say that see this loss in followers as an opportunity to rebuild your Instagram page and get more reliable data on your audience.</p> \n<div>\n <iframe style=\"border: none; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\" src=\"https://listen.hubspot.com/embed/v2/smallPlayer/d40176e3\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe>  \n</div> \n<h3>4. You don’t have a consistent aesthetic and voice.</h3> \n<p>One thing audiences love is consistency.</p> \n<p>Consistency in your branding and your creative assets is key in building strong brand recognition. In addition, consistency also helps build a visually appealing profile.</p> \n<p>If a user visits your profile and every post looks like it was created by a different brand, they’ll have a hard time understanding what your brand is all about and choose to unfollow you.</p> \n<p>Personally, if I’m scrolling and I notice a brand I don’t recognize on my timeline, I’ll visit their profile and if I don’t recognize their last few posts, I’ll likely unfollow them. I imagine many users behave the same way.</p> \n<p>With this in mind, figure out what your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/agency/develop-brand-identity\">brand identity </a>and visual aesthetic are early on in your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/branding\">branding</a> process.</p> \n<p>From there, you can leverage tools like Canva to build a visual profile that stays consistent across all platforms.</p> \n<h3>5. Your audience has evolved and you’re not keeping up.</h3> \n<p>It would be so easy to market to our audiences if their interests and behaviors always stayed the same.</p> \n<p>Unfortunately, that isn’t the case.</p> \n<p>This requires marketers to stay on top of what attracts and retains their audiences. One of the most effective ways to do this is by relying on your data. What is it telling you?</p> \n<p>Say you’re HubSpot and our feed consists of customer success stories, product highlights, company values, and industry trends.</p> \n<p>Perhaps content surrounding industry trends used to perform very well but you’ve noticed a slow decline over the past six months. Perhaps your audience is not as interested in this content or the format in which it’s being presented.</p> \n<p>Maybe if you used to leverage images, you should consider switching to video.</p> \n<p>Your Instagram strategy should be steered by what your data is telling you. If you don’t use it, you will quickly lose touch with your audience and slowly see your follower list decrease.</p> \n<p>Losing Instagram followers can be a scary reality to face. However, once you identify the reason behind the decline, you can address it and regain them.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=b1268983-9da6-4d67-9d3a-cfef2d9f3cff&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"Improve your website with effective technical SEO.

Personally, I like to visualize the funnel as that big scary slide you wanted to try as a kid. You saw your friends whizzing down, which sparked your interest. You watched how much fun they were having, doing your research. And then the benefits of having fun outweighed your fear, so you climbed up and flew down.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Customers take a similar journey through your company's conversion funnel when evaluating whether or not to buy from you. You have to pique their interest, build trust, and encourage them to take action.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=12501f7c-8e26-4e3c-9642-7afbe078156a&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Download Now: Free Customer Journey Map Templates\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/12501f7c-8e26-4e3c-9642-7afbe078156a.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<p>In this post, I'll explain what conversion funnels are and how they impact your customer journey. Then, you'll learn how to optimize your funnel to increase the number of people who make it to your conversion point at the bottom.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>All leads begin at the top of the funnel. As they learn more about your business, they move down and get closer to purchasing your product or service. This conversion process is called a funnel because companies often have more leads than they do customers, making the top of the funnel a larger pool of people than the bottom.</p> \n<p>Understanding how people flow through your conversion funnel is essential to being an effective marketer or salesperson because it helps you engage leads, answer questions about your business, and address concerns. It also lets you organize leads into categories and create <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-touchpoints\">customer touchpoints</a> that can entice each group to convert.</p> \n<p>That's why every funnel should be designed for how your customers buy, not how you sell. The focus is on providing such a great experience within the customer journey that you convince them to convert.</p> \n<p>Before diving into the details of how to analyze and optimize your funnel, we need to talk about an important aspect of this process: the customer journey.</p> \n<h3>Customer Journey</h3> \n<p>The customer journey complements the conversion funnel, but it's not the same thing. Unlike the generalized, linear conversion funnel, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-journey-map\">customer journey maps</a> show the individual and circuitous paths people take from the moment they discover your brand to the time they make a purchase.</p> \n<p>Let's say you're a food blogger who sells cookbooks. Here's how your customers' journeys can differ.</p> \n<ul> \n <li> <p><strong>Customer A</strong> sees and clicks on your banner ad, visits your blog, reads an article, signs up for your newsletter, gets a discount email, and purchases a cookbook.</p> </li> \n <li> <p><strong>Customer B</strong> sees your cookbook in a bookshop, buys it, makes the recipes, visits your blog, and subscribes to your newsletter.</p> </li> \n</ul> \n<p>The outcomes for Customer A and B are essentially the same, but the journeys and touchpoints are different. So if you know the different ways people enter your funnel, you can optimize for those entry points. That way, you can meet potential buyers where they are and entice them to convert.</p> \n<p>That said, most funnels have similar points that ultimately lead to conversion. Let’s take a closer look at each stage of this process.</p> \n<h2>Conversion Funnel Stages</h2> \n<p>The top-middle-bottom funnel is a classic model used by sales teams, which focuses on sparking interest, informing potential customers, convincing them to purchase, and building loyalty so they become repeat buyers.</p> \n<p>Traditional Conversion Funnel Stages</p> \n<ul> \n <li> <p><strong>Top of the funnel (TOFU)</strong>: This is the awareness phase. A potential customer enters the TOFU when they engage with your brand, oftentimes through your website, an ad, an email, or social media.</p> </li> \n <li> <p><strong>Middle of the funnel (MOFU)</strong>: This is the consideration phase. The potential customer knows about your brand and engages with it in order to learn more. They may sign up for your email newsletter, follow you on social media, or download guides and templates.</p> </li> \n <li> <p><strong>Bottom of the funnel (BOFU)</strong>: This is the conversion phase. A prospect is here right before they purchase, which means you've given them good information and relevant touchpoints. Help them convert by making it easy to purchase, offering a trial, outlining pricing, or sending a discount for their abandoned shopping cart.</p> </li> \n</ul> \n<p>Let’s see what this looks like visually in the examples below.</p> \n<h3>Conversion Funnel Examples</h3> \n<p>HubSpot started off with the traditional conversion funnel structure, using marketing efforts to serve as the top of the funnel. Those leads were then passed further down the funnel to the sales team.</p> \n<p>While some conversion funnels are simple, others can be incredibly complex. There are several conversion models you can use to suit your business needs, ranging from a simple three-stage funnel for smaller operations to complex, multi-stage sales funnels for enterprise-level companies. Let’s explore some of the most common models.</p> \n<h4>Three-Stage Marketing Funnel</h4> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Basic%20Funnel.jpg?width=650&amp;name=Basic%20Funnel.jpg\" alt=\"Conversion funnel example basic\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" width=\"650\"></p> \n<ul> \n <li> <p><strong>Awareness</strong>: Get visitors to your website. Attract them with quality blog posts or through social media.</p> </li> \n <li> <p><strong>Consideration</strong>: Use that great content to entice your new visitors to sign up for your newsletter.</p> </li> \n <li> <p><strong>Conversion</strong>: Now that prospects are familiar with your brand, persuade them to make a purchase by offering a discount code for first-time buyers.</p> </li> \n</ul> \n<h4>AIDA Funnel</h4> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/AIDA%20Funnel.jpg?width=650&amp;name=AIDA%20Funnel.jpg\" alt=\"Conversion funnel example AIDA\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" width=\"650\">Sometimes called a “purchase funnel,” the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/aida-model\">AIDA model</a> expands on the basic three-stage structure.</p> \n<ul> \n <li> <p><strong>Attention</strong>: In addition to blog posts and social media, you can use targeted ads to draw visitors to your website.</p> </li> \n <li> <p><strong>Interest</strong>: Pique the prospect’s interest in your product by showcasing the goods. Use case studies to show how your product has helped other businesses. Have notable press mentions? You’ll want to showcase those as well.</p> </li> \n <li> <p><strong>Desire</strong>: Your prospects like you, now you must make them want you. Gain their trust and create an emotional connection. Continue to serve them content that helps them visualize how your product would fit into their lives and why they need it.</p> </li> \n <li> <p><strong>Action</strong>: Now’s your chance to get them to convert. One way is to offer a free ebook, trial, or tool that’s only accessible if they fill out a form with their contact information. If your goal is to get them to purchase a product, you could give them a promotional offer to persuade them to buy.</p> </li> \n</ul> \n<p>The detail of your funnel depends on your sales process — the longer your sales cycle, the more complex your funnel. If you have a short sales cycle, your funnel tends to be simpler.</p> \n<p>Think about how long it takes to sell $2,000 B2B software versus a $20 t-shirt. The software purchase usually requires months of sales calls, marketing materials, FAQs, and demos. Each of those is a specific point in your conversion funnel. But potential buyers may only need five minutes to figure out that the t-shirt is the right color and fit before purchasing. The touchpoints required here are taking it off the rack and trying it on.</p> \n<p>To figure out how complex your funnel is, you can look at the data and perform an analysis. This will help you flush out each part of your customer journey to create a unique visual representation of your funnel.</p> \n<h2>Conversion Funnel Analysis</h2> \n<p>Funnels are full of barriers and friction. Analyzing your funnel helps you visualize the flow of potential customers across each point.</p> \n<p>You can see key traffic sources and high-exit pages to get a feel for how people end up in each stage of the funnel.</p> \n<p>It's also a way to discover barriers that cause people to leave a page before they convert. If you see a high drop-off rate on one page, for example, you'll know to prioritize that as you work toward optimizing your funnel.</p> \n<p>To understand your funnel, follow these steps for in-depth analysis:</p> \n<h3>1. Look for high-traffic pages with high drop-off and conversion rates.</h3> \n<p>High-traffic pages hold a plethora of useful information. Not only are these the pages people see the most, but they're also where people decide to stay or go. Look at the pages where people drop off (aka leave) and where they convert (take your intended action). Some metrics to collect are:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/cost-per-acquisition\">Cost Per Acquisition</a> (CPA)</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/how-to-calculate-customer-lifetime-value\">Customer Lifetime Value</a> (CLV)</li> \n <li>Drop-Off Rate</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-increase-conversion-rate\">Conversion Rate</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/definition-marketing-qualified-lead-mql-under-100-sr\">Number of Marketing Qualified Leads</a> (MQLs)</li> \n <li>MQLs to Customer Conversion Rate</li> \n <li>Conversion Rate Per Channel (i.e., social, email, and paid search)</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>2. Discover where your best customers come from.</h3> \n<p>Not all leads are the same. Some people drop off near the top of the funnel while others make it all the way down. That's why tracking leads is so important. When you know where your high-quality leads come from, you can analyze that touchpoint or channel to see what you're doing right. Ask yourself:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>How is this touchpoint different from other touchpoints?</li> \n <li>What information is resonating with people?</li> \n <li>What are the barriers or friction (if any)?</li> \n <li>How many steps do people have to go through before converting?</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Identifying what you're doing right in your funnel is just as important as figuring out what you're doing wrong.

Create an optimization plan.</h3> \n<p>After you figure out where people are dropping off and converting, it's time to make an optimization plan. This should include the goals you want to focus on (i.e., more leads, newsletter signups, demos, or software purchases).</p> \n<p>Goals let you determine what you want from each touchpoint within your funnel so you can measure whether it's working or not.</p> \n<p>After your funnel analysis, you'll have a list of priority touchpoints that need to be optimized. Make sure to focus on the areas with the biggest drop-off rates first.</p> \n<h2>Conversion Funnel Optimization</h2> \n<p>Every part of your conversion funnel can be optimized to increase the number of people who turn into customers. Think of conversation funnel optimization as finding out what motivates, blocks, and persuades people so you can give them the best experience possible on their unique journey.</p> \n<p>To optimize effectively, you need to think about how to give each customer what they want at each phase of the funnel. Using the phases outlined above, here's what to consider at each step along the customer journey.</p> \n<h3>1. TOFU: Awareness</h3> \n<p>Issues at the top of your funnel? Take a look at how you attract new leads. Compare every channel that brings in customers (i.e., social media, search engines, your blog, and paid ads) to see which attracts the most people.</p> \n<p>If you're unsure how customers found you, send out a survey to ask. Look for trends in how people find new brands and put more effort into your best channels. Just make sure you're attracting the people in your target audience.</p> \n<h3>2. MOFU: Consideration</h3> \n<p>Potential customers made it to the middle of your funnel, but it's your job to keep them moving toward the bottom.</p> \n<p>If you're having trouble with this phase, look at how people learn about your business and engage with your site. Is it easy for people to navigate your site? Or sign up for your email list? Do you have relevant, rich content? Do you offer pricing and product information? Is it easy to get questions answered?</p> \n<p>Depending on your barriers, consider these ideas for improvement:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Product videos and photos</li> \n <li>FAQ page</li> \n <li>Whitepapers, case studies, or blog posts</li> \n <li>Filters and search options</li> \n <li>Newsletter capture</li> \n <li>Discounts</li> \n <li>Check pages for loading speed and broken elements</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>3. BOFU: Conversion</h3> \n<p>As the final stop for potential buyers, this is the phase to turn them into customers. You should remove as much friction as possible and encourage people to take the final steps to convert.</p> \n<p>Some ways to optimize this final part of your funnel is to make sure product or service pages are fully built out with interesting descriptions, videos, and photos. Consider your checkout process to see if people have issues with payments or abandoned carts. Make it simple for people to compare pricing and clearly outline all product features. You can also send specific BOFU emails or create ads to remind people of their desire to convert.</p> \n<p>Think your job is done once a customer converts? Wrong. While you may have pulled a customer through your conversion funnel, there are plenty of opportunities to re-engage them. Not only is <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/customer-satisfaction?\">customer retention</a> essential for growing your business, but it's <a href=\"https://www.outboundengine.com/blog/customer-retention-marketing-vs-customer-acquisition-marketing/\">five times more expensive</a> to acquire a new customer than to retain a current customer.</p> \n<p>So, once your customers make it through the funnel, invite them to sign up for a new webinar series, download additional templates, send promotions, join a loyalty club, or follow you on social media.</p> \n<h2>Conversion Funnels Shouldn’t Be Business Models</h2> \n<p>While conversion funnels are very effective for demonstrating the customer journey for a one-time purchase, they are not a substitute for creating a holistic business model. Relying on a funnel as your business model creates a lack of alignment between each stage of the customer experience.</p> \n<p>HubSpot transitioned to thinking of the customer journey as less of a funnel and more of a <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/flywheel?\">flywheel</a> — building more momentum as customers move through it.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-embed-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0px; max-width: 560px; max-height: 316.089px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;\">\n <div class=\"hs-embed-content-wrapper\">\n  <div style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.5%; margin: 0px;\">\n   <iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_aA_Slv9oC0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen style=\"position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div> \n<p>With the flywheel model, the momentum of your happy customers is used to drive referrals and repeat sales. It’s not a linear beginning and end, but rather a continuous cycle that allows you to generate more business.</p> \n<h2>Tailor Your Funnel to the Customer</h2> \n<p>While the customer journey is more complex than my slide analogy, understanding how conversion funnels work can improve this flow. It can help you optimize your funnel, attract more leads, convert them to customers, and boost your bottom line. But all that requires reducing as much friction as possible.</p> \n<p>Find what makes sense for your particular sales cycle and use your existing content and channels to stay in touch. Make sure customers value your business and want to come back because you never know who they'll introduce to the top of that funnel.</p> \n<p><em>This article was originally published May 5, 2021, and has been updated for </em>comprehensiveness<em>.</em></p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=dfcc1cf6-fca7-455f-9c43-26ff2fba10ed&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"Apply for a job, keep track of important information, and prepare for an  interview with the help of this free job seekers kit.\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/dfcc1cf6-fca7-455f-9c43-26ff2fba10ed.png\"></a></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fconversion-funnel&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 24 Feb 2022 12:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/12501f7c-8e26-4e3c-9642-7afbe078156a.png","linkMd5":"83e04b24e363b27bf4e6bba7237d86b4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn27@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-26-48-382_29667f68bce7df45.webp","destWidth":494,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":3880,"destBytes":7698,"author":"Katrina Kirsch","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/12501f7c-8e26-4e3c-9642-7afbe078156a.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn27@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-26-48-382_29667f68bce7df45.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Basic%20Funnel.jpg?width=650&name=Basic%20Funnel.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn63@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-26-55-850_7733d454dae1373d.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/AIDA%20Funnel.jpg?width=650&name=AIDA%20Funnel.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn8@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-26-50-158_6acde0ddef916607.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/dfcc1cf6-fca7-455f-9c43-26ff2fba10ed.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn38@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-26-54-869_a6a20c230b966a35.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fconversion-funnel&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn3@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-26-55-870_a4b1fa676610a4d6.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647246408224},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:26:48","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:26:48","title":"How to Manage YouTube Comments","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/youtube-comments","description":"<p>The YouTube section can be a fun place to engage your audience and continue the conversation.

It will stay in the review tab for up to 60 days</li> \n <li><strong>Hold some comments for review – </strong>If some comments are flagged as potentially inappropriate by YouTube’s system, they will be hidden and held for review. You can also create a blocked words list that will hold comments containing or closely matching these terms.</li> \n <li><strong>Turn off comments – </strong>This prevents any user from leaving comments under your video.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>When you start a channel on YouTube, the default comment setting is to hold inappropriate comments for review and allow all other comments to show immediately under the video.</p> \n<p>If you had changed your settings and now want videos on your channel to display comments, you can do so by following these steps:</p> \n<ol start=\"1\"> \n <li> <h3>Access your Studio dashboard and click on \"Settings.\"</h3> <img alt=\"how to turn on comments on YouTube step 1\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Manage%20YouTube%20Comments.jpeg?width=250&amp;name=How%20to%20Manage%20YouTube%20Comments.jpeg\" title=\"\" width=\"250\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 250px;\"></li> \n <li> <h3>Select \"Upload defaults.\"</h3> <img alt=\"how to turn on comments on YouTube step 2\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Manage%20YouTube%20Comments-Feb-03-2022-05-25-26-74-AM.jpeg?width=250&amp;name=How%20to%20Manage%20YouTube%20Comments-Feb-03-2022-05-25-26-74-AM.jpeg\" title=\"\" width=\"250\" style=\"width: 250px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></li> \n <li> <h3>Navigate to the \"Advanced Settings\" tab.</h3> <img alt=\"how to turn on comments on YouTube step 3\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Manage%20YouTube%20Comments-1.jpeg?width=450&amp;name=How%20to%20Manage%20YouTube%20Comments-1.jpeg\" title=\"\" width=\"450\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 450px;\"></li> \n <li> <h3>Scroll down to the \"Comments\" section and select \"Allow all comments.\"</h3> <img alt=\"how to turn on comments on YouTube step 4\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Manage%20YouTube%20Comments-3.jpeg?width=450&amp;name=How%20to%20Manage%20YouTube%20Comments-3.jpeg\" title=\"\" width=\"450\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 450px;\"></li> \n <li> <h3>Scroll down to the \"Comments\" section.</h3> </li> \n</ol> \n<p><img alt=\"how to turn on comments on YouTube step 5\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Manage%20YouTube%20Comments.png?width=303&amp;name=How%20to%20Manage%20YouTube%20Comments.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; width: 303px; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" title=\"\" width=\"303\"></p> \n<h2>How to Delete YouTube Comments</h2> \n<p>When it comes to deleting YouTube comments, the rule of thumb is to use it with intention.</p> \n<p>It’s not sustainable or effective to delete every comment your brand disagrees with.</p> \n<p>You might ask, \"<em>Well, what if a comment says something false or damaging about our brand?</em>\" In this case, responding to the comment may be a more effective strategy.

If your connection is slow and unreliable, the comment section may not load properly.</p> \n<p>Another reason why your comments may not load is if you’re using a different viewport. While on the web app, YouTube comments load automatically when you scroll, on the mobile app, you must tap to see the comments section.</p> \n<p>Lastly, certain browser extensions may affect how elements load on a page.

Whether we call it a \"press release,\" a \"press statement,\" a \"news release,\" or a \"media release,\" we're always talking about the same basic thing.</p> \n<p>While the heading should contain action verbs, the first paragraph should answer the \"who,\" \"what,\" \"why,\" and \"where.\" The press release should also contain understandable language and a quote.</p> \n<p>Most press releases are succinct at just a page long – two pages tops. Ultimately, companies want to provide enough information so that news outlets have sufficient material for publishing their own stories about whatever the company is announcing in the release.</p> \n<p>One thing to remember is that press releases live in the public domain, which means your stakeholders and customers can see them.</p> \n<p>So, instead of thinking of a press release solely as a ticket to earning news coverage, consider it as a valuable piece of marketing content.</p> \n<a></a> \n<p>While there's no cut-and-dried formula for what a press release should include, here are a few types of occasions to help you carve out a focus for your press release and determine what content would help you broadcast your news in the best way:</p> \n<p></p> \n<h3>Product Launches</h3> \n<p>The product launch type of press release is valuable to get the word out about the new solutions your organization is offering to consumers.</p> \n<p>It should emphasize the product's specs, pricing, availability, and any other details that may be valuable to consumers.</p> \n<h3>Mergers and Acquisitions</h3> \n<p>Organizational change is noteworthy enough to warrant a press release, especially for informing current and future stakeholders about the growth and trajectory of a company.</p> \n<p>To announce an acquisition or merger, include details about all organizations involved, information about the merger or acquisition, and quotes from the leadership teams.</p> \n<h3>Product Updates</h3> \n<p>Similar to a new product launch, product updates and expansions are also ripe for promotion. Explain what the change is, why it was made, and how it benefits the user.</p> \n<h3>Events</h3> \n<p>Press releases are an important component of event marketing to attract promotion from news outlets and other media sources.</p> \n<p>You'll want to include:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>What the event is about</li> \n <li>Who should consider attending</li> \n <li>When and where it will be held</li> \n <li>Pricing</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Grand Openings</h3> \n<p>Whether you opened up a new office, relocated, or are opening for the first time, announce the details with a grand opening press release.</p> \n<p>Announce the date and location the grand opening will be held, who is involved, how the grand opening is being celebrated, and the reason for the move (if applicable).</p> \n<h3>New Partnerships</h3> \n<p>Similar to mergers and acquisitions, a press release announcing new partnerships is a mutually beneficial marketing tactic.</p> \n<p>To effectively execute this type of release, be sure to write a summary about each company, why the partnership was created, who benefits, and any additional important details for current and future stakeholders.</p> \n<h3>Rebranding</h3> \n<p>Rebranding is a difficult thing for any business to do, and it can occasionally result in confusion and awkwardness.</p> \n<p>One way to make the transition smoother is by announcing the rebrand with a press release, including details on what is changing, the reason for making the change, dates the changes go into effect, and quotes from the leadership team.</p> \n<h3>Executive Team Changes</h3> \n<p>Executives often serve as faces of the company, and a press release functions to kick off this role.</p> \n<p>It may include biographical information to establish their credibility along with a photo and other pertinent details.</p> \n<h3>Awards</h3> \n<p>When it comes to business excellence, it's OK to brag. Press releases about awards and accomplishments serve to cement your organization as an authority in your space.</p> \n<a></a> \n<p>Such a press release includes information about the company and why they were given the award, information about the award itself, and details about the ceremony (if applicable).</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>When formatting a press release, you want to write it in a newsy, straightforward way so a journalist who might write about it can imagine it as an article on their news site.</p> \n<p>To start, here are the basics every press release should include:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Your contact information located on the top left corner</li> \n <li>The phrase \"For immediate release\" located on the top right</li> \n <li>A headline that quickly explains the announcement</li> \n <li>Your business location in the first sentence of the press release</li> \n <li>A quick bio about your company at the end of your press release.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>You also might want to include \"###\" or another signifier to show the journalist that the release has ended. In the past, this prevented busy journalists from waiting or flipping the page for more information when there was no more news. However, this tradition is<a href=\"https://www.thehalogroup.com/what-does-mean-at-the-end-of-a-press-release/\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.thehalogroup.com/what-does-mean-at-the-end-of-a-press-release/\">still adopted and highly-respected today</a>.</p> \n<p>Now, onto the body of your press release:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Your first paragraph</strong> should state what the announcement while providing some context around your business and what it does.</li> \n <li><strong>The next two to three paragraphs</strong> should include quotes from a company spokesperson or business executive to explain the \"why\" behind this announcement.</li> \n <li><strong>Your last paragraph </strong>should be an \"About Us\" section that explains what your company is and what it offers.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>In this example, Catbrella Inc., a fictitious ad agency that just gained its 10th Twitter follower after two years of paid social media efforts, announces its achievement in a press release.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Sample press release format by HubSpot, with orange markers highlighting five key areas on the press release: headline, 3 paragraphs, about us section\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Write%20a%20Press%20Release%20%5BFree%20Press%20Release%20Template%20+%20Examples%5D.png?width=400&amp;name=How%20to%20Write%20a%20Press%20Release%20%5BFree%20Press%20Release%20Template%20+%20Examples%5D.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 400px;\" title=\"press-release-example-hubspot.png\" width=\"400\" /></p> \n<a></a> \n<p><em>*Disclaimer: HubSpot is entirely responsible for the silliness of this faux announcement.</em></p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Writing a press release to break important company news can help businesses grow better, but doing it right is just as important. Here's how to write a press release, like the one above, step-by-step.</p> \n<h3>1. Write a compelling headline.</h3> \n<p>You've got your announcement in mind, and now it's time to get it down in words to share with your community, industry, and followers.</p> \n<p>Just like<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/a-simple-formula-for-writing-kick-ass-titles-ht\"> </a><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/a-simple-formula-for-writing-kick-ass-titles-ht\">writing the perfect blog post title</a>, setting up your press release for success starts with your headline. You only have one line to work with, which can seem scary, but consider your words carefully to make your headline captivating.</p> \n<p>Here are some tips to make your headline stand out:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Use action verbs.</li> \n <li>Be specific.</li> \n <li>Keep it short.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Most importantly, make it interesting: Keep in mind that reporters get dozens, if not hundreds, of releases each day, so invest the time to write a compelling headline.</p> \n<p>Consumers, on the other hand, see news stories all over their timelines. As such, your headline needs to be interesting enough to reel them in.</p> \n<h3>2. Convey the news value to the press.</h3> \n<p>If you want your press release to be newsworthy, you have to give readers a reason to care.</p> \n<p>A good way to ensure this is by using the reverse pyramid formula when writing your press release: Going from the most important information to the least important.</p> \n<p>While the first paragraph of your release should explain the who, what, where, the second paragraph should cover the why.</p> \n<p>Reporters don't have a ton of time to sift through details and fluffy background information — they just need the facts that'll help them tell your story to someone else from a position of authority.</p> \n<p>There shouldn't be any new, crucial information covered after these sections because the readers could potentially miss them.</p> \n<h3>3. Offer a tempting quote.</h3> \n<p>Once you've set the scene, it's time to bring your details to life with a quote that reporters can use for context around your announcement and help paint a picture of how your news affects the given industry, customer base, and landscape.</p> \n<p>Ideally, quotes will be from key stakeholders in your company including your executive team, project leads, or those directly impacted by your announcement.</p> \n<p>Quoting key figures and authorities underlines the importance of your development. The chosen quote should shape your narrative and emphasize the core of the announcement.</p> \n<p>Don't ask everyone in your office for a comment or feel compelled to quote all 25 people included in the acquisition. Pick one or two critical spokespeople and focus the quotes around their unique perspective.</p> \n<h3>4. Provide valuable background information on the subject.</h3> \n<p>In this last paragraph, keep in mind that the reader should already have key details they need regarding your announcement.</p> \n<p>Offer details here that strengthen your narrative, like creative or noteworthy ways your company developed the project or announcement at hand. Or, when applicable, comment on the future implications of your announcement.</p> \n<p>Another good way to add value to your press release is by using<a href=\"https://blog.justreachout.io/how-to-write-press-release/\"> </a><a href=\"https://blog.justreachout.io/how-to-write-press-release/\">newsjacking</a>. A process of relating your press release to something currently going on to make it more valuable to the journalist and reader.</p> \n<h3>5. Summarize the \"who\" and the \"what\" in a boilerplate.</h3> \n<p>Twitter is chock-full of reporters lamenting press releases or pitches that don't clearly explain what the company does or what the announcement is actually about.</p> \n<p>Describe what your company does in clear, plain language and include a link to your company's website early on.</p> \n<p>If you cite data, include a reference link for the data source, and make sure every name in the release has an associated title and company as well.</p> \n<a></a> \n<p>To keep yourself honest on this front, ask a colleague to read the release without context and ask them to relay the information back to you. If they can't recall the who, what, or why get back to the drawing board.</p> \n<h2>Press Release Template</h2> \n<p>This template includes press release templates based on the type of announcement your company wants to make, whether it's a new product, a partnership, or a change within your organization.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/inbound-press-release-templates?hubs_post-cta=imagebottom&amp;_ga=2.195985199.227620996.1645120963-27426667.1645120963\"><img alt=\"press release template offer from hubspot\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Write%20a%20Press%20Release%20%5BFree%20Press%20Release%20Template%20+%20Examples%5D-1.png?width=350&amp;name=How%20to%20Write%20a%20Press%20Release%20%5BFree%20Press%20Release%20Template%20+%20Examples%5D-1.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 350px;\" title=\"\" width=\"350\" /></a></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/inbound-press-release-templates?hubs_post-cta=imagebottom\">Download This Press Release Template for Free</a></strong></p> \n<a></a> \n<p>This template also offers creative replacements for the traditional press release and a guide on how to create a comprehensive promotional plan.

Five-syllable words you have to look up on Thesaurus.com? Quotes from every executive on the planet that go on for pages? We've seen it all. Unfortunately, so have reporters – and they are <em>not</em> fans.</p> \n<p>Instead of stuffing your next release with industry jargon, take a page out of our book (OK fine, ebook),<a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/newsworthy-guide-to-inbound-public-relations\"> </a><em><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/newsworthy-guide-to-inbound-public-relations\">The Newsworthy Guide to Inbound Public Relations</a></em>, and brainstorm some creative approaches for your next announcement.</p> \n<p>Can you include new data? A remarkable graphic or video? A shareable SlideShare? If so, a creative angle can help carry your content and increase the likelihood of social sharing.</p> \n<p>Now, to get you thinking on the right track, take a look at some creative press release examples below, the type of news each one is reporting on, and what makes the release unique:</p> \n<h3>1. <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/microsoft-to-acquire-activision-blizzard-to-bring-the-joy-and-community-of-gaming-to-everyone-across-every-device-301462759.html\">Microsoft</a></h3> \n<h4><strong>Type of press release: Acquisition</strong></h4> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"snapshot of press release example from microsoft\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Write%20a%20Press%20Release%20%5BFree%20Press%20Release%20Template%20+%20Examples%5D.jpeg?width=500&amp;name=How%20to%20Write%20a%20Press%20Release%20%5BFree%20Press%20Release%20Template%20+%20Examples%5D.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; width: 500px; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" title=\"\" width=\"500\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/microsoft-to-acquire-activision-blizzard-to-bring-the-joy-and-community-of-gaming-to-everyone-across-every-device-301462759.html\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>The first thing that stands out in this press release is the headline.

We use these same guidelines when writing and formatting our releases here at HubSpot, and created a faux, sample release to illustrate what content goes where and why.</p> \n<h2>Tips for Publishing Press Releases</h2> \n<p><em>Writing</em> a press release is really only half the battle. Once you're finished with production, it'll be time to focus on distribution.</p> \n<p>Of course, we're all familiar with the traditional distribution levers we can pull, which include publishing the press release on our website/blog as well as sharing the press release with our followers/subscribers via social media and email.</p> \n<p>To get the maximum amount of distribution possible, here are some tips you can follow.</p> \n<h3>1. Reach out to specific journalists.</h3> \n<p>Instead of blasting a press release out to every journalist you can find an email address for, focus on a few journalists who have experience covering your industry (and company, hopefully) and send them personalized messages.</p> \n<p>Connect the dots. Show why what <em>you</em> wrote connects to what <em>they</em> write.</p> \n<h3>2. Send the release to top journalists the day before.</h3> \n<p>Give journalists some time to craft a story around your press release by sending it to them — under embargo — the day before it officially goes live.</p> \n<p>\"Under embargo\" just means they aren't allowed to share the information in the press release until the time you specify.</p> \n<h3>3. To avoid competition, don't publish your release on the hour.</h3> \n<p>If you're publishing your press release on a distribution service like PR Newswire or Business Wire, avoid publishing it on the hour (e.g., 1 p.m., or 3 p.m., or 5 p.m.).</p> \n<p>The reason? Most companies schedule their releases to go out on the hour, which means if your release goes out on the hour too, it's more likely to get lost in the shuffle.</p> \n<p>Instead, try going with a more distinct time (e.g., 1:12 p.m., or 3:18 p.m., or 5:22 p.m.).</p> \n<h3>4. Share your media coverage.</h3> \n<p>If all goes according to plan, and your press release gets picked up by the media, your job still isn't finished.</p> \n<p>To keep the buzz going, you can release a \"second wave\" of distribution by sharing the specific stories that news outlets write based on your press release.</p> \n<p>You can also share the news on your digital channels, like social media and email, to bring awareness to your announcement.</p> \n<h2>How To Stand Out In The News</h2> \n<p>The key to keeping your PR strategy new school is forgetting preconceived notions of what public relations is and instead focusing on creating highly remarkable content. Traditional press releases can still be really valuable when executed well.</p> \n<p>Instead of ditching releases as a tactic, give them a modern makeover to make them more useful for your marketing.</p> \n<p>Think about how you've used inbound methods to transform your marketing strategies to be more personalized, approachable, and build relationships. Those same principles apply to your PR strategy: Create content to craft your own story and use tactful outreach to get the media familiar with (and excited about) your brand.</p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in November 2019 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=686dd68a-454c-4c09-9fcc-a199380b234c&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px;

Let’s say that you find a magazine that serves your buyer persona. You ask for the media kit, choose the ad dimensions that fit your budget, and then buy the ad for a certain amount of time. Once time runs out, the ad is taken down.</p> \n<p>Real-time bidding takes out all of that work. You can get space on that magazine and hundreds of others by letting a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-dsp\">Demand-Side Platform (DSP)</a> automatically choose the best publishers and ad spaces, then bid on them for you. You set several certain targeting parameters, such as maximum bid price and target audience. These parameters then determine where your ads are placed.</p> \n<p>The publisher accepts your ad only if you place the highest bid. But remember: real-time bidding automatically does all the bidding. You don’t have to take any additional steps.</p> \n<p>Still confused? No worries. We break down the concept further below.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>How does real-time bidding work?</h2> \n<p>There are several pieces involved in the real-time bidding process. Let’s take a look at each one of them one-by-one before putting it all together.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Advertiser:</strong> The advertiser is the company or brand that wants to place an ad online.</li> \n <li><strong>Demand-Side Platform (DSP)</strong>: The Demand-Side Platform is the service advertisers use to launch ad campaigns.</li> \n <li><strong>Publisher</strong>: The publisher is the website or online property that wants to sell ad spaces, often referred to as “ad inventory.”</li> \n <li><strong>Supply-Side Platform (SSP)</strong>: The Supply-Side Platform is the service publishers use to make ad inventory available. SSPs run auctions where ad spaces are instantly purchased by the highest bidder. But this can’t happen unless an ad exchange facilitates the transaction.</li> \n <li><strong>Ad Exchanges:</strong> The ad exchange connects companies who want to advertise and publishers who want to sell ad space. Ad exchanges carry out the bidding transaction automatically in real time by connecting both Demand-Side Platforms and Supply-Side Platforms.</li> \n <li><strong>Impressions</strong>: Impressions refers to the number of times an ad is seen or scrolled past. In the real-time bidding process, advertisers don’t pay for one individual impression, but rather the cost per thousand impressions (CPM).</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Now, let’s put it together. How exactly does real-time bidding work?</p> \n<p>On the advertiser side, marketers use DSPs to set up their ad campaign and track its performance. Publishers, on the other hand, use Supply-Side Platforms (SSPs) to list their ad inventory and the price they charge. They then meet in the middle at the ad exchange, the marketplace where the real-time bidding actually takes place.</p> \n<p>To determine what ad inventory to bid on, advertisers will set targeting parameters. For instance, a brand may only want to target users who are in a specific region or have visited their website recently.</p> \n<p>So, advertisers, or specifically their Demand-Side Platforms, evaluate ad potential in real time and decide whether or not to place a bid and how much to bid.</p> \n<p>Remember, advertisers set their bid through the Demand-Side Platform, while publishers’ Supply-Side Platform either accept or reject the bid. The prices are negotiated on a cost per thousand impressions, so the advertiser isn’t paying based on uptime or even dimensions. Instead, they’re paying for the amount of times, in thousands, that their ad is seen.</p> \n<p>Let’s go through another example of how it works.</p> \n<h3>Real-Time Bidding Example</h3> \n<p>Let's say Silk is a UK-based beauty brand that just launched a new brow line and is running a campaign. They set up their campaign on a Demand-Side Platform (DSP) and are targeting users who regularly shop for makeup products, are located in the Manchester area, and are between 18 to 30 years of age. The brand also wants its ads to only show on sites related to beauty and lifestyle.</p> \n<p>A user visits a publisher's site. The publisher's Supply-Side Platform (SSP) sends a bid request to the ad exchange, where Silk's DSP will be evaluating the value of the impression. The DSP will then determine if the user meets the parameters outlined in the campaign. If so, the DSP will submit a bid.</p> \n<p>If Silk has the winning bid, the user will see the ad once the page loads. This process happens thousands of times on different webpages during the length of Silk's ad campaign.</p> \n<p>Silk's <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/media-planning\">paid ads </a>manager will also be monitoring their ad's performance on the DSP to see if it's reaching the desired audience, or if the parameters should be adjusted.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>Real-Time Bidding Platforms</h2> \n<p>There are no RTB platforms because real-time bidding is a method of purchasing impressions, not a channel. However, you can use tools that can help you start the real-time bidding process. These tools help you either purchase ad inventory or place ad inventory for sale through RTB.</p> \n<p>Below, we break down some platforms you might use if you’re looking to sell or purchase ad inventory online.</p> \n<h3>Real-Time Bidding Platforms For Advertisers</h3> \n<p>As an advertiser, you’ll want to find a Demand-Side Platform that allows you to manage several ad campaigns and set specific targeting parameters — down to the user’s most visited websites and preferred brands. Here are a few options:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.adroll.com/advertising-platform\">AdRoll</a>: Self-serve Demand-Side Platform that’s a good fit for beginners in the programmatic advertising space.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://mediasmart.io/programmatic-performance-mobile-marketing-platform\">mediasmart</a>: Self-serve Demand-Side Platform that provides advanced targeting and segmentation capabilities. Good fit if you’ve set up ad campaigns with other tools, such as Google Ads.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.thetradedesk.com/us/our-platform/dsp-demand-side-platform\">theTradeDesk</a>: Demand-Side Platform that allows you to place ads on multiple devices, including TV ad rolls, online videos, music streaming devices, mobile apps, and publishers across the web. Good fit if you’re planning to advertise across all of these channels.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Real-Time Bidding Platforms for Publishers</h3> \n<p>If you have ad inventory to sell, then signing up on a Supply-Side Platform is essential to take advantage of the real-time bidding process. You don’t have to speak with any advertisers, negotiate prices, or do any of the manual work that’s typically associated with account management.</p> \n<p>Here are a few channels that will allow you to sell ad inventory through real-time bidding:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.magnite.com/sellers/\">Magnite</a>: Supply-Side Platform for large-scale ad inventory sellers who also want to sell ad space through Private Marketplace (PMP) and Programmatic Guaranteed (PG). Good fit if you’re an experienced ad seller that wants to upgrade to a more capable system.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.indexexchange.com/solution/publishers/\">Index Exchange</a>: Supply-side marketplace that allows you to get started with ad inventory selling on multiple channels, including display, video, mobile, and native. Good fit if you’d like to start selling ad inventory or if you plan to take advantage of all of the available channels.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>You can <a href=\"https://blockthrough.com/blog/best-supply-side-platforms-for-publishers-2021/#Index_Exchange\">find more SSPs here</a>.</p> \n<p>Still not sure whether you should sell or buy ad space through real-time bidding? We go over the pros and cons below.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>Real-Time Bidding Pros</h2> \n<h3>Better Tracking</h3> \n<p>With RTB, advertisers can monitor their campaigns easily without relying on vendors. No need to reach out to multiple publishers and ask for reports, you can get them yourself on your DSP.</p> \n<p>This also gives marketers the agility to pivot quickly if their campaign isn't performing as expected. For instance, you might find that switching out one keyword for another may boost your campaign's performance and align better with the audience you want to reach.</p> \n<h3>Better Targeting</h3> \n<p>When purchasing ads through RTB, you buy one impression at a time. This means that every time a website visitor or mobile app user visits a publisher's site, you're able to assess that person's particular profile and see if it matches your target audience.</p> \n<p>It makes for more accurate targeting as you can ensure your ads are only reaching the right people at the right time.</p> \n<h3>More Cost-Effective</h3> \n<p>The precision of the real-time bidding algorithm allows marketers to spend their ad dollars on high-value impressions.</p> \n<p>Too often, brands launch marketing campaigns that only reach a portion of their target market, leaving the rest of the budget wasted on users who don't fit the profile.</p> \n<p>In addition, RTB takes much of the manual labor out of the online advertising process, allowing marketers to focus on other efforts.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>Real-Time Bidding Cons</h2> \n<h3>Compromised Brand Safety</h3> \n<p>Where your ad shows up is as important as who sees it. This is because consumers judge brands' ads based on the surrounding content.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.adcolony.com/blog/2021/12/13/brand-safety-in-emea-latam-on-which-platforms-are-users-willing-to-encounter-ads/\">An Ad Colony survey</a> reported that 60% of consumers have a negative perception of brands whose ads appear near inappropriate, hateful, or offensive content. This can be anything from a site that hosts pirated movies to sites promoting hate speech.</p> \n<p>Due to the nature of RTB, there is a risk your ad may appear on a site with content you wouldn't want your brand associated with. However, brands can limit this issue by putting certain keywords and sites on a “deny” list. This protects brands from showing up on webpages or mobile apps that don't align with their identity.</p> \n<h3>Potential Ad Fraud</h3> \n<p>Ad fraud happens when scammers (or any parties with ill intent) try to trick digital ad networks by falsifying impressions and clicks using bots. Obviously, bots aren’t real people — so they aren’t potential buyers you can eventually convert into customers. Because you don’t get to hand-pick publishers through real-time bidding, there’s the very real chance your ad might be seen by bots instead of real people. The rising sophistication of bots can also cause brands to gather inaccurate data on their campaigns.</p> \n<p>Some deceitful publishers fabricate impressions to steal from advertisers. One way to combat this is by using a DSP or ad network with fraud detection software.</p> \n<h2>Real-Time Bidding is the Easiest Way to Increase Brand Awareness</h2> \n<p>Real-time bidding makes the online advertisement process fast and easy. Marketers can skip the back-and-forth previously associated with ad buying and focus on tracking the results, increasing the ROI from your campaigns and empowering your brand to grow better.</p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in March 2021 and has been updated for comprehensiveness. </em></p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=42d905a8-656c-41d8-8c20-b93c7c9c5a12&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"paid media template\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/42d905a8-656c-41d8-8c20-b93c7c9c5a12.png\" /></a></p> \n<p></p> \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Freal-time-bidding&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 21 Feb 2022 12:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/8ba68133-b408-456b-a531-171a91d2b38e.png","linkMd5":"acb724651d994013196c59940b7168f4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn40@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-26-48-396_dd5e75e818f84a1f.webp","destWidth":389,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":4641,"destBytes":6192,"author":"mbretous@hubspot.com (Martina Bretous)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/8ba68133-b408-456b-a531-171a91d2b38e.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn40@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-26-48-396_dd5e75e818f84a1f.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/42d905a8-656c-41d8-8c20-b93c7c9c5a12.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn60@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-26-50-735_b0fecfde2c648704.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Freal-time-bidding&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn16@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-26-55-455_da5a5e6d69388abc.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647246408227},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:26:48","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:26:48","title":"Mastering Facebook Ads In 2022 Through Incrementality","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-ads-incrementality","description":"<p>There are many resources out there telling you how to optimize your Facebook ads to scale your business's growth. And while I'm sure they can help in some aspects, you're probably optimizing your campaigns based on the wrong metrics.</p> \n<p>In 2022, Facebook has <a href=\"https://zephoria.com/top-15-valuable-facebook-statistics/\">1.79 billion daily users</a>. There are plenty of opportunities to create Facebook ads that will drive impressions, link clicks, leads, and more. However, these metrics only scratch the surface of how much impact your Facebook ads can truly have on your business.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=ed40e380-bf04-4fea-b0c3-257696630e08&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Sign Up for HubSpot Academy's Free Facebook Ads Training Course\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/ed40e380-bf04-4fea-b0c3-257696630e08.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<p>As more industry experts focus their media buying on incremental gains, marketers can better measure their Facebook ads' positive, negative, or neutral impact on their business.</p> \n<h2>What is incrementality in Facebook Ads?</h2> \n<p>Incrementality allows marketers to understand how Facebook ads impact their business. Often, advertisers make optimizations to campaigns based on certain metrics, which can dramatically affect the end goal.</p> \n<p>It's crucial for businesses to identify what's working and what isn't — especially since Facebook's ad revenue worldwide was <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/277963/facebooks-quarterly-global-revenue-by-segment/\"><strong>$84.2 billion</strong> in 2020</a>. Whether you have a large or small Facebook advertising budget, you want to make sure it's generating results.</p> \n<p>Advertisers can measure incrementality by using control tests and comparing the results from those exposed to an ad versus those who have not. Once the tests have been completed, the results can help your business make smarter decisions on your Facebook ads and optimize your campaigns accordingly.</p> \n<h2>Why should marketers track incremental return on ad spend (iROAS)?</h2> \n<p>One minute you're a marketer, and the next, you're a data analyst. All jokes aside, information overload is very real in 2022. With all of this data available, there’s the assumption that it should be easy for marketers to pinpoint the best audience to target, understand what point they are at in the Facebook sales funnel, and the best methods to convert them.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Facebook-Sales-Funnel.png?width=1104&amp;name=Facebook-Sales-Funnel.png\" alt=\"Facebook Sales Funnel\" width=\"1104\" style=\"width: 1104px;\"></p> \n<p>However, data dumps and compiling all of this information is incredibly time-consuming. And as digital marketing continues to expand, time is not always on our side. Businesses need to refocus their efforts from heavy reliance on data collection to doubling down on finding the <em>right</em> data—that can assist in smart optimizations and <a href=\"https://vistasocial.com/social-media-analytics/\">actionable insights</a> to fuel your Facebook campaign's bottom line.</p> \n<h2>How to Calculate Incremental Return on Ad Spend</h2> \n<p>The method for calculating iROAS is different for every publisher. The most methodical approach is by applying a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1915029282150425\">holdout</a> to your Facebook campaign. The holdout on your campaign will act as a control group for Facebook users that will not see your ads. The remaining group of users will be the test audience for your Facebook campaign.</p> \n<p>After the test is complete, marketers can compare the results from the test group to the control group. The difference in the results will be your conversion lift, representing the incremental impacts on your conversions.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/ROAS-Formula.png?width=760&amp;name=ROAS-Formula.png\" alt=\"How to calculate return on ad spend ROAS\" width=\"760\" style=\"width: 760px;\">iROAS is calculated similarly to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/return-on-ad-spend?_ga=2.189840235.1519769113.1645056446-1004475094.1645056446\">ROAS</a>, which is revenue divided by cost. However, this measurement allows your business to understand which Facebook campaigns are working and which aren't. The calculation for iROAS is Incremental Revenue / Ad Spend = iROAS.</p> \n<p>In the YouTube video below, HubSpot details how to determine ad spend by understanding the bidding system used by ad networks.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-embed-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0; max-width: 560px; max-height: 315px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;\">\n <div class=\"hs-embed-content-wrapper\">\n  <div style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0px;\">\n   <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JtwEBXoMa80\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen style=\"position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div> \n<h2>3 Simple Ways to Increase Your Facebook's Ads Incrementality in 2022</h2> \n<p>Frequently data dumps fail due to the sheer amount of information available. Marketers may find many valid insights, but the delivery of this information can get lost in translation — especially if there is no clear direction. Brands looking to increase their Facebook ads incrementality should work with a <a href=\"https://agencyvista.com/\">leading marketing agency</a> with proven experience.</p> \n<p>However, if you're looking to get started on your own, below we'll walk you through the top three ways to increase your Facebook ad's incrementality to exceed your 2022 growth goals.</p> \n<h3>1. Audience Targeting</h3> \n<p>Facebook users at the top of the funnel versus the bottom will yield very different incrementality results. For example, you will see very different results if you're using a 5% lookalike audience of customers who purchased in the last month vs. remarketing to customers who purchased in the last few years.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Facebook-Ad-Targeting.jpg?width=1600&amp;name=Facebook-Ad-Targeting.jpg\" alt=\"Creating audience for Facebook Ad targeting\" width=\"1600\" style=\"width: 1600px;\">Targeting new customers should be your most incremental audience segment since they would not have converted and made the purchase had it not been for your Facebook ad.</p> \n<p>This can also affect your bid strategies and budgets for remarketing audiences. For example, a customer who has purchased from you recently may not need a Facebook ad to prompt another purchase — this will depend on your product or service buying situation.</p> \n<h4><strong>Three Class of Buying Situations:</strong></h4> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Routine decision-making: </strong>involves purchases that require very little thought after the original decision has been made. Such as gum, a chocolate bar, or a soft drink.</li> \n <li><strong>Limited decision-making: </strong>involves purchasing products that require a moderate amount of time and effort to compare models and brands before making a choice. This could be comparing which phone you are planning to upgrade to.</li> \n <li><strong>Extensive decision-making: </strong>involves an extensive consumer decision regarding whether or not to purchase a product. Examples include cars, homes, and education.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>2. Ad Creative</h3> \n<p>I'm sure every marketer has heard about the study that found that the average attention span has decreased from 12 seconds to 8 seconds—while a goldfish holds a 9-second attention span. There is so much noise and clutter on social media that often, consumers will scroll right past your ad.</p> \n<p>Advertisers need to create Facebook ads that grab the viewers' attention and drive action. Facebook ad creative is one of the top ways to increase your incrementality.</p> \n<p>Learn from the best! We've collected the 50 best Facebook ads to inspire your next campaign. <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/facebook-ad-examples?hubs_post-cta=body&amp;hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/the-facebook-ad-types&amp;_ga=2.189840235.1519769113.1645056446-1004475094.1645056446\">Check out this exclusive lookbook</a> to get a head start on crafting the perfect ad to drive incremental revenue.</p> \n<h3>3. Facebook Placements</h3> \n<p>There are several placements for advertisers across Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and Audience Network. But, not every placement works with every type of campaign.</p> \n<p>For example, an ad on audience network may spark brand awareness or interest but not drive an immediate conversion. The same goes for device targeting, often people are in discovery mode on mobile but complete the transaction on desktop.</p> \n<p>Most advertisers still recommend combining placements to maximize the results, but it is beneficial to understand where your most incremental audience is.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=4f0eef09-2c33-43c7-9dee-7dde3ae4071e&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"New call-to-action\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/4f0eef09-2c33-43c7-9dee-7dde3ae4071e.png\"></a></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Ffacebook-ads-incrementality&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Mar 2022 12:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/ed40e380-bf04-4fea-b0c3-257696630e08.png","linkMd5":"d5938863511e5e5025f9df1f42d22700","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn39@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-26-48-384_34bd683f552faea2.webp","destWidth":611,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":7061,"destBytes":9908,"author":"Brittany Garlin","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/ed40e380-bf04-4fea-b0c3-257696630e08.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn39@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-26-48-384_34bd683f552faea2.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Facebook-Sales-Funnel.png?width=1104&name=Facebook-Sales-Funnel.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn10@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-26-50-527_23fed7923acc4d96.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/ROAS-Formula.png?width=760&name=ROAS-Formula.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn13@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-26-49-384_b18e309465d1b081.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Facebook-Ad-Targeting.jpg?width=1600&name=Facebook-Ad-Targeting.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn45@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-26-57-111_a7027f0933833d23.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/4f0eef09-2c33-43c7-9dee-7dde3ae4071e.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn67@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-26-52-298_abc294f6e8ab83dc.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Ffacebook-ads-incrementality&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn77@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-26-53-090_f01ad25c68735200.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647246408214},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:26:48","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:26:48","title":"Everything You Need to Know About Marketing Operations in One Place","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-operations","description":"<p>One of my favorite movies is \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_of_Rock\">School of Rock</a>,\" which also happens to be one of 2003's best films.

After all, without marketing operations, it would be tough for marketing teams to complete essential activities effectively because they enable other marketing departments to bring cohesion to campaigns and processes.</p> \n<p>For example, as technology is necessary to carry out most marketing tasks, a team to manage the complexity of that technology and ensure it works as it should is also necessary — <em>which is exactly what MOps is</em>.</p> \n<p>Here are some examples of situations that can be rectified by having a marketing operations team:</p> \n<table> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td>Problem</td> \n   <td>MOps Solution</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td>Your investments in marketing technology don’t provide the solutions you thought they would.</td> \n   <td>MOps ensure that teams are enabled by technology solutions and eliminate tech debt.</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td>You want to streamline data reporting and metrics tracking to understand ROI.</td> \n   <td>MOps focus on processes and systems for data reporting to enable teams.</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td>Strategy execution is a timely process, and you want to lower the amount of time it takes from start to finish.</td> \n   <td>MOps helps team improve processes to become more efficient.</td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p>At HubSpot, the marketing ops team is responsible for supporting the systems and processes that enable the marketing team to perform optimally in their roles. This includes everything from permissions, conversational marketing, user data, forms, and email operations.</p> \n<p>An essential function of how well a marketing ops team works is proper management.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>As a point of reference, marketing operations is the process of strategizing and optimizing, while marketing ops management defines how that strategizing and optimizing will happen.</p> \n<p>Since marketing operations management aims to increase efficiency, ops teams often have a hand in content planning and campaign analysis.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3 style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Role of Marketing Operations</h3> \n<p>Marketing operations is a combination of different processes that contribute to marketing team success. The role of marketing ops encompasses:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Project management</li> \n <li>Strategic planning</li> \n <li>Organization benchmarking</li> \n <li>Workflow process development and documentation</li> \n <li>Customer, market, and competitive intelligence research</li> \n <li>Performance measurement</li> \n <li>Campaign analysis and reporting</li> \n <li>Data management</li> \n <li>Process development and implementation</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Much of the role of marketing operations comes down to strategic decision making for key <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/digital-strategy-guide\">marketing strategies</a>, and seeing those projects through to completion based on analyzed data.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>Marketing Operations Strategy</h2> \n<p>Marketing ops team members need to have an expansive skillset. Some of the typical activities this department deals with are email operations, systems analysis, customer data and marketing, user operations, and lead rotation.</p> \n<p>All of these roles come together to align the process and platforms needed to carry out marketing tasks for the greater marketing team.</p> \n<p>When thinking about a marketing ops strategy, consider the problems the marketing ops team needs to solve, taking into account the needs of customers, stakeholders, and the employees of your company.</p> \n<a></a> \n<p></p> \n<h3 style=\"font-weight: bold;\">1. Identify what you want your operations strategy to accomplish for stakeholders.</h3> \n<p>Firstly, you need to effectively communicate and involve your stakeholder(s) when trying to create your marketing operations strategy. By doing so, you can better align the team and work toward solving high-level needs and priorities that may not be explicitly clear beforehand.</p> \n<p>This is where the importance of internal <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/34212/how-to-create-a-service-level-agreement-sla-for-better-sales-marketing-alignment.aspx\">service level agreements (SLAs)</a> come in. These contracts establish a set of deliverables to another party that sets clear expectations and mitigates issues that may arise.</p> \n<p>For instance, key stakeholders might want to make email marketing a more valuable process. The marketing ops team would then be responsible for the processes and systems that support this endeavor, ensuring that:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>The organization has effective email marketing technology</li> \n <li>The marketing team is enabled to send emails and create improved content offers</li> \n <li>The sales team is enabled and empowered to source quality leads</li> \n <li>All parties have what they need and are communicating effectively during each step of the process</li> \n</ul> \n<h3 style=\"font-weight: bold;\">2. Figure out a measurable metric to determine the success of your strategy.</h3> \n<p>The next step in strategizing is to identify how the team would <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-success-metrics\">measure the success</a> of the project. When you figure out a measurable metric, you'll be able to keep track of the strategy's success as your team works through the plan. The metric will remind your team of the goal you want to accomplish and what stakeholders want to see as a result of your plan.</p> \n<p>In this example, the team might conclude, \"Click-through rate and total number of clicks are how we want to measure the value that email marketing brings to the business. We will calculate the click-through rate by dividing the number of clicks in a month by the number of unique email recipient impressions in a month and multiply it by 100 for the percentage.\"</p> \n<h3 style=\"font-weight: bold;\">3. Define your goal(s) using the SMART format.</h3> \n<p>With your metrics identified, the next step in defining a marketing ops strategy is outlining significant <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-write-a-smart-goal-template\">SMART goals</a>. This format is important because it gives your team a better sense of direction and organization in strategy execution.</p> \n<p>An example of an effective SMART goal is, “We will increase total clicks from email by 25% in one year.” because it’s:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Specific</strong>: It’s not a broad goal; it’s focused on email marketing.</li> \n <li><strong>Measurable</strong>: It can be measured by a concrete metric (total clicks).</li> \n <li><strong>Attainable</strong>: It’s possible to see this level of change in the business.</li> \n <li><strong>Realistic</strong>: The team is capable of working toward 25% of improvement.</li> \n <li><strong>Time-bound</strong>: This goal has a set duration of one year.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3 style=\"font-weight: bold;\">4. If needed, communicate how colleagues can take part in refining your strategy.</h3> \n<p>With the goal and metrics identified, your next step is to outline what this change would mean for affected colleagues, such as the team members who create and distribute email marketing messages.</p> \n<p>The team might conclude that \"Marketers can expect an easier email guideline process, a more effective format, and to receive a form to offer input about how to make that happen.\"</p> \n<h3 style=\"font-weight: bold;\">5. Determine actionable steps in your plan that will help you reach your goals.</h3> \n<p>Determining actionable steps will help your marketing ops team figure out what needs to be done, identify the resources required to see success, and stay organized as they work through their tasks.</p> \n<p>A marketing ops professional will need to run these steps by the stakeholders who actually influence the plan. For instance, they would be communicating steps to reach the previously stated SMART goal like:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Switching to a more efficient email technology provider.</li> \n <li>Ensuring that the data being used to measure these goals is clean and accurate.</li> \n <li>Enabling the marketing team to source more quality leads.</li> \n <li>Enabling the sales team with better templates or sales enablement resources.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>With these steps communicated, stakeholders can provide assistance or suggestions where it’s needed, and the marketing ops team can get closer to execution.</p> \n<h3 style=\"font-weight: bold;\">6. Assign team members to specific tasks that will contribute to the completion of your goals.</h3> \n<p>Having that set in place, what's next for the marketing ops team is to assign team members specific tasks to help them achieve their goals. For instance, one team member might be in charge of redefining email marketing contact lists. Another might be in charge of auditing the current workflows in place for email marketing.</p> \n<p>As team members complete these tasks, they would check them off in a centralized space so the entire team can stay updated on the project’s status.</p> \n<p>Marketing operations teams are equally effective with their strategies and management capabilities as Summer's character in \"School of Rock.\" With her processes, the group was able to obtain their own rehearsal space and offer music classes.</p> \n<h2>Align and Optimize Your Marketing Operations</h2> \n<p>Marketing ops can come up with ways to increase customer satisfaction and ease the job of marketers. Their strategies make marketing activities and duties accessible to all, and because of that, are an essential part of a business.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=2f598dfb-38e3-4e7b-a962-57cf6aebd7d7&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"New Call-to-action\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/2f598dfb-38e3-4e7b-a962-57cf6aebd7d7.png\"></a></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fmarketing-operations&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 09 Mar 2022 12:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/34155d81-37a6-4910-a596-3a77b9e5a99f.png","linkMd5":"0aa7014dbe6c5f0e4050c8dfa3994b13","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn64@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-26-48-401_d4993499845f294a.webp","destWidth":492,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":5749,"destBytes":7772,"author":"Kayla Carmicheal","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/34155d81-37a6-4910-a596-3a77b9e5a99f.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn64@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-26-48-401_d4993499845f294a.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Everything%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20About%20Marketing%20Operations%20in%20One%20Place.png?width=624&height=624&name=Everything%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20About%20Marketing%20Operations%20in%20One%20Place.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn52@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-26-49-724_dce62d7bc9c727c2.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/2f598dfb-38e3-4e7b-a962-57cf6aebd7d7.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn4@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-26-54-121_cbc16368967d0eb0.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fmarketing-operations&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn25@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-26-56-673_585b9b3c5a2805b7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647246408199},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:26:48","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:26:48","title":"SEO vs. PPC: When to Optimize and When to Pay for Traffic","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/tabid/6307/bid/1514/paid-search-vs-organic-search.aspx","description":"<p>If you're struggling to get the word out about your brand new business venture, you’re not alone.

We’ve also provided some pros and cons of SEO and PPC strategies along with descriptive statistics and real-life examples to help you decide whether your business is best suited for SEO or PPC — or both.</p> \n<h2>What is SEO?</h2> \n<p>Search engine optimization is the process of enhancing your website’s visibility to make it rank and gain organic traffic from search engines.</p> \n<p>Just as you turn to your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/top-search-engines?__hstc=45788219.ca6fa96b1444ad1af0b0b1debe5f22a0.1621995985031.1621995985031.1621995985031.1&amp;__hssc=45788219.1.1621995985031&amp;__hsfp=2831226065&amp;_ga=2.61221103.2124293733.1621995984-1118394532.1621995984\">favorite search engines</a>, such as Google or Bing, to look up a new marketing acronym or where to get good pizza, so do your consumers. When you invest in SEO, you're increasing the likelihood of your target audience finding you when they make a Google search for keywords related to your product or service. In fact, 61% of marketers say that <a href=\"https://www.impactplus.com/blog/seo-statistics\">SEO is a top inbound marketing factor</a> for their business. But it's easier said than done.</p> \n<p>Here's an example of SEO in action.</p> \n<p>In the image below, Hubspot appears at the top of Google’s organic search engine results page (SERP) for the term “inbound marketing,” thanks to the SEO strategy we have in place.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"SEO example of HubSpot ranking for &quot;inbound&quot; marketing&quot;\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/SEO%20vs.%20PPC%20When%20to%20Optimize%20and%20When%20to%20Pay%20for%20Traffic.png?width=650&amp;name=SEO%20vs.%20PPC%20When%20to%20Optimize%20and%20When%20to%20Pay%20for%20Traffic.png\" title=\"\" width=\"650\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px;\"></p> \n<p>The order of the results that appear on the search engine results page isn't arbitrary. Each search engine takes into account several ranking factors that influence where a webpage gets placed. The goal of an SEO strategy is to create web pages and content that work with the ranking factors of the search engine in order to rise within the SERP rankings.</p> \n<h4>Are there other search engines besides Google?</h4> \n<p>Most SEO strategies center around Google instead of others like Bing and Yahoo! because it holds <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/216573/worldwide-market-share-of-search-engines/#:~:text=Global%20market%20share%20of%20search%20engines%202010%2D2021&amp;text=Ever%20since%20the%20introduction%20of,share%20as%20of%20June%202021.\">92.47%</a> of the search engine market share. Because of this, you’ll need to learn about <a href=\"https://backlinko.com/google-ranking-factors\">Google’s 200 ranking factors</a>, technical SEO, <a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/lessons/link-building-tutorial?__hstc=45788219.ca6fa96b1444ad1af0b0b1debe5f22a0.1621995985031.1621995985031.1621995985031.1&amp;__hssc=45788219.1.1621995985031&amp;__hsfp=2831226065&amp;_ga=2.31360252.2124293733.1621995984-1118394532.1621995984\">link building</a>, content creation, and so much more if you want to appear higher up on the search engine results page.</p> \n<h3>Pros of SEO</h3> \n<p>Here are some advantages of SEO:</p> \n<h4>1. SEO is cheaper in the long run.</h4> \n<p>Although SEO might cost time and money —to pay freelancers or agencies, and for SEO tools — it’s still cheaper than PPC in the long run.</p> \n<p>When you create content that ranks and drives traffic to your website, you no longer have to keep spending money to make your target customers see it. And when these customers decide to click on your link, it comes at zero cost, unlike a PPC campaign where you pay per click.</p> \n<p>Organic traffic is also very scalable and cost-effective.</p> \n<h4>2. You can target different funnel stages with SEO.</h4> \n<p>Not all of your audience is at the same stage of the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/sales-funnel?__hstc=45788219.ca6fa96b1444ad1af0b0b1debe5f22a0.1621995985031.1621995985031.1621995985031.1&amp;__hssc=45788219.1.1621995985031&amp;__hsfp=2831226065\">sales funnel</a>.</p> \n<p>Some are just getting to know your brand at the top of the funnel. And others are already at the bottom of the funnel, ready to pull out their wallets.</p> \n<p>With SEO, you can create different content types (blog posts, guides, case studies) that meet each segment of your audience exactly where they are in the sales funnel. This gives your site a better shot at getting visitors to the next step in the funnel each time they browse your content.</p> \n<h4>3. Search traffic is more stable.</h4> \n<p>Once you rank on Google, you can begin to plan for and predict free traffic to your website as long as you keep optimizing it.</p> \n<p>Another advantage to keep in mind is that there is no off-and-on switch with SEO. With PPC marketing, your website stops appearing on search results once your marketing budget dries up. A great way to remember this difference is by thinking in terms of real estate: SEO is like owning your traffic whereas PPC is like renting it.</p> \n<h4>4. Organic listings build brand authority.</h4> \n<p>Appearing consistently on search results for keywords related to your products and services helps build trust and brand authority with your target audience.</p> \n<p>It also signifies to Google that you’re an expert on that topic or subject. This can lead to more backlinks from other trusted sites which is a ranking factor that search engines favor strongly.</p> \n<h3>Cons of SEO</h3> \n<p>Here are some reasons why you might not love SEO:</p> \n<h4>1. Search engine algorithms change.</h4> \n<p>Search engines, especially Google, have <a href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-algorithm-history/\">changed their algorithms</a> many times over the years. These changes mean that you’ll have to keep a close eye on your marketing strategy and organic results.</p> \n<h4>2. You’ll need to optimize your website regularly.</h4> \n<p>Your job doesn’t end when you get your website to rank for target keywords for one month. Over time, you’ll have to regularly optimize your content and web pages so that your site continues to rank.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/historical-blog-seo-conversion-optimization\">Optimization</a> might include refreshing old articles and removing old/expired links.</p> \n<h4>3. SEO takes time to show results.</h4> \n<p>If your website or domain is new, it’s unlikely that you’ll enjoy immediate results from SEO. The reason is that several factors affect how Google ranks websites — many of which won't be established within the first few weeks or months of launching your site.</p> \n<h4>2. It requires high-level skills and expertise.</h4> \n<p>If you’re not hiring a professional, make sure you understand your audience's goals and meet them with quality content in order to optimize your site properly for the search engines.</p> \n<p>It’s undoubtedly time-consuming and overwhelming to run a business while taking <a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/results?q=seo&amp;library=true&amp;_ga=2.11489021.830295185.1621993439-1955934222.1621993439&amp;__hstc=45788219.ca6fa96b1444ad1af0b0b1debe5f22a0.1621995985031.1621995985031.1621995985031.1&amp;__hssc=45788219.1.1621995985031&amp;__hsfp=2831226065\">technical SEO</a>, writing, and link-building classes, but it can be done if you commit to using an SEO strategy to generate revenue.</p> \n<h2>What is PPC?</h2> \n<p>PPC, or <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ppc?_ga=2.11489021.830295185.1621993439-1955934222.1621993439\">pay-per-click</a>, is a form of <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/search-engine-marketing\">search engine marketing</a> (SEM) where an advertiser pays a publisher (such as Google or Facebook) for each click someone makes on an ad. This model allows businesses to pay only when consumers interact with their ads. If you use PPC ads, you'll attract people who are interested in your offer and ready to convert.</p> \n<p>You may have noticed that some of the top search results are tagged with an \"Ad\" marker, like the HelloFresh search results here. <img alt=\"Example of PPC search result for &quot;hellofresh&quot;\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/SEO%20vs.%20PPC%20When%20to%20Optimize%20and%20When%20to%20Pay%20for%20Traffic-2.png?width=650&amp;name=SEO%20vs.%20PPC%20When%20to%20Optimize%20and%20When%20to%20Pay%20for%20Traffic-2.png\" title=\"\" width=\"650\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px;\"></p> \n<p>PPC ads always appear alongside organic search results. Some businesses run these search ads for specific marketing campaigns that have a definite start and end date. Others bid on their own brand name as part of their overall marketing strategy — like HelloFresh. Either way, this method is mainly associated with search engines as advertisers bid on keywords that are relevant to their target markets.</p> \n<p>The cost of PPC ads usually depends on your industry and the search volume of the keyword you’re targeting.</p> \n<p>PPC advertising can help your business stay competitive in a crowded market and quickly get in front of their target consumers if you don’t have the domain authority to get your site ranking organically on search engines.</p> \n<h3>Pros of PPC</h3> \n<h4>1. PPC offers quick results.</h4> \n<p>While it can take months to see results from your SEO strategy, it can take just a few hours to see results from your PPC campaign.</p> \n<h4>2. PPC ads appear above organic rankings.</h4> \n<p>When you run a PPC campaign for your target keyword, your website would appear first on the search engine result page. This ranking makes your audience notice you first before scrolling to see other results.</p> \n<h4>3. PPC allows you to pinpoint your target audience.</h4> \n<p>While setting up a PPC campaign, you get to choose who you want to target with your ads.</p> \n<p>Do you want people from a specific geographic area? Or people of a particular age? Marital status? Or interest? If so, then you should use PPC.</p> \n<h4>3. You can quickly run A/B tests on a PPC ad.</h4> \n<p>With a PPC campaign, you can run two different ads simultaneously to measure the one that converts better.</p> \n<p>All you’ll have to do is change some ad elements like the ad copy and allow them to run for a period. Depending on the performance, you can decide to either “kill” the Google ads or continue optimization to improve your results.</p> \n<h3>Cons of PPC</h3> \n<h4>1. PPC ads are expensive.</h4> \n<p>Without money, you cannot run a PPC campaign.</p> \n<p>You have to pay for every link that your audience clicks, meaning once your budget dries up, so does your traffic.</p> \n<p>Also, a PPC ad can get even more expensive (as high as $40) when you’re in a competitive industry like legal or insurance.</p> \n<h4>2. Lower profit margins.</h4> \n<p>While a PPC campaign might bring short-term wins, it’ll usually result in lower profit margins. Because PPC is a “pay to play” system, your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/what-does-cac-stand-for?_ga=2.243230795.830295185.1621993439-1955934222.1621993439\">customer acquisition costs</a> (CAC) would continue to get higher without a significant increase in the prices of your products and services.</p> \n<h4>3. PPC ads become stale after a while.</h4> \n<p>You have limited control over your paid ad because of the rule set by ad platforms like Google. As such, your copy might have similar wording to your competitors, which makes it easy for your audience to pass over quickly.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>SEO is also more effective for local searches and can grow your online presence for longer. Pay-per-click (PPC), on the other hand, is an acquisition strategy that requires you to spend ad money to get your content in front of an audience when they search for specific keywords online.</p> \n<h3>SEO vs. PPC: Which is better?</h3> \n<p>Asking which is better between SEO and PPC is like asking whether it’s better to eat with a fork or spoon — it depends.</p> \n<p>Serving pasta? Sure, I’d love a fork. Soup? I’d rather have a spoon.</p> \n<p>In the same way, different situations exist where SEO is better than PPC and vice versa.</p> \n<p>Let’s now look at some of these situations.</p> \n<h4>Use SEO if...</h4> \n<ul> \n <li>Your marketing budget is low.</li> \n <li>You want to build your brand authority.</li> \n <li>You’re looking to maximize your long-term return-on-investment (ROI).</li> \n <li>You want to create content that reaches your audience at different stages of the sales funnel.</li> \n</ul> \n<h4>Use PPC if...</h4> \n<p>You’d get better results with PPC in situations where:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>You want quick results.</li> \n <li>Your product is novel or first-of-its-kind.</li> \n <li>You’re promoting a time-sensitive offer, like a holiday sale.</li> \n <li>You want to direct your audience to a sales or landing page.</li> \n</ul> \n<h2>How to Make SEO and PPC Work For You</h2> \n<p>Instead of choosing between SEO or PPC, why not combine the two strategies and make them work for you?</p> \n<p>Here’s how you can get the best of both worlds.</p> \n<h3>1. Create retargeting ads.</h3> \n<p><img alt=\"Retargeting ads example featuring Birchbox\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/SEO%20vs.%20PPC%20When%20to%20Optimize%20and%20When%20to%20Pay%20for%20Traffic-1.png?width=650&amp;name=SEO%20vs.%20PPC%20When%20to%20Optimize%20and%20When%20to%20Pay%20for%20Traffic-1.png\" title=\"\" width=\"650\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.bluecorona.com/blog/how-remarketing-works/\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Did someone visit your site, probably the pricing or check-out page, without buying?</p> \n<p>You can easily use a retargeting ad to prompt these visitors, even after they’ve left your site, to come back and make a purchase.</p> \n<h3>2. Promote website content with social media ads.</h3> \n<p><img alt=\"social media ads example featuring dollar shave club\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/SEO%20vs.%20PPC%20When%20to%20Optimize%20and%20When%20to%20Pay%20for%20Traffic-3.png?width=300&amp;name=SEO%20vs.%20PPC%20When%20to%20Optimize%20and%20When%20to%20Pay%20for%20Traffic-3.png\" title=\"\" width=\"300\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 300px;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/facebook-ad-examples/\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>While you want your content to rank organically, you can give it a quick boost by promoting it on social media.</p> \n<p>Not only do these kinds of ads help with <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-distribution?__hstc=45788219.ca6fa96b1444ad1af0b0b1debe5f22a0.1621995985031.1621995985031.1621995985031.1&amp;__hssc=45788219.1.1621995985031&amp;__hsfp=2831226065&amp;_ga=2.31360252.2124293733.1621995984-1118394532.1621995984\">content distribution</a>, but they could potentially help you acquire essential backlinks that’d boost your rankings.</p> \n<p>Also, it’s going to be a shame not to promote your latest blog post, guide, report, or case study after spending hours creating it.</p> \n<h3>3. Collect data From ads to improve your SEO strategy.</h3> \n<p>PPC campaigns grant you access to a lot of data — keyword search volumes, keywords your competitors are bidding for, highest converting calls-to-action, and so on.</p> \n<p>Aimed with all of this data, you’d be able to create better SEO strategies with less effort.</p> \n<h2>SEO vs. PPC Statistics</h2> \n<h3>SEO</h3> \n<ul> \n <li>Google is responsible for over <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/216573/worldwide-market-share-of-search-engines/#:~:text=Google%20has%20dominated%20the%20search,share%20as%20of%20June%202021.\">92.47%</a> of global web traffic.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://ahrefs.com/blog/search-traffic-study/\">90.63%</a> of online content gets zero traffic from Google, with only 0.21% getting over 1000 visits per month.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://sparktoro.com/blog/in-2020-two-thirds-of-google-searches-ended-without-a-click/\">35.18%</a> of browser-based Google searches resulted in an organic link click in 2020.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://ahrefs.com/blog/search-traffic-study/\">99.2%</a> of website pages have less than 100 backlinks.</li> \n <li>Google processes over <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/google-search-statistics\">5.6 billion</a> searches per day (or 2 trillion searches per year.)</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/state-of-marketing/seo-trends?_ga=2.47785070.830295185.1621993439-1955934222.1621993439&amp;hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/tabid/6307/bid/1514/paid-search-vs-organic-search.aspx&amp;hubs_post-cta=64%25\">64%</a> of marketers actively invest in SEO.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>PPC</h3> \n<ul> \n <li>The Google Display Network reaches <a href=\"https://ads.google.com/intl/en_ng/home/campaigns/display-ads/#:~:text=Display%20ads%20can%20help%20you,sites%20like%20Gmail%20and%20YouTube.\">90%</a> of Internet users worldwide.</li> \n <li>Search advertising spending was <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/276671/global-internet-advertising-expenditure-by-type/#:~:text=In%202021%2C%20search%20advertising%20spending,billion%20U.S.%20dollars%20by%202022.\">$144.8 billion</a> in 2021, compared to <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/topics/4312/search-advertising/\">$58 billion</a> in 2020.</li> \n <li>More than <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/435252/adblock-users-worldwide/\">https://backlinko.com/ad-blockers-users</a>.</li> \n <li>The highest average monthly cost-per-click (CPC) in Google Ads search advertising is in the insurance industry at <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1115432/us-search-advertising-cpc/\">$18.57 per click</a>.</li> \n <li>The cheapest CPC in Google Ads search advertising is in the electronics industry at <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1115432/us-search-advertising-cpc/\">77 cents per click</a>.</li> \n <li>The average Facebook Ads Click-Through Rate across all industries is <a href=\"https://www.thedrum.com/profile/whatagraph/news/facebook-ctr-and-how-to-increase-it#:~:text=The%20average%20Facebook%20Ads%20click,is%20different%20for%20every%20industry.\">1.1%</a>.</li> \n</ul> \n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2> \n<p>Whether you choose to go with SEO or PPC ultimately depends on your business situation. So take your time to evaluate the pros and cons of both SEO and PPC to see which is the right fit for you. And if possible, integrate the two strategies to see even more outstanding results for your business.</p> \n<p>Editor's note: This post was originally published in July 2019 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in July 2019 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=d976e6fb-0071-4c77-9973-772d11ef72d3&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"state of marketing\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/d976e6fb-0071-4c77-9973-772d11ef72d3.png\"></a></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Ftabid%2F6307%2Fbid%2F1514%2Fpaid-search-vs-organic-search.aspx&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 23 Feb 2022 12:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/3d0bc27a-898d-40d5-aa46-8696ed81c4ee.png","linkMd5":"51d6b12f6754640fc8551eeb1c315d3e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn75@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-26-48-405_67a56d849e63168b.webp","destWidth":539,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":6641,"destBytes":8730,"author":"cmcginley@hubspot.com (Corinne McGinley)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/3d0bc27a-898d-40d5-aa46-8696ed81c4ee.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn75@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-26-48-405_67a56d849e63168b.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/SEO%20vs.%20PPC%20When%20to%20Optimize%20and%20When%20to%20Pay%20for%20Traffic.png?width=650&name=SEO%20vs.%20PPC%20When%20to%20Optimize%20and%20When%20to%20Pay%20for%20Traffic.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn19@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-26-52-769_0575238fe7831140.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/SEO%20vs.%20PPC%20When%20to%20Optimize%20and%20When%20to%20Pay%20for%20Traffic-2.png?width=650&name=SEO%20vs.%20PPC%20When%20to%20Optimize%20and%20When%20to%20Pay%20for%20Traffic-2.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn93@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-26-49-364_f86f3a08c95fbb63.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/SEO%20vs.%20PPC%20When%20to%20Optimize%20and%20When%20to%20Pay%20for%20Traffic-1.png?width=650&name=SEO%20vs.%20PPC%20When%20to%20Optimize%20and%20When%20to%20Pay%20for%20Traffic-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn64@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-26-52-401_715e769794f27427.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/SEO%20vs.%20PPC%20When%20to%20Optimize%20and%20When%20to%20Pay%20for%20Traffic-3.png?width=300&name=SEO%20vs.%20PPC%20When%20to%20Optimize%20and%20When%20to%20Pay%20for%20Traffic-3.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn85@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-26-50-127_b8a08ae0496a5213.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/d976e6fb-0071-4c77-9973-772d11ef72d3.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn76@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-26-49-878_ba6ee21c8b9c368e.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Ftabid%2F6307%2Fbid%2F1514%2Fpaid-search-vs-organic-search.aspx&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn52@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-26-50-135_ef864c5b92a25966.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647246408229},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:26:48","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:26:48","title":"How to Write a Great Value Proposition [5 Top Examples + Template]","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/write-value-proposition","description":"<p>Your company’s value proposition is the core of your competitive advantage.

A great value proposition could be the difference between losing a sale — and closing it.</p> \n<p>For that reason, it’s important to create one that accurately represents your products and services and makes it clear why you’re the best choice. However, writing it from scratch is hard. Download our templates below so you can follow along with the rest of the post.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Your value proposition is a unique identifier for your business. Without it, buyers won’t have a reason to purchase what you sell. They may even choose a competitor simply because that business communicates its value proposition clearly in its <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-campaigns\">marketing campaigns</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/sales-process-\">sales process</a>.</p> \n<p>That said, you might think: <em>Isn’t my value prop interchangeable with, say, my slogan?</em></p> \n<p>Nope. It’s easy to confuse your value proposition with other similar <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-are-brand-assets\">brand assets</a>, such as your mission statement, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/brand-slogans-and-taglines\">slogan</a>, or tagline. We break down the differences below.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>Value Proposition vs Mission Statement</h2> \n<p>Your value proposition details what you offer customers and why they should choose you, while a mission statement details your objective as an organization. While the two can have points in common, a value prop is more product- and service-oriented while a mission statement is more goal-oriented.</p> \n<p>Here are two examples for HubSpot and our CRM platform:</p> \n<p><strong>Value Proposition:</strong> “An easy-to-use CRM.”</p> \n<p><strong>Mission Statement:</strong> “To help businesses grow better.”</p> \n<h3>Value Proposition vs Slogan</h3> \n<p>A slogan is a short, catchy statement that brands use in marketing campaigns to sell a specific product. While your value proposition wouldn’t necessarily go in an ad (at least, not usually), a slogan would. The most important thing to note is that a company can have different slogans for different campaigns or products.</p> \n<p>Here are two examples from De Beers Group:</p> \n<p><strong>Value Proposition:</strong> “Exquisite diamonds, world-class designs, breathtaking jewelry.”</p> \n<p><strong>Slogan</strong>: “A diamond is forever.”</p> \n<h3>Value Proposition vs Tagline</h3> \n<p>A tagline is a short statement that embodies a certain aspect of your brand or business. While a value proposition is more concrete, a tagline can represent a concept or idea that your business stands for. Most businesses have only one tagline that is instantly recognizable and connected to their brand.</p> \n<p>Here’s an example from Apple:</p> \n<p><strong>Value Proposition</strong>: “The best experiences. Only on Apple.”</p> \n<p><strong>Tagline</strong>: “Think Different.”</p> \n<h3>Value Proposition vs Mission Statement vs Slogan vs Tagline</h3> \n<p>Now, let’s look at an example of a business that has all four: Nike. Remember that slogans can differ depending on the campaign.</p> \n<p><strong>Value Proposition</strong>: “Customizable performance or lifestyle sneakers with unique colorways and materials.”</p> \n<p><strong>Mission Statement:</strong> “To bring inspiration and innovation to every athlete in the world.”</p> \n<p><strong>Slogan</strong>: “Twice the guts. Double the glory.”</p> \n<p><strong>Tagline</strong>: “Just do it.”</p> \n<p>TLDR; While your value prop should help differentiate you from the rest of the industry, keep in mind it's not a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/brand-slogans-and-taglines\">slogan</a>, tagline, or mission statement. Those types of copy are important accessories to your brand, but your potential customers and employees don't choose one business over the other solely based on these elements.</p> \n<p>Your value proposition goes deep into the problems you want to solve for buyers, and what makes your product or service the perfect solution.</p> \n<p>Now, before you write the statement itself, it’s important to create a value proposition canvas.</p> \n<a></a> \n<p>Taking these three elements into consideration, you'll be able to make your own after you build a value proposition canvas.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p><img alt=\"Value Proposition Canvas Visual\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Write%20a%20Great%20Value%20Proposition%20%5B4%20Top%20Examples%20+%20Template%5D-3.png?width=650&amp;name=How%20to%20Write%20a%20Great%20Value%20Proposition%20%5B4%20Top%20Examples%20+%20Template%5D-3.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px;\" title=\"\" width=\"650\" /></p> \n<p>The value proposition canvas is made up of two major components: the customer profile and the value map.</p> \n<p>Here’s how to make one:</p> \n<h3>Step 1: Create a customer profile to represent your target buyer.</h3> \n<p>The customer profile makes up the first half of the value proposition canvas. When performing this exercise, you’ll want to start with this section first so that their wants and needs can influence the overall value proposition canvas.</p> \n<p>The customer profile consists of three areas:</p> \n<h4>Customer Jobs</h4> \n<p>What is the task your customer needs to complete or the problem they’re trying to solve with your product or service? The answer to this question sums up the “customer job” or the purpose of your product or service in the eyes of the customer.</p> \n<h4>Customer Expectations</h4> \n<p>“Expectations” are also referred to as “gains” — in other words, what your customer is hoping to gain from doing business with you. No matter what you sell, your ideal customer will have an expectation of what that product or service will do for them. In this section, you’ll use research to explain what your customers expect from you in order to purchase your product.</p> \n<h4>Customer Pain Points</h4> \n<p>As your customer completes their “customer job,” what pains do they experience? Do they take any risks while they do the customer’s job? Do they experience any negative emotions? These pain points should be considered so that you include the most helpful products and services on the value map side of the value proposition canvas.</p> \n<h3>Step 2: Create a value map for your products and services.</h3> \n<p>In this section of the value proposition canvas, three specific sectors help describe what the business offers to the customer.</p> \n<h4>Gain Creators</h4> \n<p>These are features your products or services have that make the customer happy. Think creatively about the elements of happiness your customers experience. Consider their financial and social goals as well as their <a href=\"https://cxl.com/blog/psychographics/\">psychographics</a>.</p> \n<h4>Pain Relievers</h4> \n<p>In the section above, we discussed customer pains. This section will define exactly how your business will help them overcome those pain points.</p> \n<h4>Products &amp; Services</h4> \n<p>While this section won’t list every single product or service your company offers, it should include the ones that will create the most gain and alleviate the most pains for your customers.</p> \n<h3>Step 3: Determine value proposition-customer fit.</h3> \n<p>Once you’ve completed the value proposition canvas exercise, the next step will be to determine how your value proposition fits within the customer profile. To do this, you’ll use a ranking process that prioritizes products and services based on how well they address the customer profile.</p> \n<p>All together, your value proposition canvas should look like this:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/value-proposition-canvas-example.png?width=650&amp;name=value-proposition-canvas-example.png\" alt=\"value proposition canvas example \" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" /></p> \n<p>Next up, let’s go over the elements you should include in your value proposition when you’re creating it and publishing it on your website.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>Elements of a Value Proposition</h2> \n<p>Your value proposition will most often appear on your website. While you can include it on marketing campaigns and brochures, the most visible place is your home page and, if you’d like, your product pages.</p> \n<p>There are three main elements of a value proposition: the headline, the subheadline, and a visual element.</p> \n<h3 style=\"color: #434343; font-size: 14px;\"><img alt=\"The elements of a value proposition\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Write%20a%20Great%20Value%20Proposition%20%5B4%20Top%20Examples%20+%20Template%5D-Oct-01-2021-04-55-04-13-PM.png?width=650&amp;name=How%20to%20Write%20a%20Great%20Value%20Proposition%20%5B4%20Top%20Examples%20+%20Template%5D-Oct-01-2021-04-55-04-13-PM.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px;\" title=\"\" width=\"650\" /></h3> \n<h3>Headline</h3> \n<p>The headline of your value proposition describes the benefit the customer will receive as a result of making a purchase from your business. The headline can be creative and catchy, but it should be clear and concise, first and foremost.</p> \n<h3>Subheadline or Paragraph</h3> \n<p>The subheadline or paragraph should explain in detail what your company offers, who it serves, and why. In this section, you can elaborate on the information in the headline.</p> \n<h3>Visual Element</h3> \n<p>In some cases, a video, infographic, or image may convey your value proposition better than words alone can.

Customer service reps, marketing specialists, and salespeople can fill in the gaps about what problems your customers are looking to solve by using your product or service.</p> \n<p>For example, let’s say your business sells tax software on a subscription basis and automated templates are included in the software package. Your ideal customer is looking for an affordable and user-friendly way to access complicated tax documents for their business. In this example, your business’s offerings could be the solution they need.</p> \n<h3>Step 2: Identify all the benefits your products offer.</h3> \n<p>This step can be as simple as listing out every product you sell and describing its primary benefit. The benefit should be concise and focused on a single customer need.</p> \n<p>In our tax software example, you’d list each tax template, explain the benefit it provides, and why a customer would need it.</p> \n<h3>Step 3: Describe what makes these benefits valuable.</h3> \n<p>Next, add another sentence that explains why this benefit matters to the customer.</p> \n<p>Using the same example above, the value would be that customers have affordable tax documentation at their fingertips — something that would normally cost them thousands of dollars.</p> \n<h3>Step 4: Connect this value to your buyer's problem.</h3> \n<p>Next, pair the buyer’s problem to the elements that make your product or service valuable. Do they align? If so, you’re ready to refine your value proposition to differentiate your offerings from the competition. If they don’t align, repeat the steps above until you find a valid buyer need and a viable solution your business offers to meet that need.</p> \n<p>There’re three templates we think do an excellent job of connecting value to buyer pain points:</p> \n<h3>Step 5: Differentiate yourself as the preferred provider of this value.</h3> \n<p>Finally, polish your value proposition to make it unique. Is there a specific customer service offering your business provides that others don’t? Do you offer any additional services that other companies charge for? These elements can help differentiate your value proposition from competitors while keeping the focus on the buyer’s needs.</p> \n<p>Once you understand these steps, you can easily implement them into value proposition templates as follows.</p> \n<h4>Value Proposition Templates</h4> \n<ul> \n <li> <h5><strong>Steve Blank Method</strong></h5> </li> \n</ul> \n<p>Instead of focusing on the features themselves, Blank saw the need to emphasize the benefits derived from the features in a simple sentence. By following this formula you’ll connect the target market and their pain points to the solution:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>“We help (X) do (Y) by doing (Z)”</em></p> \n<ul> \n <li> <h5><strong>Geoff Moore Method</strong></h5> </li> \n</ul> \n<p>Moore provides a template that’s more specific in identifying the industry categories alongside the benefits customers value. This makes a more clear value proposition formula as follows:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>“For [target customer] who [needs or wants X], our [product/service] is [category of industry] that [benefits]”</em></p> \n<ul> \n <li> <h5><strong>Harvard Business School Method</strong></h5> </li> \n</ul> \n<p>According to HBS a value proposition is executed best when it answers the following questions:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>What is my brand offering?</em></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>What job does the customer hire my brand to do?</em></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>What companies and products compete with my brand to do this job for the customer?</em></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>What sets my brand apart from competitors?</em></p> \n<a></a> \n<p>Now that we’ve gone through steps and templates to follow, there’s some tactics we think you should keep in mind.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h3>1. Conduct research to determine the value proposition of your competitors.</h3> \n<p>Because your value proposition is the differentiating factor between your business and the competition, it’s important to research the propositions of your closest competitors. You can use the value proposition canvas in this post to determine how each company meets the needs of your buyer persona.</p> \n<p>Be honest here — it’s tempting to focus on the areas in which your competition doesn’t excel, but you’ll have a better idea of where your product or service fits within the market if you key in on your competitors’ strengths.</p> \n<h3>2. Explain the value of your products and services.</h3> \n<p>You’re probably familiar with outlining the features and benefits of your product and service offerings. This tactic takes that concept a step further. By matching the benefits of your offerings to specific values that your customers have, you’ll be able to align what your business provides with what your customers need.</p> \n<h3>3. Describe the benefits your ideal customer will experience when they choose your product or service over the competition.</h3> \n<p>When crafting this part of your value proposition, include details about how your product or service will benefit the customer and use examples where you can. Videos, photos, and live demonstrations are all effective ways to illustrate your value proposition because they show the customer exactly what they can expect from your business.</p> \n<h3>4. Develop a unique value proposition for each buyer persona you serve.</h3> \n<p>Ideally, you’ll be focusing your marketing efforts on a specific target audience. You’ll also find that this audience will have different needs based on their buying behaviors. Buyer personas can help you segment your larger audience into groups of customers with similar desires, goals, pain points, and buying behaviors. As a result, you’ll need a unique value proposition for each persona. Different products and services you offer may solve certain <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/uncover-business-pain\">customer pain points</a> better than others, so developing a value proposition for each persona will better serve each one.</p> \n<h3>5. Test your value proposition with your audience using various marketing channels.</h3> \n<p>Each of these tactics will likely be developed internally by your team which means you’ll want to validate your work with your target audience. Your value proposition will be communicated through various marketing channels like your website, social media accounts, video, audio, and in person. Test your proposition with members of your audience (both existing customers and non-customers) using each of these channels. Tools like<a href=\"https://www.usertesting.com/\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.usertesting.com/\">UserTesting</a> can help you streamline this feedback process so that you can implement changes quickly to finalize your value proposition.</p> \n<p>We know the makings of a value proposition, so how can you make it a good one? Here’s the last three tips we have for you.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>What makes a good value proposition?</h2> \n<h3>Clear Language</h3> \n<p>Your value proposition should aim to address a primary customer need. This limited focus helps keep your value proposition clear and easy to understand. With just one main idea to comprehend, your audience will be able to quickly decide whether or not your product or service will be the best solution for them.</p> \n<h3>Specific Outcomes</h3> \n<p>Next, you’ll want to communicate the specific outcomes your customer can expect to receive from your product or service. Will they save time? Demonstrate how. Will their workflow become more manageable? Show a before and after workflow diagram. The specific outcomes will be critical components of your value proposition as they’ll exemplify exactly how your customers will use your solution to solve their problems.</p> \n<h3>Points of Differentiation</h3> \n<p>Not only are your potential customers evaluating your business’s offerings based on their own needs, but they’re also comparing what you offer against competitors. As a result, your value proposition will need to include detailed points of differentiation. These key points will help customers understand exactly what sets your company apart.</p> \n<h2>Compose a Remarkable Value Proposition</h2> \n<p>The factors that influence a potential customer to become a loyal customer are limited. Whether your industry has a lot of opportunities to differentiate (like retail) or virtually no unique identifiers (like dairy), you’ll find that a value proposition will help you understand your ideal customer and position your business as the best solution for their needs. Use the tactics, tips, framework, and examples in this post to craft your unique value proposition.</p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in June 2018 and has been updated for

There’s no formula that allows you to create a condition based on color. However, you can create a custom formula based on E2’s values.</p> \n<p>You can say that if cell E2’s values are less than 0, cell A2 turns red.

audience.</p> \n<p>To help you, we asked consumers what type of video formats they watch the most. Plus, we surveyed marketers to discover their <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/instagram-marketing?_ga=2.168031905.1293077387.1645228002-849224622.1645228002\">Instagram marketing</a> strategies.</p> \n<a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=9294dd33-9827-4b39-8fc2-b7fbece7fdb9&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"New Data: Instagram Engagement Report [2022 Version]\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/9294dd33-9827-4b39-8fc2-b7fbece7fdb9.png\" align=\"middle\"></a> \n<p>You'll also learn what video format users like to watch on Instagram as well as the size, length, and aspect ratio you should be using.</p> \n<h2>How Marketers are Leveraging Video on Instagram</h2> \n<p>In 2021, we surveyed over 1,000 global marketers to understand which trends they currently (and plan to) leverage.</p> \n<p>The first thing that stood out to us is that ​​marketers who leverage video content on Instagram are 16% more likely to say their <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-for-business-guide\">Instagram strategy</a> was effective last year.</p> \n<p>We also found that 82% of marketers post video content on Instagram and the content formats they use most are video-based.</p> \n<p>The main difference we see in how marketers use video versus other content formats on Instagram is that they use humor more in video and market products and services less.</p> \n<p>As for the platform’s features, marketers surveyed say posting videos offers the highest engagement level and the highest ROI, more than images and live streaming.</p> \n<p>We know that <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/short-form-video-trends\">short-form video</a> is at the peak of its popularity on platforms like Instagram and TikTok and that could play a role in how popular video is. In fact, 85% of marketers say short-form is the most effective video style they leverage.</p> \n<p>With that said, only one in four <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-reels\">marketers use Reels</a>. At the time marketers were surveyed, they said it offered one of the lowest ROI. However, it’s still a feature they plan to invest in this new year.</p> \n<p>Now that we know how marketers are thinking of video, let’s switch to the consumer perspective.</p> \n<h2>Best Video Format for Instagram</h2> \n<p>Currently, Instagram offers three video formats:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>In-feed</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-reels-examples\">Reel</a></li> \n <li>Stories</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Back in June 2021, we surveyed more than 300 consumers to discover which video formats they watch the most. <img alt=\"lucid data survey results showing that consumers watch Instagram Stories the most\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/3%20Instagram%20Video%20Formats%20You%20Should%20Leverage%20This%20Year%20%5BData%20from%20500+%20Instagram%20Marketers%5D.png?width=600&amp;name=3%20Instagram%20Video%20Formats%20You%20Should%20Leverage%20This%20Year%20%5BData%20from%20500+%20Instagram%20Marketers%5D.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 600px;\" title=\"\" width=\"600\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><em><a href=\"https://luc.id/\" style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Data Source</a></em></p> \n<p>Ultimately, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-stories\">Instagram Story</a> videos were the most popular video format to watch on the social media site, with 43% of those surveyed watching this type of video content the most.</p> \n<p>Besides survey respondents who didn't use Instagram, the next highest video format to watch were live videos and then videos shared directly in the feed.</p> \n<p>The least popular video format was IGTV, which was discontinued in October, a few months after this survey.</p> \n<p>Now that we know how consumers and marketers are behaving, let's find out how you can post the best video content on Instagram.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>This is the proper video quality for a post on the<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/ads-guide/video/instagram-feed/video-views\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/ads-guide/video/instagram-feed/video-views\">Instagram feed</a>.

Attributes you might consider are color, size, and model. The reason phone companies include these specs in their marketing is due to research such as conjoint analysis.</p> \n<p><em>Would consumers purchase this product or service if brought to market?</em> That's the question conjoint analysis strives to answer. It's a quantitative measure in marketing research, meaning it measures numbers rather than open-ended questions. Questions on the phone company survey would include price points, color preference, and camera quality.</p> \n<p>Surveys intended for conjoint analysis are formatted to reflect the buyer's journey.</p> \n<p>For instance, notice in this example for televisions, the specs are the options and the consumer picks what best reflects their lifestyle:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/conjoint%20analysis%20example.png?width=706&amp;name=conjoint%20analysis%20example.png\" alt=\"conjoint analysis example\" width=\"706\" style=\"width: 706px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 10px;\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.surveygizmo.com/resources/blog/conjoint-analysis/\">Image Source</a></strong></span></em></p> \n<p>This direct method of giving consumers multiple profiles to then analyze is how conjoint analysis got its name. These answers are helpful when determining how to market a new product.</p> \n<p>If answers on the phone company survey proved that their target audience of adults ages 18-25 wanted a green phone from $400-600 and a camera with portrait mode, advertisements can cater directly to that.</p> \n<p>The conjoint analysis shows what consumers are willing to give up in order to get what they need. For instance, some might be willing to pay a little more money for a larger model of a phone if their preference is larger text.</p> \n<h2>Types of Conjoint Analysis</h2> \n<p>Choice-based conjoint (CBC) and Adaptive Conjoint Analysis (ACA) are the two main types of conjoint analysis.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>Choice-based is the most common form because it asks consumers to mimic their buying habits. ACA is helpful for product design, offering more questions about specs of a product.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Choice-based conjoint analysis questions are usually presented in a \"Would you rather?\" format. For example, \"Would you rather take a ride-share service to a location 10 minutes away for $13 or walk 30 minutes for free?\" The marketer for the ride-share service could use answers from this question to think of the upsides to show off in different campaigns.</p> \n<p>ACA leans towards a Likert-scale format (most likely to least likely) for its attribute-based questions. Respondents can base their preference on specs by showing how likely they are to buy a product with slight differences — for example, similar cars with different doors and manufacturers.</p> \n<h2>How To Do A Conjoint Analysis</h2> \n<p>To create a conjoint analysis, you'll first need to define a list of attributes about your product. Attributes are usually four to five items that describe your product or service. Consider color, size, price, and market-specific attributes, such as lenses if you're selling cameras.</p> \n<p>Additionally, try to keep in mind your ideal respondents. Who do you want to answer your survey? A group of adult men? A group of working mothers? Identify your respondent base and ask specific questions catered to that target market.</p> \n<p>The next step is to organize your questionnaire depending on the type of conjoint analysis you want to conduct. For instance, to run an adaptive conjoint analysis, you will present questions with a Likert-scale.</p> \n<p>You can use a conjoint analysis tool to create and modify your survey. Then, you can distribute your questionnaire through multiple channels, including email, SMS, and social media.</p> \n<p>For more ways to introduce product marketing into your company, check out our <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/product-marketing?_ga=2.125836493.1138478006.1643301254-748143700.1643301254\"><span>ultimate guide here</span></a>.</p> \n<h2>Examples of Conjoint Analysis</h2> \n<p>Sawtooth Software offers a great example of conjoint analysis for a phone company:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/conjoint%20analysis%20example%202.png?width=752&amp;name=conjoint%20analysis%20example%202.png\" alt=\"conjoint analysis example\" width=\"752\" style=\"width: 752px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><em><a href=\"http://www.sawtooth.com/index.php/consulting/conjoint-analysis-example/\">Image Source</a></em></span></p> \n<p>The analysis puts three different phone services next to each other. The horizontal column of the model identifies which service is offering a certain program, described by the vertical values. The bottom row shows a percent value of consumers' preferences.</p> \n<p>QuestionPro offers this <a href=\"https://www.questionpro.com/survey-templates/conjoint-analysis-retirement-housing/\">fun, interactive conjoint analysis template</a> about retirement home options. The survey gives you a scenario and asks your course of action. For instance, it asks if you would sign a rental agreement for retirement home housing immediately, and considers specs like rent, meals, size, etc.</p> \n<p>Conjoint analysis isn't limited to existing products. They're also very helpful for figuring out if a brand-new product is worth developing. For instance, if surveys show that audiences would be into the idea of an app that chooses clothes for consumers, that could be a new venture for clothing companies in the future.</p> \n<p>Looking to create a conjoint analysis of your own?

There wasn't a universal standard for measuring the success of an ad campaign. In fact, the term ROI (return on investment) wasn't even widely used <a href=\"https://mashable.com/2013/04/27/roi-definition/\">until the mid-1960s</a>.</p> \n<p>A lot has changed since then. Advertisers now have access to a wealth of granular ad tracking data for every single campaign they run. Ad tracking lets marketing teams leverage this data to more accurately measure, test, and revise ads based on how users interact with their online campaigns.</p> \n<a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=da1bfbbd-7ee9-4bf1-89d1-6d7a833deb08&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Download Now: Free Ad Campaign Planning Kit\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/da1bfbbd-7ee9-4bf1-89d1-6d7a833deb08.png\" align=\"middle\"></a> \n<p></p> \n<p>If you're new to running online ads, it's important to spend some time thinking about the specific metrics that will determine the success of your campaign. Ad tracking today exists across a number of different tools and platforms, and advertisers have the ability to collect data on everything from views and clicks, to impressions and behavior across multiple sessions and websites.</p> \n<p>The sheer amount of data available can be overwhelming (not to mention distracting from your goals), so deciding on one or two key performance indicators (KPIs) will help focus your efforts and make reporting more straightforward and effective.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>\"Good key performance indicators are simple, timely, critical to the success of a project, and not financial in nature. But you also need to add in one thing if you want it to be a successful marketing metric -- <strong>it must represent a key behavior you wanted to see</strong>.

The exact ad tracking methods available to you will vary based on where you run your ads and which tools you're using, but here are a few basic types to keep in mind. It's important to note that the following ad tracking methods aren't mutually exclusive -- in fact, when used together they can provide even more powerful insights.</p> \n<h2>Technical Tracking Tools</h2> \n<p>When it comes to ad tracking, technical tools are a good place to start. These include options for tracking URLs from your website, ads placed in emails or sidebar displays or webpages and cookie-based tracking to unpack user behavior and fine-tune your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-plan-template-generator\">marketing plan</a>. Let’s explore each in more detail.</p> \n<h3>Tracking URLs</h3> \n<p>A tracking URL is a normal page URL from your website with a tracking token added to the end of it. Here's an example landing page URL by itself, and with a tracking token (in bold).</p> \n<p>Regular old landing page URL:</p> \n<p><code>http://www.yourwebsite.com/your-landing-page/</code></p> \n<p>Landing page URL with a tracking token:</p> \n<p><code>http://www.yourwebsite.com/your-landing-page/<strong>?utm_campaign=test-campaign&amp;utm_source=email</strong></code></p> \n<p>As you can see, the page URL is the same in both cases, but in the second case, there's some extra stuff added to the end. This extra stuff is your tracking token, also called a UTM parameter.</p> \n<p>So how does this \"extra stuff\" help you track things, exactly?</p> \n<p>When a user clicks on a URL with a UTM parameter added to the end, it essentially sends a signal back to your ad tracking tool that the URL was clicked. The \"<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">source=_____</span>\" bit of the tracking token can provide information about where the user clicked the link. Similarly, the \"<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">campaign=_____</span>\" bit can be used to signal to your tracking tool that the link should be bucketed as part of a campaign.</p> \n<p>For example, if you were to run the same ad on multiple websites and wanted to know which one generated the most clicks, you could define the two different websites as sources in the UTM parameters of your links.</p> \n<p>You can learn more about tracking parameters and how they work in <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-are-utm-tracking-codes-ht\">this article</a>.</p> \n<h4>When to use tracking URLs:</h4> \n<p>If you're running a PPC campaign, sending an email, or putting an advertisement on another website, tracking URLs are ideal for calculating the number of visits, leads, and conversions you've generated from your hard work.</p> \n<h3>Tracking Pixels</h3> \n<p>A tracking pixel is a tiny, often transparent, 1px by 1px image that can be placed in an email, display ad, or simply on a webpage. When it loads, it sends a signal back to your tracking tool that a user has viewed the page.</p> \n<p>Tracking pixels are also capable of collecting pretty comprehensive data about a user's activity and browser configuration -- but you should only ever track information that is directly useful to your buyer's journey and will provide a better, more personalized experience for your target users.</p> \n<p>When used correctly, tracking pixels can help optimize your ads and get them in front of a receptive audience. For example, using banner ad tracking with a pixel lets you gather information about how many people just view versus actually click on your ad, which will help you determine whether or not an ad was actually successful (and worth running again).</p> \n<p>For context, here's how big a tracking pixel appears (no, that's not just a speck of dust on your screen):</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Google tracking pixel\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Ad%20Tracking%20What%20It%20Is%20%26%20How%20to%20Do%20It.png?width=400&amp;name=Ad%20Tracking%20What%20It%20Is%20%26%20How%20to%20Do%20It.png\" title=\"\" width=\"400\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 400px;\"></p> \n<h4>When to use tracking pixels:</h4> \n<p>Tracking pixels are incredibly useful for tracking the success of your online campaigns through every step of your conversion path. They can give you insight into how users are interacting with your ads, and help you optimize each stage of your user journey from initial touch through final purchase.</p> \n<h3>Cookies</h3> \n<p>Cookies can help you gain insight into user behavior on your website across multiple sessions of activity. Marketers need to gain explicit consent from users before using cookies to track their activity. When explicit consent is given, cookies can be used to customize a user's experience. Here's a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/customers/what-is-cookie-tracking\">deeper dive on cookies</a> if you want to learn more about the technical aspects of how they function.</p> \n<p>From an ad tracking perspective, cookies are the driving force behind most ad retargeting campaigns. Cookies can be used to essentially build a user profile based on someone's web activity and habits, and advertisers can leverage this profile to serve ads that align with a user's observed interests. They can also capture information about a user's browser configuration, location, and preferred language.</p> \n<h4>When to use cookies:</h4> \n<p>Cookies are ideal when you want to serve a user ads aligned with their web browsing activity, or retarget them with ads for products they've demonstrated an interest in. Cookies can also be used to create a personalized experience for users on your website based on their previous interactions with you -- for example, you could create an abandoned cart email when users put items in their cart and then leave your website.</p> \n<p>Now that we've gone over a few core solutions related to ad targeting, let's take a deeper look at how ad targeting functions on a few of the biggest ad tracking platforms, and how you can use it to make your own ad campaigns stronger and more effective.</p> \n<h2>Search and Social Ad Tracking Solutions</h2> \n<p>Brands can also boost their ad tracking ability by using tools that integrate with search tools such as Google or social media sites such as Facebook and Instagram. This type of ad tracking provides more in-depth information about user behaviors and preferences to help companies fine-tune their marketing efforts.</p> \n<h3>DoubleClick Ad Tracking</h3> \n<p>If you've ever noticed an ad for a product you viewed weeks ago following you around on the internet, it's likely the result of DoubleClick ad tracking. <a href=\"https://support.google.com/faqs/answer/2727482?hl=en\">DoubleClick</a>, which was acquired by Google in 2008, is an ad management and ad serving platform that enables marketers to run ad campaigns across multiple channels.</p> \n<p>Online publishers use DoubleClick to essentially rent out ad space on their websites, and agencies and advertisers use the product to place ads on websites where their target audiences are spending time.</p> \n<p>In 2012, Google <a href=\"https://adexchanger.com/platforms/doubleclick-no-more-google-renames-its-ad-stack/\">rebranded</a> their DoubleClick products as Google Marketing Platform (formerly DoubleClick), Google Ads (formerly Google AdWords), and Google Ad Manager (formerly DoubleClick for Publishers and DoubleClick Ad Exchange).</p> \n<p>Google ad tracking offers advertisers a number of different options when they create campaigns on the platform -- most of which rely on the use of cookies.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://support.google.com/admanager/answer/2839090?hl=en\">According to Google</a>, \"Cookies themselves contain no personally identifiable information. Depending on the publisher’s and user’s settings, information associated with cookies used in advertising may be added to the user’s Google Account.\"</p> \n<p>These generic cookies can collect information on the time and date you viewed particular ads, the specific web pages you were on when you viewed an ad, and your IP address -- which can help the cookie infer where you're located.</p> \n<p>Although the cookies contain no personally identifiable information, <a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/google/2019/02/05/google-has-quietly-dropped-ban-on-personally-identifiable-web-tracking/\">Google can combine</a> the information it obtains via cookies with the personally identifiable information associated with your Google Account (which includes your browsing and search activity when you're logged into Google -- which, for most of us, is pretty much always).</p> \n<p>Google leverages two main types of cookies: first-party and third-party.</p> \n<p>First-party cookies are dropped (i.e., assigned to a specific user) by the owner of the website you're visiting. Information collected via first-party cookies can help publishers better understand your activity on their site and how ads are performing.</p> \n<p>Third-party cookies are dropped by an advertiser on a website where their ads are being displayed. These cookies send information back to advertisers about how their ad campaigns are performing across all the websites where their DoubleClick ads are being displayed.</p> \n<p>Over <a href=\"https://trends.builtwith.com/websitelist/Google-Adsense\">11.1 million websites</a> currently run ads as part of Google's AdSense network. If you visit a website within the network, the information collected via a DoubleClick ad tracking cookie will be pooled and leveraged by other websites and advertisers using AdSense.</p> \n<p>This consolidation of cookie information results in an extremely rich pool of data for Google advertisers, as they can keep track of what ads you're served across millions of different websites.</p> \n<p>To get started tracking ads with Google, you'll need to <a href=\"https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/\">get a Google Marketing Platform account</a>. Depending on the size of your business and your particular needs, you'll choose either an enterprise account -- which can accommodate large ad campaigns across multiple websites and mediums -- or a small business account -- with ad tracking tools more focused and specialized for early company growth.</p> \n<h3>Facebook Pixel</h3> \n<p>Advertisers on Facebook can leverage a number of different ad tracking strategies to optimize ads for their audience. Facebook's <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-pixel\">ad tracking pixel</a> is one of the more common methods for both desktop and mobile ad tracking. It functions similarly to the basic tracking pixel we outlined above, and can be used to track the path someone takes from viewing an ad, to visiting your website, to purchasing a product.</p> \n<p>When an action takes place on a page where a tracking pixel has been set up, the pixel will \"fire\" and send that information back to your Facebook Events Manager account. Information collected via the tracking pixel can also be used in the creation of custom audiences for future ad campaigns.</p> \n<p>For example, you could use data collected via a tracking pixel to create a custom ad audience targeting users who viewed a particular page on your website that implies purchase intent -- like a pricing page. We wrote an article that goes <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-pixel\">deeper into how the tracking pixel functions</a> if you want to learn more about different uses and how to set it up.</p> \n<p>Worth noting? Because Facebook owns Instagram, pixel works the same way on the photo-sharing site and will deliver the same type of insights. Collecting data from both Facebook and Instagram in tandem is a great way to pinpoint strategies that may work well on one platform but under-perform on the other. For example, longer text-driven ads may drive click-throughs on your Facebook page but fall flat on Instagram, where images drive interaction.</p> \n<h3>Additional Ad Tracking Options</h3> \n<p>While the Facebook pixel can offer advertisers valuable insights into how ads are influencing specific actions on their websites, it's not the only way to track ads on the social network.</p> \n<p>Another ad tracking option available to help improve <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ad-management-tools\">ad management</a> is adding UTM parameters to links that appear on your ads. As we discussed above, tracking parameters use extra code on a URL to \"fire\" when a user loads the link. On Facebook, they can <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1016122818401732\">be used</a> in Ads Manager to better understand which ads you're running are driving which types of traffic.</p> \n<h2>It All Adds Up: Improving Impact with Ad Tracking</h2> \n<p>Competitive Ad tracking can help your business see how your marketing efforts and campaigns are performing at scale. This starts with URL, pixel, and cookie tracking to explore how users are interacting with your brand. It’s bolstered by search-focused and social-focused tools that help your brand discover where ads are working, where they come up short, and where they need to improve to increase user engagement and drive sales conversions.</p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in July 2019 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=46d72524-f4a7-44e9-9af0-935be9bb3891&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"Improve your website with effective technical SEO.

When you visit new places, you’re forced to get out of your comfort zone and experience something foreign.</p> \n<p>What makes design so interesting is that everyone sees it differently and so, there’s always more to discover.</p> \n<p>Another way to get design inspiration IRL is through the media. Every day, we are inundated with visual content. We make decisions about what we like, what we don’t like, and continue on our day.</p> \n<p>But what if you were more intentional about how you viewed those interactions? You could come out of it with valuable insights.</p> \n<a></a> \n<p>You also can’t forget to leverage design communities. From design conferences to Reddit forums, there are hundreds of groups out there that can offer inspiration as well as advice.</p> \n<p>Now that we’ve covered some IRL design inspiration sources, let’s cover the digital ones.</p> \n<h2>Website Design Inspiration Sources</h2> \n<h3>1. <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/cms\">HubSpot’s Asset Marketplace</a></h3> \n<p>HubSpot’s Asset Marketplace houses hundreds of website templates that you can sift through to get inspired for your own website.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"website design inspiration sources\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/34%20of%20the%20Best%20Website%20Designs%20to%20Inspire%20You%20in%202022-Feb-05-2022-12-30-34-43-AM.jpeg?width=600&amp;name=34%20of%20the%20Best%20Website%20Designs%20to%20Inspire%20You%20in%202022-Feb-05-2022-12-30-34-43-AM.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 600px;\" title=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p> \n<p>The best part of the marketplace is that you can narrow down by industry and feature, allowing you to see the templates that are most relevant.</p> \n<p>Once you find a template you like, you can view a live preview of the site to get a full experience then download it if you decide to use it.</p> \n<h3>2. <a href=\"https://dribbble.com/\">Dribble</a></h3> \n<p>Dribble is where designers go to get inspired and to share their work. The website has everything from animation and branding to illustration and mobile.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"website design inspiration sources dribble\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/34%20of%20the%20Best%20Website%20Designs%20to%20Inspire%20You%20in%202022-Feb-05-2022-12-30-40-51-AM.jpeg?width=600&amp;name=34%20of%20the%20Best%20Website%20Designs%20to%20Inspire%20You%20in%202022-Feb-05-2022-12-30-40-51-AM.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 600px;\" title=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://dribbble.com/shots/popular/web-design\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Once you navigate to the “Web Design” tab on the homepage, you can filter results by color scheme, editing software, timeframe, and tags.</p> \n<p>Furthermore, if you find a designer whose work you like, you can save the design for future reference and follow their work to see other designs on their profile.</p> \n<p>This is an incredible resource to use whether you’re starting from scratch or already have a solid plan in mind.</p> \n<h3>3. <a href=\"https://www.behance.net/\">Bēhance</a></h3> \n<p>This is another digital platform full of creative inspiration to leverage ahead of your website design project.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"website design inspiration sources behance\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/34%20of%20the%20Best%20Website%20Designs%20to%20Inspire%20You%20in%202022-Feb-05-2022-12-30-40-85-AM.jpeg?width=600&amp;name=34%20of%20the%20Best%20Website%20Designs%20to%20Inspire%20You%20in%202022-Feb-05-2022-12-30-40-85-AM.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 600px;\" title=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.behance.net/search/projects?field=web%20design\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>One of the best features on this site is the ability to filter by location. This allows you to see how designers in different regions differ in technique and style.</p> \n<p>This can be particularly helpful if you are designing a website for a foreign, unfamiliar market. You can gain interesting insights by evaluating the decisions made by Behance designers.</p> \n<h3>4. <a href=\"https://www.pttrns.com/\">Pttrns</a></h3> \n<p>Want to focus on mobile web design? Pttrns is the place to go.</p> \n<p>This subscription-based platform allows you to gain access to thousands of mobile design templates and get advice from top designers all over the world.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/website%20design%20inspiration%20pttrns--jpg.jpeg?width=600&amp;name=website%20design%20inspiration%20pttrns--jpg.jpeg\" alt=\"mobile website design inspiration pttrns\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.pttrns.com/\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Additional features on this platform include:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>A favorites and collections folder to store your favorite designs.</li> \n <li><a></a>A studio to interact with other designers and get advice.</li> \n <li>A design guide to understand the strategy behind the designs.</li> \n</ul> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<p>From familiar corporations to small businesses, to international organizations, the following sites push the status quo on the web. Whether it's the design aesthetic, usability, interactivity, sound design, or value that the site provides, each one is a masterpiece in its respective industry and something to aspire to.</p> \n<p>Not surprisingly, many organizations exist to highlight these sites and the contributions they make to the web. To help surface some of the most inspirational designs, I gathered several award-winners that have made their way through several key awards organizations — including Red Dot, Awwwards, UX Awards, The Webby Awards, SiteInspire, Best Website Gallery, and FWA.</p> \n<p>As you browse through the list, know that each site excels in its own way and seeks to serve a unique purpose. While one site may be an excellent example of visual design, another may be an excellent example of interactivity.</p> \n<p>This means that not all of these sites may be \"conversion machines\" or blueprint ideas that you can easily copy over to your site. Rather, they're great ways to gain some website design inspiration and see the cutting-edge marketing that's happening in the different corners of the web.</p> \n<p>Keep in mind that web designs are fluid and change often. Some of the designs in this list have changed since they were awarded, but we do our best to keep them up-to-date. We’re confident you’ll find a design here that sparks your creativity.</p> \n<h4 style=\"font-size: 22px;\"><strong>Read More:</strong><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/website-design-homepage-examples?hubs_post-cta=header\" style=\"font-style: normal;\"> 77 Examples of Incredible Website Design</a></h4> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/website-design-homepage-examples?hubs_post-cta=header&amp;_ga=2.71015760.191708588.1644020930-550792540.1644020930\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/website-ebook-cover%20copy-jpg.jpeg?width=210&amp;name=website-ebook-cover%20copy-jpg.jpeg\" width=\"210\" style=\"width: 210px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" alt=\"77 Examples of Incredible Website Design\" /></a></p> \n<a></a> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/website-design-homepage-examples?hubs_post-cta=imagebottom\">Download this free guide</a></em><em> to see even more examples of website blog, homepage, and landing page designs. </em></p> \n<h2>Beautiful Award-Winning Websites</h2> \n<h3>Best Website Designs from 2021</h3> \n<h4>IBM’s The Harmonic State</h4> \n<h5>Award: Site of the Month (July 2021), Awwwards</h5> \n<p>When you land on this IBM web page, it’s clear to see why the design won an award.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"best website designs from 2021: IBM\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/34%20of%20the%20Best%20Website%20Designs%20to%20Inspire%20You%20in%202022-Feb-05-2022-12-30-39-56-AM.jpeg?width=600&amp;name=34%20of%20the%20Best%20Website%20Designs%20to%20Inspire%20You%20in%202022-Feb-05-2022-12-30-39-56-AM.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 600px;\" title=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/resources/activations/harmonic-state\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>The best way to describe the website is as an immersive experience. In fact, IBM uses both visual and auditory elements to draw the visitor in and keep them engaged.</p> \n<p>When you first land on the web page, you’re prompted to put on headphones to get the full experience. Even if you skip this step, you’re drawn in by the interactive background that reacts as your mouse navigates on the page.</p> \n<p>In addition, the page is well balanced with a large title that grabs your attention across from a small description with a bold blue CTA.</p> \n<p>With a topic as complex as AI, IBM then uses visual storytelling to explain how its Watson tool works in the real world. Visitors can explore three stories through video game-like functions and learn more about the tool.</p> \n<p>It’s a fun and effective way to get users engaged in a topic that can be complicated and dry.</p> \n<h4>Superlist</h4> \n<h5>Award: Site of the Month (April 2021), Awwwards</h5> \n<p>Superlist is a productivity app that helps teams and individuals change the way they work.</p> \n<p>Too often, you land on a website and have to figure out what the brand is about.

However, to facilitate navigation, they include a small button with an arrow icon to indicate that there’s more to see on the page once you scroll.</p> \n<p>From there, the fun visuals continue – keeping you engaged as you learn more about the brand.</p> \n<h4><a href=\"https://www.flyhyer.com/\">Hyer</a></h4> \n<h5>Award: Website of the Month (2022), CSS Design Awards</h5> \n<p>Want to make a strong impression on your website visitors?

Aside from this being just a good service, the Overflow website practices what it preaches: Along with vibrant red call-to-action buttons for downloading the tool, this website promotes its product the best way it knows how — using a flow diagram.</p> \n<p>The website delivers this flow diagram in the form of a video.

href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/short-form-video-trends\"><span>short-form video content</span></a>; the rise and fall of new platforms (looking at you, Meta); and the continuing impact of the global pandemic. In short, what worked for your marketing strategy in the past might not fly today.</p> \n<p>To succeed in the fast-paced marketing world — and maintain a sense of relevance with your audience — it's vital to stay ahead of the curve.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>To help ease some of that uncertainty, we've created this guide to show you step-by-step how to create a marketing strategy that leaves no stone unturned.</p> \n<p>Let's dive into the critical components of a complete marketing strategy in 2022, followed by some examples for inspiration.</p> \n<h2>The Importance of Customer-Driven Marketing Strategy Steps</h2> \n<p>A robust marketing strategy will reach your target audience – this includes those who have never heard of your brand all the way to repeat customers.</p> \n<p>Without a defined strategy, you’ll essentially be throwing things to the wall to see what sticks. And it’s costing you cost, time, and resources.</p> \n<p>A marketing strategy will:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Align your team to specific goals.</li> \n <li>Help you tie your efforts to business objectives.</li> \n <li>Allow you to identify and test what resonates with your target audience.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>There are seven key steps to crafting a successful marketing strategy: Build your marketing plan, create your buyer personas, identify your goals, select the tools, review your existing resources, audit and plan media campaigns, and lastly, execute your strategy.</p> \n<p>Let’s get into the details of each step in the next section.

Build a marketing <span style=\"font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: 500;\">plan.</span></h3> \n<p>Wait, I have to make a plan for my strategy? What's the difference?</p> \n<p>Your marketing strategy provides an overview of the reasons why your marketing team will need certain resources, take certain actions, and set certain goals over the year. Your marketing plan is the specific actions you'll take to achieve that strategy.</p> \n<p>Not sure where to start?<a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/marketing-plan-template\"> </a><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/marketing-plan-template?hubs_post-cta=imageheader\">This free marketing plan template</a> can help.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/marketing-plan-template?hubs_post-cta=image\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/mkt-plan-cover-1.png?width=291&amp;name=mkt-plan-cover-1.png\" alt=\"marketing-strategy-template-free\" width=\"291\" style=\"width: 291px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" /></a></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/marketing-plan-template?hubs_post-cta=imagebottom\">Download for Free</a></p> \n<p>The right template can help you build a marketing plan that identifies your budget for the year, the initiatives your marketing organization needs to tackle, and the marketing channels you'll use to implement those initiatives.</p> \n<a></a> \n<p>Plus, it’ll tie everything back to a business summary, to keep you aligned with overarching company goals.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h3>2. Create buyer personas.</h3> \n<p>If you can't define who your audience is in one sentence, now's your chance to do it. A buyer persona is a snapshot of your ideal customer.</p> \n<p>For example, a store like Macy's could define a buyer persona as Budgeting Belinda, a stylish working-class woman in her 30s living in a suburb, looking to fill her closet with designer deals at low prices.</p> \n<p>With this description, Macy's Marketing department can picture Budgeting Belinda and work with a clear definition in mind.</p> \n<p>Buyer personas have critical demographic and psychographic information, including age, job title, income, location, interests, and challenges. Notice how Belinda has all of those attributes in her description.</p> \n<p>You don't have to create your buyer persona with a pen and paper. In fact,<a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/persona-templates?hubs_post-cta=anchor&amp;hsCtaTracking=7faf1d61-e857-4d2c-9cf2-10b32f7880af%7C7dda2041-868b-4701-9c92-417128517f48&amp;_ga=2.266419789.271348628.1571240896-940436819.1565181751\"> </a><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/persona-templates?hubs_post-cta=anchor&amp;hsCtaTracking=7faf1d61-e857-4d2c-9cf2-10b32f7880af%7C7dda2041-868b-4701-9c92-417128517f48&amp;_ga=2.266419789.271348628.1571240896-940436819.1565181751\">HubSpot offers a free template you can use to make your own (and it's really fun).</a></p> \n<p>You can also use a platform like <a href=\"https://versium.com/\">Versium</a>, which helps you identify, understand and reach your target audience through data and artificial intelligence.</p> \n<a></a> \n<p>Buyer personas should be at the core of building your strategy.</p> \n<h3>3. Identify your goals.</h3> \n<p>Your marketing strategy goals should reflect your business goals.</p> \n<p>For example, if one of your business goals is to have 300 people attend your annual conference in three months, your goal as a marketer should be along the lines of boosting online registration by 10% at the end of the month to stay on track.</p> \n<p>Other marketing goals might be to increase brand awareness or generate high-quality leads. You might also want to grow or maintain thought leadership in your industry or increase customer value.</p> \n<a></a> \n<p>Whatever your goals, identify what they are and how your marketing organization can work to achieve them over the next year.</p> \n<h3>4. Select the appropriate tools.</h3> \n<p>Once you have your goals identified, make sure you have the right tools to measure the success of those goals.</p> \n<p>Online software like social media schedulers gives you analytics to help you keep track of what your audience likes and doesn't.

Review your media.</h3> \n<p>Decide what you already have in your arsenal that can help you create your strategy. To streamline this process, think of your assets in three categories – paid, owned, and earned media.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/earned-owned-paid-media-lead-generation\">Paid media</a></strong> means any channel you spend money on to attract your target audience. This includes offline channels like television, direct mail, and billboard to online channels like social media, search engines, and websites.</li> \n <li><strong>Owned Media</strong> refers to any of the media your marketing team has to create: pictures, videos, podcasts, ebooks, infographics, etc.</li> \n <li><strong><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-earned-media-faqs\">Earned media</a></strong> is another way to say <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/user-generated-content-stats\">user-generated content</a>. Shares on social media, tweets about your business, and photos posted on Instagram mentioning your brand are all examples of earned media.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Gather your materials in each media type and consolidate them in one location to have a clear vision of what you have and how you can integrate them to maximize your strategy.</p> \n<p>For example, if you already have a blog that's rolling out weekly content in your niche (owned media), you might consider promoting your blog posts on Twitter (paid media), which customers might then reTweet (earned media). Ultimately, that will help you create a better, more well-rounded marketing strategy.</p> \n<a></a> \n<p>If you have resources that don't fit into your goals, nix them. This is a great time to clean house and identify gaps in your materials.</p> \n<h3>6. Audit and plan media campaigns.</h3> \n<p>Cleaning house segues straight into this step. Now, you must decide which content is going to help you.</p> \n<p>Focus on your owned media and marketing goals. For instance, will updating the CTAs at the end of your blog posts help you increase RSVPs to your event?</p> \n<p>Next, look at your buyer personas. Let's say you work for a video editing software company. If one of your persona's challenges is adding clean sound effects to their videos but you don't have any content that reflects that, make a 15-second demo video for Instagram to show how great your product is at solving that challenge.</p> \n<p>Finally, create a content creation plan. The plan should include topic clusters, goals, format, and channel for each piece of content. Be sure to include which challenge it's solving for your buyer persona.</p> \n<a></a> \n<p>For ideas on content creation or a more in-depth look at how to create a content plan, check out our post, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-creation\">The Ultimate Guide to Content Creation</a>.</p> \n<h3>7. Bring it to fruition.</h3> \n<p>At this point, your market research and planning should help you visualize how your strategy will be executed – and by which teams.</p> \n<p>The final step is to bring that all together and assign <em>actions</em> to your plans.</p> \n<p>Create a document that maps out the steps you need to take to execute your campaign. In other words, define your strategy.</p> \n<p>Think long-term when creating this document. A standard strategy document is 12 months. This structured timeline should be the home base for your strategic marketing efforts.</p> \n<p>To paint an example, let's go back to the video software company.</p> \n<p>Maybe in January, you will launch a software update that improves the exportation process for users. In April, you want to publish an ebook that explains editing terms to your buyer personas, and in September, you plan to launch an integration with other software.</p> \n<p>Remember, your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/digital-strategy-guide\">digital strategy</a> is unique to your business, so the document should be as well. As long as the strategy includes the pertinent details outlined in previous sections, you'll be set.</p> \n<a></a> \n<p>Now that we've explored the critical steps of a complete marketing strategy, let's look at some <em>\"Why didn't I think of that?\"</em> strategies to inspire your own.</p> \n<h2>Examples of Successful Marketing Strategies</h2> \n<h3>1. <strong><a href=\"https://www.regmovies.com/\">Regal Movies</a></strong></h3> \n<h4><strong>Digital strategy: Owned media</strong></h4> \n<p>Regal Movies took the Halloween spirit to a new level, even renaming its Twitter account to reflect the spirit of the season. This \"Monster Madness\" poll is a fun, interactive way to get followers invested in Regal's content:</p> \n<p><img alt=\"regal movies' owned media\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/The%20Step-by-Step%20Guide%20to%20Creating%20a%20Complete%20Marketing%20Strategy%20in%202021-1.png?width=400&amp;name=The%20Step-by-Step%20Guide%20to%20Creating%20a%20Complete%20Marketing%20Strategy%20in%202021-1.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; width: 400px; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" title=\"\" width=\"400\" /></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 12px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/RegalMovies/status/1183437779826556928\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Regal's tweet is an example of owned media because the company was in full control of the answers followers gave (and, apparently, <em>American Werewolf</em> didn't stand a chance).</p> \n<p>Regal effectively kept true to their brand by using only classic movies in their poll while still putting a modern spin on it.</p> \n<p>This is also a good example of how retweets don't necessarily equal success. While four retweets aren't that big of a deal, check out the votes: 461. That means there were over 400 interactions with a single tweet.</p> \n<h4>2. <a href=\"https://www.lacroixwater.com/\">La Croix</a></h4> \n<h4><strong>Digital strategy: User-generated content, earned media</strong></h4> \n<p>User-generated content is one of the best ways to gain traction in your strategy.</p> \n<p>It demonstrates your appreciation for loyal customers, builds community, and also incentivizes other users' to promote your products for the chance at a similar shout-out.</p> \n<p>Plus, sometimes the content your brand loyalists create is really, really good.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/lacroix.png?width=330&amp;name=lacroix.png\" alt=\"lacroix\" width=\"330\" style=\"width: 330px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lacroixwater/?hl=en\"><span>Image Source</span></a></p> \n<p>In this case, the consumer is praising the brand’s product. Doesn’t get better than a fantastic review like that.</p> \n<h4>3. <strong><a href=\"https://www.smallgirlspr.com/\">Small Girls PR</a></strong></h4> \n<h4><strong>Digital strategy: Event marketing</strong></h4> \n<p>Wait, is that Keke Palmer?</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/olay.png?width=330&amp;name=olay.png\" alt=\"olay\" width=\"330\" style=\"width: 330px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B3Zv_d5BmGs/\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Small Girls PR is a boutique PR company based in New York, and one of the company's talents is throwing amazing events for their clients, like Olay. This event recap carousel on Instagram is an effective event marketing example, as it boosts awareness for your brand and offers social proof by featuring a public figure.</p> \n<h4>4. <a href=\"http://superside.com\">Superside</a></h4> \n<h4><strong>Digital strategy: Paid media</strong></h4> \n<p>Design agency Superside launched an Instagram ad to promote a lead magnet: Their digital ad design guide. While the brand may have created the guide specifically for paid promotions, it’s also possible that they repurposed a high-performing blog post into a downloadable ebook.</p> \n<img alt=\"marketing strategy paid media example\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/The%20Step-by-Step%20Guide%20to%20Creating%20a%20Complete%20Marketing%20Strategy%20in%202021-2.jpeg?width=218&amp;name=The%20Step-by-Step%20Guide%20to%20Creating%20a%20Complete%20Marketing%20Strategy%20in%202021-2.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 218px;\" title=\"\" width=\"218\"> <p>In this case, all they had to do was repackage their current content, build an ad around it with creative assets, and run it.</p> <p>In previous sections, we discussed the power of leveraging multiple forms of media in your marketing strategy. This is a great example of it.</p> <h4><strong>5.</strong><a href=\"http://target.com\" style=\"font-size: 1.375rem;\"><strong> Target</strong></a></h4> <h4><strong>Digital strategy: Paid media, Twitter cards</strong></h4> <p>If you've got the budget for paid media, take full advantage of it.</p> <p>Paid media is when you pay social channels, like Twitter, to promote your content on their site. By doing this, your content reaches new audiences you might not be able to reach organically:</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"target marketing strategy example\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/The%20Step-by-Step%20Guide%20to%20Creating%20a%20Complete%20Marketing%20Strategy%20in%202021-Oct-13-2021-10-44-03-56-PM.jpeg?width=300&amp;name=The%20Step-by-Step%20Guide%20to%20Creating%20a%20Complete%20Marketing%20Strategy%20in%202021-Oct-13-2021-10-44-03-56-PM.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 300px;\" title=\"\" width=\"300\" /></p> <p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Target/status/1182673802746089472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">Image Source</a></p> <p>This inclusive ad from Target about fall shopping uses Twitter cards to promote the brand and make shopping easy with the click of a button.</p> <a></a> <p>More social channels are offering ways for shoppers to purchase in-app or close to it, driving sales and boosting exposure for brands.</p> <h2>What to Expect After Following Your Marketing Process Steps</h2> <p>Ultimately, creating a complete marketing strategy isn't something that can happen overnight. It takes time, hard work, and dedication to ensure you're reaching your ideal audience, whenever and wherever they want to be reached.</p> <p>Stick with it (and use some of the resources we've included in this post), and over time, research and customer feedback will help you refine your strategy to ensure you're spending most of your time on the marketing channels your audience cares most about.</p> <p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in October 2019.

Small business owners may lack the experience drawing up budgets; moreover, it's critical that these companies keep costs as low and lean as possible as they scale.</p> \n<p>Ironically, you need marketing to scale. Without it, it's hard to sell your products and services. In addition to the budgeting templates provided below, check out some of our <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/free-content-creation-templates\">free offers</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/free-online-marketing-classes\">courses</a> to mitigate your company's marketing costs.</p> \n<p>Yet marketing budgets can be difficult to establish for companies of all sizes.</p> \n<h3>How much should a company spend on marketing?</h3> \n<p>Well, <a href=\"https://insights.digitalmediasolutions.com/articles/digital-spending-2020\">digital media makes up more than half</a> of both U.S. and global advertising spend. This includes initiatives that cater to audiences on desktop computers, search engines, video streaming platforms, social media, and mobile devices.</p> \n<p>Given the success marketers have seen in it, you might consider planning to spend at least half of your marketing budget on some of these digital channels.</p> \n<p>Let's talk about other ways to allocate your marketing budget.</p> \n<p></p> \n<a></a> \n<p></p> \n<p>As you build a budget, there are a few items you'll want to keep in mind when planning your marketing budget allocation.</p> \n<h3>Marketing Cost Examples</h3> \n<h4>1. Software</h4> \n<p>When it comes to digital and even print media, you may need software to create your marketing campaigns or handle your daily processes. There’s a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-tools\">marketing tool</a> for just about any task you can think of, but they are generally broken down into the following categories:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/benefits-of-crm\">Customer relationship management </a>(CRM)</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/online-marketing-tools\">Online advertising</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-social-media-management-tools\">Social media</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-creation\">Content creation</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/website/free-web-design-tools-2020\">design</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/event-marketing\">Event marketing</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/lead-generation-tools\">Lead capture and lead generation</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-automation-information\">Marketing automation</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-marketing-analytics\">Data reporting and analytics</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/website/digital-asset-management\">Digital asset management</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/collaboration-tools\">Team collaboration</a></li> \n</ul> \n<p>The costs of these tools can quickly add up, so it’s worth it to try out the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-tools\">free options</a> until you’re ready to commit to a tool your team loves.</p> \n<h4>2. Freelancers</h4> \n<p>If you have a temporary campaign or want to test out a new marketing strategy, you might want to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/find-manage-freelancers\">hire a short-term freelancer</a> before bringing on a full-timer.</p> \n<p>Reach out to your network for recommendations or consider using a site like UpWork. Freelancers typically charge an hourly rate, so be sure to examine your budget before hiring.</p> \n<h4>3. New Personnel</h4> \n<p>When you do hire full-time employees, you'll want to budget costs including their computer, technology, benefits, and onboarding-related needs. According to research from <a href=\"https://www.zippia.com/advice/cost-of-hiring-statistics-average-cost-per-hire/#Cost_Per_Hire_Demographic_Statistics\">Zippia</a>, the average cost of hiring a new employee is $4,425.</p> \n<h4>4. Advertising</h4> \n<p>Budget how much money you'll spend on paid opportunities such as physical ads, native ads, sponsored content, search engine ads, and social media promotions.</p> Most businesses will benefit from some form of online advertising whether via social media platforms, search engine, or native ads. \n<a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/273018/number-of-internet-users-worldwide/\">Statista</a> estimates there were an estimated 4.9 billion internet users worldwide as of 2021. If you’re not advertising online, you're missing out.\n<br> \n<h4>5. Content Creation</h4> \n<p>When you create content such as videos, photos, or even blog posts, you'll need to put paid time into it.</p> \n<p>Content marketing brings in <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-creation\">3X </a>as many leads as traditional options, so it’s worth dedicating funds to this area. Budget how much money will go into creating this content so you can adjust accordingly based on its return on investment.</p> \n<p>Now that you know more about what to include in your budget, let’s look at how to those funds are spent.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-size: 12px;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Marketing%20budget%20breakdown.jpg?width=650&amp;name=Marketing%20budget%20breakdown.jpg\" alt=\"Marketing budget breakdown\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" width=\"650\"><a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/marketing/research/annual-cmo-spend-survey-research\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>If you’re not sure where to start with budget allocation, a good guideline to follow is the 70-20-10 rule. Using this as a benchmark:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>70% of your budget is allocated toward strategies you know work well</li> \n <li>20% of your budget is allocated toward new strategies aimed at helping you grow</li> \n <li>10% of your budget is allocated toward experimental strategies</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Marketing Cost Example</h3> \n<p>Let’s say your business has a marketing budget of $10,000. The budget allocation may look like this:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>$7,000 towards a CRM or other software you love, successful paid search campaigns, social media marketing</li> \n <li>$2,000 towards marketing a new product, feature, or service you’re testing</li> \n <li>$1,000 towards testing sponsored content</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Allocation by Channel</h3> \n<p>How you allocate your budget per channel depends on your company’s particular goals, so there is no hard and fast rule. However, the chart below from <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1222784/marketing-budget-share-channel/\">Statista</a> can give you a ballpark idea as it illustrates the share of marketing budgets from large companies across North America, the UK, Germany, and France.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-size: 12px;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Marketing%20budget%20by%20channel%20Statista.jpg?width=650&amp;name=Marketing%20budget%20by%20channel%20Statista.jpg\" alt=\"Marketing budget cost by channel \" width=\"650\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"><a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1222784/marketing-budget-share-channel/\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Organized by channel, you can see that the top spots belong to social marketing, digital advertising, and search engine optimization (SEO).</p> \n<p>By 2023, it's estimated that marketers will spend more than <a href=\"https://www.emarketer.com/content/digital-ad-spending-outlook-blows-past-previous-forecasts\">$52 billion</a> on ads across websites or apps that are mainly eCommerce-focused. Let’s look at some examples of how these digital marketing costs apply to your budget.</p> \n<h4>Paid Search Advertising</h4> \n<p>You’re probably familiar with the ads at the top of a Google results page that show up above the list of search results. Those are a form of paid advertising called <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ppc\">pay-per-click (PPC)</a>. You can <a href=\"https://ads.google.com/home/campaigns/search-ads/\">create and run ads on Google</a>, and each time someone clicks, you pay. The cost-per-click (CPC) can range anywhere from a few cents to a few dollars. You can use Google’s <a href=\"https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7337243\">keyword planner</a> to help estimate costs.</p> \n<p>With this method, you only pay for clicks you receive. So even if you’ve set aside a budget of $2,000, your campaign may only generate $1,500 worth of clicks.</p> \n<h4>Social Media</h4> \n<p>Like Google Ads, social media platforms have advertising programs based on the PPC model, but also charge by impressions. The CPC of running a paid social campaign varies depending on the platform of choice, but ranges from a few cents to a several dollars.</p> \n<p>Some companies may opt to hire an agency to run their campaigns and to create a social media strategy. Outsourcing this function is more expensive and can cost anywhere from <a href=\"https://www.digitalstand.com/blog/social-media-agency-charges\">$2,000 to $20,000</a> per month.</p> \n<h4>Content Marketing</h4> \n<p>Having a brand blog is a great way to get into content marketing, especially if you have in-house staff tasked with keeping it updated. Instead of a blog, you may be more interested in creating case studies, eBooks, videos or guides. They’re all designed to promote your brand and attract new customers.</p> \n<p>Content marketing costs vary widely based on what your goals are and area of focus. Hiring outside consultants or agencies to handle content marketing for you can range from <a href=\"https://www.webfx.com/content-marketing/pricing/\">$2,000 to $10,000</a> per month for small to medium-sized businesses. While it isn’t cheap, paying an agency to handle this task will free up your team’s time to work on other projects and may yield better results than going solo.</p> \n<h4>Email Marketing</h4> \n<p>Email marketing is a must-have for businesses, especially online retailers. With a customer acquisition rate <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/email-marketing-guide\">40X more effective</a> than Facebook and Twitter combined, it’s no surprise why this tried and true method is a staple in most marketing budgets. Email marketing also provides higher ROI as you’re connecting with people already interested in your brand.</p> \n<p>Email marketing costs depend on the size of your business, your goals, and chosen software or platform. Hiring an outside firm to handle these efforts will cost significantly more than doing it yourself.</p> \n<h4>Search Engine Optimization</h4> \n<p>SEO aids marketing efforts by improving your webpages so that they show up in search engines like Google. The more often your website comes up in search, the more potential customers will see it and hopefully visit your website.</p> \n<p>If you don’t have staff to handle your SEO needs in-house you may need to work with an agency. Depending on what your business needs are, this can cost thousands per month.</p> \n<p>While the marketing channel choices can seem endless, don't feel pressured to use all of them. Every business is different and you should prioritize putting funds toward the methods that best suit your needs.</p> \n<a></a> \n<p></p> \n<p>Spreadsheet knowledge <em>alone</em> won't help you understand how you'll spend your marketing money this year. Creating a sound marketing budget starts with knowing what purpose this budget will serve and which marketing teams it will represent.</p> \n<h3>1. Know your buyer's journey.</h3> \n<p>Your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/what-is-the-buyers-journey\">buyer's journey</a> is the steps your audience takes as they 'journey' from prospect to paying customer. Knowing your buyer's journey allows you to understand how your audience interacts with your marketing — and where to set your goals <em>and</em> budget to better reach your customers.</p> \n<p>Ask yourself these questions as you define your buyer's journey:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>How do your leads and customers typically discover your products?</li> \n <li>What do they need to know before they make a purchase?</li> \n <li>How many site visits do you see per month?</li> \n <li>How many leads are you generating per month, and how many of these convert to paying customers?</li> \n <li>What is the cost of generating new leads and then converting them to customers?</li> \n <li>What's the typical value/revenue of each lead?</li> \n</ul> \n<p>This process should point out what marketing tactics are (and aren't working), where you should alter your marketing goals, and where you can focus your marketing budget.</p> \n<h3>2. Align your budget with your marketing goals.</h3> \n<p>What you spend and where you spend it will depend on what you're trying to accomplish.</p> \n<p>So, when starting to create your marketing budget, make sure you're only spending money on the things required by your current marketing goals — goals set based on your audience and their journey from prospect to customer. These could include:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Display ads <strong>to promote a new product</strong> you're launching this year.</li> \n <li>Sponsored social media posts <strong>to generate followers</strong> on your new Facebook page.</li> \n <li>Paid search engine ads <strong>to drive traffic (and purchases)</strong> to a specific product page.</li> \n <li>Contract bloggers <strong>to get more organic search traffic</strong> to your company's website.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Former Demand Generation Marketer at HubSpot and current Head of Marketing at Tailscale, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessicacwebb\">Jessica Webb Kennedy</a>, says this about how your costs can change when focusing on lead generation vs. lead conversion: \"The majority of the money you spend on paid efforts is usually calculated based on the volume of clicks or impressions. Because of this, you'll often want to put more budget toward campaigns with higher-volume offers and audiences.\"</p> \n<p>\"For example, a tweet or Facebook ad promoting a lead generation offer that leans more top of the funnel will likely receive more clicks than something that falls more toward the middle or bottom of the funnel,\" she explains.</p> \n<p>Your paid advertising costs will also change depending on how wide of an audience you are attempting to reach.</p> \n<p>\"You can look at Twitter advertising as an example,\" Webb says. \"You have to option to target your campaigns based on users' interests or keywords searched for. Interests are a much broader category, whereas smaller pockets of users are searching for any given keyword, therefore your interests-based audience is going to be much larger and require a larger budget.\"</p> \n<h3>3. Beware of hidden marketing costs.</h3> \n<p>One of the great advantages to having and maintaining a budget spreadsheet is that it helps you avoid those end-of-the-quarter or end-of-the-year freak-outs when you realize, \"Whoa … what did I spend all that money on?\"</p> \n<p>In many cases, unanticipated costs can force marketers to fork over cash that they didn't plan on spending. Product marketing offers a perfect example. According to former HubSpot VP of Marketing and current CMO at The Wanderlust Group, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/meghankeaney\">Meghan Keaney Anderson</a>, it's easy to forget that successfully marketing your products and services requires more than just promotion.</p> \n<p>\"When people allocate budget for product marketing, they tend to think in terms of product launches and promotional activities,\" Anderson explains.</p> \n<p>\"That's certainly an important part of it, but another area of focus to remember is setting aside resources to conduct research and message testing long before the product ever goes to market. Having conversations with customers about the pain points your product will ultimately address is critical to shaping the messaging and having a successful launch.\"</p> \n<h3>4. Remember where your priorities lie.</h3> \n<p>Marketing is overflowing with add-ons and extras, upsells, and \"premium\" versions. One of the best ways to assess what's nice to have versus what's absolutely necessary is to (you guessed it) organize all of your expenses.</p> \n<p>By keeping tabs on where your budget is being allocated, and cross-checking that spending with the results you're getting, it will be much easier to figure out what should keep getting budget and what should get kicked to the curb.</p> \n<p>For example, let's look to the world of public relations. In PR, there are countless tools to which you can allocate budget, which could leave you overspending where it doesn't matter — and underspending where it does.</p> \n<p>\"Tools abound to help PR practitioners not only create and distribute great content and find and target key stakeholders, but to ultimately measure reach and effectiveness,\" says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathanieleberle\">Nathaniel Eberle</a>, HubSpot's former Director of PR &amp; Brand and GoTo’s current VP of Global Brand &amp; Creative Management.</p> \n<p>\"The key is making sure you're laser-focused on who you're setting out to reach and influence, then ensuring that your budget supports how they'll most likely want to receive (and share) your key messages.</p> \n<p>\"As the media and digital landscape evolves at breakneck speed, continually reassessing the tools, services, and programs you're employing is a great way to determine real-time ROI of your overall spend. Today's measurement tool may be worthless to you tomorrow.\"</p> \n<h3>5. Spend your budget smartly.</h3> \n<p>When you open up these budget templates and check out all the various expenses detailed in them, don't fret if you can't tick every box. I'm not advocating for an \"always spend more\" approach to marketing.</p> \n<p>I'm advocating for an \"always spend smart\" approach. The expenses listed out aren't mandatory — they're just meant to guide your thinking and to help ensure that you haven't overlooked any hidden costs.</p> \n<h3>6. Prepare to measure ROI.</h3> \n<p>When you put a certain amount of money into a certain area, you'll want to determine if your budgeting helped you or hurt you as you plan out future budgets. The best way to do this is by measuring ROI — or return on investment.</p> \n<p>If the money you spend on one item results in your company making more in return, you may want to increase budget in the next year. If your money went nowhere, you should examine your budget.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>8 Marketing Budget Templates You Need to Manage Your Marketing Spend</h2> \n<p>With the <em>8 Free Budget Planner Templates to Manage Your Marketing Spend</em><em>,</em> you'll be able to manage all of the moving pieces of your budget at a monthly and quarterly level.</p> \n<p>Use the Excel version of the templates to keep all of your budgets in one place.

That's pretty much it, right?</p> \n<p>Wrong.</p> \n<p>For example, does the venue come with tables/chairs, or will you have to rent those separately?

Hint: There's no right answer — it'll depend on the market research you do to figure out where your specific audience spends most of its time.</p> \n<p>If you find your buyer prefers learning and consuming content in the form of video, for example, you might invest more of your money in <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/youtube-video-advertising-guide\">YouTube advertising</a>.</p> \n<h3>Advertising Budget Example</h3> \n<p>Here's a small sample budget for a quarter's worth of expenses by a hypothetical company that has decided to invest heavily in video marketing. This template was created using the Master Budget Template, the first template listed in the section above.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/sample-marketing-budget-1.jpg?width=650&amp;name=sample-marketing-budget-1.jpg\" alt=\"Sample marketing budget showing a video advertising investment that exceeds budget by $2,420.\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<p>Based on the figures above, video advertising's total expenses for the quarter exceeded budget by $20, while full-time recruitment's total expenses exceeded budget by $2,400. This means the company is trending over budget for the first three months of the year.</p> \n<p>Why might this happen? Perhaps a pay-per-click (PPC) campaign on YouTube received more clicks by viewers than expected, and a sharp video-savvy job candidate negotiated a higher salary.</p> \n<p>Based on the difference between this company's planned spend and actual spend, their budget template produced the following graph:<br><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/sample-marketing-budget-graph.jpg?width=650&amp;name=sample-marketing-budget-graph.jpg\" alt=\"sample marketing budget graph\" width=\"650\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"></p> \n<h2>Create a Marketing Budget That Prioritizes Your Goals</h2> \n<p>A well-thought out marketing budget serves as roadmap to your team's success. Revisit the buyer’s journey, flesh out your goals, and stay away from tempting add-ons that are not in line with your marketing priorities.</p> \n<p>Go now, and plan wisely — your marketing staff is counting on you.</p> \n<p><em>Editor's Note: This blog post was originally published in December 2015 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=fec839c8-058f-4d11-8943-c7e0c554fa27&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px;

Getting Hired</em> and <em>Hire With Your Head</em>, <a href=\"http://www.inc.com/lou-adler/best-interview-question-ever.html\">spent 10 years</a> searching for the single best interview question that will reveal whether to hire or not hire a candidate — and this was the one.</p> \n<h5>A good answer to this question:</h5> \n<p>Candidates' answers will tell you about their prior success and sense of ownership. A great answer will show they are confident in their work and professional choices while being humble enough to show they care about the <em>company's</em> success. For example, if a candidate built a sales or marketing campaign they're particularly proud of, listen for them to explain how the business benefited from it. Did it help the company sign a major client?</p> \n<h4>2. \"Is it better to be perfect and late, or good and on time?\"</h4> \n<p>If your candidate responds with \"It depends,\" hear them out — the interview question itself is phrased in such a way that candidates can sense there is a right and wrong answer, and they'll be looking for signs from you that they're heading in the right direction.</p> \n<h5>A good answer to this question:</h5> \n<p>For most companies, the correct answer is \"good and on time.\" It's important to let something be finished when it's good enough. Let's face it, every blog post, email, book, video, etc. can <em>always</em> be tweaked and improved. At some point, you've just got to ship it. Most managers don't want someone who can't hit deadlines because they're paralyzed by perfection.</p> \n<p>Try to remain neutral as they feel out their response, though. They might not be able to relate to work that's measured purely by quality and deadline, but it's important that they can express how they prioritize their tasks.</p> \n<h4>3. \"Tell me about a time you screwed up.\"</h4> \n<p>An oldie but goodie. This is a tried-and-true test for self-awareness. (Honestly, well-prepared candidates should see it coming and have an answer ready.) Someone who takes ownership of their mess-up and learns something from it is usually humble and mindful. Candidates who blame others or give a \"fake\" screw-up (something like \"I worked too hard and burned out.\") are red flags.</p> \n<h5>A good answer to this question:</h5> \n<p>A good answer to this question will do two things well:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Admit to a genuine mistake.</strong> Often candidates will dress up a mistake with a self-compliment or excuse to avoid looking weak. For example, <em>\"I was so committed to X that I overlooked Y.\"</em> On the contrary, good answers will just show that they miscalculated, plain and simple.</li> \n <li><strong>Explain what they learned from it.</strong> It's one thing to screw up, but it's another thing to take that screw-up as an opportunity to improve. Great companies learn more from failure than they do from success — candidates who do too are exactly what you need to grow.</li> \n</ul> \n<p style=\"font-weight: normal;\"></p> \n<h3 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Questions to Test a Candidate's Work Ethic</h3> \n<h4>4. \"Tell me about a time you set difficult goals.\"</h4> \n<p>If you're looking for a candidate who is goal-oriented and results-driven — as most hiring managers are — this question will help you gauge whether they'll be able to handle the audacious goals you have in store for them. Ask follow-up questions like, \"What did you do to achieve them?\" Have the candidate walk you through the process and purpose of the goals they set out for themselves.</p> \n<h5>A good answer to this question:</h5> \n<p>A good answer to this interview question shows they understand what difficult goals are, and that they put a lot of effort into attaining their goals while maintaining a high standard of work quality. Listen for answers that describe a lofty goal and show <em>why</em> this goal challenged their normal targets. Responses that admit the candidate came up short of this goal can also indicate self-awareness and confidence despite a lack of success.</p> \n<h4>5. \"What have you done professionally that is not an experience you'd want to repeat?\"</h4> \n<p>A candidate's answer to this question will give you an idea of how they viewed work they weren't very happy with, which is bound to happen to everyone in every job at one point or another.</p> \n<h5>A good answer to this question:</h5> \n<p>HubSpot's VP of Customer Service and Support <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mredbord\">Michael Redbord</a> says candidates' answers generally fall into a few categories:</p> \n<ol> \n <li><strong>Something menial</strong> (e.g. envelope-stuffing). Pay attention to whether they understand the value of this getting done for the business, or whether they just think they're too good for a job like that.</li> \n <li><strong>Something really hard.</strong> Why was it hard? Was it because it was poorly planned, poorly executed, or something else? Where do they put the blame on it being such an unpleasant experience?</li> \n <li><strong>Something team-related.</strong> Follow up with questions about the team, what their role on the team was, and so on.</li> \n</ol> \n<p>Even the category of what they consider an experience they wouldn't want to repeat is interesting, says Redbord. When you talk about extreme experiences that get people emotional, it can be very revealing. Keep in mind, however, that good answers don't have to fall into any one category — what's most important is if they extracted value from the experience despite their lack of interest in doing it again.</p> \n<h4>6. \"What is your definition of hard work?\"</h4> \n<p>Some organizations move at very different paces, and this question is an effective way to tell whether your candidate will be able to keep pace with the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-build-a-marketing-team\">rest of your team and add value to your team</a>. It also helps you identify someone who is a \"hard worker in disguise,\" meaning someone who might currently be at a slow-moving organization or in a role that is not well-suited to them, but wants to work somewhere where they can really get their hands dirty.</p> \n<h5>A good answer to this question:</h5> \n<p>A good answer doesn't have to produce evidence of hard work — it should rather reveal if your candidate knows what it takes to get something done and solve the problems it was designed to solve.</p> \n<p>Answers that talk about working hard by working <em>smart</em> are great, as well. Always listen for this — putting in the work to find the <em>best way</em> of doing something is often just as important as the task itself.</p> \n<h4>7. \"Who is the smartest person you know personally? Why?\"</h4> \n<p>These questions test what the candidate values and aspires to by forcing them to think of a real person they know, and then articulate what makes that person smart.</p> \n<h5>A good answer to this question:</h5> \n<p>Ideal answers vary, but could include specific examples of the person they've chosen's ability to think ahead several steps and execute. They could also touch on the person's decision-making skills, ability to connect, desire for learning, or application of the things they learned.</p> \n<h4>8. \"What’s the biggest decision you’ve had to make in the past year? Why was it so big?\"</h4> \n<p>Here's a great way to figure out how a candidate approaches decision-making. Were they quick to make that big decision, or did it take them a long time? Did they spend most of their time reflecting on it by themselves or fleshing it out with others? How did they make a plan?</p> \n<h5>A good answer to this question:</h5> \n<p>Candidates' answers could be work-related or personal. In addition to revealing their thought process, as described above, an effective response to this interview question will also show how the candidate was able to prioritize what was most important when each possible option might have had its own advantages and disadvantages.</p> \n<p>If your candidate had hiring power in a previous position, for example, maybe they found it hard to choose between two job candidates of their own. A good answer might show that they saw immediate skill in one candidate but long-term potential in the other. Although both people had usable strengths, your candidate chose the second person because he or she offered he best return on investment.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/best%20interview%20questions-1.png?width=1080&amp;name=best%20interview%20questions-1.png\" alt=\"best interview questions\" width=\"1080\" style=\"width: 1080px;\"></p> \n<h3>Questions to Test a Candidate's Interests, Passions, &amp; Working Style&nbsp;</h3> \n<h4>9. \"Tell me about the relationships you've had with the people you've worked with. How would you describe the best ones? The worst?\"</h4> \n<p>Each team is different, so this question helps you tease out whether the candidate would be happy, productive, and well liked on <em>your </em>team. Their answer will tell you how they interact with others — and which kinds of interactions they <em>want</em> to happen.</p> \n<h5>A good answer to this question:</h5> \n<p>Answers to this question don't have to focus on just professional elements of a relationship with colleagues — they can also be related to business culture. Maybe the candidate enjoyed their coworker's positivity or thought their attitude lowered morale. Good responses aren't one-sided, though. Look for answers that explain how their colleague's work style thrived (or conflicted) with their own — not simply what their colleague did that benefited or offended them.</p> \n<p>Many candidates are hesitant to bad-mouth their coworkers and bosses, so it'll be interesting for you to hear how they navigate a question about their worst working relationships.</p> \n<h4>10. \"In five minutes, could you explain something to me that is complicated but you know well?\"</h4> \n<p>This is a much better test of intelligence than a college GPA, and it's also a great gauge of a candidate's passion and charisma outside of their core job responsibilities. Candidates who are passionate and knowledgeable about something — and can convey that well — are more likely to be enthusiastic and influential at work.</p> \n<h5>A good answer to this question:</h5> \n<p>The \"something\" in this question doesn't have to be work-related — it can be a hobby, a sports team, something technical ... anything, really. Good responses will tell you how well your candidate comprehends complex subjects and that they can articulate that subject to someone who doesn't know much about it.</p> \n<p>Explanations that use analogies also make good answers, especially if it's a topic that is filled with industry jargon. This shows that the candidate can solve problems by drawing comparisons to things that are more universally understood.</p> \n<h4>11. \"If I were to poll everyone you've worked with, what percentage would not be a fan of yours?\"</h4> \n<p>At work, you can't please everyone all the time. The answer to this question will help you find out if your candidate has enough drive and conviction in their own work to have ever conflicted with one or more of their colleagues.</p> \n<p>Obviously you don't want the candidate to be an unlikable person, though, so consider asking follow-up questions to find out <em>why</em> they might have alienated these coworkers: \"If I were to interview these people, what words would they most frequently use to describe you?\"</p> \n<h5>A good answer to this question:</h5> \n<p>The follow-up question about word choice is more important than the percentage they give in the initial question. In their answers, you should be encouraged by words like \"passionate\" and concerned by words like \"lazy.\"</p> \n<p>Of course, not all negative words are red flags — while words that indicate a lack of work ethic might be a bad sign, words like \"stubborn\" could show a candidate's self-awareness — and commitment to things their coworkers would rather move on from.</p> \n<h4>12. \"What is something you'd be happy doing every single day for the rest of your career?\"</h4> \n<p>While it's important to hire for skill, it's also important to hire someone who's likely to be happy in the job for which you're hiring. A question like this one will help uncover what makes each candidate happy at work — which is a great way to gauge whether they'd enjoy their role and stay at the company for a long time.</p> \n<h5>A good answer to this question:</h5> \n<p>There's no right answer to this question — it's more of a learning opportunity for you to see what your employees most enjoy in the industry. Nonetheless, a candidate's answer to this question should align with the core responsibilities of the job for which they're applying.</p> \n<p>A sales candidate who says they could lead client kickoff meetings every day, for example, is a much better fit than a sales candidate who prefers to create lead-generating campaigns (a task that shows a bigger interest in the marketing side of things).</p> \n<h4>13. \"If you had $40,000 to build your own business, what would you do?\"</h4> \n<p>This question is a favorite of HubSpot Marketing Team Development Manager <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ekueffner\">Emily MacIntyre</a>. First, the type of business they choose to talk about can reveal a lot about their interests, values, and how creative they are. Second, it'll give you insight into how business-savvy they are. By giving them a specific amount to work with (in this case, $40,000), they have the opportunity to parse out how they'd spend that money.</p> \n<h5>A good answer to this question:</h5> \n<p>The best answers to this question will get specific: They'll offer an overview of the business <em>and </em>get into the logistics of where that money would go, whom they'd hire first, and so on.</p> \n<h3>Questions to Test a Candidate's Knowledge or Interest in Your Specific Company</h3> \n<h4>14. \"Pitch our company to me as if I were buying our product/service.\"</h4> \n<p>This is a unique and more challenging approach to the generic \"What does our company do?\" question. It forces candidates to not only drum up the research they've done to prepare for the interview, but also show they can use this research to craft a persuasive message that would be valuable in a business situation.</p> \n<h5>A good answer to this question:</h5> \n<p>This will come more naturally to some candidates than others. Above all, good answers to this interview question are able to combine an accurate definition of your company with what it offers to your core customer that they need or can't get anywhere else.</p> \n<p>Keep in mind that someone interviewing for a sales or marketing position might find it easier than someone interviewing for a non-client facing role — and that's okay. You aren't necessarily assessing their delivery. But it'll be interesting to see how each candidate thinks through and gives their response.</p> \n<h4>15. \"What has surprised you about this interview process so far?\"</h4> \n<p>This is a question no candidate can really prepare for, and it'll give you some indication of how candidates are feeling about the whole thing. Plus, you can see how they think on their feet.</p> \n<h5>A good answer to this question:</h5> \n<p>You're looking for specifics here — something about the office space; the personality of the team; an assignment they were given to complete.</p> \n<p>Honest answers are good answers, and answers that are directed at <em>you</em> are even better, as they show the candidate is confident speaking their mind in front of decision-makers. For instance, maybe the candidate was surprised you asked them about something on their resume that they don't personally pay much attention to.</p> \n<h4>16. \"Do you have any questions for me?\"</h4> \n<p>This is another classic interview question, and like the one above, you're seeing how candidates think on their feet. The answer to this question also reveals what's important to the candidate. Are they wondering about company culture, or compensation? Are they curious about growth potential, or learning opportunities?</p> \n<h5>A good answer to this question:</h5> \n<p>There are no right or wrong answers, but personality and communication style are important factors when considering hiring someone to join your team, and you can get a sense of these factors with their answer.</p> \n<p><em><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=b15f5ee5-9381-4b6d-b503-a5f8997d6eff&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"marketing questions\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/b15f5ee5-9381-4b6d-b503-a5f8997d6eff.png\"></a></em></p> \n<p><em></em></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fgreat-interview-questions&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 22 Feb 2022 12:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/9cd76457-ee12-40f6-b9d3-53674b1f7714.png","linkMd5":"6387f16bdee8fb38e290119420a2e2f8","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn7@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-26-48-389_5f40cc83585676b8.webp","destWidth":604,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":6896,"destBytes":9546,"author":"lkolowich@hubspot.com (Lindsay Kolowich Cox)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/9cd76457-ee12-40f6-b9d3-53674b1f7714.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn7@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-26-48-389_5f40cc83585676b8.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/best%20interview%20questions-1.png?width=1080&name=best%20interview%20questions-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn98@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-26-52-080_23c2f1b0f7b8a396.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/b15f5ee5-9381-4b6d-b503-a5f8997d6eff.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn18@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-26-50-608_90aed6fd7d43f179.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fgreat-interview-questions&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn71@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-26-51-513_a4548ece2e4ad5d2.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647246408226},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:26:48","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:26:48","title":"How 500 Marketers are Leveraging Instagram Shopping Tools [Data]","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-shopping-data","description":"<p>Does anyone remember the days when all we saw on Instagram were poorly lit pictures our friends took and memes we didn’t want our parents to see on Facebook? Well, we’re long gone from then.</p> \n<p>The platform has evolved from a simple image-sharing social platform to a money-making content curation one. With the addition of Instagram’s shopping tools, it’s steering more toward ecommerce and less on the social aspect.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=9294dd33-9827-4b39-8fc2-b7fbece7fdb9&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"New Data: Instagram Engagement Report [2022 Version]\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/9294dd33-9827-4b39-8fc2-b7fbece7fdb9.png\"></a></p> \n<p>So what does that mean for brands? We surveyed over 500 marketers to learn more about their Instagram strategy. Find out below what we found out as it relates to the social platform’s shopping tools.</p> \n<h2>The Benefits and Challenges of Instagram’s Shopping Tools</h2> \n<p>When we asked marketers the biggest benefit of using Instagram’s shopping tools, their number one answer was the increased product discoverability.</p> \n<p>In the past, users had to navigate to a brand’s website to get product or service details. Today, they can learn everything they need to know about it. In addition, Instagram’s \"wishlist\" feature also allows users to save products they like to a specific folder on the app.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"lucid poll asking &quot;do consumers shop on social media?&quot; Results show that 24.5% say they have shopped on instagram. \" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20500%20Marketers%20are%20Leveraging%20Instagram%20Shopping%20Tools%20%5BData%5D.png?width=500&amp;name=How%20500%20Marketers%20are%20Leveraging%20Instagram%20Shopping%20Tools%20%5BData%5D.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 500px;\" title=\"lucid poll asking &quot;do consumers shop on social media?&quot; Results show that 24.5% say they have shopped on instagram. \" width=\"500\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/do-consumers-shop-directly-on-social-media-platforms\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>The second biggest benefit is the simplified shopping experience. Gone are the days when you need to leave the app to make the purchase. You can discover a brand and make a purchase all in the same breath. This means a more enjoyable process for consumers, which can lead to more purchases for brands.</p> \n<p>Another key advantage Instagram’s shopping tools offer is the ability to easily partner with influencers.</p> \n<p>Currently, creators can tag easily the products they’re promoting and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/do-consumers-shop-directly-on-social-media-platforms?_ga=2.29777660.2134660075.1645397012-1770650723.1645397012\">send traffic directly to the brand’s Shop page</a>.</p> \n<p>In addition, Instagram is <a href=\"https://business.instagram.com/creators/earn-money/affiliate\">currently testing an affiliate program</a>, in which influencers have their own Shop page.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"instagram affiliate program for influencers\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20500%20Marketers%20are%20Leveraging%20Instagram%20Shopping%20Tools%20%5BData%5D-2.jpeg?width=500&amp;name=How%20500%20Marketers%20are%20Leveraging%20Instagram%20Shopping%20Tools%20%5BData%5D-2.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 500px;\" title=\"\" width=\"500\"></p> \n<p>This allows users to easily find products recommended by their favorite influencers and make a purchase seamlessly.</p> \n<p>Now, onto the not-so-great obstacles of Instagram’s shopping tools.</p> \n<p>The biggest thing marketers surveyed complained about is supply-chain issues following many purchases. Since the pandemic, this has been a common hurdle for many businesses, as manufacturers deal with month- or year-long backlogs.</p> \n<p>Another concern marketers are facing is not generating enough revenue from utilizing <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-shopping-tools\">Instagram’s shopping tools</a> or having access to certain features.</p> \n<p>37% of marketers also complained about <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/help/223030991929920?id=533228987210412\">Instagram’s selling fees</a>, which is currently 5% per shipment, or a flat fee of $0.40 for shipments of $8.00 or less. For brands, this is an additional cost that they could avoid by directing traffic to their website instead.</p> \n<p>Another big concern is the loss of user data. When Instagram serves as the end-to-end platform, brands can lose valuable data to inform future strategies.</p> \n<p>Now that you know the pros and cons of the shopping tools, let’s break down how marketers are using them.</p> \n<h2>How Marketers Leverage Instagram Shopping Tools</h2> \n<p>From the marketers we surveyed in our HubSpot Blog Research, 32% currently leverage Instagram Shops in their marketing strategy, and 48% plan to increase their investment in 2022.</p> \n<p>While some brands tried the shopping tools as soon as it was introduced, others are just now diving in. In fact, 36% of marketers will be increasing their investment in Instagram Shops <em>for the first time</em> this year.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, 14% of marketers will be prioritizing Instagram Shops above all other features in 2022.</p> \n<p>However, one thing to note is that when compared to all the features available on Instagram, marketers say its shopping tools don’t offer a high ROI when it comes to leads. Posting content and going live offer much better results.</p> \n<p>With that said, while it may not be ideal for driving leads, it may work well for meeting other marketing goals.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"instagram shopping tools\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20500%20Marketers%20are%20Leveraging%20Instagram%20Shopping%20Tools%20%5BData%5D.jpeg?width=500&amp;name=How%20500%20Marketers%20are%20Leveraging%20Instagram%20Shopping%20Tools%20%5BData%5D.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 500px;\" title=\"\" width=\"500\"></p> \n<p>Out of all shopping features available on Instagram (Shop tab, product tagging, guides, Live shopping), the Shop tab is the most used tool by 47% of marketers surveyed.</p> \n<p>However, in terms of ROI, it’s in the #2 spot. What’s on top? Instagram Shopping from Creators, which allows influencers to tag the products they’re using in an image or video.</p> \n<p>As for shopping tools by format: It looks like in-feed shopping, Stories shopping, and Guides shopping are used at the same rate by over one in three marketers.</p> \n<h2>How Marketers Approach Product Launches on Instagram</h2> \n<p>One of the most interesting findings from our research is that for many brands, Instagram’s shopping tools are their sole ecommerce platform.</p> \n<p>In fact, 41% of marketers surveyed said most of the brands they work with use the platform’s shopping tools exclusively. The other 59% say their brands have a presence outside of the social platform via an ecommerce website.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"instagram in-feed shoppable post\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20500%20Marketers%20are%20Leveraging%20Instagram%20Shopping%20Tools%20%5BData%5D-1.jpeg?width=250&amp;name=How%20500%20Marketers%20are%20Leveraging%20Instagram%20Shopping%20Tools%20%5BData%5D-1.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 250px;\" title=\"\" width=\"250\"></p> \n<p>So the question is, how do Instagram’s shopping tools impact a product launch? One in four marketers says it’s much better to launch a product exclusively on the platform.</p> \n<p>In fact, 83% of marketers surveyed say they have worked with a brand that launched a product exclusively on the platform.</p> \n<p>Conversely, 15% say launching a product/service exclusively on Instagram is worse than launching elsewhere.</p> \n<p>We’ve covered <em>a lot</em> here. One fact that’s clear is that more marketers will invest in Instagram’s shopping tools than they have in the past. What works well for one brand may not work for another, based on the audience, the audience, and more.</p> \n<p>So, don’t be afraid to experiment with all the features and analyze your data to figure out what offers the best return on investment for your company.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=b1268983-9da6-4d67-9d3a-cfef2d9f3cff&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"Improve your website with effective technical SEO.

Creative Director </strong></h3> \n<p>Nowadays, brands are expected to create top-notch content across platforms. To successfully reach new audiences and increase sales, you'll want to have strong social media, content marketing, and video marketing strategies — to name a few.</p> \n<p>As Wistia's Creative Director, Adam Day, puts it, \"In the context of today's media landscape, the opportunity for brands to express themselves through multiple mediums is more attainable than ever — and consumers are demanding more than ever, too.\"</p> \n<p>Day adds, \"It's not just about blog posts anymore. Video consumption, alone, is <a href=\"https://wistia.com/about/state-of-video\">up 121% from 2019</a>, and in a recent survey of Wistia customers, we learned that most companies are increasing their production budgets by more than 10% this year. Businesses need someone who can oversee the creative execution of all this work while maintaining the consistency and quality it takes to have a world-class brand.\"</p> \n<p>That's all well and good. But what, exactly, does a creative director do?</p> \n<p>\"A great creative director develops a clear and engaging visual identity for your brand,\" Mark Tanner, Co-Founder and COO of <a href=\"https://qwilr.com/\">Qwilr</a>, told me. \"Visual consistency communicates professionalism, attention to detail, and builds buyer confidence in a brand's capabilities.\"</p> \n<blockquote>\n Tanner told me, \"The creative director should 'own' how a brand is represented across all visual assets, from your website to ads to product brochures to sales proposals.\"\n</blockquote> \n<p>Tanner continues, \"And if you think the impact of a creative director is limited to aesthetics, think again. According to a <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-design/our-insights/the-business-value-of-design\">study by McKinsey</a>, design-driven companies consistently outperform their competitors, demonstrating the ROI potential of a good design experience.\"</p> \n<p>A creative director can ultimately help your business hit its sales goals by ensuring your marketing materials are highly optimized, effective, and on-brand.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>As Tanner told me, \"<a href=\"https://pages.qwilr.com/SaaS-Buyer-Experience-Study-2021-Full-Report-tPfTLda8SiOI\">One out of three buyers</a>&nbsp;are influenced by the quality of your sales materials, and that influence can either be positive, or cause your buyer to go with your competition, instead. It's no wonder the <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/art-directors.htm\">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects creative director demand to grow by 11%</a>, faster than the average for all occupations.\"</p> \n<p>Among other things, you can expect a creative director to guide your overarching content strategy; build and manage a successful production process; lead, inspire, and nurture your creative team to drive brand direction forward; and own specific KPIs related to content marketing.</p> \n<p>Jenny Coppola, Head of Brand &amp; Communications at<a href=\"https://teamwork.com/\" style=\"color: #1e1f21; font-size: 12px;\">&nbsp;</a><a href=\"https://www.teamwork.com/\">Teamwork</a>, says, \"Creative directors should focus on ensuring that all brand touchpoints are cohesive and consistent, both visually and in terms of messaging, while also shepherding the idea of experimentation and concerted risk-taking within the team.\"</p> \n<blockquote>\n Coppola says, \"Your team's creative director should always be thinking ahead to what the future could look like for the brand and the market as a whole, which means pushing ideas further and challenging the status quo of what's expected.\"\n</blockquote> \n<p>Coppola adds, \"Equally as important, creative directors should be close to the customer, understanding what makes them tick inside and out. Knowing your target customer and being able to see the world through their eyes is the best way to build a brand that resonates with them.\"</p> \n<p>If you can only hire one new marketer in 2022, you'll want to strongly consider the importance of having a creative director if you don't already have one. Even a small but mighty team of marketers needs a creative director to nurture their strengths and guide the overarching vision.</p> \n<p>Additionally, if your business works with freelancers, agencies, or contractors, a creative director can help streamline those processes and ensure consistency across marketing channels.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/adam%20day%20on%20top%20marketing%20role%20of%202022.png?width=1200&amp;name=adam%20day%20on%20top%20marketing%20role%20of%202022.png\" alt=\"adam day on top marketing role of 2022\" width=\"1200\" style=\"width: 1200px;\"></p> \n<h3><strong>2. Creative Assistant </strong></h3> \n<p>The second most-voted for role in 2022 is a creative assistant.</p> \n<p>If you already have someone in a director-level or manager-level role, it makes sense to consider how you might help alleviate some of their responsibilities by hiring an assistant.</p> \n<p>A creative assistant is an entry-level professional who will create promotional materials for your brand — those materials could include promotional videos, advertising campaigns, press releases, or social media posts.</p> \n<p>A creative assistant will also help your creative director or manager by handling the day-to-day creation of specific marketing materials — for instance, they might write copy, produce designs or infographics, or conduct market research to identify future trends and campaign ideas.</p> \n<p>A creative assistant can be a strategic, long-term play for your team. A creative assistant is an entry-level position, which means it's someone who is often new to the field of marketing.</p> \n<p>You might hire a creative assistant with impressive design skills, or a strong knowledge of the various social media platforms, and foster his or her growth on your team.</p> \n<p>Simply put, a creative assistant is a hire who will continue to grow on your team and could ultimately have a strong impact on the future of your brand's marketing strategy.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3><strong>3. Content Marketing Manager </strong></h3> \n<p>\"Let's face it,\" Dan Seavers, Talkwalker's Content Marketing Manager, told me,</p> \n<blockquote>\n \"Consumers are rapidly changing. They are savvier, smarter, and more active in their research. And they no longer want to be sold to. They want to be educated, entertained, excited, enthralled, anything … but not sold to.\"\n</blockquote> \n<p>Seavers told me that this shift in consumer behavior has led to content marketing as an essential component for any business' bottom line.</p> \n<p>And a strong <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-marketing\">content marketing strategy</a> needs a content marketing manager.</p> \n<p>Why? Well, as Seavers puts it, \"To do [content marketing] properly, you need content. A lot of content. We're talking blogs, videos, podcasts, tweets, reports, case studies, TikTok dances, and more — all weaved into an epic journey that leads consumers from discovery to purchase.\"</p> \n<p>Unbounce's VP of Marketing, Meg Sakakibara, agrees that a content marketing manager is vital for any marketing team.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Sakakibara says, \"Content marketing managers are critical for brands today that need a voice that cuts through the noise, builds trust, and ensures content isn't just a pleasant accessory — it drives conversions.\"</p> \n<p>Sakakibara adds, \"After analyzing the most influential elements for conversion in 40,000 landing pages, Unbounce found that copy influenced conversion more than 2X as much as design did. Content isn't just the king/queen — it's the whole kingdom. By investing in content marketing and new technologies like<a href=\"https://unbounce.com/conversion-intelligence/\">&nbsp;Unbounce's Conversion Intelligence Platform</a>, people are using content and optimization to convert more leads, sales, and sign-ups to win in this competitive space.\"</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/meg%20sakakibara%20on%20top%20marketing%20role%20of%202022.png?width=1200&amp;name=meg%20sakakibara%20on%20top%20marketing%20role%20of%202022.png\" alt=\"meg sakakibara on top marketing role of 2022\" width=\"1200\" style=\"width: 1200px;\"></p> \n<p>So what should you look for in a content marketing manager?</p> \n<p>Among other things, an effective content marketing manager will execute digital content strategies across platforms, drive traffic and engagement, have a deep understanding of what types of content perform best on which channels, and consistently evaluate how each campaign performs — and shift when necessary.</p> \n<p>Additionally, Seaver told me,&nbsp;\"To be good, your content marketing manager should always have one eye on your consumers' ecosystem. <em>Where do they cluster online? What do they talk about? What are they looking for in a product? What problem do they have that you can solve? </em><a href=\"https://www.talkwalker.com/blog/content-strategy\">Their content strategy</a>&nbsp;will answer all of these questions, piece by piece. Slowly building that brand and consumer relationship from awareness — to having your consumers wonder how they can go on without you.\"</p> \n<p>Finally, a good content marketing manager needs to be a strong fit for your brand and goals. Content marketing is about delivering unique value to your intended audiences — which means your marketing manager needs to know, inside and out, who your target audience is and what they care about.</p> \n<p>As Microsoft's Group Marketing Manager Nora Xu puts it, \"It goes beyond a single touchpoint with an action to purchase your product, to a flywheel of inspirational and educational content that meets them where they are. On the <a href=\"https://ads.microsoft.com/\">Microsoft Advertising</a> brand marketing team, I look for people who can get into the mindset of our audience and create content that makes them feel seen and connected with our brand.\" &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Ultimately, <em>you</em> know what's best for your business needs. Take a careful look at your team's current strengths, and aim to identify a role that can help fill in the gaps.</p> \n<p>Once you're ready to begin the recruitment process, take a look at these <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-job-descriptions\">17 marketing job descriptions</a> to attract the right hire.&nbsp;</p> \n<p></p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=d976e6fb-0071-4c77-9973-772d11ef72d3&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"state of marketing\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/d976e6fb-0071-4c77-9973-772d11ef72d3.png\"></a></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Ftop-marketing-roles&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 01 Mar 2022 12:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/6baeae42-e710-4ecd-beb9-ceb2fb9f0877.png","linkMd5":"d895a86b573cb7af39e8c32a7ccebd00","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn50@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-26-48-407_0a6311d55189482b.webp","destWidth":418,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":4983,"destBytes":6716,"author":"Caroline Forsey","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/6baeae42-e710-4ecd-beb9-ceb2fb9f0877.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn50@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-26-48-407_0a6311d55189482b.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/adam%20day%20on%20top%20marketing%20role%20of%202022.png?width=1200&name=adam%20day%20on%20top%20marketing%20role%20of%202022.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn79@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-26-50-820_ed02f2f3a7ea9da4.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/meg%20sakakibara%20on%20top%20marketing%20role%20of%202022.png?width=1200&name=meg%20sakakibara%20on%20top%20marketing%20role%20of%202022.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn5@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-26-54-832_5352c828686f89a0.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/d976e6fb-0071-4c77-9973-772d11ef72d3.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn76@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-26-49-878_ba6ee21c8b9c368e.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Ftop-marketing-roles&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn1@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-26-56-552_aee9fbf5a5b1d711.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647246408215},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:26:48","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:26:48","title":"How to Insert a Checkbox in Excel in 4 Easy Steps","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/inserting-check-box-excel","description":"<p>Adding a checkbox to your workbook may sound simple but it can expand the possibilities of what you can do in <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/microsoft-excel\">Excel</a>.</p>  \n<p>From checklists to graphs, there’s so much you can do.

Something that works for one company may not necessarily work for another. <span>In fact, conversion rate optimization (CRO) experts hate the term \"best practices\" because it may not actually be the best practice for&nbsp;</span><em>you</em><i>. </i>But, this kind of testing can be complex if you’re not careful.</p> \n<p>Let’s go over how A/B testing works to ensure that you don’t make incorrect assumptions about what your audience likes.</p> \n<h2>How does A/B testing Work?</h2> \n<p>To run an A/B test, you need to create two different versions of one piece of content, with changes to a single <strong>variable</strong>. Then, you'll show these two versions to two similarly sized audiences and analyze which one performed better over a specific period of time (long enough to make accurate conclusions about your results).</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/a-b-testing-explanation.jpg?width=650&amp;name=a-b-testing-explanation.jpg\" alt=\"Explanation of what a/b testing is\" title=\"explanation of what a/b testing is\" width=\"650\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 650px;\"></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 12px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://cxl.com/blog/ab-testing-guide/\"><em>Image Source</em></a></p> \n<p>A/B testing helps marketers observe how one version of a piece of marketing content performs alongside another. Here are two types of A/B tests you might conduct in an effort to increase your website's conversion rate:</p> \n<h3>Example 1: User Experience Test</h3> \n<p>Perhaps you want to see if moving a certain call-to-action (CTA) button to the top of your homepage instead of keeping it in the sidebar will improve its click-through rate.</p> \n<p>To A/B test this theory, you'd create another, alternative web page that uses the new CTA placement. The existing design with the sidebar CTA — or the \"<strong>control</strong>\" — is Version A. Version B with the CTA at the top is the \"<strong>challenger</strong>.\" Then, you'd test these two versions by showing each of them to a predetermined percentage of site visitors. Ideally, the percentage of visitors seeing either version is the same.</p> \n<p>Learn how to easily A/B test a component of your website with <a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/articles/kcs_article/cos-pages-editor/a/b-test-a-page\">HubSpot's Marketing Hub</a>.</p> \n<h3>Example 2: Design Test</h3> \n<p>Perhaps you want to find out if changing the color of your call-to-action (CTA) button can increase its click-through rate.</p> \n<p>To A/B test this theory, you'd design an alternative CTA button with a different button color that leads to the <em>same</em> landing page as the control. If you usually use a red call-to-action button in your marketing content, and the green variation receives more clicks after your A/B test, this could merit changing the default color of your call-to-action buttons to green from now on.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/ab-testing-kit?hubs_post-cta=pillar_allphrase\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">To learn more about A/B testing, download our free introductory guide here.</a></p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>A/B Testing in Marketing</h2> \n<p>A/B testing has a multitude of benefits to a marketing team, depending on what it is you decide to test. Above all, though, these tests are valuable to a business because they're low in cost but high in reward.</p> \n<p>Let's say you employ a content creator with a salary of $50,000/year. This content creator publishes five articles per week for the company blog, totaling 260 articles per year. If the average post on the company's blog generates 10 leads, you could say it costs just over $192 to generate 10 leads for the business ($50,000 salary ÷ 260 articles = $192 per article). That's a solid chunk of change.</p> \n<p>Now, if you ask this content creator to spend two days developing an A/B test on <em>one</em> article, instead of writing <em>two</em> articles in that time period, you might burn $192 because you're publishing one fewer article. But if that A/B test finds you can increase each article's conversion rate from 10 to 20 leads, you just spent $192 to potentially double the number of customers your business gets from your blog.</p> \n<p>If the test fails, of course, you lost $192 — but now you can make your <em>next</em> A/B test even more educated. If that second test succeeds in doubling your blog's conversion rate, you ultimately spent $384 to potentially double your company's revenue. No matter how many times your A/B test fails, its eventual success will almost always outweigh the cost to conduct it.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>There are many types of split tests you can run to make the experiment worth it in the end. Here are some common goals marketers have for their business when A/B testing:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Increased Website Traffic:</strong> Testing different blog post titles or webpage titles can change the number of people who click on that hyperlinked title to get to your website. This can increase website traffic as a result.</li> \n <li><strong>Higher Conversion Rate:</strong> Testing different locations, colors, or even anchor text on your CTAs can change the number of people who click these CTAs to get to a landing page. This can <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/a-b-test-landing-page-form-copy\">increase the number of people who fill out forms on your website</a>, submit their contact info to you, and \"convert\" into a lead.</li> \n <li><strong>Lower Bounce Rate:</strong> If your website visitors leave (or \"bounce\") quickly after visiting your website, testing different blog post introductions, fonts, or featured images can reduce this bounce rate and retain more visitors.</li> \n <li><strong>Lower Cart Abandonment:</strong> Ecommerce businesses see an average of <a href=\"https://baymard.com/lists/cart-abandonment-rate\">70% of customers leave their website with items in their shopping cart</a>. This is known as \"shopping cart abandonment\" and is, of course, detrimental to any online store. Testing different product photos, check-out page designs, and even where shipping costs are displayed can lower this abandonment rate.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Now, let's walk through the checklist for setting up, running, and measuring an A/B test.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>How to Conduct A/B Testing<a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/ab-testing-kit?hubs_post-cta=imagebody&amp;_ga=2.4361779.1667640274.1563800435-1307414301.1541080541\"></a></h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/ab-testing-kit?hubs_post-cta=imagebody&amp;_ga=2.4361779.1667640274.1563800435-1307414301.1541080541\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/kissmetrics_Abtestkit_headerimage.png?width=650&amp;name=kissmetrics_Abtestkit_headerimage.png\" alt=\"ab test graphic\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"></a></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/ab-testing-kit?hubs_post-cta=imagebody&amp;_ga=2.4361779.1667640274.1563800435-1307414301.1541080541\"></a><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/ab-testing-kit?hubs_post-cta=pillar_allphrase\" style=\"font-weight: normal;\"></a><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/ab-testing-kit?hubs_post-cta=pillar_allphrase\"><em>Follow along with our free A/B testing kit with everything you need to run A/B testing including a test tracking template, a how-to guide for instruction and inspiration, and a statistical significance calculator to see if your tests were wins, losses, or inconclusive.</em></a><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/ab-testing-kit?hubs_post-cta=imagebody&amp;_ga=2.4361779.1667640274.1563800435-1307414301.1541080541\"></a></p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Before the A/B Test</h3> \n<p>Let's cover the steps to take before you start your A/B test.</p> \n<h4>1. Pick one variable to test.</h4> \n<p>As you optimize your web pages and emails, you might find <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/26785/20-variables-every-marketer-should-be-testing.aspx\">there are a number of variables you want to test</a>. But to evaluate how effective a change is, you'll want to isolate one \"<strong>independent variable</strong>\" and measure its performance. Otherwise, you can't be sure which variable was responsible for changes in performance.</p> \n<p>You can test more than one variable for a single web page or email — just be sure you're testing them one at a time.</p> \n<p>To determine your variable, look at the elements in your marketing resources and their possible alternatives for design, wording, and layout. Other things you might test include email subject lines, sender names, and different ways to personalize your emails.</p> \n<p>Keep in mind that even simple changes, like changing the image in your email <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/call-to-action-ab-testing-ht\">or the words on your call-to-action button</a>, can drive big improvements. In fact, these sorts of changes are usually easier to measure than the bigger ones.</p> \n<p><strong>Note: </strong>There are some times when it makes more sense to test multiple variables rather than a single variable. This is a process called multivariate testing. If you're wondering whether you should run an A/B test versus a multivariate test, <a href=\"https://www.optimizely.com/resources/multivariate-test-vs-ab-test/\">here's a helpful article from Optimizely</a> that compares the two processes.</p> \n<h4>2. Identify your goal.</h4> \n<p>Although you'll measure several metrics during any one test, choose a primary metric to focus on <em>before</em> you run the test. In fact, do it before you even set up the second variation. This is your \"<strong>dependent variable</strong>,\" which changes based on how you manipulate the independent variable.</p> \n<p>Think about where you want this dependent variable to be at the end of the split test. You might even state an official <strong>hypothesis</strong> and examine your results based on this prediction.</p> \n<p>If you wait until afterward to think about which metrics are important to you, what your goals are, and how the changes you're proposing might affect user behavior, then you might not set up the test in the most effective way.</p> \n<h4>3. Create a 'control' and a 'challenger.'</h4> \n<p>You now have your independent variable, your dependent variable, and your desired outcome. Use this information to set up the unaltered version of whatever you're testing as your control scenario. If you're testing a web page, this is the unaltered page as it exists already. If you're testing a landing page, this would be the landing page design and copy you would normally use.</p> \n<p>From there, build a challenger — the altered website, landing page, or email that you’ll test against your control. For example, if you're wondering whether <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/social-proof-examples-landing-pages\">adding a testimonial to a landing page</a> would make a difference in conversions, set up your control page with no testimonials. Then, create your challenger with a testimonial.</p> \n<h4>4. Split your sample groups equally and randomly.</h4> \n<p>For tests where you have more control over the audience — like with emails — you need to test with two or more audiences that are equal in order to have conclusive results.</p> \n<p>How you do this will vary depending on the A/B testing tool you use. If you're a <a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/email-user-guide-v2/how-to-utilize-ab-testing-in-email\">HubSpot Enterprise customer conducting an A/B test on an email</a>, for example, HubSpot will automatically split traffic to your variations so that each variation gets a random sampling of visitors.</p> \n<h4>5. Determine your sample size (if applicable).</h4> \n<p>How you <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/email-a-b-test-sample-size-testing-time\">determine your sample size</a> will also vary depending on your A/B testing tool, as well as the type of A/B test you're running.</p> \n<p>If you're A/B testing an email, you'll probably want to send an A/B test to a subset of your list that is large enough to achieve statistically significant results. Eventually, you'll pick a winner and send the winning variation on to the rest of the list. (See \"The Science of Split Testing\" ebook at the end of this article for more on calculating your sample size.)</p> \n<p>If you're a HubSpot Enterprise customer, you'll have some help determining the size of your sample group using a slider. It'll let you do a 50/50 A/B test of any sample size — although all other sample splits require a list of at least 1,000 recipients.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/how-to-do-a-b-testing-2.png?width=650&amp;name=how-to-do-a-b-testing-2.png\" alt=\"ab testing sample size settings in hubspot\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>If you're testing something that <em>doesn't</em> have a finite audience, like a web page, then how long you keep your test running will directly affect your sample size. You'll need to let your test run long enough to obtain a substantial number of views. Otherwise, it will be hard to tell whether there was a statistically significant difference between variations.</p> \n<h4>6. Decide how significant your results need to be.</h4> \n<p>Once you've picked your goal metric, think about how significant your results need to be to justify choosing one variation over another. Statistical significance is a super important part of the A/B testing process that's often misunderstood. If you need a refresher, I recommend <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketers-guide-understanding-statistical-significance\">reading this blog post on statistical significance from a marketing standpoint</a>.</p> \n<p>The higher the percentage of your confidence level, the more sure you can be about your results. In most cases, you'll want a confidence level of 95% minimum — preferably even 98% — especially if it was a time-intensive experiment to set up. However, sometimes it makes sense to use a lower confidence rate if you don't need the test to be as stringent.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-rheault-322b051b\">Matt Rheault</a>, a senior software engineer at HubSpot, likes to think of statistical significance like placing a bet. What odds are you comfortable placing a bet on? Saying \"I'm 80% sure this is the right design and I'm willing to bet everything on it\" is similar to running an A/B test to 80% significance and then declaring a winner.</p> \n<p>Rheault also says you’ll likely want a higher confidence threshold when testing for something that only slightly improves conversion rate. Why? Because random variance is more likely to play a bigger role.</p> \n<p>\"An example where we could feel safer lowering our confidence threshold is an experiment that will likely improve conversion rate by 10% or more, such as a redesigned hero section,\" he explained.</p> \n<p>\"The takeaway here is that the more radical the change, the less scientific we need to be process-wise. The more specific the change (button color, microcopy, etc.), the more scientific we should be because the change is less likely to have a large and noticeable impact on conversion rate.\"</p> \n<h4>7. Make sure you're only running one test at a time on any campaign.</h4> \n<p>Testing more than one thing for a single campaign — even if it's not on the same exact asset — can complicate results. For example, if you A/B test an email campaign that directs to a landing page at the same time that you’re A/B testing that landing page, how can you know which change caused the increase in leads?</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>During the A/B Test</h3> \n<p>Let's cover the steps to take during your A/B test.</p> \n<h4>8. Use an A/B testing tool.</h4> \n<p>To do an A/B test on your website or in an email, you'll need to use an A/B testing tool. If you're a HubSpot Enterprise customer, the HubSpot software has features that let you A/B test emails (<a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/email-user-guide-v2/how-to-utilize-ab-testing-in-email\">learn how here</a>), calls-to-action (<a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/cta-user-guide-v2/how-to-create-an-a-b-variation-test-for-calls-to-action\">learn how here</a>), and landing pages (<a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/landing-page-user-guide-v2/how-to-ab-test-landing-pages\">learn how here</a>).</p> \n<p>For non-HubSpot Enterprise customers, other options include <a href=\"http://www.google.com/analytics\">Google Analytics</a>, which lets you A/B test up to 10 full versions of a single web page and compare their performance using a random sample of users.</p> \n<h4>9. Test both variations simultaneously.</h4> \n<p>Timing plays a significant role in your marketing campaign’s results, whether it's time of day, day of the week, or month of the year. If you were to run Version A during one month and Version B a month later, how would you know whether the performance change was caused by the different design or the different month?</p> \n<p>When you run A/B tests, you'll need to run the two variations at the same time, otherwise you may be left second-guessing your results.</p> \n<p>The only exception here is if you're testing timing itself, like finding the optimal times for sending out emails. This is a great thing to test because depending on what your business offers and who your subscribers are, the optimal time for subscriber engagement can vary significantly by industry and target market.</p> \n<h4>10. Give the A/B test enough time to produce useful data.</h4> \n<p>Again, you'll want to make sure that you let your test run long enough to obtain a substantial sample size. Otherwise, it'll be hard to tell whether there was a statistically significant difference between the two variations.</p> \n<p>How long is long enough? Depending on your company and how you execute the A/B test, getting statistically significant results could happen in hours ... or days ... or weeks. A big part of how long it takes to get statistically significant results is how much traffic you get — so if your business doesn't get a lot of traffic to your website, it'll take much longer for you to run an A/B test.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/email-a-b-test-sample-size-testing-time\">Read this blog post to learn more about sample size and timing</a>.</p> \n<h4>11. Ask for feedback from real users.</h4> \n<p>A/B testing has a lot to do with quantitative data ... but that won't necessarily help you understand <em>why</em> people take certain actions over others. While you're running your A/B test, why not collect qualitative feedback from real users?</p> \n<p>One of the best ways to ask people for their opinions is <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/art-asking-survey-questions\">through a survey or poll</a>. You might add an exit survey on your site that asks visitors why they didn't click on a certain CTA, or one on your thank-you pages that asks visitors why they clicked a button or filled out a form.</p> \n<p>You might find, for example, that a lot of people clicked on a call-to-action leading them to an ebook, but once they saw the price, they didn't convert. That kind of information will give you a lot of insight into why your users are behaving in certain ways.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>After the A/B Test</h3> \n<p>Finally, let's cover the steps to take after your A/B test.</p> \n<h4>12. Focus on your goal metric.</h4> \n<p>Again, although you'll be measuring multiple metrics, keep your focus on that primary goal metric when you do your analysis.</p> \n<p>For example, if you tested two variations of an email and chose leads as your primary metric, don’t get caught up on open rate or click-through rate. You might see a high click-through rate and poor conversion rates, in which case you might end up choosing the variation that had a lower click-through rate in the end.</p> \n<h4>13. Measure the significance of your results using our A/B testing calculator.</h4> \n<p>Now that you've determined which variation performs the best, it's time to determine whether your results are statistically significant. In other words, are they enough to justify a change?</p> \n<p>To find out, you'll need to conduct a test of statistical significance. You could do that manually ... or you could just plug in the results from your experiment to <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/ab-test-calculator\">our free A/B testing calculator</a>.</p> \n<p>For each variation you tested, you'll be prompted to input the total number of tries, like emails sent or impressions seen. Then, enter the number of goals it completed — generally you'll look at clicks, but this could also be other types of conversions.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/hubspot-a-b-testing-calculator.png?width=1500&amp;name=hubspot-a-b-testing-calculator.png\" alt=\"hubspot ab testing calculator\" title=\"hubspot-a-b-testing-calculator.png\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; margin: 0px auto;\"></p> \n<p>The calculator will spit out the confidence level your data produces for the winning variation. Then, measure that number against the value you chose to determine statistical significance.</p> \n<h4>14. Take action based on your results.</h4> \n<p>If one variation is statistically better than the other, you have a winner. Complete your test by disabling the losing variation in your A/B testing tool.</p> \n<p>If neither variation is statistically better, you've just learned that the variable you tested didn't impact results, and you'll have to mark the test as inconclusive. In this case, stick with the original variation, or run another test. You can use the failed data to help you figure out a new iteration on your new test.</p> \n<p>While A/B tests help you impact results on a case-by-case basis, you can also apply the lessons you learn from each test and apply it to future efforts.</p> \n<p>For example, if you've conducted A/B tests in your email marketing and have repeatedly found that using numbers in email subject lines generates better clickthrough rates, you might want to consider using that tactic in more of your emails.</p> \n<h4>15. Plan your next A/B test.</h4> \n<p>The A/B test you just finished may have helped you discover a new way to make your marketing content more effective — but don't stop there. There’s always room for more optimization.</p> \n<p>You can even try conducting an A/B test on another feature of the same web page or email you just did a test on. For example, if you just tested a headline on a landing page, why not do a new test on body copy? Or a color scheme? Or images? Always keep an eye out for opportunities to increase conversion rates and leads.</p> \n<p>You can use HubSpot’s A/B Test Tracking Kit to plan and organize your experiments.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/ab-testing-kit\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/ab%20test%20tracking.png?width=1410&amp;name=ab%20test%20tracking.png\" alt=\"ab test tracking\" width=\"1410\" style=\"width: 1410px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></a></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/ab-testing-kit?_ga=2.268392270.1136205898.1644610869-1937536568.1644610869\">Download This Template Now</a></p> \n<h2>How to Read A/B Testing Results</h2> \n<p>As a marketer, you know the value of automation. Given this, you likely use software that handles the A/B test calculations for you — a huge help. But, after the calculations are done, you need to know how to read your results. Let’s go over how.</p> \n<h3>1. Check your goal metric.</h3> \n<p>The first step in reading your A/B test results is looking at your goal metric, which is usually conversion rate. After you’ve plugged your results into your A/B testing calculator, you’ll get two results for each version you’re testing. You’ll also get a significant result for each of your variations.</p> \n<h3>2. Compare your conversion rates.</h3> \n<p>By looking at your results, you’ll likely be able to tell if one of your variations performed better than the other. However, the true test of success is whether the results you have are statistically significant. This means that one variation performed better than the other at a significant level because, say, the CTA text was more compelling.</p> \n<p>Say, for example, Variation A had a 16.04% conversion rate and variation B had a 16.02% conversion rate, and your confidence interval of statistical significance is 95%. Variation A has a higher conversion rate, but the results are not statistically significant, meaning that Variation A won’t significantly improve your overall conversion rate.</p> \n<h3>3. Segment your audiences for further insights.</h3> \n<p>Regardless of significance, it's valuable to break down your results by audience segment to understand how each key area responded to your variations. Common variables for segmenting audiences are:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Visitor type, or which version performed best for new visitors versus repeat visitors.</li> \n <li>Device type, or which version performed best on mobile versus desktop.</li> \n <li>Traffic source, or which version performed best based on where traffic to your two variations originated.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Let’s go over some examples of A/B experiments you could run for your business.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>A/B Testing Examples</h2> \n<p>We’ve discussed how A/B tests are used in marketing and how to conduct one — but how do they actually look in practice?</p> \n<p>As you might guess, we run many A/B tests to increase engagement and drive conversions across our platform. Here are five examples of A/B tests to inspire your own experiments.</p> \n<h3>1. Site Search</h3> \n<p>Site search bars help users quickly find what they’re after on a particular website. HubSpot found from previous analysis that visitors who interacted with its site search bar were more likely to convert on a blog post. So, we ran an A/B test in an attempt to increase engagement with the search bar.</p> \n<p>In this test, search bar functionality was the independent variable and views on the content offer thank you page was the dependent variable. We used one control condition and three challenger conditions in the experiment.</p> \n<p>In the control condition (variant A), the search bar remained unchanged.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/how-to-do-a-b-testing-search-bar-control.png?width=530&amp;name=how-to-do-a-b-testing-search-bar-control.png\" alt=\"control condition in the hubspot search bar A B test\" width=\"530\" style=\"width: 530px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>In variant B, the search bar was made larger and more visually prominent, and the placeholder text was set to “search by topic.”</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ViXecYg9kH0cxCiinUo2MEC_o5Ou7k0ki1H2w-iuxEvK4DVLNWVFcGApFkFN4lxWuKgS0gYd0AQM90ZhdVuGILOJbhPtiDkpQD1GDPuudRacQWOtLrjlexJZnU2IHOb-ewbP1-4P\" width=\"400\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 400px;\" alt=\"variant b of the hubspot search bar AB test\"></p> \n<p>Variant C appeared identical to variant B, but only searched the HubSpot Blog rather than the entire website.</p> \n<p>In variant D, the search bar was made larger but the placeholder text was set to “search the blog.” This variant also searched only the HubSpot Blog</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/v6MZzCEA1LPhNPyF584H6dUQ83SPGRgYAi-7d3oA_zNmYA5yuuRbnIHKg3pc2MUj1YQ9j8km9lNpgUSWS7ENVJTQeJfgmQSkFiwIxp8ZjHe5QRnxXshmfUYXfSgb0gy8jwdRKH4F\" width=\"350\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 350px;\" alt=\"variant c of the hubspot search bar AB test\"></p> \n<p>We found variant D to be the most effective: It increased conversions by 3.4% over the control and increased the percentage of users who used the search bar by 6.5%.</p> \n<h3>2. Mobile CTAs</h3> \n<p>HubSpot uses several CTAs for content offers in our blog posts, including ones in the body of posts as well as at the bottom of the page. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ab-testing-ctas\">We test these CTAs extensively</a> for optimize their performance.</p> \n<p>For our mobile users, we ran an A/B test to see which type of bottom-of-page CTA converted best. For our independent variable, we altered the design of the CTA bar. Specifically, we used one control and three challengers in our test. For our dependent variables, we used pageviews on the CTA thank you page and CTA clicks.</p> \n<p>The control condition included our normal placement of CTAs at the bottom of posts. In variant B, the CTA had no close or minimize option.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/how-to-do-an-a-b-test-mobile-cta-variant-b-2.png?width=300&amp;name=how-to-do-an-a-b-test-mobile-cta-variant-b-2.png\" alt=\"variant B of the hubspot mobile CTA AB test\" width=\"300\" style=\"width: 300px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\">In variant C, mobile readers could close the CTA by tapping an X icon. Once it was closed out, it wouldn’t reappear.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/how-to-do-an-a-b-test-mobile-cta-variant-c-2.png?width=300&amp;name=how-to-do-an-a-b-test-mobile-cta-variant-c-2.png\" alt=\"variant C of the hubspot mobile CTA AB test\" width=\"300\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 300px;\"></p> \n<p>In variant D, we included an option to minimize the CTA with an up/down caret.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/how-to-do-an-a-b-test-mobile-cta-variant-d-2.jpg?width=600&amp;name=how-to-do-an-a-b-test-mobile-cta-variant-d-2.jpg\" alt=\"variant d of hubspot's mobile cta A B test\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>Our tests found all variants to be successful. Variant D was the most successful, with a 14.6% increase in conversions over the control. This was followed by variant C with an 11.4% increase and variant B with a 7.9% increase.</p> \n<h3>3. Author CTAs</h3> \n<p>In another CTA experiment, HubSpot tested whether adding the word “free” and other descriptive language to author CTAs at the top of blog posts would increase content leads. Past research suggested that using “free” in CTA text would drive more conversions and that text specifying the type of content offered would be helpful for SEO and accessibility.</p> \n<p>In the test, the independent variable was CTA text and the main dependent variable was conversion rate on the content offer form.</p> \n<p>In the control condition, author CTA text was unchanged (see the orange button in the image below).</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/n1OzWBuiCbJaR4e1VRrsyvuUHCLSuZc2xkYC-ovXP5DBPkYODIuK2A62Svs1IzuBWaeo3QN4dzkHyLRpU7sY4OLi6eOPm5U1WY7CM4SPjL-_rDx9q_RLB9e0twfcWn0Q-YK87c9K\" width=\"650\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px;\" alt=\"variant A of the author CTA AB test\"></p> \n<p>In variant B, the word “free” was added to the CTA text.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/GFVdnuSnm1W6pD64fPCw5D9bCrYtFbevTczl4wluvIxNOv-Qm_9G4FRfd5dYZubqdZDuHA7A3lLw2-oZO9SWvLx5JVPKhkDQdm-llrX3cW41bqeh-73z1kkEBZF1VP8FTXOqQMK3\" width=\"650\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px;\" alt=\"variant B of the author CTA AB test\"></p> \n<p>In variant C, descriptive wording was added to the CTA text in addition to “free.”</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/QeqWmdjj84siDfYVc1eucUicRHouXKgN5MkeeFFMQiwiwhKz-6DUCP90rF1hFRl0rRq41F2Ffon4C5kLnz-8IqoaFeT0BFdXardJQDE7RGp_BXH4K3u8obwZHPpYlO6-dDDkSyy1\" width=\"650\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px;\" alt=\"variant C of the author CTA AB test\"></p> \n<p>Interestingly, variant B saw a loss in form submissions, down by 14% compared to the control. This was unexpected, since including \"free\" in content offer text is widely considered a best practice.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, form submissions in variant C outperformed the control by 4%. It was concluded that adding descriptive text to the author CTA helped users understand the offer and thus made them more likely to download.</p> \n<h3>4. Blog Table of Contents</h3> \n<p>To help users better navigate the blog, HubSpot tested a new Table of Contents (TOC) module. The goal was to improve user experience by presenting readers with their desired content more quickly. We also tested whether adding a CTA to this TOC module would increase conversions.</p> \n<p>The independent variable of this A/B test was the inclusion and type of TOC module in blog posts, and the dependent variables were conversion rate on content offer form submissions and clicks on the CTA inside the TOC module.</p> \n<p>The control condition did not include the new TOC module —control posts either had no table of contents, or a simple bulleted list of anchor links within the body of the post near the top of the article (pictured below).</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/cVNqdOuWN_4G96kpE7W5pyjhWr8-zIh5iRjIDH7wDh6pOXXarbPbxzuzm6fQyubShTcuQzmLjFhy3-eclMEj-aKIfcfp3_Sj_SA8hNXoXIQt2NW29tIIDhy3QLV9NPS2eZhdcJHS\" width=\"650\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px;\" alt=\"variant A of the hubspot blog chapter module AB test\"></p> \n<p>In variant B, the new TOC module was added to blog posts. This module was sticky, meaning it remained onscreen as users scrolled down the page. Variant B also included a content offer CTA at the bottom of the module.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/s8XFuXNaFnWSuzevJwaFUyPyJtkSnUs93qMYZU9RHUnK0u3h9vVdFlXti1_rAVZTU1hFYK14P9iUR2AfSgXGXKH-4aDe_r5D4fDC3K8dUcWmmBLBhfAJWN0QPza1DlUS1qHvvZJZ\" width=\"650\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px;\" alt=\"variant B of the hubspot blog chapter module AB test\"></p> \n<p>Variant C included an identical module to variant B but with the CTA removed.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4HFWXYjCae6K8X-R4Q0nbPMbe_OI5m5-gNna6UISmZVQRoKQnFvXU5_rruzPmpCoKHgdYhunW_WVrUKqpzfQTGgJqSjz1UyAWHBGWxvwHtcwsxIcrEQx9V2nCvZufSTZ96LK4mXR\" width=\"650\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px;\" alt=\"variant C of the hubspot blog chapter module AB test\"></p> \n<p>Both variants B and C did not increase the conversion rate on blog posts. The control condition outperformed variant B by 7% and performed equally with variant C. Also, few users interacted with the new TOC module or the CTA inside the module.</p> \n<h3>5. Review Notifications</h3> \n<p>To determine the best way of gathering customer reviews, we ran a split test of email notifications versus in-app notifications. Here, the independent variable was the type of notification and the dependent variable was the percentage of those who left a review out of all those who opened the notification.</p> \n<p>In the control, HubSpot sent a plain text email notification asking users to leave a review. In variant B, HubSpot sent an email with a certificate image including the user’s name.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1uBsYglIwFmXp-L0b_zQsSq5-lTYVSnN1B0-ewKYiRz9uZrXttvE8h38jEOFl9Q0GDD7s3x60WUknh7BxJEPMGIRuTCk7sMrPshNnxzyEkP935SLHiWrJrhNUPDh5Bf6JKu4kmMf\" width=\"500\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 500px;\" alt=\"variant B of the hubspot notification AB test\"></p> \n<p>For variant C, HubSpot sent users an in app-notification.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Uaesq2m_BCCmf8leXIo30qCSQcQ7-8aadq4wtiyYUw73FG31jU1oD36OD52zDcLdRqbzpK_JovaJTKZYfvfbKdthSwnY8DEICqnUMSwayGKMFX0VsRddFnKexXHPYvahohwIa_HU\" width=\"500\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 500px;\" alt=\"variant C of the hubspot notification AB test\"></p> \n<p>Ultimately, both emails performed similarly and outperformed the in-app notifications. About 25% of users who opened an email left a review versus the 10.3% who opened in-app notifications. Emails were also more often opened by users.</p> \n<h2>Start A/B Testing Today</h2> \n<p>A/B testing allows you to get to the truth of what content and marketing your audience wants to see.

Since its launch in 2004, it has become an invaluable tool for B2C businesses, offering advanced advertising tools as well as organic opportunities.</p> \n<h3>TikTok</h3> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Users</strong>:<a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/970920/monetizable-daily-active-twitter-users-worldwide/\"> </a><a href=\"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/1-billion-people-on-tiktok\">1 billion</a> active monthly global users</li> \n <li><strong>Audience</strong>: Primarily Gen Z followed by Millennials</li> \n <li><strong>Industry impact</strong>: B2B and B2C</li> \n <li><strong>Best for</strong>: Short-form, creative video content; user-generated content; brand awareness</li> \n</ul> \n<p>When you think of short-form video, you probably think of TikTok. The platform rose in popularity in 2020 and shows no signs of slowing down. It's one of the best platforms for community building, with marketers ranking it in second place behind YouTube.</p> \n<h3>Instagram</h3> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Users</strong>:<a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/253577/number-of-monthly-active-instagram-users/\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/253577/number-of-monthly-active-instagram-users/\">1 billion</a> monthly active users</li> \n <li><strong>Audience</strong>: Primarily Millennials</li> \n <li><strong>Industry impact</strong>: B2C</li> \n <li><strong>Best for</strong>: High-quality images and videos; user-generated content; advertising</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Although Instagram launched only 12 years ago, the platform has taken the world by storm. When it comes to sharing visually compelling content, Instagram is where brands go. Another thing that sets the platform apart is its advanced ecommerce tools.</p> \n<p>Today, users can discover brands, browse their products and/or service, and complete a purchase without ever leaving the app – making Instagram a hard platform to beat.</p> \n<h3>Twitter</h3> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Users</strong>:<a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/970920/monetizable-daily-active-twitter-users-worldwide/\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/970920/monetizable-daily-active-twitter-users-worldwide/\">211 million</a> <em>daily</em> active users worldwide</li> \n <li><strong>Audience</strong>: Primarily Millennials</li> \n <li><strong>Industry impact</strong>: B2B and B2C</li> \n <li><strong>Best for</strong>: Public relations; customer service; community building</li> \n</ul> \n<p>While Instagram focuses on visuals, Twitter focuses on words. Since the early days of 140-character Tweets, the platform has now expanded to include an audio tool called <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-twitter-spaces\">Twitter Spaces</a>, a community-building tool called <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/twitter-communities\">Twitter Communities</a>, and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/25084/the-ultimate-cheat-sheet-for-expert-twitter-marketing.aspx\">Twitter Moments</a> to share interesting content with your followers.</p> \n<h3>LinkedIn</h3> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>User</strong><strong>s</strong>:<a href=\"https://hootsuite.com/resources/digital-2020\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.statista.com/forecasts/1147197/linkedin-users-in-the-world\">774 million</a> active users worldwide</li> \n <li><strong>Audience</strong>: Baby boomers, Generation X, and Millennials</li> \n <li><strong>Industry impact</strong>: B2B</li> \n <li><strong>Best for</strong>: B2B relationships, business development, and social selling</li> \n</ul> \n<p>LinkedIn is Facebook's professional cousin. It's perhaps the only platform where its audience is clearly defined: Working professionals looking to network and seek out new opportunities.</p> \n<p>That makes it the ideal platform for B2B companies looking to identify key decision-makers and build an industry-specific community.</p> \n<h3>YouTube</h3> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Users</strong>: Over<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/about/press/#:~:text=Global%20Reach,watchtime%20comes%20from%20mobile%20devices.\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1252638/youtube-app-dau-worldwide/\">315 million daily active</a> users worldwide</li> \n <li><strong>Audience</strong>: Primarily Millennials but has a strong audience across gender and age demographics</li> \n <li><strong>Industry impact</strong>: B2C and B2B</li> \n <li><strong>Best for</strong>: Brand awareness; long-form entertainment, and how-to videos</li> \n</ul> \n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.hootsuite.com/resources/digital-trends\">HootSuite</a>, YouTube is the second most visited website in the world. In addition, marketers name it the best platform to build community.</p> \n<p>In addition to being an incredibly popular platform, its users also tend to stay longer on it because it features mostly long-form content – making it an ideal platform to share educational content.</p> \n<h3>Snapchat</h3> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Users</strong>:<a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/545967/snapchat-app-dau/#:~:text=With%20an%20estimated%2046%20million,such%20as%20Twitter%20or%20Facebook.\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/545967/snapchat-app-dau/#:~:text=With%20an%20estimated%2046%20million,such%20as%20Twitter%20or%20Facebook.\">306 million</a> daily active users worldwide</li> \n <li><strong>Audience</strong>: Primarily Generation Z</li> \n <li><strong>Industry impact</strong>: B2C</li> \n <li><strong>Best for</strong>: Brand awareness; advertising</li> \n</ul> \n<p>When Snapchat came out in 2011, leading the charge in ephemeral content. It introduced content that you could share with your friends and that would expire after 24 hours.</p> \n<p>The platform peaked in 2015 and has held strong since then. Many thought the brand would disappear once Instagram introduced Stories, the same feature with a different name. However, Snapchat continues to be popular among young adults.</p> \n<h3>Pinterest</h3> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Users</strong>:<a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/463353/pinterest-global-mau/\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/463353/pinterest-global-mau/\">444 million</a> monthly active users worldwide</li> \n <li><strong>Audience</strong>: Primarily Millennials with a solid audience in Gen Z, Gen X and Baby Boomers</li> \n <li><strong>Industry impact</strong>: B2C</li> \n <li><strong>Best for</strong>: Visual advertising; inspiration</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Think of <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/31147/the-ultimate-guide-to-mastering-pinterest-for-marketing.aspx\">Pinterest</a> like a visual storyboard that allows users to get inspiration for everything from fashion to home decor.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://business.pinterest.com/audience/\">85% of Pinners</a> say Pinterest is where they go to start a new project. In addition, 80% of weekly Pinners say they've discovered a new brand or product on the platform. So, not only is it a great discovery tool but it's also a way for brands to build their narrative through visual stories.</p> \n<h3>Clubhouse</h3> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Users</strong>:<a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/463353/pinterest-global-mau/\"> </a>10 million weekly active users worldwide</li> \n <li><strong>Audience</strong>: Primarily Millennials</li> \n <li><strong>Industry impact</strong>: B2B and B2C</li> \n <li><strong>Best for</strong>: Visual advertising; inspiration</li> \n</ul> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-clubhouse\">Clubhouse</a> made a strong impression as soon as it entered the social media world in 2020. The audio-only platform allows people to start interesting conversations with followers as well as strangers and build community.</p> \n<p>The platform also gained some buzz for its invitation-only set up when it was in beta testing. Today, the platform is open to everyone globally and on both IOS and Android devices. Another big selling point to this platform is that it works well for both B2B and B2C businesses and leverages audio, which has made a huge comeback in recent years.</p> \n<p>Now that we've detailed the fundamentals of each social media network, let's discuss why social media marketing is beneficial for your business.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h2>Benefits of Social Media Marketing</h2> \n<p>To illustrate the benefits of social media marketing, let's take a look at the experience from the user's perspective. Well, my perspective.</p> \n<p>As I scroll through my Instagram feed every day (cough, cough...multiple times a day), I consistently notice new posts and stories by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thefryecompany/?hl=en\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\">The Frye Company</a>. I’ve always been a fan of their boots, clothing, and accessories, but I also love the content they share on their Instagram profile.</p> \n<p>All of their photos have the same filter on them to ensure they match — this makes their profile look professional, artistic, and organized when visitors, like myself, browse their page.</p> \n<p>Frye’s account also encourages interaction between the company and its followers by providing them with a specific <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/inmyfrye/?hl=en\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\">hashtag</a> to use so they can be featured on the page when they post photos with Frye products.</p> \n<p>Frye’s Instagram account is a great example of successful social media marketing — it’s attractive, distinctly Frye, engages their ~200K followers, and promotes their products.</p> \n<p>But why is social media marketing so important? And how do you actually <a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/courses/social-media?utm_source=marketing_blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=social_media\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\">build a social media marketing strategy</a> that’ll work for your specific type of business?</p> \n<p>There are a variety of reasons why your company should use social media marketing. We've created a list of the most beneficial reasons to consider.</p> \n<p>Let's dive in.</p> \n<h3>1. Increase your brand awareness.</h3> \n<p>Due to the sheer amount of people on social media, you're missing out on the potential to reach thousands, and even millions, if you don't have a presence.</p> \n<p>In fact, social media has been proven to boost brand awareness by driving up engagement. Social engagement includes things like comments, likes, shares, and reposts, and saves.</p> \n<p>It also helps you increase brand awareness by directing traffic straight to your site. You can do this by including direct links to your website in your profile, bio, and posts.</p> \n<p><strong>Featured Resource</strong></p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/how-to-build-a-brand?hubs_post-cta=inline-text\">How to Build a Brand for Your Company</a></li> \n</ul> \n<h3>2. Generate leads and boost conversions.</h3> \n<p>Promoting and sharing your products on social media is a simple way to improve lead generation, boost conversions, and increase sales because you're advertising to people who have opted to engage with you by following your account.</p> \n<p>Here are some examples of ways you can use social media to generate more leads.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Create contests</strong> for your visitors and followers to participate in on your social media profiles.</li> \n <li><strong>Include links to your website and offers</strong> in the bio sections of your profiles.</li> \n <li><strong>Host live videos </strong>to make announcements about products and provide updates or details about exciting news at your company.</li> \n <li><strong>Implement a social media marketing campaign</strong> on one of your channels.</li> \n <li><strong>Sell your products through your social profiles</strong>. For example, you can enable<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/help/912190892201033\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/help/912190892201033\">Facebook's Shop Section</a> or<a href=\"https://business.instagram.com/a/shopping-on-instagram\"> </a><a href=\"https://business.instagram.com/a/shopping-on-instagram\">Instagram's Shopping feature</a> on your profiles. These features allow your visitors and followers to click on products you've shared in posts to view information such as price, material, and size.

Foster relationships with your customers.</h3> \n<p>By connecting and engaging with your social media followers, you'll be able to build lasting relationships between them and your business. You can do this by interacting with them on your posts, responding to their questions and comments, and providing them with any help they may need.</p> \n<p>You can also ask your followers questions about your products, their pain points, or create giveaways to help you build trust and show them how much you value their input and support.</p> \n<h3>4. Learn from your competitors.</h3> \n<p>Social media is a great way to keep tabs on your competitors — whether that's in reference to their social media tactics, the products they're promoting, the campaigns they're implementing, or their level of interaction with followers.</p> \n<p>Social media allows you to get a look at what is and isn't working for your competition, and therefore helps you decide what should or shouldn't change in terms of <em>your</em> company's approach.</p> \n<p>Lastly, reviewing the social accounts of your competitors can help you make sure your marketing stands out and is unique to your brand.</p> \n<p><em><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/competitive-analysis-kit?hubs_post-cta=pillar_allphrase\">Learn how to conduct a competitive analysis to discover how you can beat the competition.</a></em></p> \n<p>Now, let's talk strategy — there are severa steps to ensure your social media marketing plan is sustainable and positively impacts your business.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Although social media is constantly evolving, most of the foundational steps you need to succeed stay the same. Essentially, you're following the same steps you would take to create a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-strategy\">marketing strategy</a> and narrow it to a specific channel.</p> \n<p>Let's cover these steps in more detail so you can begin applying them to your business.</p> \n<h3>Step 1: Research your buyer personas and audience.</h3> \n<p>The first step to creating a social media marketing strategy is to determine who your buyer personas and audience are so you can target their needs and interests appropriately.</p> \n<p>To do this, think about the people you're trying to reach and why, and how you would classify them as a group. For example, if your company sells trendy leggings and joggers, you might classify your target audience as millennials who like to wear stylish athletic apparel regularly — a style known as<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/athleisure.asp\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/athleisure.asp\">athleisure</a>.</p> \n<p>By considering your buyer personas and audience, you'll then be able to determine what content will attract the type of followers and customers you hope to gain. Plus, learn how to create engaging content to keep your followers interested.</p> \n<h4>Recommended Tools</h4> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/persona-templates?hubs_post-cta=inline-text\">Buyer Persona Templates</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/make-my-persona?hubs_post-cta=inline-text\">Make My Persona Tool</a></li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Step 2: Determine which social platforms you'll market on.</h3> \n<p>As a social media marketer, it's crucial you determine which platforms you're going to share your content on.</p> \n<p>There's not necessarily a right or wrong answer when it comes to which social channels your business should use — it's more about the needs of your target audience and where they tend to spend their time.</p> \n<p>\"It's important to be where your audience of potential customers is today, and where they might be tomorrow,\" said Andrew Delaney, former social media marketing manager at HubSpot. \"It's better to be ahead of the curve than behind.\"</p> \n<p>For example, if you are going for that target audience of athleisure-loving millennials, you may want to focus the majority of your social media efforts on<a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/integrations/instagram\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/integrations/instagram\">Instagram</a> — this is because<a href=\"https://blog.hootsuite.com/instagram-demographics/\"> </a><a href=\"https://blog.hootsuite.com/instagram-demographics/\">millennials</a> cover the largest portion of users on the platform.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/smorgan817/\">Stephanie Morgan</a>, founder and CEO of social media agency <a href=\"http://www.thesociallock.com\">Social Lock</a>, echoes this sentiment.</p> \n<p>\"Think about their behaviors and where they hang out online. If that's Pinterest, use that platform for your brand. If that's TikTok, use that platform for your brand,\" Morgan adds. \"Don't waste time on a platform that your ideal client avatar is not very active on.\"</p> \n<h4>Recommended Tools and Resources</h4> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/snapchat-for-business?hubs_post-cta=inline-text\">A Marketer's Guide to Snapchat for Business</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/facebook-ad-examples?hubs_post-cta=inline-text&amp;_ga=2.166263099.465005662.1556543642-1307414301.1541080541\">50 Facebook Ad Examples We Actually Clicked</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/youtube-for-business?hubs_post-cta=inline-text\">YouTube for Business: A 30-Day Roadmap for Growth</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/how-to-use-twitter-for-business?hubs_post-cta=inline-text\">How to Use Twitter for Business (+ Follower Tracking Template)</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/how-to-use-pinterest-for-business?hubs_post-cta=author\">12 Pinterest Templates for Business</a></li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Step 3: Establish your most important metrics and KPIs.</h3> \n<p>No matter your goals or industry, your social media strategy should be data-driven.</p> \n<p>That means focusing on the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/social-media-metrics-ceos-cares-about\">social media metrics that matter</a>. Rather than focus on vanity metrics, dig into data that aligns directly with your goals.</p> \n<p>What metrics are we talking about? Check out the breakdown below:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Reach</strong>. Post reach is the number of unique users who saw your post. How much of your content actually reaches users’ feeds?</li> \n <li><strong>Clicks</strong>. This is the number of clicks on your content or account. Tracking clicks per campaign is essential to understand what drives curiosity or encourages people to buy.</li> \n <li><strong>Engagement</strong>. The total number of social interactions divided by the number of impressions. This sheds light on how well your audience perceives you and their willingness to interact.</li> \n <li><strong>Hashtag performance</strong>. What were your most-used hashtags? Which hashtags were most associated with your brand? Having these answers can help shape the focus of your content going forward.</li> \n <li><strong>Organic and paid likes</strong>. Beyond a standard “Like” count, these interactions are attributed to paid or organic content. Given how much harder organic engagement is to gain, many brands turn to ads. Knowing these differences can help you budget both your ad spend and the time you invest in different formats.</li> \n <li><strong>Sentiment</strong>. This is the measurement of how users react to your content, brand, or hashtag. Did customers find your recent campaign offensive? What type of sentiment do people associate with your campaign hashtag? It’s always better to dig deeper and find out how people talk or feel about your brand.</li> \n</ul> \n<h4>Recommended Resources</h4> \n<ul> \n <li><a>Which Social Media Metrics Are Marketers Tracking?</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/social-media-analytics\">The Ultimate Guide to Social Media Analytics</a></li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Step 4: Get to know your competition.</h3> \n<p>A competitive analysis allows you to understand who the competition is and what they’re doing well (and not so well). You’ll get a good sense of what’s expected in your industry, which will help you set social media targets of your own.</p> \n<p>It will also help you spot opportunities.</p> \n<p>Maybe one of your competitors is dominant on Facebook, for example, but has put little effort into Twitter or Instagram. You might want to focus on the networks where your audience is underserved, rather than trying to win fans away from a dominant player.</p> \n<h4>Recommended Tools and Resources</h4> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/competitive-analysis-kit\">What's a Competitive Analysis &amp; How Do You Conduct One?</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/competitive-intelligence-competitive-advantage\">A Marketer's Guide To Competitive Intelligence</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/customers/monitor-competitors-in-social-within-hubspot\">How to Monitor Your Competitors' Every Move in Social Within HubSpot</a></li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Step 5: Create unique and engaging content.</h3> \n<p>With the billions of social media users around the globe, there's no question that at least <em>some</em> of your followers — or the people browsing your profile — have also seen your competitor's content or that of other businesses in your industry.</p> \n<p>That's why you must have engaging social media content that stands out and provides viewers with a reason to click that \"Follow\" button and interact with your brand.</p> \n<p>Not sure what's considered engaging? Morgan has a recommendation.</p> \n<p>\"My number one tip to brands for creating engaging content on social media is to do market research first because what will be engaging depends on the audience,\" Morgan said. \"When you know what your audience likes and needs to know, you can create content that engages those interests.\"</p> \n<p>To help you get creative, consider the content your competitors are sharing and how you can uniquely promote your products. Also, take advantage of the features offered by the platform you're using.</p> \n<p>For example, you can create live videos on Facebook to share the latest details about a product launch or conduct a giveaway.</p> \n<p>You can also use your current customers and promoters to help you generate content. You can do this by re-posting their content or encouraging them to use a hashtag to share their own experiences and pictures with your products.</p> \n<p>Lastly, leverage trends. Social media trends are always coming up, especially on short-form video platforms like TikTok. Don't be afraid to join in but you still have to be intentional about how you do it.</p> \n<p>\"If the trend started happening three weeks ago, you've probably missed the boat,\" Morgan said. \"Catching the trends early is the best way to capitalize on it without coming across as inauthentic or like you're trying too hard, or worse [as] 'chuegy' – see Gen Z for that one.\"</p> \n<h4>Recommended Tools and Resources</h4> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/social-media-trends-report-2022\">The Social Media Trends Report </a></li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Step 6: Organize a schedule for your posts.</h3> \n<p>One of the easiest ways to ensure your content is shared as planned is to use a social media management solution. These tools allow you to write captions, prepare pictures and videos, and schedule posts in advance. They also automatically share your content on schedule and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/29437/20-free-social-media-and-brand-monitoring-tools-that-rock.aspx?_ga=2.150639797.2053315133.1572189466-237440449.1568656505\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\">monitor</a> all post interactions and engagement for you. Social media management solutions save you time and allow you to focus on your other tasks.</p> \n<p>There are a number of solution options available — here are a few examples.</p> \n<h5><strong>HubSpot</strong></h5> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/social-inbox?hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/social-media-marketing&amp;hubs_post-cta=HubSpot\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\">HubSpot</a> offers a social media tool — as part of the <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing?hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/social-media-marketing&amp;hubs_post-cta=marketing%20software\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\">marketing software</a> — to help you publish and monitor your content and create real connections with your followers. You can schedule and publish your content in advance and compare in-depth reports on your posts’ engagement to understand the performance of various platforms, types of content, and posting times.</p> \n<h5><strong>Sprout Social</strong></h5> \n<p><a href=\"https://ecosystem.hubspot.com/marketplace/apps/marketing/social-media/sprout-social\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\">Sprout Social</a> is a social media marketing and management solution designed to help your team organize and plan content creation, manage campaigns, understand engagement, and review content reports and analysis.</p> \n<h5><strong>Hootsuite</strong></h5> \n<p><a href=\"https://hootsuite.com/\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\">Hootsuite</a> is a social media management platform for finding, scheduling, managing, and reporting on your content. You can schedule posts in advance on <em>all</em> of your channels at once and measure your ROI with comprehensive content analysis.</p> \n<h4><strong>How often should you post on social media?</strong></h4> \n<p>Now, you might be wondering how often you should post content on your social media channels.</p> \n<p>As a rule of thumb, you should only post on social when you have <em>quality</em> content to share. Meaning, there's a reason you're posting the content. This is how you'll strike the right balance when it comes to your posting frequency.</p> \n<p>Morgan says the top mistake she sees brands make in regards to social media marketing is focusing on quantity of content instead of the quality of content.</p> \n<p>\"They think they need to post every day, so they force themselves to create posts to fill up the calendar,\" she said. \"Odds are, every single one of those posts isn't going to be very valuable to the ideal customer, I've coined this 'clutter content.'\"</p> \n<p>Instead, she recommends downsizing in quantity and upping the quality.</p> \n<p>\"It's better to post two or three times a week with super valuable content, versus posting seven times a week with only one or two valuable posts,\" said Morgan.</p> \n<p>There are plenty of studies and resources available explaining social media post frequency standards by industry and platform for you to follow. Every business is different, so find what works for your audience.</p> \n<p>Then, you can begin experimenting with more or fewer posts – as well as other factors such as the time of day you're posting on social – to determine what provides the highest level of engagement.</p> \n<h4>Recommended Tools and Resources</h4> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/social-media-content-calendar?hubs_signup-url=www.hubspot.com%2Fresources&amp;hubs_signup-cta=directories__link&amp;q=social%2520media&amp;_ga=2.13241907.540916378.1639696309-1866752076.1638585232\">Social Media Content Calendar Template</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/startups/social-media-content-template-for-startups?hubs_signup-url=www.hubspot.com%2Fresources&amp;hubs_signup-cta=directories__link&amp;q=social%2520media&amp;_ga=2.9692465.540916378.1639696309-1866752076.1638585232\">Social Media Content Calendar Template for Startups</a></li> \n</ul> \n<h2>How to Analyze Your Social Media Marketing Impact and Results</h2> \n<p>One of the most important aspects of social media marketing is ensuring your efforts are successful in helping you meet your goals. To determine this, you'll need to keep track of all of your posts, on every channel. You can do this by reviewing and managing your social media metrics.</p> \n<h3>Social Media Metrics</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/social-media-metrics-ceos-cares-about\">Social media metrics</a> are data related to the success of your posts and your impact on your audience and customers on various platforms. These metrics may include data about your level of engagement, likes, follows, shares, and all other interactions on each platform.</p> \n<p>Here are 10 of the most important metrics for you to track:</p> \n<ol start=\"1\"> \n <li><strong>Engagement:</strong> This includes clicks, comments, likes, and replies on your social media posts. There are also platform-specific types of engagement such as \"<a href=\"https://help.instagram.com/1744643532522513\">Saved</a>\" posts on Instagram and \"<a href=\"https://help.pinterest.com/en/article/create-a-pin-from-your-photos\">Pinned</a>\" posts on Pinterest.</li> \n <li><strong>Reach: </strong>The number of people who have seen any content associated with your page or profile is your reach.</li> \n <li><strong>Followers: </strong>This is the number of people you have on your profile who have clicked your \"Follow\" button and see your content in their feeds regularly.</li> \n <li><strong>Impressions: </strong>This is the number of times a post from your profile or page is seen, whether or not your audience members click on it. This is often what happens when someone is scrolling through their newsfeed, but not clicking on anything.</li> \n <li><strong>Video views: </strong>On Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, or any other social channel with video capabilities, this is the number of views each gets.</li> \n <li><strong>Profile visits: </strong>The number of people who have opened your social media page is your number of profile visits.</li> \n <li><strong>Mentions: </strong>This is the number of times your profile has been mentioned by audience members in their posts.</li> \n <li><strong>Tags: </strong>This is when your audience adds the name of your company's profile or your hashtag to another post.</li> \n <li><strong>Reposts: </strong>This is when a member of your audience posts a piece of your content on their profile.</li> \n <li><strong>Shares: </strong>These are the posts your followers and audience take from your profile and share with their network.</li> \n</ol> \n<p>You can influence all of these metrics, increase your social following, and improve overall engagement on your profile by using the same tactics you would to generate leads and boost conversions.</p> \n<p>Morgan adds that the metrics you focus on will depend on which season you're in. Here's her formula:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>If you're new, focus on building an audience and awareness. Key metrics: reach, impressions, audience growth.</li> \n <li>If you're growing, focus on building trust. Key metrics: Likes, saves, comments, DMs.</li> \n <li>If you're established, focus on retaining and nurturing. Key metrics: Likes, saves, comments, DMs.</li> \n <li>If you're launching something, focus on selling. Key metrics: DMs and clickthrough rate</li> \n</ul> \n<h4>How to Measure Social Media Metrics</h4> \n<p>You can review social media metrics in a variety of ways, For example, you can use the analytics tools built into the various platforms you use. Here are a few examples:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://business.twitter.com/en/analytics.html\">Twitter Analytics</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://analytics.facebook.com/\">Facebook Analytics</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://help.instagram.com/1533933820244654\">Instagram Insights</a></li> \n</ul> \n<p>You might also choose to use an analytics and tracking tool such as<a href=\"https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/provision/?authuser=0#/provision\"> </a><a href=\"https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/provision/?authuser=0#/provision\">Google Analytics</a>. This is a great option if you want to track your social media <em>and</em> website metrics. Lastly, many social media scheduling solutions — as we reviewed earlier — have monitoring and tracking features automatically built-in.</p> \n<p>All of these <a href=\"https://napoleoncat.com/features/analytics/\">metrics tracking tools</a> will give you a better understanding of what your followers and audience respond well to and what you should consider modifying to improve engagement.</p> \n<p>Now that we've reviewed the benefits of social media marketing and how to build your strategy, let's talk about the various resources available to help you along the way.</p> \n<h2>Social Media Marketing Resources</h2> \n<p>There are a plethora of social media marketing resources you can use to build a social strategy for your company.

Read on to see the results, and decide for yourself.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"></p> \n<h3>Number of Users</h3> \n<p><strong>Winner: YouTube</strong></p> \n<p><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">There's no real competition here. YouTube commands an audience of </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/yt/about/press/\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\"><span>over two billion monthly users</span></a><span style=\"color: #33475b;\"> — almost half of the entire internet-using population. Vimeo's </span><a href=\"https://expandedramblings.com/index.php/vimeo-statistics/\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\"><span>230 million monthly viewers and 1.9 million </span></a><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">paid subscribers seem insignificant in contrast. For maximum reach, choose YouTube.</span></p> \n<h3>Search Optimization</h3> \n<p><strong>Winner: YouTube</strong></p> \n<p>YouTube leaves Vimeo in the dust here. YouTube is <a href=\"https://www.alexa.com/topsites\">the second largest search engine on the internet</a>, right after parent company Google. If you're planning to create a video tailored to a specific search query, (e.g., <em>how to pick a font for your website</em>), your video belongs on YouTube. Not only will it appear in search results directly on YouTube, but Google also <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-steers-users-to-youtube-over-rivals-11594745232\">seems to favor</a> videos from YouTube over those posted on other platforms.</p> \n<h3>Mobile</h3> \n<p><strong>Winner: YouTube</strong></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/intl/en-GB/about/press/\">70% of all YouTube views come from mobile</a>, and the YouTube mobile app is absolutely <a href=\"https://www.digitalinformationworld.com/2020/02/youtube-dominates-all-the-major-apps-takes-away-most-streaming-time-on-smartphones.html\">dominating the mobile streaming space</a> — outranking even formidable competitors like Netflix, Hulu, and Twitch.</p> \n<p>Videos uploaded to Vimeo and YouTube are both optimized automatically for mobile, but YouTube offers more opportunities for mobile discovery and reach.</p> \n<h3>Cost</h3> \n<p><strong>Winner: YouTube</strong></p> \n<p>YouTube is free — even for businesses. But you might be wondering if Vimeo is as well.</p> \n<h4>Is Vimeo free to use?</h4> \n<p><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Vimeo operates on a tiered pricing model, </span><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/upgrade\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\"><span>ranging from a free basic plan to a $75/month package </span></a><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">that includes unlimited live streaming.</span></p> \n<h4>Vimeo Pro vs YouTube</h4> \n<p>While Vimeo does have a free basic plan, it limits you to 500MB maximum storage per week.</p> \n<p>If you're okay with paying some money, you can get a Vimeo Pro plan. With Vimeo Pro, you'll have access to support, advanced analytics, and professional privacy.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, you can have unlimited storage for free on YouTube.</p> \n<h3>Support</h3> \n<p><strong>Winner: Vimeo</strong></p> \n<p>With their paid packages, Vimeo <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/upgrade\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\"><span>offers several levels of technical support</span></a> that could be a game-changer for businesses with little video expertise. YouTube offers plenty of <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube?__hstc=20629287.6ac66382cd6445e9a532bf78e26b2936.1629761983054.1644432577944.1644443037198.247&amp;__hssc=20629287.5.1644443037198&amp;__hsfp=2104872287#topic=7505892\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\"><span>free help documentation</span></a> and access to a (rather crowded) <a href=\"https://productforums.google.com/forum/?__hstc=20629287.6ac66382cd6445e9a532bf78e26b2936.1629761983054.1644432577944.1644443037198.247&amp;__hssc=20629287.5.1644443037198&amp;__hsfp=2104872287#!forum/youtube\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\"><span>support community</span></a>. Still, if you're seeking higher-touch, personalized support on-demand, a paid Vimeo account is the better option.</p> \n<h3>Storage</h3> \n<p><strong>Winner: YouTube</strong></p> \n<p>YouTube offers unlimited, free storage for all accounts, while Vimeo <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/upgrade\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\"><span>charges for storage on a tiered basis</span></a>. The basic, free Vimeo account option gives you 500MB of storage per week. With their highest level, $75/month package, you can store 7TB total with no weekly limits.</p> \n<h3>No Pre-Roll Ads</h3> \n<p><strong>Winner: Vimeo</strong></p> \n<p>If you upload your videos to YouTube, there's a good chance a pre-roll ad will play before it, which has the potential to deter some viewers from sticking around. Vimeo currently doesn't allow ads, and it doesn't look like they'll be changing this policy anytime soon.</p> \n<h3>Running Ad Campaigns</h3> \n<p><strong>Winner: YouTube</strong></p> \n<p>If you're thinking of running your own ads on a video platform, you can't beat YouTube (You also <a href=\"https://help.vimeo.com/hc/en-us/articles/224968628-Vimeo-PRO\">can't</a><a href=\"https://help.vimeo.com/hc/en-us/articles/224968628-Vimeo-PRO\"> purchase ad space on Vimeo</a>, even if you wanted to, because they don't allow it.)</p> \n<p>YouTube <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/yt/advertise/\">offers an advanced, user-friendly ads platform</a>, as well as personalized support from a \"YouTube Advertising Expert\" when you spend $10 a day on ads.</p> \n<h3>Community</h3> \n<p><strong>Winner: Vimeo</strong></p> \n<p>User numbers don't tell the entire story. With such a massive audience on YouTube, the environment is naturally more competitive. It's easier for your video to get drowned out by thousands of others if you aren't planning to feature it somewhere off YouTube. Vimeo's smaller, more community-driven platform might be a better option if you're hoping to tap into an existing creative niche, or get featured on their <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/channels/staffpicks\">hand-curated staff picks page</a>.</p> \n<h3>Advanced Privacy Options</h3> \n<p><strong>Winner: Vimeo</strong></p> \n<p>Both YouTube and Vimeo give you the option to set videos to private or public (the default setting on YouTube is public), but Vimeo offers a handful of more nuanced, specific privacy options if that serves your interests. You can add a password protection option to videos, share a video only with people who follow your account, or even hide it from the Vimeo community — which could be useful if you plan on embedding the video on your website and want it to be viewable in only one place.</p> \n<h3>Customizable Player</h3> \n<p><strong>Winner: Vimeo</strong></p> \n<p>Vimeo's sleek embedded player <a href=\"https://help.vimeo.com/hc/en-us/articles/224972808-Customizing-the-embedded-player\">offers a number of useful customization options</a> that YouTube can't match, including hex color customization and the ability to include a custom player logo (on Business and PRO accounts). Plus, when you change the default customization options on your account, all previously embedded videos will update to reflect the changes automatically, with no need to go back and tinker with any code.</p> \n<h3>Analytics</h3> \n<p><strong>Winner: YouTube </strong></p> \n<p>YouTube takes the win here because <a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1714323?hl=en&amp;__hstc=20629287.6ac66382cd6445e9a532bf78e26b2936.1629761983054.1644432577944.1644443037198.247&amp;__hssc=20629287.5.1644443037198&amp;__hsfp=2104872287\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\"><span>all their analytics</span></a> — ranging from basic statistics like views to more advanced options — are completely free. Vimeo also offers <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/stats\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\"><span>powerful analytics tools</span></a> to evaluate performance, but you'll have to pay to access everything but basic stats.</p> \n<h3>Video Quality</h3> \n<p style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Winner: Vimeo</p> \n<p>When it comes to video quality, Vimeo beats out YouTube. In a test done by <a href=\"https://medium.com/@GreatUX/vimeo-vs-youtube-video-quality-18e51f83f916\">Medium</a>, Vimeo's video quality was crisp, clean, and easier to read. On the other hand, the same video on YouTube was blurry, making it much harder to follow.</p> \n<h3>Audio Quality</h3> \n<p style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Winner: Vimeo</p> \n<p>Again, when it comes to quality, Vimeo comes out on top. Sound quality is higher on Vimeo because the platform supports 320Kbps. However, to enjoy higher-quality videos and audio, you'll need to be subscribed to one of the paid plans.</p> \n<h3>Live Streaming</h3> \n<p style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Winner: YouTube</p> \n<p>Both Vimeo and YouTube have live streaming options, however, YouTube is the clear winner here because it's free. Vimeo offers live streaming with a paid plan. However, with Vimeo, you can upload new versions of the video and keep on using the same URL and upload higher quality recorded versions of a live stream, which you can edit before posting.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Imported%20sitepage%20images/youtube-vs-vimeo-mini-infographic-market-motive.jpg?width=790&amp;name=youtube-vs-vimeo-mini-infographic-market-motive.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube vs. Vimeo infographic\" width=\"790\" style=\"width: 790px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.marketmotive.com/blog/online-marketing/vimeo-vs-youtube-which-should-you-be-using\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></span></p> \n<h3>So which one should you choose?</h3> \n<p>It depends on what exactly you want to accomplish with your videos. If you're looking for a creative community where you can connect with other video creators and gain some exposure in a specific niche, Vimeo is a better place to start sharing your content. If you have business goals that revolve heavily around search optimization and ads, YouTube is your best bet.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=7e8681b3-9162-45a4-b6a1-f33ff244a78a&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"New call-to-action\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/7e8681b3-9162-45a4-b6a1-f33ff244a78a.png\"></a></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fyoutube-vs-vimeo&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 08 Mar 2022 12:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/b33cfd44-133a-49e3-a943-086c5679d485.png","linkMd5":"be7dafc5977404caa82c10b938b1410d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn34@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-26-48-389_cf13f3171c1652e5.webp","destWidth":625,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":6230,"destBytes":9478,"author":"kcook@hubspot.com (Karla Hesterberg)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/b33cfd44-133a-49e3-a943-086c5679d485.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn34@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-26-48-389_cf13f3171c1652e5.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Imported%20sitepage%20images/youtube-vs-vimeo-mini-infographic-market-motive.jpg?width=790&name=youtube-vs-vimeo-mini-infographic-market-motive.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn88@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-26-54-682_5c49f26b5a0d36be.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/7e8681b3-9162-45a4-b6a1-f33ff244a78a.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn84@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-26-53-229_61f66f8328bd53cd.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fyoutube-vs-vimeo&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn25@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-26-54-994_4ad67a02c3a430ec.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647246408203},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:26:48","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:26:48","title":"370 Best Instagram Captions: Good, Cool, Funny, & Cute IG Quotes","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-captions","description":"<p>If you're anything like me, you take about four minutes choosing a filter for your Instagram photo, and about four hours deciding on a caption.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Worst of all, after much creative effort and advice from friends, I'm usually barely able to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/write-good-instagram-caption?_ga=2.101382273.1039695984.1631207651-2064995039.1631207651\">write a caption</a> that goes beyond, \"Had a fun day with friends!\"</p> \n<p>And I'm a writer — go figure.</p> \n<p>Next time you're contemplating a witty line of text to go with your Instagram photo, take a look at our complete list of captions that suit any mood or occasion you’ll be sharing with the world.

Your caption is on-brand.</h3> \n<p>Whether your Instagram page is personal or for your business, your captions should be on-brand, or reflective of your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/agency/develop-brand-identity\">brand identity</a>.</p> This encapsulates the nature of your Instagram's branding and tone of voice. For example, if your page is based on self-love, you should use captions that are friendly in tone, and use inclusive language to make people feel good when they scroll through your Instagram profile. \n<br> <h3>2. Your caption is simple.</h3> <p>Instagram captions can fit up to 2,200 characters, but you don't have to use all of them for your caption to be considered a good one. You ideally want to keep your captions clear, short, and simple for easy readability. You also want to keep your audience's attention enough to read it to finish.</p> <p>The exception to this is if you're making posts that champion storytelling or other lengthy formats. Ultimately, it comes down to what your audience is looking for.</p> <h3>3. Your caption is memorable.</h3> <p>While your Instagram caption doesn't have to be a profound piece of literature, you can make it memorable in a number of ways. Depending on the type of post you're sharing, you can make it hilarious, thought-provoking, inspiring, or anything you want it to be.&nbsp;</p> <p></p> <a></a> <h2>Business Instagram Captions</h2> <p>If you’re running a business account, you should use your captioning to humanize your business more than your average paid ad.</p> <p>Your business Instagram captions are an opportunity to give your brand some personality while getting the word out about your product or service offering. Here are some of our go-to captions that prospects and customers will love.</p> <p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/r1WjSm56W13yxdtfr__8LHh-2JsSQwQrluZfW343DUMU-RKrtQ3JPEdnPBAYVxeXNXD70ccKYmQNNVpJGSPKuD3KaGpMAOpe6RHMsM7TD74Fe0uLXvmJl_uR02QvhSfRx-g-NxuY\" width=\"350\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 350px;\" alt=\"Instagram captions: If you're offered a seat on a rocket ship, don't ask what seat.

The best brands combine physical, emotional, and logical elements into one exceptional customer (and employee) experience that you value as much as they do.</p> \n<p>When your brand creates a genuine connection with customers and employees, they'll stay loyal to your company, thereby increasing your overall profitability. But this type of success doesn’t happen overnight.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=72c7ece3-b9c6-4064-8a2a-33f42783a2d5&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"→ Free Resource: 100 Mission Statement Templates &amp; Examples\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/72c7ece3-b9c6-4064-8a2a-33f42783a2d5.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<p>Building brand loyalty, like creating mission and vision statements, takes time. If you’re in a bit of a time crunch, use this table of contents to find precisely what you’re looking for to inspire the development of your company’s mission:</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<a></a> \n<p></p> \n<p>As a company grows, its objectives and goals may be reached, and in turn, they'll change. Therefore, mission statements should be revised as needed to reflect the business's new culture as previous goals are met.</p> \n<p>But first, you have to understand how to write a proper mission statement to build off of as your company evolves.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h3>1. Explain your company’s product or service offering.</h3> \n<p>You want prospects to understand what your company does in a literal sense. This means explaining your offering in basic, clear terms. Your explanation should answer the most basic questions like:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Are you selling a product or service?</li> \n <li>Why would customers buy it?</li> \n <li>How does your offering solve for the customer?</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Record your answers and focus on how your product or service brings value to your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/buyer-persona-research?_ga=2.259565891.832425509.1645127728-603726757.1645127728\">buyer personas</a>, otherwise known as your target audience.</p> \n<h3>2. Identify the company’s core values.</h3> \n<p>Now, this is where you can start thinking bigger. You didn’t just make a product or service at random, you most likely were motivated by a set of <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/company-values?_ga=2.259565891.832425509.1645127728-603726757.1645127728\">core values</a>.</p> \n<p>Core values are deeply ingrained principles that guide a company’s actions. Take HubSpot’s culture code, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/34234/the-hubspot-culture-code-creating-a-company-we-love.aspx?_ga=2.94915669.832425509.1645127728-603726757.1645127728#:~:text=Employees%20who%20work%20at%20HubSpot,%2C%20Adaptable%2C%20Remarkable%2C%20Transparent.\">HEART</a>, for example:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Humble</li> \n <li>Empathetic</li> \n <li>Adaptable</li> \n <li>Remarkable</li> \n <li>Transparent</li> \n</ul> \n<p>These are principles that not only company employees respect, but are principles that our customers appreciate as well. By identifying core values that hold meaning on personal and organizational levels, you’ll have an appealing set to add to your mission statement.</p> \n<h3>3. Connect how your company's offering aligns with your values.</h3> \n<p>So how can your company offering serve your core values? You need to draw a connection between the two in a way that makes sense to the public.</p> \n<p>For example, if one of your core values is centered on innovation, you want to frame your product or service as pushing boundaries and explaining how it helps customers innovate their lives or business practices. Essentially, you’re taking the literal benefit of the offering and expanding it to serve a higher purpose.</p> \n<h3>4. Condense these statements into one.</h3> \n<p>A mission statement can be as short as a single sentence, or as long as a paragraph, but it’s meant to be a short summary of your company’s purpose. You need to state the what, who and why of your company:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>What:</strong> The company offering</li> \n <li><strong>Who:</strong> Who you’re selling to</li> \n <li><strong>Why:</strong> The core values you do it for</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Once you have successfully conveyed your message, it’s time to refine and perfect your statement.</p> \n<h3>5. Make sure it’s clear, concise, and free of fluff.</h3> \n<p>Above all, your mission statement is a marketing asset that is meant to be clear, concise, and free of fluff. It should clearly outline the purpose of your company offering and demonstrate the common goals the company is working to achieve. You should also have other team members or advisors read the mission statement and make adjustments if needed according to their recommendation.</p> \n<p>Both mission and vision statements are often combined into one comprehensive \"mission statement\" to define the organization's reason for existing and its outlook for internal and external audiences — like employees, partners, board members, consumers, and shareholders.</p> \n<p>The difference between mission and vision statements lies in the purpose they serve.</p> \n<a></a> \n<p></p> \n<p>A mission statement is a literal quote stating what a brand or company is setting out to do. This lets the public know the product and service it provides, who it makes it for, and why it’s doing it. A vision statement is a brand looking toward the future and saying what it hopes to achieve through its mission statement. This is more conceptual, as it’s a glimpse into what the brand can become in the eyes of the consumer and the value it will bring in longevity.</p> \n<p>In summary, the main differences between a mission and vision statement are:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Mission statements</strong> describe the current purpose a company serves. The company's function, target audience, and key offerings are elements that are often mentioned in a mission statement.</li> \n <li><strong>Vision statements</strong> are a look into a company’s future or what its overarching vision is. The same elements from the mission statement can be included in a vision statement, but they'll be described in the future tense.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Now that we know what they are, let’s dive into some useful examples of each across different industries.</p> \n<a></a> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a style=\"color: #33475b; text-decoration: none; font-weight: normal;\"></a></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Free Guide:</strong><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/100-mission-statements?hubs_post-cta=header\"> </a><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/100-mission-statements?hubs_post-cta=header\">100 Mission Statement Templates &amp; Examples</a></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/100-mission-statements?hubs_post-cta=image\"><img alt=\"100-mission-statements examples\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/17%20Truly%20Inspiring%20Company%20Vision%20and%20Mission%20Statement%20Examples-1.gif?width=350&amp;name=17%20Truly%20Inspiring%20Company%20Vision%20and%20Mission%20Statement%20Examples-1.gif\" title=\"\" width=\"350\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 350px;\"></a></p> \n<p>Need more examples to build your mission statement?

Life is Good answers that question below the fold, where the mission is explained in more detail using a video and with links to the <a href=\"https://www.lifeisgood.com/blog/\">company’s community</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.lifeisgood.com/kidsfoundation/kidsfoundation.html?ecom=true\">Life is Good Kids Foundation page</a>. We really like how lofty yet specific this mission statement is — it's a hard-to-balance combination.</p> \n<h3>2. <a href=\"https://www.sweetgreen.com/our-story/\">sweetgreen</a>: To inspire healthier communities by connecting people to real food.</h3> \n<p><img alt=\"Best Missions Statement Examples: sweetgreen's\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/27%20Truly%20Inspiring%20Company%20Vision%20and%20Mission%20Statement%20Examples-Feb-03-2022-08-53-45-71-PM.jpeg?width=400&amp;name=27%20Truly%20Inspiring%20Company%20Vision%20and%20Mission%20Statement%20Examples-Feb-03-2022-08-53-45-71-PM.jpeg\" title=\"Sweet Green's logo\" width=\"400\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 400px;\"></p> \n<p>Notice that sweetgreen's mission is positioned to align with your values — not just written as something the brand believes. We love the inclusive language used in its statement.</p> \n<p>The language lets us know the company is all about connecting its<a href=\"http://sweetgreen.com/our-story/\"> </a>growing network of farmers growing healthy, local ingredients with us — the customer — because we're the ones who want more locally grown, healthy food options.</p> \n<p>The mission to connect people is what makes this statement so strong. And, that promise has gone beyond sweetgreen's website and walls of its food shops: The team has made strides in the communities where it's opened stores as well. Primarily, it provides education to young kids on healthy eating, fitness, sustainability, and where food comes from.</p> \n<h3>3. <a href=\"https://www.patagonia.com.au/pages/our-mission\">Patagonia</a>: We’re in business to save our home planet.</h3> \n<p><img alt=\"Best Missions Statement Examples: Patagonia\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/27%20Truly%20Inspiring%20Company%20Vision%20and%20Mission%20Statement%20Examples-Feb-03-2022-08-53-49-08-PM.jpeg?width=650&amp;name=27%20Truly%20Inspiring%20Company%20Vision%20and%20Mission%20Statement%20Examples-Feb-03-2022-08-53-49-08-PM.jpeg\" title=\"Mountains and landscape \" width=\"650\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px;\"></p> \n<p>Patagonia's mission statement spotlights the company’s commitment to help the environment and save the earth. The people behind the brand believe that among the most direct ways to limit ecological impacts is with goods that last for generations or can be recycled so the materials in them remain in use.</p> \n<p>In the name of this cause, the company donates time, services, and at least 1% of its sales to hundreds of environmental groups worldwide.</p> \n<p>If your company has a similar focus on growing your business and giving back, think about talking about both the benefit you bring to customers and the value you want to bring to a greater cause in your mission statement.</p> \n<h3>4. <a href=\"https://www.americanexpress.com/in/company/mission.html\">American Express</a>: Become essential to our customers by providing differentiated products and services to help them achieve their aspirations.</h3> \n<p><img alt=\"Best Missions Statement Examples: American Express\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/27%20Truly%20Inspiring%20Company%20Vision%20and%20Mission%20Statement%20Examples-4.png?width=400&amp;name=27%20Truly%20Inspiring%20Company%20Vision%20and%20Mission%20Statement%20Examples-4.png\" title=\"American Express\" width=\"400\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 400px;\"></p> \n<p>Customers will never love a company until the employees love it first.</p> \n<p>— <a href=\"https://twitter.com/simonsinek/status/456545886143643649\">Simon Sinek (@simonsinek)</a></p> \n<p>The tweet above is from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/simonsinek\">Simon Sinek</a>, and it's one that we repeat here at HubSpot all the time. American Express sets itself apart from other credit card companies in its list of values, with an ode to excellent customer service, which is something it’s famous for.</p> \n<p>We especially love the emphasis on teamwork and supporting employees so that the people inside the organization can be in the best position to support their customers.</p> \n<h3>5. <a href=\"https://www.warbyparker.com/history\">Warby Parker</a>: To offer designer eyewear at a revolutionary price, while leading the way for socially conscious businesses.</h3> \n<p><img alt=\"Best Missions Statement Examples: Warby Parker\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/27%20Truly%20Inspiring%20Company%20Vision%20and%20Mission%20Statement%20Examples-Feb-03-2022-08-53-49-39-PM.jpeg?width=400&amp;name=27%20Truly%20Inspiring%20Company%20Vision%20and%20Mission%20Statement%20Examples-Feb-03-2022-08-53-49-39-PM.jpeg\" title=\"Warby Parker \" width=\"400\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 400px;\">This \"objective\" statement from Warby Parker uses words that reflect a young and daring personality: \"rebellious,\" \"revolutionary,\" \"socially-conscious.\" In one sentence, the brand takes us back to the root of why it was founded while also revealing its vision for a better future.</p> \n<p>The longer-form version of the mission reads: \"We believe that buying glasses should be easy and fun. It should leave you happy and good-looking, with money in your pocket,\" which further shows how Warby Parker doesn't hold back on letting its unique personality shine through. Here, the mission statement's success all comes down to spot-on word choice.</p> \n<h3>6. <a href=\"https://www.invisionapp.com/company\">InvisionApp</a>: Question Assumptions. Think Deeply. Iterate as a Lifestyle. Details, Details. Design is Everywhere. Integrity.</h3> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/vLSCcgqGINNDtMNLG_sWXthFTYX5By8DPDs9Kud7qDayzeutvJ6jBZrImwRfusVUn8qeNPs5ozjQVhnOeAH8dfo2I0BoYOvxNwTDHlKPSLQwmG9J9Ce_ZXlvXcmmlnpzKnAHZMj1\" width=\"650\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px;\" alt=\"Best Missions Statement Examples: InVision App\"></p> \n<p>These days, it can seem like every B2B company page looks the same — but InvisionApp has one of the cooler<a href=\"http://www.invisionapp.com/company\"> </a>company pages I've seen. Scroll down to \"Our Core Values,\" and hover over any of the icons, and you'll find a short-but-sweet piece of the overall company mission under each one.</p> \n<p>We love the way the statements are laid out under each icon. Each description is brief, authentic, and business babble-free — which makes the folks at InvisionApp seem trustworthy and genuine.</p> \n<h3>7. <a href=\"https://www.honesttea.com/our-mission\">Honest Tea</a>: To create and promote great-tasting, healthy, organic beverages.</h3> \n<p><img alt=\"Best Missions Statement Examples: Honest Tea's\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/27%20Truly%20Inspiring%20Company%20Vision%20and%20Mission%20Statement%20Examples-3.png?width=650&amp;name=27%20Truly%20Inspiring%20Company%20Vision%20and%20Mission%20Statement%20Examples-3.png\" title=\"Honest Tea\" width=\"650\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px;\"></p> \n<p>Honest Tea's mission statement begins with a simple punch line connoting its tea is real, pure, and therefore not full of artificial chemicals. The brand is speaking to an audience that's tired of finding ingredients in its tea that can't be pronounced and has been searching for a tea that's exactly what it says it is.</p> \n<p>Not only does Honest Tea have a punny name, but it also centers its mission around the name. For some time, the company even<a href=\"https://www.honesttea.com/content/dam/nagbrands/us/honesttea/en/mission/CCD20-231%20HT%20Mission%20Brochure-R10.pdf\"> published a Mission Report</a> each year in an effort to be \"transparent about our business practices and live up to our mission to seek to create and promote great-tasting, healthier, organic beverages.\"</p> \n<h3>8. <a href=\"https://ikea.jobs.cz/en/vision-culture-and-values/#:~:text='To%20create%20a%20better%20everyday,be%20able%20to%20afford%20them'.\">IKEA</a>: To offer a wide range of well-designed, functional home furnishing products at prices so low that as many people as possible will be able to afford them</h3> \n<h3><img alt=\"Best Missions Statement Examples: IKEA\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/27%20Truly%20Inspiring%20Company%20Vision%20and%20Mission%20Statement%20Examples-Feb-03-2022-08-53-48-67-PM.jpeg?width=650&amp;name=27%20Truly%20Inspiring%20Company%20Vision%20and%20Mission%20Statement%20Examples-Feb-03-2022-08-53-48-67-PM.jpeg\" title=\"Ikea \" width=\"650\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px;\"></h3> \n<p>The folks at IKEA dream big. The vision-based mission statement could have been one of beautiful, affordable furniture, but instead, it's to make everyday life better for its customers. It's a partnership: IKEA finds deals all over the world and buys in bulk, then we choose the furniture and pick it up at a self-service warehouse.</p> \n<p>\"Our business idea supports this vision ... so [that] as many people as possible will be able to afford them,\"<a href=\"http://www.ikea.com/ms/en_SG/about_ikea/our_business_idea/index.html\"> the brand states</a>.</p> \n<p>Using words like \"as many people as possible\" makes a huge company like IKEA much more accessible and appealing to customers.</p> \n<h3>9. <a href=\"http://shop.nordstrom.com/c/company-history\">Nordstrom</a>: To give customers the most compelling shopping experience possible.</h3> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/KckXCKu2LdRAyGANsCMxkjFfeCJTqWGDLSHMzm98nbjWPrt3q1vy7MU4pVqvTdlleneDEVvwbYbhQlVHPvObLjk-ZVJBIsjtKuXXr3NIWsdpI0eg7JSYvTVWkrcJPgUbQxGFx6rq\" width=\"650\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px;\" alt=\"Best Missions Statement Examples: Nordstrom\"></p> \n<p>When it comes to customer commitment, not many companies are as hyper-focused as Nordstrom is. Although clothing selection, quality, and value all have a place in the company's mission statement, it’s crystal clear that it’s all about the customer: \"Nordstrom works relentlessly to give customers the most compelling shopping experience possible.\"</p> \n<p>If you've ever shopped at a Nordstrom, you'll know the brand will uphold the high standard for customer service mentioned in its mission statement, as associates are always roaming the sales floors, asking customers whether they've been helped, and doing everything they can to make the shopping experience a memorable one.</p> \n<h3>10. <a href=\"https://www.cradlestocrayons.org/what-we-do/our-mission-and-model/#:~:text=Our%20Mission%3A%20Cradles%20to%20Crayons,by%20engaging%20and%20connecting%20communities.\">Cradles to Crayons</a>: Provides children from birth through age 12, living in homeless or low-income situations, with the essential items they need to thrive – at home, at school, and at play.</h3> \n<p><img alt=\"Best Missions Statement Examples: Cradles to Crayons\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/27%20Truly%20Inspiring%20Company%20Vision%20and%20Mission%20Statement%20Examples-Feb-03-2022-08-53-45-18-PM.jpeg?width=650&amp;name=27%20Truly%20Inspiring%20Company%20Vision%20and%20Mission%20Statement%20Examples-Feb-03-2022-08-53-45-18-PM.jpeg\" title=\"Cradles to Crayons \" width=\"650\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px;\"></p> \n<p>Cradles to Crayons divided its mission and model into three sections that read like a game plan: The Need, The Mission, and The Model. The \"rule of three\" is a powerful rhetorical device called a tricolon that's usually used in speechwriting to help make an idea more memorable. A tricolon is a series of three parallel elements of roughly the same length — think \"I came; I saw; I conquered.\"</p> \n<h3>11. <a href=\"https://www.uhsinc.com/mission-statement/\">Universal Health Services, Inc.</a>: To provide superior quality healthcare services that: PATIENTS recommend to family and friends, PHYSICIANS prefer for their patients, PURCHASERS select for their clients, EMPLOYEES are proud of, and INVESTORS seek for long-term returns.</h3> \n<p><img alt=\"Best Missions Statement Examples: Universal Health Services\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/27%20Truly%20Inspiring%20Company%20Vision%20and%20Mission%20Statement%20Examples-Feb-03-2022-08-53-47-32-PM.jpeg?width=650&amp;name=27%20Truly%20Inspiring%20Company%20Vision%20and%20Mission%20Statement%20Examples-Feb-03-2022-08-53-47-32-PM.jpeg\" title=\"Universal Health Services\" width=\"650\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px;\"></p> \n<p>A company thrives when it pleases its customers, its employees, its partners, and its investors — and Universal Health Services endeavors to do just that, according to its mission statement. As a health care service, it specifically strives to please its patients, physicians, purchasers, employees, and investors. We love the emphasis on each facet of the organization by capitalizing the font and making it red for easy skimming.</p> \n<h3>12. <a href=\"https://www.jetblue.com/corporate-social-responsibility/\">JetBlue</a>: To inspire humanity – both in the air and on the ground.</h3> \n<p><img alt=\"Best Missions Statement Examples: JetBlue\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/27%20Truly%20Inspiring%20Company%20Vision%20and%20Mission%20Statement%20Examples-Feb-03-2022-08-53-46-81-PM.jpeg?width=650&amp;name=27%20Truly%20Inspiring%20Company%20Vision%20and%20Mission%20Statement%20Examples-Feb-03-2022-08-53-46-81-PM.jpeg\" title=\"JetBlue\" width=\"650\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px;\"></p> \n<p>JetBlue's committed to its founding mission through lovable marketing, charitable partnerships, and influential programs — and we love the approachable language used to describe these endeavors. For example, the brand writes how it \"set out in 2000 to bring humanity back to the skies.\"</p> \n<p>For those of us who want to learn more about any of its specific efforts, JetBlue's provided details on the Soar With Reading program, its partnership with KaBOOM!, the JetBlue Foundation, environmental and social reporting, and so on. It breaks down all these initiatives really well with big headers, bullet points, pictures, and links to other web pages visitors can click to learn more. JetBlue also encourages visitors to volunteer or donate their TrueBlue points.</p> \n<h3>13. <a href=\"https://www.workday.com/en-us/company/about-workday/core-values.html\">Workday</a>: We aim for innovation not only in our development organization but also in the way we approach every aspect of our business.</h3> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/oHsgTu_MtbdcM2RPkNilhIbqcd6lPBflaECBWDQlp43SxCyoc19xXbK_fqBrhKzeHl0IU88JHsjMm-lgGQHUcijlHQoxOarLAmzd-sHLW8-2whhV5RLHGCevG4Zsc1Dr6eHvtAIK\" width=\"650\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px;\" alt=\"Best Missions Statement Examples: Workday\"></p> \n<p>Workday, a human resources (HR) task automation service, doesn't use its mission statement to highlight the features of its product or how it intends to help HR professionals improve in such-and-such a way.</p> \n<p>Instead, the business takes a stance on the state of enterprise software in general: There's a lot of great tech out there. But at Workday, it revolves around the people. We love how confident yet kind this mission statement is. It observes the state of its industry — which Workday believes lacks a human touch — and builds company values around it.</p> \n<h3>14. <a href=\"https://prezi.com/about/\">Prezi</a>: To reinvent how people share knowledge, tell stories, and inspire their audiences to act.</h3> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_ZBzI0wxybj4V_WHVlHv3CxlMy11uylhObkz4IoVenC-SnIg3FWUQdmSa_t_rPvlpO86UFxwleYyl1C-Tb6cHxnl5xOzggBBGFgJ8JtCPE00JzrpCY-ouSRo4pCBYZrmDunAnNqj\" width=\"650\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px;\" alt=\"Best Missions Statement Examples: Prezi\"></p> \n<p>If you know Prezi, you know how engaging it can make your next business presentation look. According to its mission statement, the company's clever slide animations and three-dimensional experience aren't just superficial product features. With every decision Prezi makes, it's all about the story you tell and the audience that story affects.</p> \n<h3>15. <a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/about\">Tesla</a>: To accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy.</h3> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202022-02-03%20at%204-03-33%20PM-png.png?width=650&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202022-02-03%20at%204-03-33%20PM-png.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px;\" width=\"650\" alt=\"Best Missions Statement Examples: Tesla\"></p> \n<p>A car company's punny use of the word \"accelerate\" is just one reason this mission statement sticks out. However, Tesla makes this list because of how its mission statement describes the industry.</p> \n<p>It may be a car company, but Tesla's primary interest isn't just automobiles — it's promoting sustainable energy. And, sustainable energy still has a \"long road\" ahead of it (pun intended) — hence the world's \"transition\" into this market.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, a mission statement that can admit to the industry's immaturity is exactly what gets customers to root for it — and Tesla does that nicely.</p> \n<h3>16. <a href=\"https://invisiblechildren.com/challenge/\">Invisible Children</a>: To end violence and exploitation facing our world's most isolated and vulnerable communities.</h3> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/KEEZh3wumIE2uUqJfcFZJlq7LG0iVo8iSh7xy1xd5NyRzww4r4mVbUCcxXXhgilzaf1a9CHeMXYwr0ZxYKC80KqGBo5aIOpnG4C5fZEzWHwWmPNIUPfzUj52f4HEeljzNMy-v4yt\" width=\"500\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 500px;\" alt=\"Best Missions Statement Examples: Invisible Children\"></p> \n<p>Invisible Children is a non-profit that raises awareness around the violence affecting communities across Central Africa, and the company takes quite a confident tone in its mission.</p> \n<p>The most valuable quality of this mission statement is that it has an end goal. Many companies' visions and missions are intentionally left open-ended so that the business might always be needed by the community. Invisible Children, on the other hand, wants to \"end\" the violence facing African families. It's an admirable mission that all businesses — not just nonprofits — can learn from when motivating customers.</p> \n<h3>17. <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/about/our-organization\">TED</a>: Spread ideas.</h3> \n<p><img alt=\"Best Missions Statement Examples: TED\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/27%20Truly%20Inspiring%20Company%20Vision%20and%20Mission%20Statement%20Examples-Feb-03-2022-08-53-48-30-PM.jpeg?width=650&amp;name=27%20Truly%20Inspiring%20Company%20Vision%20and%20Mission%20Statement%20Examples-Feb-03-2022-08-53-48-30-PM.jpeg\" title=\"TED\" width=\"650\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px;\"></p> \n<p>We've all seen TED Talks online before. Well, the company happens to have one of the most concise mission statements out there.</p> \n<p>TED, which stands for \"Technology Education and Design,\" has a two-word mission statement that shines through in every Talk you've seen the company publish on the internet. That mission statement: \"Spread ideas.\" Sometimes, the best way to get an audience to remember you is to zoom out as far as your business's vision can go. What do you really care about? TED has recorded some of the most famous presentations globally, but in the grand scheme of things, all it wants is to spread ideas around to its viewers.</p> \n<p>Now that we’ve gone over successful mission statements, what does a good vision statement look like?

The question is, how exactly does it help brands better plan campaigns?</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=a145a75e-59f6-4b51-a482-4f3ea486e740&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Free Resource: Content Marketing Planning Template\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/a145a75e-59f6-4b51-a482-4f3ea486e740.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<p>Let’s dive into how it works, review some stats, and see some brand examples.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>A media mix is another term for an overview of the channels businesses choose to execute their marketing strategies on. Ultimately, media mix optimization is the process of analyzing the performance of those channels.</p> \n<p>Think about the last campaign you saw from one of your favorite brands. What did they do differently that really clicked with you? By incorporating a media mix into your yearly planning, you can narrow down what resonates with your audience.</p> \n<h2>Media Mix Example</h2> \n<p>To see how a media mix works for a campaign, let’s use makeup brand <a href=\"https://thelipbar.com/\">The Lip Bar</a>’s latest campaign: \"Something BAWSE is coming.\"</p> \n<p>To build anticipation around its latest product launch and celebrate its 10-year company anniversary, The Lip Bar launched a multi-channel campaign that reached audiences both online and offline.</p> \n<p>First up, website.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"media mix example showing makeup brand's campaign on their website\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/What%20is%20a%20Media%20Mix%20%26%20The%20Most%20Effective%20Types%20%5BHubSpot%20Blog%20Data%5D-1.jpeg?width=600&amp;name=What%20is%20a%20Media%20Mix%20%26%20The%20Most%20Effective%20Types%20%5BHubSpot%20Blog%20Data%5D-1.jpeg\" title=\"\" width=\"600\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 600px;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://thelipbar.com/\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>When you land on the brand’s homepage, you’ll see an image of the CEO with the following sentence \"Shark Tank said no, 12,000 5-star reviews later, 100% that bawse.\"</p> \n<p>Upon clicking on the image, you’ll arrive at a landing page that has a timeline of the brand. From launching in 2012, to opening its flagship store in 2019, then expanding to 1500+ stores in 2021. Once you get to 2022, you see the tagline \"Something Bawse is Coming.\"</p> \n<p>As you continue scrolling, you reach a section that offers a launch date and time for the brand’s newest product.</p> \n<p>The second digital channel the brand leveraged for this campaign is YouTube, publishing a 45-second video showing the CEO’s journey over the last 10 years.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 853px; max-height: 480px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.27%; margin: 0;\">\n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0BfxeqsaYLE\" width=\"853\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n </div> \n</div> \n<p>Moving offline, the brand also published billboards in five cities to continue the campaign.</p> \n<p>Note how the billboard didn’t use the tagline we saw on social media platforms.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"media mix example showing makeup brand's billboard campaign\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/What%20is%20a%20Media%20Mix%20%26%20The%20Most%20Effective%20Types%20%5BHubSpot%20Blog%20Data%5D.jpeg?width=600&amp;name=What%20is%20a%20Media%20Mix%20%26%20The%20Most%20Effective%20Types%20%5BHubSpot%20Blog%20Data%5D.jpeg\" title=\"\" width=\"600\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 600px;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CZwiA_ILpBj/\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>The benefit of using a media mix is to leverage different strategies to see which tactics work and lead to better conversions.</p> \n<p>The Lip Bar’s latest campaign is a great example of how any brand can leverage channels differently to reach the same marketing goal.</p> \n<h2>Media Mix Stats in 2022</h2> \n<p>In January 2022, we surveyed over 600 <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/media-planning\">media planners</a> to discover their strategies, goals, and challenges. Here are some interesting findings:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>84% of media planners surveyed leverage a mix of organic and paid media.</li> \n <li>Email marketing is the most leveraged media channel, used by 1 in 2 media planners.</li> \n <li>41% of media planners surveyed will change their media mix in 2022, while 45% will keep it the same.</li> \n <li>14% of media planners currently leverage non-fungible tokens (NFTs) while 16% plan to use them for the first time in 2022.</li> \n <li>39% of those who use NFTs in their media planning say they have the best ROI of any channel in their media mix.</li> \n <li>39% of marketers surveyed say determining the most effective media mix is the biggest challenge of media planning.</li> \n</ul> \n<h2>Media Mix Optimization</h2> \n<p>Media mix optimization provides businesses with an understanding of how their messages are coming across to customers. It allows a brand to invest more time and money into marketing strategies that are best suited for their audiences.</p> \n<p>Marketers might consider optimizing their media mix if they want to gain some helpful insight into what time and capital is needed to target their audience in a way that gives customers a personalized experience.</p> \n<p>But, while media mix optimization is a powerful opportunity for methodizing data collection online, it's not the best strategy for marketers who employ a lot of traditional marketing techniques, since you can't really measure the success of a billboard or newspaper ad.</p> \n<p>However, to make guided decisions such as what font to use in creative design, when to publish social media posts on various channels, or where to invest resources, this method can be helpful.</p> \n<p>Optimizing a media mix means looking at the analytics and ROI of various marketing strategies. This can be anything from engagement data of social media platforms to views on the newest commercial.</p> \n<p>That's where media mix modeling comes in. If media mix optimization is the \"what,\" modeling is the \"how.\" Every model can (and should) look different, depending on your marketing and broader business goal.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Media mix models can be used to analyze the relationship between a dependent variable and an independent variable.</p> \n<p>For instance, let's say a business has a question like, \"How did paying for a sponsored tweet affect overall blog traffic?\" The business's media mix model should then accurately depict how a dependent variable – like overall blog traffic – relates to an independent variable, such as investing in Twitter.</p> \n<p>For businesses still deciding if a media mix optimization is a good idea for them, we've put together key tips to guide you when creating a media mix model. Let's explore those, next.</p> \n<h2>Tips for Optimizing Your Media Mix</h2> \n<h3>1. Collect personal level data.</h3> \n<p>The goal here is to find and focus on analytics that will help provide an accurate picture of how customers engage with your media mix.</p> \n<p>Analytics software is expansive and offers an array of tools for use. If you're in the market for one, the <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing\">HubSpot Marketing Hub</a> is a great place to go.</p> \n<p>Having too many metrics can be confusing and lead to inaccurate data. The best plan is to have an idea of which metrics need to be tracked so they can be right at the beginning.</p> \n<p>A normal media mix optimization process can take anywhere from a few months to a year. So, collecting the right information at the beginning contributes to getting the most accurate information overall.</p> \n<h3>2. Have a robust reporting process.</h3> \n<p>When using a media mix, you often combine online and offline strategies. With this in mind, it can be more difficult to measure the impact of a billboard compared to a paid social ad.</p> \n<p>That means you’ll have to think outside of the box when evaluating your media mix. For instance, while an online ad will have clear conversion rates you can find, a billboard may require some creative tracking.</p> \n<p>Perhaps, you can track the uptick in branded search volume or improved brand recall.</p> \n<p>This requires having a robust reporting process that accounts for the events you’ll be tracking – both online and offline.</p> \n<h3>3. Choose the right platform.</h3> \n<p>Marketing teams that use CMS or analytics software are already ahead of the game. Software like this is essential to optimizing a media mix because it can give you numbers that would otherwise take some time to figure out manually.</p> \n<p>A brand can analyze its media mix with the use of platforms that collect engagement data in real-time and compile that data into tracking reports.</p> \n<p>Look for a platform that can give a holistic view of results across the board, so results will maintain consistency. It's also good to choose software that specializes in the marketing channels being used at the time.</p> \n<p>Because optimizing is measuring a lot of different data at once, stick to as few systems as possible.</p> \n<p>For businesses that are in the market for a CMS,<a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/content-management-system?_ga=2.32061246.1093091538.1581343599-940436819.1565181751\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/content-management-system?_ga=2.32061246.1093091538.1581343599-940436819.1565181751\">HubSpot offers tools</a> that are easy to use for brands of any size.</p> \n<h3>4. Analyze the data.</h3> \n<p>We've been talking a lot about the kind of data and analyzing that needs to be done in a media mix optimization, but another important factor is being able to interpret and understand that data.</p> \n<p>It's no secret that in the marketing world, there is an abundance of processes and acronyms floating around. While first getting into the groove of understanding them and what they mean can be intimidating, it's important to know the data being collected and how to use it to your advantage.</p> \n<p>For instance, if a marketing team had especially high click-to-open rates for weekly newsletters, that's useful information to infer that the next campaign could benefit greatly from an email-marketing rollout. Alternatively, if a marketing team has no idea what a click-to-open rate is, those numbers aren't going to be helpful — just a little confusing.</p> \n<p>Reading data to understand its usefulness is just as important as collecting it.</p> \n<h3>5. Consider public perception.</h3> \n<p>Knowing how the public perceives your brand can help fill in some interpretation gaps during the modeling process. In the media mix model, think about how to fit in customer opinion. That way, the numbers will have some customer opinions to define them.</p> \n<p>There are a couple of ways to do this.</p> \n<p>To better understand your brand perception, monitor your brand mentions on social media. Take note of the positives, the negatives, and the questions. You can also create a survey to know how your customers feel about your company and its services and use a net promoter score.</p> \n<p>An NPS asks customers how likely they are to recommend a business to a friend. Knowing this will aid in figuring out how a business fares among the competition in the market. It will also assist in future marketing endeavors.</p> \n<p>For instance, if customers fill out your survey and ask for more personalized Instagram stories, your team could take that knowledge and include it in your next campaign.</p> \n<p>This method ultimately gives the media mix optimization reigns to the customer.</p> \n<p>Media mix optimization can help your marketing team figure out which distribution channels will best promote an upcoming campaign, and can ultimately help strengthen your marketing strategy as a whole.</p> \n<p><em>Editor's Note: This post was originally published in Feb. 2020 and has been updated for comprehensiveness. </em></p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=dc23c777-516f-4c62-b371-70b180c87a3e&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"Blog - Content Mapping Template\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/dc23c777-516f-4c62-b371-70b180c87a3e.png\"></a></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fmedia-mix&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 01 Mar 2022 12:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/a145a75e-59f6-4b51-a482-4f3ea486e740.png","linkMd5":"561d994faf8c508bd2e5132b41ce2364","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn48@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-26-48-852_f8c910eb1e0201f6.webp","destWidth":483,"destHeight":60,"sourceBytes":4217,"destBytes":7328,"author":"Kayla Carmicheal","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/a145a75e-59f6-4b51-a482-4f3ea486e740.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn48@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-26-48-852_f8c910eb1e0201f6.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/What%20is%20a%20Media%20Mix%20%26%20The%20Most%20Effective%20Types%20%5BHubSpot%20Blog%20Data%5D-1.jpeg?width=600&name=What%20is%20a%20Media%20Mix%20%26%20The%20Most%20Effective%20Types%20%5BHubSpot%20Blog%20Data%5D-1.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn51@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-26-51-817_f224b3a7c8b4a7c9.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/What%20is%20a%20Media%20Mix%20%26%20The%20Most%20Effective%20Types%20%5BHubSpot%20Blog%20Data%5D.jpeg?width=600&name=What%20is%20a%20Media%20Mix%20%26%20The%20Most%20Effective%20Types%20%5BHubSpot%20Blog%20Data%5D.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn62@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-26-57-239_9d0ddf4316cdfe18.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/dc23c777-516f-4c62-b371-70b180c87a3e.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn1@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-26-53-723_d198dce450120884.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fmedia-mix&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn68@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-26-56-631_e7ff58d00b36a57b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647246408215},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:26:48","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:26:48","title":"How Market Intelligence Will Make Your Marketing Team More Agile","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/market-intelligence","description":"<p>When I was younger, my dream was to open a cheese store with my family.

For companies that prioritize intelligence data, decision-making can be <a href=\"https://techjury.net/blog/business-intelligence-statistics/#gref\">five times faster</a>.</p> \n<p>Feeling hesitant to rely on intelligence data? <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-top-10-trends-in-data-and-analytics-for-2020\">Gartner reports</a> over one-third of organizations will rely on decision intelligence by 2023, making data intelligence a must for remaining competitive.</p> \n<p>Below, let's review what market intelligence is, how it's different from market research, and the intel tools that can facilitate the process.</p> \n<p>Market intelligence is used to learn about the existing market, customers, problems, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/competitive-intelligence-competitive-advantage\">competition</a>, and growth potential. Businesses can gather this information through internal and external sources such as sales logs, surveys, social media, news websites, manufacturers, clients, or distributors.</p> \n<p>For instance, companies can gather general demographics and spending habits of their consumers to write better, more targeted <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/social-media-marketing?_ga=2.89808924.622785003.1614973949-456434430.1614973949\">social media ads</a>. Additionally, market intelligence can help a company make decisions on product development and establish a stronger brand.</p> \n<h2>How to Gather Market Intelligence</h2> \n<p>So, what type of information should you collect? Generally, market intelligence can be divided into four main categories of information:</p> \n<h3>Competitor Intelligence</h3> \n<p>This is the process of <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/competitive-intelligence-competitive-advantage\">learning more about your competitors</a>. To do this, you might conduct a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/swot-analysis\">SWOT analysis</a>, so you can look at the competition's strengths and weaknesses. The goal is to uncover why customers would choose competitors over your product or service.</p> \n<h3>Product Intelligence</h3> \n<p>Once you've analyzed how you compare to your competitors, look inward at your own product or service. The goal is to learn about its quality and performance and identify opportunities for improvement.</p> \n<p>If you have a physical product, you should also analyze your manufacturing process. Are you building your product in the most efficient way? This information should help you improve the user experience and improve your product.</p> \n<h3>Market Understanding</h3> \n<p>To truly understand how your product is performing, you'll have to look at the various markets where it's available. Could you <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/market-development-strategy\">expand your product </a>to other markets? Are there other markets that could benefit from your product or service?</p> \n<p>Ultimately, this information should help you understand where your audience is and what gaps exist, so you can fill them.</p> \n<h3>Customer Understanding</h3> \n<p>Understanding your customer helps to increase your product or service life cycle. That's because it's usually more expensive to gain a new customer than to keep an existing one.<a href=\"https://www.invespcro.com/blog/customer-acquisition-retention/\"></a></p> \n<p>For this reason — and many others — you have to know your audience. Why do your customers buy from you? What challenges do you help them resolve? The goal here is to gather the information that can help your marketing team come up with targeted campaigns.</p> \n<p>Overall, gathering market intelligence should answer questions like:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Where should we devote more resources?</li> \n <li>What markets can we enter next?</li> \n <li>What are our customers purchasing patterns?</li> \n <li>What audiences should we market to?</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Now, you might be wondering, <em>\"How do I gather this information?\"</em></p> \n<p>To conduct market intelligence, you'll use internal and external sources of data, such as:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Surveys</li> \n <li>Polls</li> \n <li>Forms</li> \n <li>Focus groups</li> \n <li>Interviews</li> \n <li>Observation</li> \n <li>A/B tests</li> \n <li>Competitor tracking analytics</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Depending on the analytics you have available, a lot of this information can be found on your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/7969/what-is-a-cms-and-why-should-you-care.aspx\">content management system </a>(CMS) or <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/how-to-use-crm\">customer relationship management </a>(CRM).</p> \n<p>However, before we jump into the software you can use to find this information, I know you're probably thinking, <em>\"How is this different from market research?\" </em>Let's dive into that below.</p> \n<p>Alternatively to market intelligence, market research focuses on learning more about the buyer's research process and what influences their buying decisions.</p> \n<h2>Example of Market Intelligence</h2> \n<p>Let’s walk through an example of how a fictional company could use market intelligence to create a competitive advantage.</p> \n<p>JKL Podcasting Co offers online software podcasters can use to record, edit, and distribute their podcast to major streaming platforms. As marketers at JKL look to expand the company’s user base, they performed an in-depth analysis of the market for podcast recording software.</p> \n<p>In this analysis, they covered four areas:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>Competitor landscape — They identified the top-ranking podcast recording software companies to understand their product features, pricing model, sales funnel, marketing tactics, and customer demographics.</li> \n <li>Product — After gathering competitor information, they worked with their product team to gain a deep understanding of their own product including key features, how it was like competitor products, and what differentiated it from competitor products. They also learned about up-and-coming features launching later in the year.</li> \n <li>Market analysis — Next, the team did research to understand the overall valuation and growth potential of the podcast recording software market. They learned podcast listenership has <a href=\"https://www.insiderintelligence.com/insights/the-podcast-industry-report-statistics/\"><span>grown over the past decade</span></a> and is expected to grow more in coming years, which could lead to more podcasts being produced. With seeing growth and investment in the podcasting space, along with increased interest in people wanting to start podcasts, marketers at JKL learn there is a potential market for new, or up-and-coming podcasters who want easy-to-use software.</li> \n <li>Customer base — Finally, the JKL marketing team reached out to a focus group of their current customers to understand their relationship to the product. The customers walk them through their podcast production workflow using JKL software and share what features they love, along with what new features or changes they would like to see.</li> \n</ol> \n<p>After going through this exercise, JKL has gained valuable insight into their competitive landscape, product features to highlight, market growth opportunities, and ways to keep their current customer base engaged and using the platform.</p> \n<p>You're probably wondering, <em>\"How do I gather this information?\" </em>Below, let's review what tools and software you can use.</p> \n<h2>Market Intelligence Tools</h2> \n<p>For market intelligence to be useful, companies need to conduct research and sort through their collected data for analysis. A lot of this can be done through your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/how-to-use-crm\">CRM software</a>.</p> \n<p>To start, many CRMs allow you to create competitor profiles in which you will track your competitors' products, price points, organizational updates, social media activity, and more.</p> \n<p>You'll likely also find <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/battle-cards\">battle card templates </a>in your CRM, making it easy for your sales reps to access the information they need during their calls to combat objections and persuade prospects.</p> \n<p>In addition, you can conduct regular <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/questions-to-ask-win-loss-review\">win/loss analysis </a>with your sales team to determine strengths and weaknesses in your sales and/or marketing strategy. You'll want to know:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>What factors are contributing to your wins and losses?</li> \n <li>What other company was the prospect considering for the sale? Why?</li> \n <li>Which competitors are you beating and which ones you are losing to?</li> \n</ul> \n<p>If you don't already have a CRM, there are many out there that cater to businesses ranging from small to enterprise-level. Pricing is usually structured on a monthly basis and can range anywhere from $20/month to $1200+.</p> \n<p>If your team would rather focus on specific tools, there are several online options to help you achieve your goals. Below are a few we recommend, divided into sections depending on your goals. Additionally, if you're a HubSpot user, many of these tools integrate with <a href=\"https://ecosystem.hubspot.com/marketplace/apps/all-categories?eco_search=market%20intelligence\"></a><a href=\"https://ecosystem.hubspot.com/marketplace/apps/all-categories?eco_search=market%20intelligence\">HubSpot</a>.</p> \n<h3>Competitor Intelligence</h3> \n<h4>1. <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing\">HubSpot's Marketing Hub</a></h4> \n<img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/HubSpot-homepage.jpg?width=600&amp;name=HubSpot-homepage.jpg\" alt=\"Market-Intelligence-Marketing-Hub\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"http://Hubspot.com\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>HubSpot's Marketing Hub has extensive tools to help marketing teams manage, track and scale their efforts.

What do you want to learn and why? Use that to steer your approach.</p> \n<p>Having a clear direction is essential during this stage to narrow down what data to focus on. You'll be compiling a lot of data, and not all of it will be relevant to your main objective. Knowing which will be most impactful will save you so much time and allow you to use your resources efficiently.</p> \n<p>Now that you know what to focus on, start organizing and reviewing your data. You'll want to look for patterns. During this step, keep an open mind. Confirmation bias (the tendency to interpret information to support a pre-existing idea or belief) can greatly impact how you interpret data, so it's important to consider all perspectives.</p> \n<p>Once you identify a theme or trend, dive deeper to answer the 5Ws. <strong>When </strong>did it start? <strong>Who </strong>or <strong>what </strong>is influencing this? <strong>Why </strong>is it happening? <strong>Where </strong>else is this trend identified?</p> \n<p>From there, it's time to strategize. Based on what your data is telling you, you can develop an action plan and make recommendations to key stakeholders.</p> \n<p>For instance, let's say your latest intel revealed that consumers are unaware of a key feature in your product line, which is steering them toward your competitors. Your recommendation could be to launch a marketing campaign that highlights that feature, create stronger messaging on your website product pages, and adjust the sales team's scripts to place more emphasis on this feature and how it's better suited for your customers than a competitor's.</p> \n<p>The formula is easy: collect, organize, identify, and recommend. Understanding your market is key to entering the market and maintaining your place in it. But if you want to stand out among your competition, you'll need to leverage market intel.</p> \n<p>Market intelligence can give you a holistic view of the market, improve customer retention, boost your efficiency, and give you a competitive advantage. So, I'm not being hyperbolic when I say market intelligence is vital for your company to succeed.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=560aa80b-9e0b-4615-851c-f23e4f49b62f&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"New Call-to-action\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/560aa80b-9e0b-4615-851c-f23e4f49b62f.png\"></a></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fmarket-intelligence&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 25 Feb 2022 12:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/6ba52ce7-bb69-4b63-965b-4ea21ba905da.png","linkMd5":"b47d3bfc04c03ae2c134f7bcac0bbc4e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn24@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-26-48-507_3c323ccea639359f.webp","destWidth":486,"destHeight":60,"sourceBytes":5174,"destBytes":7456,"author":"Rebecca Riserbato","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/6ba52ce7-bb69-4b63-965b-4ea21ba905da.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn24@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-26-48-507_3c323ccea639359f.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/HubSpot-homepage.jpg?width=600&name=HubSpot-homepage.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn9@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-26-57-094_63f3d495408b2212.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/%5BUpdate%5D%20How%20Market%20Intelligence%20Will%20Make%20Your%20Marketing%20Team%20More%20Agile.jpeg?width=600&name=%5BUpdate%5D%20How%20Market%20Intelligence%20Will%20Make%20Your%20Marketing%20Team%20More%20Agile.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn64@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-26-53-836_28f16eed15f7949e.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/SEMrush-homepage.jpg?width=600&name=SEMrush-homepage.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn80@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-26-54-093_3f5b1acb19c5a373.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/%5BUpdate%5D%20How%20Market%20Intelligence%20Will%20Make%20Your%20Marketing%20Team%20More%20Agile-1.jpeg?width=600&name=%5BUpdate%5D%20How%20Market%20Intelligence%20Will%20Make%20Your%20Marketing%20Team%20More%20Agile-1.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn93@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-26-57-130_0714962c665e7666.webp","https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/VEBz4QjG_mC2Cy0dKSXRQu1VDeAMlGvQkOByf1L9GfyjXDLJMjKfLW44cfEnj4P0_1Fezf7r1dmxVPME7qYH-A9QSX0Y-4uEl1hsmbrZ2OUCv57pRqTFHIF_BKWeNnvrKNG0-nFY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn54@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-26-51-698_1cae5f461cd756a5.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Metadata.io-homepage.jpg?width=600&name=Metadata.io-homepage.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn85@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-26-49-805_472e769c95a3bc67.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google-Forms.jpg?width=600&name=Google-Forms.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn10@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-26-55-319_f858af862c01f911.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/%5BUpdate%5D%20How%20Market%20Intelligence%20Will%20Make%20Your%20Marketing%20Team%20More%20Agile-3.jpeg?width=600&name=%5BUpdate%5D%20How%20Market%20Intelligence%20Will%20Make%20Your%20Marketing%20Team%20More%20Agile-3.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn43@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-26-50-280_54ef9f2700766d63.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google-Analytics-homepage.jpg?width=600&name=Google-Analytics-homepage.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn98@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-26-50-047_4297be3c29aa9c9e.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/560aa80b-9e0b-4615-851c-f23e4f49b62f.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn58@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-26-54-369_56bafbfb62a605be.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fmarket-intelligence&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn66@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-26-54-618_b56b13e70ea8bb43.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647246408221},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:26:48","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:26:48","title":"What is Content Governance?

Content governance ensures that you have a definitive way for this content to reach them. Who creates the content? On what platform is it published? How will it be updated in the future? While these questions and their answers help shape content governance, its framework involves more.</p> \n<p>Content governance is more than consumer-facing content. It requires preliminary and behind-the-scenes work seen in an asset like an <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/business-blog-editorial-calendar-templates\">editorial content calendar</a>. Consumers don’t have access to your company’s content calendar; however, this is an irreplaceable tool to keep your company on track with its strategy. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/31247/the-simple-template-for-a-thorough-content-style-guide.aspx\">Style guides</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/company-content-audit\">content audits</a> are other tools that assist with content governance but are unseen by consumers.</p> \n<p>Content governance encompasses content sent to consumers and content that waits for them. It is not only reserved for social media posts that land on their feed or emails sent to their inbox. It includes banner ads or frequently asked questions on your website. It’s your Instagram bio or the answering message you have for phone calls. In a business, content is <em>everywhere</em>, and content governance allows your business to manage all of its avenues.</p> \n<h2>Why is content governance important?</h2> \n<p>To illustrate the importance of content governance, let’s look at an analogy.</p> \n<p>Content marketing is like a first date. You wine and dine with visuals and information and hope it builds a budding relationship. If it does, how do you move forward and keep building?</p> \n<p>After that initial interaction, you publish two emails, one blog post, and four social media posts during week one. You drop the ball in week two. The amount of content decreases to one email and two social media posts. Week three is worse, but during week four, you’re able to publish three emails, two blog posts, and five social media posts. While the increase in content <em>seems</em> remarkable, your potential long-term customer has unsubscribed from your content after a month. Why?</p> \n<p><em>Content</em> needs to be <em>governed</em> by procedures and systems. Procedures mean consistency, and consistency is key to the success of any business. It shows effort and demonstrates to customers that you <em>care</em>.</p> \n<p>Content works as a cycle. Although the number of steps might differ for each organization, content life cycles typically follow this process:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Develop a strategy.</li> \n <li>Create the content.</li> \n <li>Store the content.</li> \n <li>Edit.</li> \n <li>Publish.</li> \n <li>Analyze.</li> \n <li>Update or repurpose content.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>The content cycle never ends. There is always work to do. Use the steps above. If you finish strategizing, focus on content creation. If you’re not creating, your company can work on storing, editing, publishing, and more.</p> \n<p>Content governance is important because it ensures that your company maintains an efficient process in its continuous content cycle. It can prevent delays, inconsistent messaging, or even legal issues. Content governance helps:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Provide structure</li> \n <li>Establish clear roles and responsibilities</li> \n <li>Create detailed processes and workflows</li> \n <li>Outline company standards and policies</li> \n</ul> \n<p>A comprehensive content governance model creates a standard for effective, consistent content, resulting in continued success.</p> \n<p>The online world is fast-paced, and to keep up, businesses need to make sure that they’re covering all avenues. It used to mean website and email content; however, the growth of social media has expanded the number of channels businesses need to account for. Companies have had to shift gears and adjust their content strategies to accommodate social platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn.</p> \n<p>While content grows and changes, its governance models help companies scale, sustain, and recreate their content.</p> \n<h2>Creating a Content Governance Model</h2> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/content-governance-models.png?width=650&amp;name=content-governance-models.png\" alt=\"content governance model components\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>You’re ready to create your content governance model. While each step might require extensive work, the process isn’t complicated. Building your content governance model requires four steps.</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Establish and define the roles and responsibilities of the content team.</li> \n <li>Design content workflows.</li> \n <li>Create policies, standards, and procedures for content.</li> \n <li>Document guidelines and ensure company-wide compliance.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Let's go over these one-by-one.</p> \n<h3>1. Establish and define the roles and responsibilities of the content team.</h3> \n<p>Good content doesn’t exist without people. While you could argue that the most vital person in the content experience is the consumer, you could also contend that content would not exist without the team.</p> \n<p>To create a content governance model, decide on the roles and responsibilities of those within the company. Content roles include strategists, writers, editors, and analysts. When defining the obligations of the people in these roles, think about their function. Team members typically have a strategic, operational, or specialist function.</p> \n<p>A strategic function, usually seen in roles like a content strategist, is for those who plan long-term strategy. Staff, who are operational, implement the content strategy daily. This work is carried out by writers, editors, photographers, and more. Lastly, members of the specialist function provide expert data to other team members. This could be an SEO specialist providing analytical information to strategists or writers that shape how they fulfill their role.</p> \n<p>When establishing the roles and responsibilities for your team, you might find it necessary to create an overlap in function. For example, it could be beneficial to have your content writers specialize in SEO. As long as there is a clear distinction in role and responsibility, there should be no issue in team management.</p> \n<h3>2. Design content workflows.</h3> \n<p>How does your content go from Point A to Point B? Point A is an idea while Point B is publication. Consumers cannot see this process, but multiple steps are necessary to reach publication.</p> \n<p>Content workflows follow these stages:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-marketing-plan\"><strong>Strategy</strong></a><strong>:</strong> planning content</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-creation\"><strong>Creation</strong></a><strong>:</strong> writing, designing, filming, content</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ultimate-editing-checklist\"><strong>Review</strong></a><strong>:</strong> editing and fact-checking content</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-distribution\"><strong>Publication/Distribution</strong></a><strong>:</strong> publishing and sharing content</li> \n</ul> \n<p>While the list is short, the process isn’t. Content takes time. Once you’re aware of what it takes to create your content, use this to shape your policies, standards, and procedures.</p> \n<h3>3. Create policies, standards, and procedures for content.</h3> \n<p>Once you have the proper people in place, it is time to focus on your policies, standards, and procedures. Content policies are the values and goals of a company. Standards are targets used to make sure that a company upholds its policies. Procedures are a step-by-step breakdown of who is involved and what steps are needed to achieve the ultimate goal.</p> \n<p>Consider this example. An online company has the <strong>policy</strong> to be a leading source of global news. The company enforces this policy by setting a <strong>standard</strong> for publishing at least 10 daily articles. Members of the content team, like the writers, editors, and publishers, have <strong>procedures</strong> to guide them through the content process and ensure that 10 articles are shared with the public every day.</p> \n<p>Once your company creates policies, standards, and procedures for content, finish the process with documentation and compliance.</p> \n<h3>4. Document guidelines and ensure company-wide compliance.</h3> \n<p>There is no use in creating a content governance model if no one knows about it. The most significant element of content governance is ensuring that the entire company has access to it and complies with it.</p> \n<p>Create documents for your company policies, standards, and procedures, and put them in a central location. Hold a meeting to walk through content processes and workflows. And lastly, regularly review and update your content governance models.</p> \n<h2>Content never ends.</h2> \n<p>Content lives on a lifecycle. You might think a blog post is complete after it is published and distributed, but its cycle continues with updates and redistribution. Managing one blog post without a system is most likely doable, but imagine an additional 20 content assets in one week.

But with so many email marketing tools available today, where should you start? We'll answer those questions and more in this guide to email marketing services — let's dive in.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>What is an email marketing service?</h2> \n<p>Email marketing services and software streamline all of your email marketing efforts. They have a wide range of features depending on the service you choose — however, they often have functionality related to automation, subscription, general email communication, notifications, monitoring, campaigns, integration with other marketing, sales, and service software, and analytics.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Why is an email marketing service important?</h3> \n<p>Today, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/email-marketing-2017\">email marketing services continue to be an integral, strategic tool</a> for businesses of all sizes across all industries — they help businesses build strong relationships with prospects and customers all while moving them through the buyer's journey and maintaining strong communication throughout.</p> \n<p>Not to mention, as <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/free-email-accounts\">ESPs</a> continue to develop, features like A/B Testing, automation, and personalization have made the tools even more valuable to a marketer looking to engage with an increasingly fragmented audience.</p> \n<p>Now let's look at some of the best email marketing services today — one of which you might choose to implement at your company.</p> \n<a></a> \n<p></p> \n<p>For each of the following services, we've listed notable features as well as pricing details but we still recommend reviewing the service's product and pricing pages for greater detail.</p> \n<h3>1.

Additionally, you can run <a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/email/run-an-a/b-test-on-your-marketing-email\">A/B tests</a> to compare different versions of an email to understand which one resonates the most with your audience.

A battlefield for brand experience. If companies can create a lasting positive impression among potential customers, they can drive sales and set the stage for long-term loyalty. But what exactly is brand experience? What does effective design require and what does it look like in practice? Most importantly, how do brands create experience strategies that deliver reliable results over time?</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Brand experience describes the tangible and emotional experience consumers have while interacting with your brand. Think of it as a holistic approach that combines elements of user experience, customer experience, and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/agency/develop-brand-identity\">brand identity</a> all in one.</p> \n<p>Brand experience encompasses all the feelings consumers have before, during, and after interacting with your brand. Take <a href=\"https://www.nestle.com/brands/allbrands/toll-house\">Nestlé Toll House</a> for example. When most people think of them, they think of cookies. You may even remember baking cookies using Toll House chocolate chips, the smell as they baked, and finally, savoring every last bite. You may even associate the brand with moments of bonding with family as you baked cookies together.</p> \n<p>In this case, the Toll House brand experience has moved beyond just the consumption of chocolate chips. It’s an emotional connection built over time with consumers and how their products integrate into the lives of the people who buy them.</p> \n<p>While brand experience is similar to user experience, it encompasses a broader perception of your brand at large. Where user experience speaks to the takeaways — positive or negative — of a user when they interact with your website or social media profiles, brand experience refers to the impression of your brand as a whole. Not surprisingly, positive user experiences inform better brand experiences (and vice versa) but the two are distinct concepts.</p> \n<p>It’s also important to understand that brand experience is subjective. While it’s possible to create experiences that produce reactions along a generalized spectrum, individual users will have different reactions to your efforts. In practice, this means that no matter how carefully you curate brand experience efforts, there will always be customers who come away with a negative reaction. As a result, the goal isn’t to create a universal experience but rather to create one that resonates positively with the largest number of target customers.</p> \n<h2>Breaking Down Brand Experience Design</h2> \n<p>Just <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/sap/2021/04/26/brand-experience-what-does-it-mean-and-how-can-it-be-your-differentiator/\">39%</a> of business decision-makers say their brand effectively resonates with prospective buyers. This is a problem: If customers don’t connect your brand with positive thoughts, feelings, and reactions, they’re less likely to remember your products and services when it comes time to make a purchase.</p> \n<p>Worth noting? Neutrality isn’t enough. While negative impressions of your brand can drive customers away from your site, neutral impressions are just as problematic — even if consumers see your brand listed in search engine results or advertised online, the absence of a positive brand impression means they won’t seek you out over companies that offer better connective messaging.</p> \n<p>So what does effective brand experience design look like? Four components are critical:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Everything%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20about%20Brand%20Experience.jpg?width=650&amp;name=Everything%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20about%20Brand%20Experience.jpg\" alt=\"Brand Experience vs. Customer Experience\" width=\"650\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 650px;\"></p> \n<h3>Perception</h3> \n<p>Perception forms a key part of the experience. This includes audio, visual, and tactical interactions that allow customers to connect a specific sense to advertising campaigns. In much the same way that particular smells can bring back memories of childhood experiences, brands that successfully merge senses with marketing can create connections that drive sales.</p> \n<h3>Participation</h3> \n<p>It’s also more likely that customers will walk away with a positive brand experience if they’re able to participate in some way rather than simply watch. This might include the ability to submit suggestions online or interact in real-time online question forums, or it could feature the use of physical installations that allow consumers to touch your product or provide direct feedback.</p> \n<h3>Personalization</h3> \n<p>Generic marketing campaigns can produce steady returns, but personalization can help encourage connection across different customer segments. By leveraging both user-provided data (with their consent) along with social media interactions and other engagement data, it’s possible to create more personalized efforts that help create connections between consumer needs and current product offerings.</p> \n<h3>Prioritization</h3> \n<p>Brand experience can’t be all things to all people. Attempts to capture every consumer in every circumstance actually undermine experience-driven efforts — as a result, it’s worth selecting specific brand metrics such as positive social mentions or repeat purchases to prioritize.</p> \n<h2>Creating a Brand Experience Strategy</h2> \n<p>So how do you build an effective brand experience strategy?</p> \n<h3>1. Assess whether or not you’re meeting customer expectations.</h3> \n<p>First up is identifying areas where your current experience isn’t meeting customer expectations. Social media interactions and customer service calls can help pinpoint potential problems — if consistent concerns around brand interaction or reaction arise, this can help frame the foundation of brand experience strategy.</p> \n<h3>2. Identify areas for improvement.</h3> \n<p>Next is targeting an area for improvement. While there may be more than one aspect of brand experience that could use a refresh or redesign, attempting to do everything at once can spread strategy efforts too thin and deliver less-than-ideal results. For example, you might choose to increase positive social mentions across specific channels such as Facebook or Instagram. While the eventual goal could be a larger social impact from initial contact to eventual conversion, easily-accessible social platforms provide an ideal starting point.</p> \n<h3>3. Measure your results.</h3> \n<p>Effective measurement follows to ensure efforts are bearing fruit. In the case of our social media example above, this means tracking user views, reactions, and responses to social media posts along with the sentiment — positive, negative, or neutral — that goes along with them. This is also the time to explore and innovate by testing multiple strategies to see which one sticks. From video campaigns to personalized storytelling to marketing efforts all designed to elicit specific emotions, it’s worth finding that resonates with your customer base and then fine-tuning your efforts to deliver ideal outcomes.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>It’s one thing to talk about brand experience building, but it’s another to see it in action. Here’s a look at five brand experiences efforts that offer effective in-practice examples.</p> \n<h3>1. <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/\">Apple</a></h3> \n<a class=\"hs-embed-content-wrapper\"></a>\n<a style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.5%; margin: 0px;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"position: relative; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: auto; border: none; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 650px; max-height: 367px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n  <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.46%; margin: 0;\">\n   <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pJIKPzZTJXM?feature=oembed\" width=\"650\" height=\"367\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </div> \n </div> </a> \n<p>One of the reasons Apple has such a devoted customer base is because of the brand experience they’ve created. From ads to Apple stores to the packaging of their products — all touch points work together to create a cohesive brand experience that highlights innovation, style, and functionality.</p> \n<p>Their products are cool, sleek, and user-friendly, all attributes highly coveted by Apple’s fans. Even their product announcements have become anticipated events. Apple is a pro at conquering the four \"Ps\" of brand experience (perception, participation, personalization, and prioritization) and incorporating them in all messaging. This helps Apple stay top of mind for consumers whether they’re in the market to buy or not. It’s not a smart phone, it’s an iPhone. It’s not a laptop, it’s a MacBook.</p> \n<h3>2. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/FHtvDA0W34I\">Red Bull</a></h3> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"position: relative; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: auto; border: none; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 650px; max-height: 365px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.15%; margin: 0;\">\n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FHtvDA0W34I\" width=\"650\" height=\"365\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n </div> \n</div> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In 2012, the company went all-in on its tagline “Red Bull gives you wings by sending skydiver Alex Baumgartner 24 miles above the Earth’s surface to pull off the highest skydive ever recorded and become the first person to break the sound barrier during freefall.</p> \n<p>While his record was broken two years later by an executive from Google, it doesn’t change the fact that Red Bull did something no one had ever done before and created a unique brand experience that aligned with its core marketing message.</p> \n<h3>3. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/RrftWVessAw\">Cadbury India</a></h3> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"position: relative; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: auto; border: none; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 650px; max-height: 365px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.15%; margin: 0;\">\n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RrftWVessAw\" width=\"650\" height=\"365\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n </div> \n</div> \n<p>Cadbury India opted for consumer suggestions in creating their new chocolate bar flavor. Customers were encouraged to visit the company’s dedicated chocolate bar platform that let them select ingredients and create a recipe. Cadbury then tried all suggested recipes and selected the best of those submitted.</p> \n<p>By prioritizing interaction over simple reaction, Cadbury facilitated consumer connection and encouraged customers to view chocolate bar making as a collaborative effort rather than a corporate endeavor, in turn creating a community-based brand experience.</p> \n<h3>4. <a href=\"https://www.nike.com/\">Nike</a></h3> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"position: relative; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: auto; border: none; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 650px; max-height: 365px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.15%; margin: 0;\">\n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fUldMpGbBdA\" width=\"650\" height=\"365\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n </div> \n</div> \n<p>Similarly to Cadbury, Nike found that giving customers more control over their products was a win. <a href=\"https://www.nike.com/nike-by-you\">Nike By You</a> allows customers to customize their favorite Nike kicks online using various color and style combinations.</p> \n<p>Their flagship store in NYC’s SoHo boasts a sneaker bar where customers can customize their shoes in person with dip-dyeing, patches, and accessories. This emphasis on customization and personalization allows Nike to fully integrate into their customers' lives, creating a brand experience that lasts long after they’ve made a purchase.</p> \n<h3>5. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/eaB8XkpHd64\">Lean Cuisine</a></h3> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"position: relative; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: auto; border: none; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 650px; max-height: 365px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.15%; margin: 0;\">\n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eaB8XkpHd64\" width=\"650\" height=\"365\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n </div> \n</div> \n<p>While healthy eating has taken off in recent years, messaging around this effort is often the opposite. With a focus on weight loss instead of overall health, many brands find themselves reinforcing harmful stereotypes that equate weight loss with personal worth.</p> \n<p>Lean Cuisine’s #WeighThis campaign looked to change the narrative by placing “scales” around New York’s Grand Central Station that encouraged women to “weigh in”.</p> \n<p>The catch? These scales were actually boards that let women write down how they would prefer to be measured — such as by their own persistence, accomplishments or efforts.</p> \n<p>Even better? Lean Cuisine marketers were smart enough to stay out of the way. There were no samples on offer, no surveys to fill out; women simply saw the scales and interacted with them, in turn boosting Lean Cuisine’s overall brand experience.</p> \n<h3>6. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/wpM499XhMJQ\">Dove</a></h3> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"position: relative; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: auto; border: none; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 650px; max-height: 488px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 75.08%; margin: 0;\">\n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wpM499XhMJQ\" width=\"650\" height=\"488\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n </div> \n</div> \n<p>Dove’s Campaign for Real Beauty took a similar approach to Lean Cuisine but opted for the use of viral video that highlighted beauty of all types — beauty that goes beyond photoshoots and photoshop. The campaign earned praise for both its authenticity and efforts to help boost self-esteem among young girls.</p> \n<p>By choosing emotional experience over a simple sales effort, Dove was able to better connect with its target customer base and boost overall customer loyalty.</p> \n<h3>7. <a href=\"https://www.zillow.com/\">Zillow</a></h3> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"position: relative; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: auto; border: none; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 650px; max-height: 365px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.15%; margin: 0;\">\n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fWOY9-X5mSg\" width=\"650\" height=\"365\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n </div> \n</div> \n<p>Zillow’s “To Move is to Grow” campaign tapped into 2021’s pandemic house hunting frenzy. As people started remote work, folks realized that they didn’t need to live in crowded cities, and browsing the home search site quickly became a common pastime, which <a href=\"https://youtu.be/yEfsaXDX0UQ\">Saturday Night Live</a> hilariously highlighted in one of its skits that year.</p> \n<p>Tugging at our heartstrings, Zillow tackled the emotional rollercoaster of moving. Using an aesthetic reminiscent of <a href=\"https://www.warnerbros.com/movies/where-wild-things-are\"><em>Where the Wild Things Are</em></a>, the first commercial showcases a child unsure about what her moving adventure will bring. The second one hones in on a seller’s perspective. Susan, the main character, is faced with a host of doppelgangers that try to influence her decision.</p> \n<p>With many across the globe feeling like their lives were in flux, Zillow was able to create a brand experience that showed empathy with their customers as they navigated their new normal during a pandemic. It also positioned the brand as a reliable guide to assist with their transition, whether buying or selling.</p> \n<h3>8.<a href=\"https://youtu.be/OSYhPIAIU9o\"> WestJet</a></h3> \n<div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"position: relative; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: auto; border: none; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 650px; max-height: 367px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.46%; margin: 0;\">\n  <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OSYhPIAIU9o\" width=\"650\" height=\"367\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n </div> \n</div> \n<p>Canadian commercial airline WestJet has been running its “Christmas Miracle” campaign since 2013. Its 2021 version sees the company asking people what they miss the most during the holidays — not surprisingly, many mention absent family members. WestJet staff then provide plane tickets to help loved ones reconnect, and the end of the video features a tearful reunion in progress.</p> \n<p>Overall, it’s a feel-good experience designed to bring out emotions already close to the surface for many customers and in turn, boost the overall brand experience.</p> \n<h2>Building a Better Brand Experience</h2> \n<p>The right brand experience makes all the difference when it comes to cultivating long-term customer relationships. By understanding where current efforts don’t deliver, prioritizing areas for improvement, and tracking engagement metrics over time, it’s possible to build a brand experience that boosts customer connection and encourages long-term loyalty.</p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in February 2016 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=ddbf2eb7-04e8-44b2-9e05-b21264e09b65&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"brand consistency\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/ddbf2eb7-04e8-44b2-9e05-b21264e09b65.png\"></a></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fbrand-experience&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 10 Mar 2022 12:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/814dd420-0d49-40e0-b59c-f01066e186c1.png","linkMd5":"25b8724829410ff484ff4f980aa01943","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn32@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-26-48-558_eac7fa40866dc905.webp","destWidth":382,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":4555,"destBytes":6088,"author":"Doug Bonderud","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/814dd420-0d49-40e0-b59c-f01066e186c1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn32@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-26-48-558_eac7fa40866dc905.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Everything%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20about%20Brand%20Experience.jpg?width=650&name=Everything%20You%20Need%20to%20Know%20about%20Brand%20Experience.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn5@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-26-55-071_e3b7fe945edb1991.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/ddbf2eb7-04e8-44b2-9e05-b21264e09b65.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn81@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-26-50-164_f4156d3bc1379fd0.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fbrand-experience&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn35@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-26-56-808_7523cd1b4a8ce620.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647246408187},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:26:48","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:26:48","title":"29 Free Resume Templates for Microsoft Word (& How to Make Your Own)","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/resume-templates-word","description":"<p>No matter what industry you work in (or your experience level in that industry), a plain, black-and-white resume written in Times New Roman font just doesn't quite cut it anymore.</p>  \n<p>But just because resumes have gotten more creative doesn’t mean you need special design software to make your application stand out.

Open Microsoft Word on your computer.</h3> \n<p>If you have Microsoft Word installed on your computer, open the program and let it load for a moment. There will be a couple of helpful options waiting for you on the first screen, specifically for resume creation.</p> \n<h3>2. Select either \"Basic Resume\" or \"Bold Resume\" from the template menu.</h3> \n<p>Once you've launched MS Word, a window of templates will appear. Scroll down until you see the template options designed for resumes — there will be at least two of them. Double-click the one that suits your style and personal brand, but don't be too particular about design just yet ... you can customize these templates quite a bit.</p> \n<h3>3. Fill in your name and contact information at the top.</h3> \n<p>When your resume template opens, you'll see placeholder text for each line of your resume, starting with your first and last name at the top. Delete this header text and enter your name, as well as any contact information by which you want the recruiter to contact you.</p> \n<h3>4. Draft a brief summary of your experience and goals.</h3> \n<p>Use the first line below your name and contact info to describe who you are, what you do, and what you're looking for in your career.</p> \n<h3>5. Enter your school and latest education.</h3> \n<p>List any relevant degrees or certificates you received through schooling. You can safely exclude secondary education if you've graduated from an accredited college.</p> \n<h3>6. Describe each job you've held using the lines prompted on the template.</h3> \n<p>Your professional experience is frequently the most important section of your resume, so feel free to rank this section <em>above</em> your skills and education, depending on how many jobs you previously held.</p> \n<h3>7. List all relevant skills.</h3> \n<p>If you have experience in certain software, exercises, problem-solving, or management techniques, use them to populate your skills. Your resume's \"Skills\" section helps reveal what all of your previous jobs or related experiences have in common, based on what they taught you and what you provided them.</p> \n<h3>8. Describe any relevant accolades and accomplishments.</h3> \n<p>Finish out your resume with any personal accomplishments or accolades you think a hiring manager in your industry would appreciate. Although this section shouldn't include a <em>Most Improved</em> recognition from little league, for example, it should definitely include your <em>Marketer of the Month</em> award from your last position.</p> \n<p>Next, let’s cover <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-format-resume\">how to format your brand-new resume</a> in Word.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h2>How To Format a Resume in Word</h2> \n<p>When formatting a resume in Word, it’s important to know the right style. We’ll go over it piece by piece.</p> \n<h3>Set the Right Margins and Font Size</h3> \n<p>Your resume should contain one-inch margins on all sides. Most documents will automatically have one-inch margins, but it’s best to double-check or create them yourself. Here’s how to create one-inch margins for your resume:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Go to “Layout.”</li> \n <li>Click “Margins.”</li> \n <li>Click the “Normal” setting, where it states 1” on the top, bottom, left, and right sides of the document.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Lastly, make sure your font size is 12-pt. This font size is standard for most resumes. However, if you have a particularly long CV, you could potentially get away with an 11-pt font size to fit it all on one page.</p> \n<h3>Create Headers</h3> \n<p>You should separate each section (i.e., education, work experience) with a header.</p> \n<p>Create a header in Word by selecting “Styles”. You can use “Header 1” for your first and last name at the top of the page. “Header 2” is great for the “Education” section, “Work Experience” section, and “Skills” section. Use “Header 3” for employer names and job titles, and use normal text to fill in the details of your accomplishments, skills, and educational background.</p> \n<h3>Create Dividers</h3> \n<p>If you want to visually divide your resume into different parts, you can create dividers to split up the information and make your resume more scannable. Here’s how to add dividers:</p> \n<p>Go to “Insert”, select “Illustrations,” and then click “Shapes”. You can select “Lines” to draw a line in Word. Another shortcut to create dividers is pressing the “=”, “_”, or and “*” three times and hitting enter. These give a variation of dividers that can add dimension to your resume.</p> \n<h3>Create Bullet Points</h3> \n<p>The truth is, no hiring manager will read a paragraph of information, so we recommend using bullets instead to list your accomplishments and responsibilities underneath your job titles. When you open “Paragraph,” you’ll see a variation of bullet points you can use. Choose the one you like best.</p> \n<p>Sometimes, you might not have time to create and format a resume from scratch. Plus, if you’re already employed full-time, it’s hard to find the time to apply to a new job opportunity, let alone update your resume to reflect your qualifications.</p> \n<p>Luckily, there are numerous publishers out there who've created incredible resume templates for quick editing and formatting in Word.</p> \n<p>You can also find resume templates directly in Word, which we’ll go over next.</p> \n<p>To keep you from hunting the internet for resume templates that are both free and compatible with MS Word, we’ve listed some options below for you to customize with your own information right now.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Some of them come with variations so you can pick your favorite design. A few of them cater specifically to marketers.</p> \n<h2>Free Resume Template Downloads for Word</h2> \n<h3>1.

href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/landing-page-design\"><span>landing page</span></a>. They're simple pages — often with just a few lines of text and a form — to drive conversions and turn visitors into leads.</p> \n<p>When done correctly, a landing page can help you generate leads and pass off those qualified leads to your sales team.</p> \n<p>Here, we'll break down seven landing page builders and outline their costs, benefits, and drawbacks.</p> \n<h2>What is Leadpages?</h2> \n<p>One of the most popular tools for creating landing pages is Leadpages.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.leadpages.com/\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\"><span>Leadpages</span></a> offers a variety of tools that can help you create compelling landing pages — including pop-ups, a drag-and-drop page editor with a seemingly endless list of pre-made templates, and more.</p> \n<p>But Leadpages doesn't have a free version to help you get started, and doesn't offer many marketing tools beyond landing pages.</p> \n<p>If you're looking for an alternative to Leadpages, there are a number of different tools that you can explore.</p> \n<p>Let's take a look at the seven best Leadpages alternatives.</p> \n<h3>1. <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/landing-pages\">HubSpot's Landing Page Builder</a></h3> \n<p>HubSpot's landing page builder helps you build beautiful landing pages that fit seamlessly into your marketing campaigns.</p> \n<p>The drag-and-drop page editor is easy to use, and comes with a variety of templates for a number of different content offer types.</p> \n<p>It includes all of the modules you'd expect, like a rich text module and a forms module, but it also has a video module and a meetings module, so your prospects can book meetings with your sales team directly on your landing pages.</p> \n<div>\n <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/landing-pages?hubs_post-cta=image\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/The%207%20Best%20Leadpages%20Alternatives%20in%202020-3.png\" alt=\"\"></a>\n</div> \n<p><strong>Price:</strong><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"> Free</span></p> \n<p><strong>Pros:</strong> HubSpot's landing page builder is available for free and comes with the <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/crm?hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-leadpages-alternatives&amp;hubs_post-cta=HubSpot%20CRM\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\"><span>HubSpot CRM</span></a>.</p> \n<p>With the CRM, you can track every interaction your prospects have with your brand, allowing you to create marketing campaigns that focus on the end-to-end customer experience. And with <a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\"><span>HubSpot Academy</span></a>, you'll be able to learn how to effectively run a marketing campaign and easily apply those learnings to the next campaign you run.</p> \n<p>As you grow your business, HubSpot's landing page builder grows with you. You'll be able to run machine-learning powered tests on your landing pages to ensure you're constantly optimizing your pages for conversions, and revenue attribution reporting shows you exactly which offers are impacting your bottom line.</p> \n<p><strong>Cons:</strong> If you’re looking for more advanced features to help scale your marketing operations, you may need to upgrade to HubSpot's <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/pricing/marketing?hubs_content=www.hubspot.com%2Fproducts%2Fmarketing%2Flanding-pages&amp;hubs_content-cta=Starter%2C+Professional%2C+and+Enterprise+editions&amp;hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing%252Fbest-leadpages-alternatives&amp;hubs_post-cta=HubSpot%2527s%2520Landing%2520Page%2520Builder\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\"><span>Starter, Professional, and Enterprise </span></a>plans of Marketing Hub.</p> \n<h3>2. <a href=\"https://unbounce.com/\">Unbounce</a></h3> \n<p>Unbounce is one of the most popular landing page builders on the market today.</p> \n<p>They provide landing pages and pop-ups geared at turning traffic into revenue for your business. Unbounce comes with over 100 templates that you can easily customize in their drag-and-drop editor. All their templates also work with WordPress.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/unbounce.webp\" alt=\"unbounce\" width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px;\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"font-size: 11px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://unbounce.com/landing-page-templates/\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Price:</span></strong><span style=\"color: #33475b;\"> $90/month</span></p> \n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Pros:</span></strong><span style=\"color: #33475b;\"> With Unbounce, you never </span><span style=\"color: #303030;\">start from a blank page. Powered by AI, its Smart Builder pulls data from over 1.5 billion conversions — helping you to predict which layouts and headlines will work best for your target audience.</span></p> \n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #33475b;\">Cons:</span></strong><span style=\"color: #33475b;\"> Although powerful, Unbounce charges you based on the number of conversions you receive on your pages. For growing companies, this can add up quickly as you generate more leads from your content offers.</span></p> \n<h3>3. <a href=\"https://instapage.com/\">Instapage</a></h3> \n<p>Like the other landing page builders on this list, Instapage offers an easy-to-use content editor, and a number of templates to create your pages.</p> \n<p>Instapage also includes a feature called AdMap. With AdMap, you'll be able to visualize how your ads match your landing pages, and report on the effectiveness of your ad campaigns personalization.</p> \n<p>Their landing page solution also lets you leave comments on different elements of a landing page and @mention team members of yours, making it easy to collaborate on your marketing campaigns.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/instapage.png?width=1665&amp;name=instapage.png\" alt=\"instapage\" width=\"1665\" style=\"width: 1665px;\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"font-size: 11px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://instapage.com/\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p><strong>Price:</strong> $199/month</p> \n<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Instapages is one of the few landing page builders with built-in collaboration. We also like its<span style=\"color: #45536b;\"> 500+ layouts and near-instant page loads — with or without AMP.</span></p> \n<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Instapages limits the number of pages you can create, how many users you have, and the number of unique visitors to your pages.</p> \n<h3>4. <a href=\"https://mailchimp.com/\">Mailchimp</a></h3> \n<p>Mailchimp now does so much more than email.</p> \n<p>They've built out a full suite of marketing tools that helps small businesses get up and running with their digital marketing efforts. Their landing page builder works alongside their ads, email, and social media tools.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/instapages.png?width=1024&amp;name=instapages.png\" alt=\"instapages\" width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px;\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"font-size: 11px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.growthmarketingpro.com/mailchimp-landing-page-builder-software-review-and-pricing/\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p><strong>Price:</strong> Free — to a point. Paid plans start at $11/month</p> \n<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Their drag-and-drop editor is easy to use and lets you create beautiful on-brand landing pages in minutes.</p> \n<p><strong>Cons:</strong> You may need to upgrade to their paid tier to start collaborating with your teammates, get access to more templates, or start optimizing your campaigns.</p> \n<h3>5. <a href=\"https://www.clickfunnels.com/\">Clickfunnels</a></h3> \n<p>Clickfunnels is a landing page builder and marketing automation tool focused on the sales audience.</p> \n<p>Clickfunnels believes that your content should produce results just like your best sales reps would, and it's a solution aimed at moving prospects through a sales funnel into becoming customers.</p> \n<p>Clickfunnels has a number of templates to choose from based on intent — such as up-sell or webinar event pages. To edit these templates, you can use their drag-and-drop page editor to create a page that works for you and your business.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/clickfunnels.jpeg?width=750&amp;name=clickfunnels.jpeg\" alt=\"clickfunnels\" width=\"750\" style=\"width: 750px;\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"font-size: 11px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.clickfunnels.com\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p><strong>Price:</strong> $97/month</p> \n<p><strong>Pros:</strong> They have pre-built \"funnels\" that you can use to visualize your customer's journey with your brand — including follow-up funnels that will help you cultivate relationships with users who've converted on your content.</p> \n<p><strong>Cons:</strong> An important limitation to Clickfunnels is its lack of email marketing capabilities. Of course, you can integrate Clickfunnels with an email marketing tool, but this requires an additional fee on top of the $97/month starter plan.</p> \n<h3>6. <a href=\"https://www.sendinblue.com/\">Sendinblue</a></h3> \n<p>Sendinblue is a simple marketing automation tool that features a number of different tools that SMBs need.</p> \n<p>From email marketing, SMS, Facebook Messenger, and a CRM, you get a suite of tools that can help you communicate effectively with your customers.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/sendinblue-1.png?width=1024&amp;name=sendinblue-1.png\" alt=\"sendinblue-1\" width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px;\">\n</div> \n<div style=\"font-size: 11px; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://www.sendinblue.com/\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a>\n</div> \n<p><strong>Price:</strong> $65/month</p> \n<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Their suite of tools includes an intuitive and straightforward landing page builder with pre-built templates you can choose from.</p> \n<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Although intuitive, their landing page builder is not included in their free product offering. However, other free offerings like their email marketing and SMS features are a great way to see if Sendinblue is right for you.</p> \n<h3>7. <a href=\"https://www.getresponse.com\">GetResponse</a></h3> \n<p>Like other landing page builders on this list, GetResponse comes with a variety of tools that can help you build amazing marketing campaigns.</p> \n<p>With email marketing and pre-built sales funnels, you can quickly begin marketing to the leads that you generate on your landing pages. You can create your own design or choose from over 200 templates.</p> \n<p>They also include a mobile-first editor in case you want to enhance your mobile-visitors experience.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/The%207%20Best%20Leadpages%20Alternatives%20in%202020-1.png\" alt=\"\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"font-size: 11px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.getresponse.com/features/landing-page-creator?_ga=2.159176638.545940589.1599780698-1319341611.1599780698\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p><strong>Price:</strong> Create one landing page for free, then $12/month</p> \n<p><strong>Pros:</strong> What sets GetResponse apart are its features they provide to help you design your pages. For instance, they have built-in integrations with Shutterstock and Giphy to help you add compelling visuals to your landing pages.</p> \n<p>Additionally, its drag-and-drop builder is incredibly flexible, allowing you to place content blocks wherever you want on the landing page (rather than designated placeholders).&nbsp;</p> \n<p><strong>Cons: </strong><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">GetResponse is primarily an email marketing tool, not a landing page builder. So if you’re looking to get advanced with your landing pages, it's a good idea to test it out first.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<h2><strong>Choosing the Best LeadPages Alternative</strong></h2> \n<p>Ultimately, deciding what landing page builder you go with will depend on your business' needs.</p> \n<p>For instance, if you're looking for a point solution, tools like Unbounce or Instapage will be great for you — alternatively, if you're looking for a platform that you can use across all your marketing efforts, other tools like Mailchimp or GetResponse will be better suited for your needs.</p> \n<p>And, for growing teams looking to align their marketing efforts around the customer experience, HubSpot's landing page builder is a powerful choice for you. You can get started for free, and track your customers' journey with your brand through the HubSpot CRM.</p> \n<p>Plus, as you grow, you not only avoid having to rip out other tools, but you gain access to more advanced solutions that will help you unlock even more insights into your customers' experience.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=eef5f40f-7762-44f4-a238-46f3c6105c43&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"New Call-to-action\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/eef5f40f-7762-44f4-a238-46f3c6105c43.png\"></a></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fbest-leadpages-alternatives&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 08 Mar 2022 12:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/5ff38c7a-c12b-48c8-bb6f-4f066754c979.png","linkMd5":"fad73d938dfbdbfc51c243a018623045","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn80@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-26-48-465_692592cc39f8a803.webp","destWidth":499,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":5581,"destBytes":7886,"author":"agirard@hubspot.com (Alex Girard)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/5ff38c7a-c12b-48c8-bb6f-4f066754c979.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn80@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-26-48-465_692592cc39f8a803.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/The%207%20Best%20Leadpages%20Alternatives%20in%202020-3.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn13@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-26-51-497_dd0dffebc9a2e36d.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/unbounce.webp":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn96@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-26-54-406_1649d683e2a4b2d4.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/instapage.png?width=1665&name=instapage.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn23@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-26-49-873_de72df06cb9e9fa1.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/instapages.png?width=1024&name=instapages.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn49@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-26-54-099_0b3774d7ac2562f9.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/clickfunnels.jpeg?width=750&name=clickfunnels.jpeg":null,"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/sendinblue-1.png?width=1024&name=sendinblue-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn33@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-26-51-111_b9aee44d70a8fe93.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/The%207%20Best%20Leadpages%20Alternatives%20in%202020-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn21@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-26-49-440_1a42e144af15b5d7.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/eef5f40f-7762-44f4-a238-46f3c6105c43.png":null,"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fbest-leadpages-alternatives&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn19@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-26-49-928_6905958b8f62450e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647246408204},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:26:48","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:26:48","title":"What is Context Marketing?

That’s what context marketing is all about.</p> \n<p>Here, we're going to introduce the concept of context marketing and dive into strategies you can use to implement it into your overall marketing strategy.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=a145a75e-59f6-4b51-a482-4f3ea486e740&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Free Resource: Content Marketing Planning Template\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/a145a75e-59f6-4b51-a482-4f3ea486e740.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<p></p> \n<p>My favorite context marketing definition is delivering the right content, to the right people, at the right time.</p> \n<p>Let me explain what I mean by context a little more, though. When you have context around something, you have a larger, more telling picture — you know, those little details that lend more clarity to things that would otherwise be pretty general, unspecific, and, well, uninteresting.</p> \n<p>The best marketers leverage context about their audience, leads, and customers in their content marketing. They create <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/audience-profile\">audience profiles</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/buyer-persona-research\">buyer personas</a> and use that information to create more effective marketing and advertising campaigns.</p> \n<p>Now that we have a basic understanding of context marketing, you might be wondering what the difference is between content marketing and context marketing. Let’s take a look below.</p> \n<p>A marketer using context would know more about a lead than her first name. They might also know what industry she works in, what kind of content she likes best, through which channel she prefers to consume content, whether she's currently using another solution to meet her needs, and whether her company has budget at this time of year.</p> \n<p>As a marketer, if you were asked to \"market\" to someone, and all you were given was a first name and the type of company your lead works at, wouldn't your first question be ... what else do we know about her? Probably, if you want to do your job way better.</p> \n<p>That's the idea behind context marketing: Using what you know about your contacts to provide supremely relevant, targeted, and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/data-personalize-marketing-li\">personalized marketing</a>.</p> \n<h2>Why is context marketing important?</h2> \n<p>Context marketing is important for many reasons, but there are two top ones that make its importance even more salient. Let’s go over them below.</p> \n<h3>Context marketing converts better.</h3> \n<p>When you're creating marketing that's targeted at people's point of need, it stands to reason that marketing will perform much better for you, because you aren't delivering marketing content that's misaligned with their interests or stage in the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/what-is-the-buyers-journey\">buyer’s journey</a>.</p> \n<p>Think about it: If you know that a B2B lead is getting a new budget in January and it's December, you're able to send her insanely targeted content that addresses her needs — like, say, an offer for a custom demo of your product with a rep that specializes in the finance industry. That's content that she's pretty likely to convert on, especially if she's downloaded a buying guide and visited your product pages.</p> \n<p><strong>Hot tip</strong>: Keeping track of your prospect’s activity using <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/marketing-automation\">marketing automation software</a> will make context marketing easier. You’ll know which products your prospect is most interested in and how many times they’ve visited your website.</p> \n<h3>Context marketing increases retention.</h3> \n<p>When you have context around your relationship with a contact, you're able to provide more personalized and relevant marketing content that's targeted to their needs.</p> \n<p>This is great for two reasons: Personalized and relevant marketing is the foundation for <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-creation\">creating content</a> people love and engage with. What's more, personalized and relevant marketing is typically not the kind of marketing that annoys people into clicking \"unsubscribe\". If they feel like you’re out to solve their problems specifically, customers are much more likely to stay with you.</p> \n<p>Why not use the context around your relationships with your contacts to create marketing that they love and convert on? Let’s take a look at how you can get started.</p> \n<h2>How to Start Context Marketing</h2> \n<p>Alright, how does this \"context marketing\" theory manifest itself? What would it look like for you, as a marketer? With the help of <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products?hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33894/what-s-the-deal-with-this-whole-context-marketing-thing.aspx&amp;hubs_post-cta=integrated%20marketing%20software\">marketing automation software</a>, here are some examples of where you'd actually use the principle of \"context\" in your marketing.</p> \n<h3>1. Create specific offers for specific posts and pages.</h3> \n<p>One easy way you can start context marketing? Create offers that extend the value of your website. Bonus points if these offers answer a specific pain point or problem that a customer is trying to solve for when visiting that page.</p> \n<p>Most blog posts in HubSpot’s library feature an offer that’s directly related to the topic of the article. For instance, in our <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-plan-template-generator?hubs_post-cta=blognavcard-marketing\">blog post about creating a marketing plan</a>, you can download a marketing plan template — which is something that someone wanting to create a marketing plan might need.</p> \n<h3><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/context-marketing-example-offer.jpeg?width=650&amp;name=context-marketing-example-offer.jpeg\" alt=\"context marketing example: specific offer on HubSpot blog post\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></h3> \n<p>Come up with content offers that will benefit your readers and website visitors depending on the page they’re visiting. For instance, if you sell hiking shoes and you’re writing a blog post about going on a solo hiking trip, you might feature an offer for downloading a solo hiking checklist.</p> \n<h3>2. Add smart calls-to-action (CTAs) to your website.</h3> \n<p>You can take personalized offers to the next level by featuring smart <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/calls-to-action?hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33894/what-s-the-deal-with-this-whole-context-marketing-thing.aspx&amp;hubs_post-cta=dynamic%20CTAs\">calls-to-action</a>. Let’s say you have a variety of offers you want to use to convert traffic into leads, leads into qualified leads, and qualified leads into customers.</p> \n<p>To <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-increase-conversion-rate\">increase your lead conversion rates</a>, you probably don't want leads visiting a case study webpage (typically an action you'd perform further along in your buyer's journey), and finding a CTA leading them to a blog post (which is meant for people earlier in the buyer's journey).</p> \n<p>However, not everyone who visits a case study page on your website is necessarily ready to talk to a salesperson. You don't want to turn them away, either, by offering a CTA that's too pushy.</p> \n<p>Fortunately, with smart CTAs, you can actually surface a CTA that automatically aligns with the visitor's stage in the sales cycle ... or any other host of criteria you want to set. Think industry, business type, location, and past activity/behaviors.</p> \n<p>For instance, if you have already downloaded an offer from HubSpot, you might see this CTA on certain social-media-related posts:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/context-marketing-example-smart-cta.jpeg?width=650&amp;name=context-marketing-example-smart-cta.jpeg\" alt=\"context marketing example: smart cta\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>But if you haven’t downloaded an offer before, you’ll see the default CTA:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/context-marketing-example-default-cta.jpeg?width=650&amp;name=context-marketing-example-default-cta.jpeg\" alt=\"context marketing example: default cta\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>This type of smart content can help you capture your audience’s information at all stages of their buyer’s journey.</p> \n<p><strong>Hot tip</strong>: HubSpot’s marketing automation software lets you <a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/ctas/create-smart-calls-to-action-cta\">easily create a smart calls-to-action</a> with little technical knowledge.</p> \n<h3>3. Create smart forms that shorten the conversion cycle.</h3> \n<p>Smart forms know if someone has already filled out the form fields you're asking for. If you use smart forms, for instance, your site visitors won't see \"First Name\" and \"Last Name\" every time they fill out a form — instead, they'll answer those questions once, and then never again.</p> \n<p>This will help you glean new information about your leads each time they fill out a form, instead of just more of the same stuff. It also helps you create a more seamless, personalized user experience that leverages prior interactions with your website as context.</p> \n<p>Here’s one example from HubSpot Academy. This is what I see when I’m logged into the HubSpot CRM:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/context-marketing-example-smart-form.jpeg?width=650&amp;name=context-marketing-example-smart-form.jpeg\" alt=\"context marketing example: smart form\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>The form knows I’m a current HubSpot customer and doesn’t require me to create a new account. I only have to click one button: “Start the Course.”</p> \n<p>But this is what I see when I’m not logged in:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/context-marketing-example-default-form.jpeg?width=650&amp;name=context-marketing-example-default-form.jpeg\" alt=\"context marketing example: default form\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>Ultimately, smart forms will help you gather even more context about your visitors, leads, and customers, and help increase conversion rates over time.</p> \n<p><strong>Hot tip</strong>: You can easily <a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/cos-general/create-smart-forms?hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33894/what-s-the-deal-with-this-whole-context-marketing-thing.aspx&amp;hubs_post-cta=smart%20forms\">create smart forms</a> inside HubSpot’s marketing automation software.</p> \n<h3>4. Leverage dynamic email content and workflows.</h3> \n<p>Your forms and offers aren't the only things that need to be smart. Your email database — especially if you want to maintain your space in people's coveted inboxes — <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/email-list-segmentation\">needs to be segmented</a> into highly targeted lists, as well.</p> \n<p>I happen to be subscribed to Grammarly emails on both my work and personal emails. Because I only use the Grammarly Chrome extension at work, I receive emails like this:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/context-marketing-example-segmented-email-example.jpeg?width=650&amp;name=context-marketing-example-segmented-email-example.jpeg\" alt=\"context marketing example: grammarly segmented email\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\">In my personal account, however, I use Grammarly’s web app regularly and review thousands of words for a personal project. Here’s the email I get:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/context-marketing-example-segmented-email-grammarly.jpeg?width=650&amp;name=context-marketing-example-segmented-email-grammarly.jpeg\" alt=\"context marketing example: grammarly second segmented email\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\">Throughout the email, Grammarly prompts you to upgrade to the premium version and take advantage of its other tools. Because I don’t use the Chrome extension in my personal email account, it includes a call-to-action to install the extension. It’s delightful to receive an email that uses my account activity as context.</p> \n<p>Beyond email segmentation, your email lists need to be smart enough to know when to pull in a contact, and certain information you have in your database about that contact, into your email marketing campaigns.</p> \n<p>Remember, a great context marketer delivers the right content, to the right person, at the right time. So to send emails that are contextually relevant, you need to use their activity and background to deliver personalized content that delights them and prompts them to convert.</p> \n<h2>Context Marketing Examples</h2> \n<p>While context marketing may sound complicated, it’s actually quite simple in practice. In fact, as a customer, you may have seen or enjoyed context marketing yourself. Let’s take a look at some examples.</p> \n<h3>1. Google’s Product Ads Carousel</h3> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/context-marketing-example-google.jpeg?width=650&amp;name=context-marketing-example-google.jpeg\" alt=\"context marketing example: google product carousel ads\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>Have you ever looked up a product on Google and see a carousel at the top (as opposed to just the plain search results)? The products you see are typically ads for the exact same thing you searched for.</p> \n<p>This is a prime contextual marketing example. Google uses your behavior and search query to deliver ads that are contextually relevant. Imagine if, when searching for instant coffee, Google delivers ads for french presses instead. While you might be interested in French presses and even searched for them before, you’re looking for instant coffee right now.</p> \n<p>That’s why it’s important to answer for your customer’s specific pain points and queries, and to do so at the right time. And you don’t have to be a highly sophisticated search engine to do so. Remember those offers we spoke about in the previous sections? That can function in the same way as Google’s product carousels.</p> \n<h3>2. Asana’s New Feature Pop-Up</h3> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/context-marketing-example-asana.jpeg?width=650&amp;name=context-marketing-example-asana.jpeg\" alt=\"context marketing example: asana feature popup\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>There’s no more powerful place to carry out contextual marketing than right within your own product, website, or store. Asana’s example shows that you can upsell customers easily by marketing a new feature and prompting them to try it for free.</p> \n<p>This is an excellent example of contextual marketing because you wouldn’t be interested in trying this new feature unless you were a current Asana user. For instance, if Asana had placed this pop-up on their homepage, they likely wouldn’t have much success with it. But because it pops up after you log in, you’re more likely to say, “Sure, I’ll try it.”</p> \n<p>You can achieve something similar by instituting a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/website/website-personalization-examples-dynamic\">website personalization campaign</a>. When people visit your product page, for instance, they might see a popup to schedule a meeting with a salesperson. But when they’re on the blog, they might see a popup to subscribe. These simple changes can help you capture more leads and use the context from their activity to deliver an offer they won’t resist.</p> \n<h3>3. LinkedIn Company Page Sidebar Ad</h3> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/context-marketing-example-linkedin.jpeg?width=650&amp;name=context-marketing-example-linkedin.jpeg\" alt=\"context marketing example: linkedin sidebar ad on company page\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>When you visit a company page on LinkedIn, it provides a little sidebar ad that prompts you to find roles at that company that match your skills.</p> \n<p>LinkedIn does this because it knows that you might be open to opportunities even if you don’t list it on your profile. And if you’re looking at a company page, you might be interested in working at that firm. LinkedIn uses this context to deliver a relevant ad that you can’t help but click on.</p> \n<p>Another reason this is such a great example is that it also lists a job title that relates to yours. So if you’re a financial advisor and are looking at JP Morgan Chase’s company page, LinkedIn will automatically advertise financial advisor roles at the firm.</p> \n<h2>Context Marketing is the Next Evolution of Content Marketing</h2> \n<p>Without context, you risk reaching the wrong people at the wrong time.

The same logic applies to business. If you want to build a thriving company that can pull ahead of the competition, you need to prepare yourself for battle before you break into a market.</p>  \n<p>Business plans guide you along the rocky journey of growing a company. Referencing one throughout your voyage will keep you on the path toward success. And if your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-business-plan\">business plan</a> is compelling enough, it can also convince investors to give you funding.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=e9d2eacb-6b01-423a-bf7a-19d42ba77eaa&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"→ Download Now: Free Business Plan Template\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/e9d2eacb-6b01-423a-bf7a-19d42ba77eaa.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<p>But how do you actually write a viable and convincing business plan? Below, let's review the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/business-plan-template\">format of a business plan</a> and sample business plans you can use to inspire your own.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h2>Business Plan Format</h2> \n<p>Before you get started on your business plan, you might be wondering, <em>\"Where do I start? How should I format this?\"</em></p> \n<p>Typically, a business plan is a document that will detail how a company will achieve its goals.</p> \n<p>Most business plans include the following sections:</p> \n<h3>Executive Summary</h3> \n<p>The executive summary is arguably the most important section in the entire business plan. Essentially, it's the overview or introduction, written in a way to grab readers' attention and guide them through the rest of the business plan (which may be dozens or hundreds of pages long).</p> \n<p>Most executive summaries include:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Mission statement</li> \n <li>Company history and leadership</li> \n <li>Competitive advantage overview</li> \n <li>Financial projections</li> \n <li>Company goals</li> \n</ul> \n<p>However, many of these topics will be covered in more detail later on in the business plan, so keep the executive summary clear and brief, including only the most important take-aways.</p> \n<p>Here's an example:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/business-templates/executive-summary\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Imported%20sitepage%20images/Executive%20Summary.png?width=600&amp;name=Executive%20Summary.png\" alt=\"Executive Summary Example\" width=\"600\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></a></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/business-templates/executive-summary\">Download this template for free</a></p> \n<p>Check out our tips for <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/executive-summary-examples\">writing an effective executive summary</a> for more guidance.</p> \n<h3>Market Opportunity</h3> \n<p>This is where you'll detail the opportunity in the market. Where is the gap in the current industry and how will your product fill that gap?</p> \n<p>In this section, you might include:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>The size of the market</li> \n <li>Current or potential market share</li> \n <li>Trends in the industry and consumer behavior</li> \n <li>Where the gap is, what has caused the gap, and how you intend to fill it</li> \n</ul> \n<p>To get a thorough understanding of the market opportunity, you'll want to conduct a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/tam-sam-som\">TAM, SAM, and SOM analysis</a> and perform <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/market-research-buyers-journey-guide\">market research</a> on your industry. You may also benefit from creating a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/swot-analysis\">SWOT analysis</a> to identify some of the insights for this section.</p> \n<h3>Competitive Landscape</h3> \n<p>Speaking of market share, you'll need to create a section that shares details on who the top competitors are. After all, your customers likely have more than one provider to choose from, and you'll want to understand exactly why they might choose one over another. Performing a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/competitive-analysis-kit\">competitive analysis</a> can help you uncover:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Industry trends that other providers may not be taking advantage of yet</li> \n <li>Strengths in your competition that may be obstacles to handle</li> \n <li>Weaknesses in your competition that may help you develop selling points</li> \n <li>What <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/unique-selling-proposition\">unique proposition</a> you bring to the market that may resonate with customers</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Target Audience</h3> \n<p>This section will describe who your customer segments are in detail. What is the demographic and psychographic information of your audience?</p> \n<p>If your immediate answer is \"everyone,\" you'll need to dig deeper. Ask yourself:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>What are the demographics of the people most likely to need/buy your product or service?</li> \n <li>What are the psychographics of this audience? (Desires, triggering events, etc.)</li> \n <li>Why are your offerings valuable to them?</li> \n</ul> \n<p>It can be helpful to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/buyer-persona-research\">build a buyer persona</a> to get in the mindset of your ideal customers and get crystal clear on why you're targeting them.</p> \n<h3>Marketing Strategy</h3> \n<p>Here, you'll discuss how you'll acquire new customers with your marketing strategy. You might consider including information on:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>The brand positioning vision and how you'll cultivate it</li> \n <li>The goal targets you aim to achieve</li> \n <li>The metrics you'll use to measure success</li> \n <li>The channels and distribution tactics you'll use</li> \n</ul> \n<p>It can help to already have a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-plan-examples\">marketing plan</a> built out to help you inform this component of your business plan.</p> \n<h3>Key Features and Benefits</h3> \n<p>At some point in your business plan, you'll review the key features and benefits of your products and/or services. Laying these out can give readers an idea of how you're positioning yourself in the market and the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/features-vs-benefits-messaging-ht\">messaging you're likely to use</a>. It can even help them gain better insight into your business model.</p> \n<h3>Pricing and Revenue</h3> \n<p>This is where you'll discuss your cost structure and various revenue streams. Your pricing strategy must be solid enough to turn a profit while staying competitive in the industry. For this reason, you might outline:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>The specific pricing breakdowns per product or service</li> \n <li>Why your pricing is higher or lower than your competition's</li> \n <li>(If higher) Why customers would be willing to pay more</li> \n <li>(If lower) How you're able to offer your products or services at a lower cost</li> \n <li>When you expect to break even, what margins you expect, etc.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Financials</h3> \n<p>This section is particularly informative for investors and leadership teams to determine funding strategies, investment opportunities, etc. According to <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2019/10/07/basics-of-a-business-plan-financials-section/\">Forbes</a>, you'll want to include three main things:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Profit/Loss Statement</strong> - This answers the question of whether your business is currently profitable.</li> \n <li><strong>Cash Flow Statement</strong> - This details exactly how much cash is incoming and outgoing to provide insight into how much cash a business has on hand.</li> \n <li><strong>Balance Sheet</strong> - This outlines assets, liabilities, and equity, which gives insight into how much a business is worth.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>While some business plans might include more or less information, these are the key details you'll want to include.</p> \n<p>Keep in mind, that each of these sections will be formatted differently. Some may be in paragraph format, while others will be in charts.</p> \n<h2>Sample Business Plan Templates</h2> \n<p>Now that you know what's included and how to format a business plan, let's review some templates.</p> \n<h3>1. <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/business-templates/one-page-business-plan\">HubSpot's One-Page Business Plan</a></h3> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/business-plan-template\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/One-Page%20Business%20Plan%20Template.jpg?width=450&amp;name=One-Page%20Business%20Plan%20Template.jpg\" alt=\"sample business plan: HubSpot 1 page template\" width=\"450\" style=\"margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"></a><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/business-plan-template\"><em>Download a free, editable one-page business plan template.</em></a></p> \n<p>The business plan linked above was created here at HubSpot, and is perfect for businesses of any size -- no matter how much strategy they still have to develop.</p> \n<p>Including fields such as Company Description, Required Funding, and Implementation Timeline, this one-page business plangives businesses a framework for how to build their brand and what tasks to keep track of as they grow.

This eliminates the task of having to pull reports together manually, saving teams time and helping automate workflows.</p> \n<p>When it came to including marketing strategy into their business plan, LiveFlow created a separate marketing profit and loss statement (P&amp;L) to track how well the company was doing with its marketing initiatives. This is a great approach as it allows businesses to focus on where their marketing dollars are making the most impact.</p> \n<p>“Using this framework over a traditional marketing plan will help you set a profitable marketing strategy taking things like CAC, LTV, Payback period, and P&amp;L into consideration, “ explains LiveFlow Co-founder Lasse Kalkar</p> \n<p>Having this information handy will enable you to build out your business plan’s marketing section with confidence.

That’s why we’ve compiled this guide — to provide a clear, concise approach to your next marketing campaign.</p> \n<p>Keep reading to get started or use the links below to jump ahead.</p> \n<p></p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Marketing Campaigns vs. Advertising Campaigns</h3> \n<p>Marketing is how a company raises awareness of its brand and convinces customers to make a purchase, while<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/advertising\"> advertising</a> is the process of creating persuasive messages around these broad goals.</p> \n<p>In terms of campaigns, an <a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/courses/digital-advertising?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=digital-advertising-certification&amp;_ga=2.202528273.1297659820.1636758994-1495700724.1636758994\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\">advertising campaign</a> might be one facet of a larger marketing campaign strategy.</p> \n<p>Say shoe brand Nike launched a campaign surrounding the release of a new product. Its advertising would only reflect one facet of its marketing strategy.</p> \n<p>The brand might also leverage email newsletters, social media, and paid search to meet its goal.</p> \n<p>Now that we understand the difference between advertising and marketing campaigns, here's a list of a few more types of marketing campaigns you might run.</p> \n<a></a> \n<p></p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>Marketing Campaign Components</h2> \n<p><span style=\"color: #425b76;\">Multiple components go into the planning, execution, and results of a stellar marketing campai<span style=\"color: #425b76;\">gn.</span></span></p> \n<ul> \n <li style=\"color: #000000;\"> <p><span style=\"color: #425b76;\"><strong>Goals and key progress indicators (KPIs):</strong> This component defines the end goal of your campaign, quantifies it in specific and measurable goals, and states which metrics will be used to track progress. For example, your content creation campaign might be measured by organic traffic, with each post aiming to drive 1,000 views per month and 10 new contacts, with metrics being measured in <a href=\"https://analytics.google.com/\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\">Google Analytics</a> <span style=\"color: #425b76;\">and <a href=\"https://looker.com/\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\">Looker</a>.</span></span></p> </li> \n <li> <p><span style=\"color: #425b76;\"><strong>Channels:</strong> Where will your content and messaging be distributed? For example, if you’re running a social media marketing campaign, you might specifically prioritize growing the channels most relevant to your audience and omit those where you’re least likely to grow a loyal following.</span></p> </li> \n <li> <p><span style=\"color: #425b76;\"><strong>Budget:</strong> Not all marketing campaigns require an incremental budget, but many still do. Factor in the agency, advertising, and freelance costs, if appropriate, and factor these numbers into any ROI analysis for your campaign.</span></p> </li> \n <li> <p><span style=\"color: #425b76;\"><strong>Content Format(s):</strong> Determine what kind of content you will be creating to fuel the campaign. It’s common for marketers to include multiple content formats in a singular campaign. For example, a branding campaign could include video ads, press releases, and guest blogs.</span></p> </li> \n <li> <p><span style=\"color: #425b76;\"><strong>Team:</strong> Who are the individuals you’re relying on to get the job done? Before kickstarting your campaign, make sure you designate people to work on every aspect of the campaign, from copywriting and design to media buying and reporting.</span></p> </li> \n <li> <p><span style=\"color: #425b76;\"><strong>Creative Assets:</strong> A great marketing campaign should have great creative assets to match. Whether it’s a sleek website design, a video commercial, or an interactive infographic, make sure your design is professional and fitting for the purpose of the campaign.</span></p> </li> \n</ul> \n<p></p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>How to Create a Successful Marketing Campaign</h2> \n<p>Creating an entire campaign is a big task, but the process is pretty straightforward.</p> \n<p>Before you create what your audience will see, you must consider your end goal and the action you want them to take</p> \n<p>I’ve organized this section as a marketing campaign template. All you need to do is answer the questions — as accurately and in-depth as possible — to ensure a thorough, successful approach to your next marketing campaign.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Planning Your Marketing Campaign</h3> \n<p>This step is crucial to the effectiveness of your marketing campaign. The planning stage will determine how you measure success and will guide your team when things go awry.</p> \n<p><strong>Featured Resource: </strong><span style=\"color: #33475b;\"></span><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-plan-template-generator?hubs_post-cta=inline-text\">Free Marketing Plan Generator</a></p> \n<a></a> \n<h4>1. Set a purpose and goal for your campaign.</h4> \n<p>Let’s start simple. Why are you running this campaign? What would you like your campaign to accomplish for your business?</p> \n<a></a> \n<p>If you’re having trouble defining your campaign purpose, start broad. Take a look at the goals below. Which one is most aligned with your own?</p> \n<ul> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Promote a new product or service</li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Increase <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/brand-awareness?_ga=2.29459327.15258776.1540221058-1384912595.1528309621\">brand awareness</a></li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gather customer feedback or content</li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drive leads</li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Generate revenue</li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Boost user engagement</li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Advertise an upcoming event</li> \n</ul> \n<p>This is hardly a definitive list, but it gives you an idea of general business goals that a campaign could help reach.</p> \n<p>Let's take this broad campaign purpose and turn it into a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/smart-goal-examples?_ga=2.29459327.15258776.1540221058-1384912595.1528309621\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\">S.M.A.R.T. goal</a>. We'll use the third option as an example: Gather customer feedback or content.</p> \n<p>\"<em>The goal of my marketing campaign is to gather user-generated content from 100 customers via a branded hashtag on Instagram featuring our new product line by December 31.</em>\"</p> \n<p style=\"font-weight: normal;\">The goal is specific (user-generated content), measurable (100 customers), attainable (via a branded Instagram hashtag), relevant (featuring the new product line), and timely (by December 31).</p> \n<p>See how this broad campaign purpose instantly transforms into an actionable, attainable goal?</p> \n<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Setting SMART Goals is simple when you have the right tools. Check out the free SMART Goal-Setting template below to get started on this critical piece of your marketing campaign.</p> \n<p><strong>Featured Resource: </strong><span style=\"color: #33475b;\"></span><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/how-to-determine-your-smart-marketing-goals?hubs_post-cta=inline-text\">Free SMART Goal-Setting Template</a></p> \n<h4>2. Establish how you’ll measure your campaign.</h4> \n<p>This will look different for everyone depending on the channels you're leveraging and your end goal. You might measure email open rates, new Facebook Page likes, product pre-orders, or a combination.</p> \n<p>These answers will depend on your overarching campaign goal. Here are a few examples of metrics based on the campaign goals I mentioned above.</p> \n<ul> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>For promoting a new product or service:</strong> Pre-orders, sales, upsells</li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>For increasing brand awareness:</strong> Sentiment, social mentions, press mentions</li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>For gathering customer feedback or content:</strong> Social mentions, engagement</li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>For generating revenue:</strong> Leads, sales, upsells</li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>For boosting user engagement:</strong> Blog shares, social shares, email interactions</li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>For advertising an upcoming event:</strong> Ticket sales, vendor or entertainment bookings, social mentions</li> \n</ul> \n<p>If your campaign involves multiple marketing channels, it’s wise to define how you’ll measure your campaign on each medium.</p> \n<p>For example, say I was running my user-generated content (UGC) campaign on social media, email, and on our blog. First, I’d define my key performance indicators (KPIs) for each medium, which may look like:</p> \n<ul> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instagram engagements (likes and comments) and profile tags</li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Email open rates and click-through rates</li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blog views, click-throughs, and social shares</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Then, I’d define my primary campaign KPI: Instagram branded hashtag mentions.</p> \n<p>While the above KPIs indicate how well my campaign is reaching and engaging my audience, my primary KPI tells me how close I am to reaching my SMART goal.</p> \n<p>Lastly, let’s think about another question: What does \"success\" look like for your company? Sure, it’s exciting to reach a predetermined goal, but that’s not always possible. What (outside of your goal) would constitute success for you (or serve as a milestone)?</p> \n<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> When determining how you’ll measure your campaign, consider setting up some checkpoints along the way. If your campaign involves boosting brand awareness and your goal is to reach 50 PR mentions by the end of the year, set up some benchmark notifications at 10, 25, and 40 mentions.</p> \n<p>Not only will it remind you to keep pushing toward your ultimate goal, but it’ll boost morale within your team and remind you that your hard work is paying off.</p> \n<h4>3. Define your target audience.</h4> \n<p>Imagine constructing a bulletproof marketing campaign only to be met with crickets.</p> \n<p>In that case, you might think you chose the wrong marketing medium or that your creative wasn’t witty enough. However, the culprit may be your audience.</p> \n<p>The first step to resolving this problem is figuring out what stage of the buyer’s journey your campaign is targeting. Are you trying to bring in new customers, or attempting to gather feedback from existing clients?</p> \n<p>Marketing your brand to those who recognize it, or are you introducing a new brand identity altogether?</p> \n<p>Your marketing message will vary depending on whether your campaign audience is in the awareness, consideration, or decision stage. Even though your campaign may reach those outside of your target audience, it's vital that you design your campaign with a specific target in min you know who it's meant for.</p> \n<p>Next, identify your audience's interests and pain points. Here are <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/buyer-persona-questions?_ga=2.194075949.1297659820.1636758994-1495700724.1636758994\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\">some questions</a> to ask yourself and your team to better understand your audience.</p> \n<ul> \n <li>What are my audience’s general interests? What magazines do they read? What TV shows do they watch? How do they spend their free time?</li> \n <li>Where does my audience hang out online? For what purpose do they use Instagram, Facebook, and other networks? Do they engage or merely browse?</li> \n <li>What kind of content gets my audience’s attention? Do they respond to straightforward sales messages, or would they rather consume witty, humorous content? What cultural references would they understand?</li> \n <li>What kind of problems do they have that my product, service, or brand could solve?</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Becoming well-acquainted with your campaign audience will help you confidently answer these questions and any others that may arise during the campaign.</p> \n<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> To uncover more about your target audience, survey your existing customers as well as potential customers in your market. Then, use this data to create your buyer personas — you can even enter that data into a free buyer persona generator like the one below.</p> \n<p><strong>Featured Resource: </strong><span style=\"color: #33475b;\"></span><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/make-my-persona?hubs_post-cta=inline-text\">Buyer Persona Generator</a></p> \n<h4>4. Set a concept for your campaign and get in contact with the right team.</h4> \n<p>Marketing campaigns require a mission, vision, and visual identity. Great campaigns are an offshoot of their parent brand, both visually and creatively — they stay consistent with the business brand but maintain their own identity.</p> \n<p>When creating their campaign assets, some businesses use an in-house team while others opt for an agency. Another alternative is hiring a freelancer or contractor to complete a specific portion of the project, such as the copy or design.</p> \n<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Depending on your specific campaign goals, I’d recommend starting with your in-house team and moving forward from there. They are the experts of your business and can speak to what your campaign needs to succeed.</p> \n<p>This step will likely take the longest since you’ll be creating your campaign concept from scratch. Next, we’ll dive into how you’ll distribute your campaign assets and connect with your audience.</p> \n<p><strong>Featured Resource: </strong><span style=\"color: #33475b;\"></span><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/market-research-kit?hubs_post-cta=inline-text\">Market Research Kit</a></p> \n<h3>Distributing Your Marketing Campaign</h3> \n<p>This stage is all about the public-facing part of your campaign, including what your audience will see and when. If you’ve combed through the previous section, you should have all the answers you need to guide you through this step.</p> \n<h4>5. Choose the channels on which you’ll run your campaign.</h4> \n<p>This choice depends on your audience preference, budget, and brand engagement levels, among other factors.</p> \n<p>Take a look at the current media channels you use to promote your company. Which ones perform the best? Which ones allow you to pay for advertisements? Which ones have the best engagement? Most importantly, where are your customers hanging out?</p> \n<p>Need a few ideas? Take a look at the <a href=\"https://shonaliburke.com/peso-model-content-distribution-super-strategy/\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\">PESO</a> model, which breaks up distribution channels into Paid, Earned, Shared, and Owned.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/marketing-campaigns-1.png?width=1500&amp;name=marketing-campaigns-1.png\" alt=\"marketing campaigns: choosing your channel using the PESO marketing model\" width=\"1500\" style=\"width: 1500px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"><a href=\"https://www.ceralytics.com/content-marketing-campaigns/#actions\"></a></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.ceralytics.com/content-marketing-campaigns/#actions\" style=\"font-style: normal;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<h4>6. Set a timeline for your campaign.</h4> \n<p>Establishing a deadline for your campaign gives you a much better idea of when, how, and how often you’ll promote it. Here's how to do this:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Build a general campaign timeline, then mark your campaign start date and deadline on a calendar.</li> \n <li>Take a look at your marketing assets and chosen promotional marketing channels and work backward from the campaign launch date. Based on your resources, how often can you afford to post and promote your campaign content? With this information, create a promotional calendar for each marketing channel.</li> \n <li>Decide on a cadence for each channel and map out your scheduled posts, emails, etc. on your calendar.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Visually mapping your marketing campaign will help you evenly disperse your campaign promotions and publish equally on each medium. It’ll also give you an idea of where your time and energy are going so that you can look back when assessing the effectiveness of your campaign.</p> \n<p><strong>Pro Tip: </strong>If your promotional calendar seems full, don’t fret. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/social-media-calendar-tools?_ga=2.194075949.1297659820.1636758994-1495700724.1636758994\" style=\"color: #0091ae;\">Social media</a> and email scheduling tools can alleviate the pressure of posting daily.

Ensure your campaign is driving users toward a desired action.</h4> \n<p>Even if your campaign is effective and drives a ton of traffic, it still needs to complete its desired action. By \"the desired action,\" I’m talking about that SMART goal you initially defined. Let’s take a moment and reiterate that goal.</p> \n<p>For my sample campaign, my SMART goal was \"to gather user-generated content from 100 customers via a branded hashtag on Instagram featuring our new product line by December 31.\"</p> \n<p>This step is all about calibrating your marketing efforts and channels to lead your customers to complete your desired goal. This is done through conversion assets like calls-to-action, landing pages, and lead forms.</p> \n<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Lead conversion assets can be used separately or in conjunction with one another, such as featuring a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/lead-generation-forms?_ga=2.194075949.1297659820.1636758994-1495700724.1636758994\">lead form</a> on a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/landing-page-examples-list?_ga=2.180709921.744970675.1636760229-1821932007.1636760229\">landing page</a>, or creating a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/call-to-action-examples?_ga=2.180709921.744970675.1636760229-1821932007.1636760229\">call-to-action</a> asking your audience to fill out a form.</p> \n<h4>8. Monitor the right metrics.</h4> \n<p>The campaign effectiveness metrics you’ll monitor will depend on what type of marketing campaign you’re running and what channels you’ve chosen. This section merely serves as a baseline list to give you an idea of what to watch.</p> \n<p>Also, it’s tempting to focus on vanity metrics like generated traffic, click-through rate, and impressions. A bump in these areas is definitely a good thing, but since they don’t necessarily indicate a bump in revenue, they can’t be the only metrics used to measure the effectiveness of your campaign.</p> \n<p><strong>Pro Tip: </strong>Bookmark this link to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/essential-marketing-metrics?_ga=2.180709921.744970675.1636760229-1821932007.1636760229\">all the marketing metrics to watch</a>. It's organized by marketing channel so you can quickly scan the list for new metrics to track for your campaigns.</p> \n<h3>Assessing Your Marketing Campaign</h3> \n<p>The post-campaign stage determines your success just as much as the planning stage. Measuring and analyzing your campaign data can provide unique insight into your audience, marketing channels, and budget. It will also inform future campaigns.</p> \n<h4>9. Establish success numbers and metrics.</h4> \n<p>The easy way to figure this out is to understand whether or not your campaign met the initial SMART goal outlined in step one. If it did, great! If it didn’t, you can dive into the data to assess why.</p> \n<p>For example, if your goal was to increase organic blog views by 100K, any bump in views would be considered successful. But there’s a difference between a campaign that works and a campaign that’s worthwhile.</p> \n<p>A worthwhile campaign gives you an ROI that’s proportionate to the time and energy you put into it.</p> \n<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> While it’s OK to celebrate any bump in pre-orders, leads, views, or engagements, don’t assume that’s enough. There’s a reason the very first thing to do is set a campaign goal. Sticking to that goal and calibrating your investment will ensure your campaign is worthwhile.</p> \n<h4>10. What will you do with the campaign data?</h4> \n<p>This step helps maximize your campaign’s business impact.</p> \n<p>When you analyze and apply your data, its value increases tenfold — not only did it help you measure and assess your campaign results, but it’ll also give you direction and clarity on your audience, marketing methods, creative prowess, and more.</p> \n<p>Let’s return to my UGC Instagram campaign.</p> \n<p>In addition to meeting my goal of 100 posts with UGC, the data I collect in the process also offers insights into who my audience is, when and how often they post on Instagram, what language they use, and how they use my product.</p> \n<p>Whether you collect lead information, pre-orders, social engagements, or offer downloads, your data can equip you to not only meet your campaign goal but also expand your marketing efforts as a whole.</p> \n<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> The campaign isn't over once you've pulled that final report. Spend time with your team in a retrospective meeting. Ask yourselves questions like:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>What could’ve been done differently?</li> \n <li>How could we have saved money?</li> \n <li>For anything that went wrong, why do we think it went wrong?</li> \n <li>What did we learn about our audience or marketing channels?</li> \n <li>What kind of feedback could we gather from participants or customers?</li> \n</ul> \n<h2>Great Marketing Campaign Examples (and Why They’re So Great)</h2> \n<p>This wouldn’t be a HubSpot Ultimate Guide if we didn’t share some examples from the pros.</p> \n<h3>1. <a href=\"http://www.thelipbar.com\">The Lip Bar</a>'s \"Something BAWSE is coming\"</h3> \n<p>In 2022, The Lip Bar celebrated its 10-year anniversary. It also release a new product called \"The Bawse Bundle.\"</p> \n<p>In early February, the brand launched a multi-channel campaign, from website and social media to billboards.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/marketing-campaign-example.jpg?width=600&amp;name=marketing-campaign-example.jpg\" alt=\"marketing campaign example: homepage of the lip bar website\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"http://thelipbar.com\">Image Source</a><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"></span></span></p> \n<p>The campaign is built around a story of resilience and perseverance, focusing on the CEO's negative experience on the show Shark Tank.</p> \n<h4>Why The Lip Bar's \"Something BAWSE is coming\" campaign is so great:</h4> \n<p>It accomplishes multiple things through a single campaign: It gives the audience a peek into the brand's journey. It builds on that journey and beautifully connects it to a product.</p> \n<p>So, not only can current customers share in this excitement because of the 10-year anniversary, new customers will be drawn in by the personal story shared by the CEO.</p> \n<h3>2. <a href=\"https://about.facebook.com/meta\">Meta (Formerly Facebook)</a>: \"The Metaverse\"</h3> \n<p>In Q4 2021, Facebook announced the <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/facebook-company-is-now-meta/\">rebranding of its parent company</a>. The new name, Meta, comes with its own <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CVlR5GFqF68/\">marketing campaign</a> that introduces the world to a new concept called the \"metaverse.\"</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/marketing%20campaign%20example%20by%20meta.jpg?width=500&amp;name=marketing%20campaign%20example%20by%20meta.jpg\" alt=\"marketing campaign example by meta\" width=\"500\" style=\"width: 500px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tv/CVlhWMxheDk/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link\" style=\"font-style: normal;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>The campaign is still in its infancy stages, but it has taken over social media networks, including the Facebook app itself.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tv/CVlhWMxheDk/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link\">video</a> posted to the new <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/meta/\">@meta</a> Instagram account showcases an alternate reality in which people can interact in 3D.</p> \n<h4>Why Meta's \"The Metaverse\" campaign is so great:</h4> \n<p>Reception of the campaign is still developing, but so far, it's successfully stopped the world in its tracks — and that's a recipe for success with just about any marketing campaign.</p> \n<p>The idea of a Facebook rebrand had been <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/facebook-reportedly-changing-name-042958266.html\">speculated</a> prior to the launch of the campaign which piqued the public's interest. That meant even if they didn't like the change, they would still be interested in seeing what happens next.</p> \n<h3>3. <a href=\"https://www.popeyes.com/\">Popeyes</a>: \"Megan Thee Stallion Hottie Sauce\"</h3> \n<p>If Popeye's wasn't sure that it hit the ball out of the park with the chicken sandwich marketing campaign, then it nailed it for sure with the Megan Thee Stallion Hottie Sauce collaboration.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/marketing%20campaign%20from%20popeyes.jpg?width=500&amp;name=marketing%20campaign%20from%20popeyes.jpg\" alt=\"marketing campaign from popeyes\" width=\"500\" style=\"width: 500px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.popeyes.com/menu/section-5fe7b12e-c23f-430a-a7ce-84dd9265d3e2\" style=\"font-style: normal;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Arguably, Popeyes created one of the best chicken sandwiches on the fast-food market in 2019. At the same time, artist Megan Thee Stallion was becoming the hottest rapper in the industry.</p> \n<p>So, it made sense that in 2021, the two would join forces to debut a remix of the successful chicken sandwich.</p> \n<h4>Why Popeyes' \"Megan Thee Stallion Hottie Sauce\" campaign is so great:</h4> \n<p>This marketing campaign was intentional about targeting the younger crowd with not just chicken sandwiches, but <a href=\"https://theehottiesauce.com/\">merchandise</a>, too.</p> \n<p>Popeyes was able to tap into this segment of the market and increase sales while continuing to capitalize on its success without the campaign coming across as stale.</p> \n<h3>4. <a href=\"https://www.cheerios.com/\">Cheerios</a>: #GoodGoesRound</h3> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/marketing%20campaign%20example%20from%20cheerios.jpg?width=500&amp;name=marketing%20campaign%20example%20from%20cheerios.jpg\" alt=\"marketing campaign example from cheerios\" width=\"500\" style=\"width: 500px;

[Examples + Best Practices]","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/employee-referral-program","description":"<p>Finding qualified candidates to fill your open positions can be challenging. Job posting sites claim to make the process easy by connecting you with hundreds if not thousands of potential employees. But having such a large pool of candidates can be overwhelming.</p>  \n<p>Just thinking about the sheer volume of work involved in reviewing applications, narrowing them down to good fits, and then vetting those potential candidates is enough to make anyone’s head explode.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=3f403048-fd8e-426f-bddd-4fce020ae24b&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Download Now: Free Company Culture Code Template&nbsp;\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/3f403048-fd8e-426f-bddd-4fce020ae24b.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<p>You work with or run a solid organization with wonderful employees. How do you make sure that you don’t get a bevy of potential candidates, but rather the <em>right</em> candidate?</p> \n<p>Look at this like finding the perfect place to take your significant other on a special occasion. Sure, you could do a Google search for random restaurants in your neighborhood. You could even check a review site for recommendations.</p> \n<p>However, you don’t know any of those people, so how much weight does their opinion really carry? Instead of taking a risk on a very special evening, why not reach out to the people you trust? Asking friends and family for a recommendation is a much safer avenue to finding the perfect date night experience.</p> \n<p>What if we applied this type of thinking to your search for the perfect employee? Rather than leave it up to a random internet search, ask the people you already know, like, and trust… your employees.</p> \n<h2>What is an employee referral program?</h2> \n<p>An employee referral program is a structured system by which you ask existing employees to recommend people they know for open positions within your organization. Employees often receive some sort of incentive for their assistance.</p> \n<p>An employee referral program leverages the power of your employees’ networks and can save you time, money, and a huge headache when it comes to hiring the best talent for your business.</p> \n<h2>Benefits of an Employee Referral Program</h2> \n<p>There are many benefits to utilizing an employee referral program as part of your hiring strategy. These include:</p> \n<h3>1. High Quality Hires</h3> \n<p>Good employees know what skills are necessary to excel in a position and understand the workplace culture. When they recommend someone for the job, there’s a good chance they have the qualifications necessary to successfully perform in the role.</p> \n<h3>2. Decreased Turnover Rates</h3> \n<p>With employee turnover rates <a href=\"https://www.zippia.com/advice/employee-turnover-statistics/\"><span>on the rise</span></a>, you’ll want to keep it front of mind when you’re making hiring decisions. According to <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/employee-referral-statistics-you-need-know-2020-mike-stafiej/?articleId=6622562177335336961\"><span>ERIN</span></a>, 45% of referred employees stay with a company longer compared to 22% from job boards and 33% from career sites.</p> \n<h3>3. Less Time and Lower Cost Per Hire</h3> \n<p>According to <a href=\"https://business.linkedin.com/content/dam/me/business/en-us/talent-solutions/resources/pdfs/new_employee_referral_programs_FINAL.pdf\"><span>LinkedIn</span></a>, employees hired through referrals take an average of 29 days to hire and onboard, whereas job boards can take 39 days and a career site can take upwards of 55 days. The less time it takes to hire and onboard means less revenue lost, fewer employees stressed because they are handling multiple jobs, and more productivity from your new hire.</p> \n<p>Using a headhunter? According to <a href=\"https://www.jobvite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Jobvite-RecruiterNation-Report-Final.pdf\"><span>Jobvite</span></a>, you can expect to pay between 15% and 25% of the gross annual salary of the candidate. If you’re hiring an employee at $100k per year, that’s $15k to $25k in headhunting fees. The cost to reward an employee for an amazing referral? Around $2,000.</p> \n<h3>4. Increase Employee Satisfaction and Loyalty</h3> \n<p>Doesn’t it feel nice when you have a hand in the decision-making process? Employees that refer candidates feel like they’ve contributed to the company, making them more engaged and more likely to stay.</p> \n<h2>Employee Referral Program Ideas</h2> \n<p>Now that you see the benefit to you as the employer or hiring manager, how do you create an employee referral program that encourages your existing employees to introduce you to their quality contacts? There are a number of ways to do this and best practices that you can adopt to get the most out of your program.</p> \n<h3>Make it Clear What You’re Looking For</h3> \n<p>In a mid-sized to a large company, one department may have no idea what another one is working on. In order for employees to make connections, they need to know what your expectations are for the new position. When you reach out to employees looking for suggestions, provide them with all the details you can. This should include:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-job-descriptions\"><span>Job descriptions</span></a></li> \n <li>Desired experience</li> \n <li>Necessary skills</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Make it Easy for Employees to Refer</h3> \n<p>Consider the referral experience from your employees’ point of view. Is there a simple form for them to submit when they recommend someone, or do they have to jump through a variety of complicated hoops to pass along their referrals? Some companies even host recruitment happy hours where existing employees can invite friends who might be a good fit.</p> \n<p>The easier you make it for your employees to refer their contacts, the more quality candidates will be presented to you.</p> \n<h3>Keep Your Employees Updated on Referral Status</h3> \n<p>It’s frustrating to make a suggestion or an introduction and not know if it’s been acted upon. When your employee recommends a colleague, keep them updated as to the steps of the hiring process. Some times to check-in include:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>When you receive an application</li> \n <li>When you make contact</li> \n <li>When an interview is scheduled</li> \n <li>When a position has been offered to their contact</li> \n <li>When the position has been given to someone else (after the candidate has been contacted)</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Provide a Juicy Incentive</h3> \n<p>Surprisingly, this may not always be a monetary reward. While money is always appreciated, you can offer a combination of \"cash\" and experiences, time off, gifts, etc. For some, these may be even more desired than a financial incentive. One great option is to give your employees the choice. That way, you know they’ll be motivated to help. A few employee referral incentive ideas to get your creative juices flowing:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Cash bonuses</li> \n <li>Gift certificates to their favorite restaurants and local establishments</li> \n <li>Weekend getaways or week-long excursions for frequent referrers</li> \n <li>VIP parking</li> \n <li>Show tickets</li> \n <li>Physical gifts (it’s important to let them choose so they don’t end up with something they can’t use)</li> \n <li>Perks like a gym membership or massage</li> \n</ul> \n<p>The sky's the limit when it comes to thanking your employees for their referrals. You can also consider using a platform like <a href=\"https://www.xoxoday.com/\">XoxoDay</a> to make distributing employee referral perks as easy and streamlined as possible.</p> \n<h3>Show Appreciation for \"Frequent Referrers\"</h3> \n<p>If you’ve got employees that consistently send you quality employee candidates, acknowledge them publicly. This shows your amazing team members that they are appreciated and motivates other employees to step up their referral game.</p> \n<h2>Employee Referral Program Examples</h2> \n<p>Looking for real-world examples of these programs in action? We’ve compiled a few employee referral program samples to introduce you to some of the possibilities.</p> \n<ol> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.inmobi.com/\"><span>Inmobi</span></a>, a mobile advertising company offers referring employees the choice of a bike or a trip to Bali. They park the vehicles in front of the company headquarters to motivate employees to participate.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.accenture.com/us-en\"><span>Accenture</span></a>, a consulting and IT company encourages philanthropy and community involvement by letting their employees donate a part of their referral bonus to a charity of their choice.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://distillery.com/\"><span>Distillery</span></a>, an American software development company gifts their employees new tech gadgets for every referral they make.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/\"><span>Atlassian</span></a> software company encourages employees to \"Refer-a-Mate\" and offers them $2,000 in cash bonuses.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html\"><span>Intel</span></a> tech company takes financial incentives one step further by doubling their employee referral reward for women, minorities, and veterans that are referred to the company.</li> \n</ol> \n<p>If you’d like to tap into a pool of qualified, trustworthy, easy-to-hire (and onboard) candidates, an employee referral program can help. Instituting this type of hiring process in your organization can save you money, time, headaches, and the pain of having to repeatedly hire for the same position when your first employee doesn’t work out well. In addition, you’ll improve your workplace culture and enhance your brand.</p> \n<p>An employee referral program is the best thing you can do to improve the quality of your incoming employees. Choose your incentives wisely and then watch the quality candidates roll on in.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=4bbcf7f8-3c11-4d5b-b284-c5f6a9d419c9&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"company culture template\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/4bbcf7f8-3c11-4d5b-b284-c5f6a9d419c9.png\"></a></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Femployee-referral-program&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 09 Mar 2022 12:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/3f403048-fd8e-426f-bddd-4fce020ae24b.png","linkMd5":"ad7181ffe31559a408a75af9a3fd7bc0","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn56@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-26-48-438_af47b0cd123e84fb.webp","destWidth":489,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":5237,"destBytes":7504,"author":"Sheryl Green","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/3f403048-fd8e-426f-bddd-4fce020ae24b.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn56@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-26-48-438_af47b0cd123e84fb.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/4bbcf7f8-3c11-4d5b-b284-c5f6a9d419c9.png":null,"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Femployee-referral-program&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn16@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-26-53-945_aa77a0f97e109ceb.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647246408207},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:26:48","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:26:48","title":"31 Instagram Features, Hacks, & Tips Everyone Should Know About","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-features-tricks","description":"<p>Did you know you could schedule your Instagram posts in advance?

Add and manage multiple accounts from the same device.</h4> \n<p>Have a separate account for your dog? Don't be embarrassed; stand by your puppy profile. In fact, whether it's a pet account or a business account, you can add and manage this one right alongside your personal account.</p> \n<p>Here's how:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>From your profile, tap the gear icon. To find this icon on an Android device, you'll first need to tap the three horizontal lines to the top right of your screen.</li> \n <li>Scroll to the very bottom and tap \"Add Account.\"</li> \n <li>Add your other account by username and password, and you're all set.</li> \n</ol> \n<p>To toggle between both profiles, hold down your profile picture in the navigation bar to view all connected accounts. You can also switch to a different account through the Settings page mentioned earlier. See what this screen looks like in the next Instagram feature, below.</p> \n<h4>2. See all the posts you've liked.</h4> \n<p>Ever wanted to see the posts you've Liked, all in one place? All you have to do is go to your own profile and click the \"Settings\" button in the top right — a gear icon on iPhone/iPad, and three dots on Android — then, click \"Account\", and finally \"Posts You've Liked.\"</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8584.jpg?width=450&amp;name=IMG_8584.jpg\" alt=\"someone's instagram settings to click account to find out posts you've liked\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8585.jpg?width=450&amp;name=IMG_8585.jpg\" alt=\"someone's instagram settings to click account to find out posts you've liked\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></img></p> \n<p>To un-Like any of the posts you've Liked, simply go to the post and deselect the \"heart\" icon below it. Don't worry — the user won't be notified that you've un-Liked the post.</p> \n<h4>3. Hide, delete, or disable comments on your posts.</h4> \n<p>Twitter may carry a more \"anything goes\" culture of commentary, but your Instagram is your domain — and it's much easier to control who says what on your content. This is especially important if you manage a business account.</p> \n<h5>To Filter Comments by Keyword:</h5> \n<p>In the Instagram mobile app, navigate to \"Options\" and select \"Comments.\" From here, you can toggle on \"Hide Inappropriate Comments\" and even enter specific keywords you'd like the app to police within each comment.</p> \n<h5>To Delete Comments:</h5> \n<p>Tap the speech bubble icon below the comment you'd like to delete, and swipe lightly to the left over this text. Select the garbage can icon that appears to delete this post. You can also do this to your own comments.</p> \n<h5>To Disable Comments Entirely:</h5> \n<p>To clarify, you can't turn off comments across your entire profile; you can only disable them for individual posts.</p> \n<p>To do so, start posting an image on which you'd like nobody to comment. When you reach the page to add a caption, tags, and location, tap \"Advanced Settings\" at the very bottom. This will open a screen where you can easily switch on an option labeled \"Turn Off Commenting.\"</p> \n<h4>4. Clear your Instagram search history.</h4> \n<p>We swear — this blog post isn't all about how to convince people you're not an Instagram creeper. But many of us can relate to the desire to clear our online search history everywhere, including on this particular social channel. Luckily, you can.</p> \n<p>To clear your Instagram search history, go to your own profile and click the \"Settings\" button (a gear icon on iPhone/iPad and three dots on Android).

Add another Instagram account to your bio.</h4> \n<p>Perhaps your company has more than one Instagram account for different aspects of your brand. For instance, HubSpot has a verified HubSpot account, a HubSpot Life account, a HubSpot Academy account, and a HubSpot Partners account.</p> \n<p>To draw awareness back to its main company page, then, HubSpot links to the @HubSpot account in its other account bios, like in @HubSpotLife's account:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/add%20another%20account%20to%20instagram%20bio.jpeg?width=450&amp;name=add%20another%20account%20to%20instagram%20bio.jpeg\" alt=\"add another account to instagram bio\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" /></p> \n<p>Fortunately, you have the option to include another Instagram account in your Instagram bio. To do so, simply type the \"@\" sign into your Bio, and then select the account you'd like to tag. Then, click \"Done\".</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/add-insta-account-to-bio.png?width=450&amp;name=add-insta-account-to-bio.png\" alt=\"add-insta-account-to-bio\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>Instagram Design Features&nbsp;</h3> \n<h4>6. Add special fonts to your bio.</h4> \n<p>Here's an Instagram bio hack that can truly make your profile stand out. You can already add emojis to the bio beneath your profile photo, but your keyboard limits your creativity right there.</p> \n<p>Using a couple of basic third-party websites, you can copy over some more special fonts not often found in the Instagram community. Here's how.</p> \n<h5>To Add a Special Font to Your Bio via Mobile:</h5> \n<p>Add a new font to your Instagram bio via your mobile device using a website like <a href=\"https://lingojam.com/FontsForInstagram\">LingoJam</a>. Open the site on your phone, type your desired bio text in the lefthand text box, and you'll see the same bio text in different typefaces appear on the right.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/instagram-bio-hack-new-fonts-1.png\" alt=\"how to add special font to bio with a tool like lingojam\" /></p> \n<p>Carry your chosen font over to your Instagram bio by tapping it and selecting \"Copy.\" Then, open your Instagram app, navigate to your profile, select \"Edit Profile,\" tap the \"Bio\" section and paste your chosen font into the empty field.</p> \n<h5>To Add a Special Font to Your Bio on Desktop:</h5> \n<p>If you're editing your Instagram profile on your laptop or desktop, <a href=\"http://www.fontspace.com/category/instagram\">Font Space</a> has a library of fonts you can download and copy into your bio in seconds. To do so, Find a font you like and select \"Download\" beneath the font's sample image, as shown below.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/download-font-for-instagram.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"cursive font of someone's name\" /></p> \n<p>Downloading this font will open a folder on your desktop where you can pull a \".ttf\" file that carries the various versions of this font. The file will look something like the screenshot below.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/cassandra-font-for-instagram-bio.png\" alt=\"copying special font to paste it into instagram\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" /></p> \n<p>Once you have this font copied to your computer's clipboard, open your internet browser and log onto Instagram.com. Select \"Edit Profile\" and paste your downloaded font into your bio field. You can then edit the sample text that came with your font to write your new bio as you see fit.</p> \n<h4>7. Add special characters to your bio.</h4> \n<p>Not only can you customize your bio with a special font, but you can also add atypical characters that distinguish you or your brand — but that you wouldn't find on your smartphone's normal keyboard. These include<span>&nbsp;</span><span>§,&nbsp;</span><span>†, or even&nbsp;™ if your Instagram name features a trademarked product name.</span></p> \n<h5>To Add Special Characters From Mobile</h5> \n<p>Using your mobile device, install a free mobile app like<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/character-pad/id418874651\">Character Pad</a>, which catalogs nearly every character and symbol you might need but won't find in the 26-letter English alphabet.</p> \n<p>Open the app and find the character you want to add to your Instagram bio. In Character Pad, you'll simply double-tap the picture of your chosen symbol to paste it into a text box, as shown below. Then, copy this character to your phone's clipboard. (For our purposes, I double-tapped the half moon icon.)</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/special%20characters.png?width=450&amp;name=special%20characters.png\" alt=\"special characters\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\">Once you have your symbol copied to your clipboard, open Instagram, navigate to your bio, and tap \"Edit Profile.\"<br><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/edit%20profile-1.jpeg?width=450&amp;name=edit%20profile-1.jpeg\" alt=\"edit profile-1\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\">Hold down your finger on the field of your bio you want to insert your special character until \"Paste\" appears as an option, as shown below. Tap \"Paste\" and then \"Done\" you'll be all set.</img></br></img></p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/welcome%20to%20my%20page.png?width=1125&amp;name=welcome%20to%20my%20page.png\" alt=\"welcome to my page\" width=\"1125\" style=\"width: 1125px;\" /></p> \n<h5>To Add Special Characters From a PC</h5> \n<p>You can also insert special characters and symbols through Instagram's web client on a desktop or laptop computer. The easiest way is to use Microsoft Word's \"Symbol\" insertion icon, as shown below.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/ms-word-insert-symbol.jpg?width=400&amp;name=ms-word-insert-symbol.jpg\" alt=\"ms-word-insert-symbol\" width=\"400\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" /></p> \n<p>Select your desired symbol or character and copy it to your computer's clipboard. Then, navigate to Instagram.com and follow the steps above to paste your character into a particular part of your bio.</p> \n<p>You might be tempted to simply Google search the special character you want, and at times it might work just as well as the steps above. But keep in mind not all special characters you copy from the internet are \"clean\" when you paste them into Instagram — some of them might become corrupted or not show up correctly.</p> \n<h4>8. Reorder filters to set your favorite filters at the front.</h4> \n<p>If you use Instagram a lot, chances are, you have a few favorite go-to filters, and others you never touch. To make editing photos easier, you can reorder the filters in your editing window.</p> \n<p>To reorder filters, add a new post and begin editing it. When you get to the filters page, hold down on a filter you'd like to move, and then drag it to your preferred location.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/reorder%20instagram%20filters.png?width=450&amp;name=reorder%20instagram%20filters.png\" alt=\"reorder instagram filters\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" /></p> \n<h4>9. Use Instagram as a photo editor (without having to post anything).</h4> \n<p>Perhaps you love Instagram's filters and editing capabilities, but aren't quite ready to post the photo to your account — right now, or ever. To use Instagram as a photo editor without posting anything, all you need to do is publish a picture while your phone is on airplane mode.</p> \n<p>First, be sure you have \"Save Original Photo\" turned on in your Instagram settings.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8604.png?width=1125&amp;name=IMG_8604.png\" alt=\"IMG_8604\" width=\"1125\" style=\"width: 1125px;\" /></p> \n<p>Then, turn on airplane mode — see instructions in #5.</p> \n<p>Next, follow the normal steps to post a photo to Instagram: Upload the photo, edit it, and press \"Share.\" An error message will appear saying the upload failed, but you'll be able to find the edited image in your phone's photo gallery.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/use%20ig%20as%20photo%20editor.png?width=450&amp;name=use%20ig%20as%20photo%20editor.png\" alt=\"use ig as photo editor\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" /></p> \n<h4>10. Insert line breaks into your bio and captions.</h4> \n<p>When you write a caption in Instagram, you'll see the keyboard doesn't give you an option to press \"Enter\" or \"Return.\" The same is true for your bio. So how do all those people put line breaks in there?</p> \n<img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/No%20return%20key.png?width=450&amp;name=No%20return%20key.png\" alt=\"No return key.png\" title=\"No return key.png\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"> <p>It turns out that all you have to do is press the \"123\" key in the bottom lefthand corner of the keyboard, and the \"Return\" key will appear on the bottom right.</p> <img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Return%20key.png?width=450&amp;name=Return%20key.png\" alt=\"Return key.png\" title=\"Return key.png\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"> <p>I know this tip sounds simple, but <em>a lot</em> of people miss it — myself included, until a colleague clued me in. We've seen some elaborate solutions out there for hacking through this problem, like <a href=\"http://www.lifeinlimbo.org/2014/08/27/instagram-tips-how-to-add-line-breaks-and-spaces-to-your-captions-and-bio/\">writing the caption copy in another app</a>, then copying and pasting it into Instagram. Thankfully, it's much simpler than that.</p> \n  <div class=\"video-container-responsive\"> \n   <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-wrapper hs-responsive-embed\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; position: relative; overflow: hidden; padding: 0; max-width: 560px; max-height: 315px; min-width: 256px; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\"> \n    <div class=\"hs-responsive-embed-inner-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0;\"> \n     <iframe class=\"hs-responsive-embed-iframe\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/498VDB076eY\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n    </div> \n   </div> \n  </div> <a></a> <h3>Instagram Optimization Features</h3> <h4>11. Optimize your Instagram bio to appear in the Explore tab.</h4> <p>Your friends, family, and coworkers might be your first group of Instagram followers, but growing your audience takes more than the people who already know you. One key way to do this is to get your profile to appear in Instagram's Explore page.</p> <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/explore%20tab.jpeg?width=450&amp;name=explore%20tab.jpeg\" alt=\"explore tab\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\">The Explore page, accessible using the magnifying glass icon shown above, is a browsing page that sorts the entire Instagram community by topic and keyword. These include \"Fitness,\" \"Style,\" \"Science,\" and more.</img></p> <p>Hashtagging your posts with these words can expose your content to the people browsing these topics, but you can also use them in your Instagram name and bio to promote your profile.</p> <p>If Jane Doe is a marketing consultant, for example, she might want to make her Instagram name \"Jane Doe Marketing,\" rather than simply \"Jane Doe.\" Then, in her bio, she can include all of her specialties, such as \"SEO,\" \"blogging,\" \"email marketing,\" etc.</p> <h4>12. Drive traffic to an external website.</h4> <p>One of the biggest frustrations people have with marketing on Instagram is that clickable URLs aren't allowed anywhere except the single \"website\" box in your bio. If you put a URL in a photo caption it'll appear as plain text, meaning users would have to painstakingly copy the URL, open a web browser, and paste or type it in there.</p> <p>One sneaky way to get people to visit your Instagram profile, which is where that one clickable URL is allowed, is to use your photo captions to encourage people to visit your profile for a link. Then, update that URL frequently to point to your latest blog content, YouTube video, product, or offer.</p> <p>Check out the example from food magazine <em>Bon Appétit</em> below. This photo's caption provides a text call-to-action to visit the user's profile so you can click the link related to the post.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 658px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);\"> \n   <div style=\"padding: 8px;\"> \n    <div style=\"background: #F8F8F8; line-height: 0; margin-top: 40px; padding: 50.0% 0; text-align: center; width: 100%;\">\n      &nbsp; \n    </div> \n    <p style=\"margin: 8px 0 0 0; padding: 0 4px;\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BT99Vgvh_Km/\" style=\"color: #000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none; word-wrap: break-word;\">Comfort food gone green 🌱. Brandon Jew, chef at @misterjius, put a spring spin on his mom's congee for @healthy_ish.

Update this link frequently to point to your latest content or offer.</p> <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/add%20link%20to%20bio.jpeg?width=450&amp;name=add%20link%20to%20bio.jpeg\" alt=\"add link to bio\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\">Plus, if you have a verified Instagram account, you can also add links to your Story.

Sell products from Instagram using Shoppable Posts.</h4> <p>You might already know you can tag people in your Instagram posts as (or after) you post new content. Now, you can tag <em>products</em> — and direct your viewers to a product page to buy what they saw.</p> <h5>To Add an Instagram Business Account</h5> <p>You'll need an Instagram Business account to publish shoppable posts. You can get one by selecting \"Edit Profile\" on your Instagram profile and tapping \"Try Instagram Business Tools,\" as shown below.</p> <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/professional-account-1.jpg?width=450&amp;name=professional-account-1.jpg\" alt=\"switch to professional account button on instagram\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> <h5>To Tag a Post With Products</h5> <p>Once you've launched an Instagram Business account, you'll need to enable product tags to use them on a post that depicts a product. Navigate to your settings using the gear icon from your profile page, and select \"Products.\" Tap \"Continue\" and follow the prompts to connect a \"<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/instagram/shopping/guide\">product catalog</a>\" to your business profile.</p> <p>With product tags enabled on your Instagram Business account, you can now upload new posts and tag your photo with products you find from your product catalog. Here's what a shoppable post can look like:</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/instagram-shoppable-post.jpg?width=350&amp;name=instagram-shoppable-post.jpg\" alt=\"instagram-shoppable-post\" width=\"350\" style=\"width: 350px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Image via <a href=\"https://help.instagram.com/191462054687226\">Instagram</a></span></img></p> <h4>14. Create an auto-complete quick reply for standard responses.</h4> <p>Responding to user comments and questions is incredibly timely, but fortunately, there's a hack to streamline the process and make it more efficient. (Note: This only works on Instagram Business accounts.)</p> <p>You can simply create a one-to-two word phrase that can act as your shortcut to a longer standard response you might send often. To do this, click \"Business\" in your Settings, and then \"Quick Replies\" — or, click the three-dot chat bubble icon on bottom of screen, and then click \"New Quick Reply\".</p> <p>Add a shortcut you can enter for the response. For instance, you might type \"returnpolicy\" as the shortcut for a longer response, i.e.: \"Hey there. We're sorry you don't love your purchase. Fortunately, we permit 30-day returns, no questions asked. Please send us your order confirmation number to get the process started.\"</p> <p>Once you've added a shortcut, you can either type the shortcut \"returnpolicy\" into the comment box when you want it to auto-generate, or you can tap the three-dot chat Quick Replies bubble icon at the bottom of your screen to choose from a response you've created. (<a href=\"https://business.instagram.com/blog/how-to-communicate-effectively-with-customers\">Read more about Quick Replies here</a>.)</p> <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/0bbb2a75b44c18506923b75ffceb2a1a.gif\" alt=\"0bbb2a75b44c18506923b75ffceb2a1a\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" /></p> <p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://business.instagram.com/blog/how-to-communicate-effectively-with-customers\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> <h4>15. Pin your Instagram post to Pinterest.</h4> <p>Instagram doesn't have a natural integration with many social networks (except Facebook, its parent company) for <a href=\"https://academy.hubspot.com/courses/instagram-marketing?utm_source=marketing_blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=instagram_marketing_relaunch\">publishing Instagram posts</a> to other social accounts.</p> <p>But with respect to Pinterest, image-loving platforms stick together. Here's a backdoor way to Pin your latest Instagram Story to Pinterest:</p> <p>On the Instagram mobile app, tap a post to view it in full, then tap the three dots to the top-right of the image. Select \"Copy Share URL\" to attach the picture's link to your clipboard.</p> <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8618.jpg?width=450&amp;name=IMG_8618.jpg\" alt=\"copy an instagram post's link\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> <p>Open the <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pinterest&amp;hl=en_US\">Pinterest mobile app</a> — or download it; you'll need it for this step — and navigate to your profile page. If you have the latest version of Pinterest downloaded, it might ask you as soon as you open the app if you'd like to produce the image from your clipboard.</p> <p>If not, select the \"+\" icon to the top right to add a new pin, and you'll see a menu of options where you can add your \"Copied Link\" to a new Pin or board on your profile.</p> <a></a> <h3>Instagram Stories Features</h3> <h4>16. Create a collection of saved posts.</h4> <p>In addition to being able to view all of the posts you've liked, Instagram also has an option to save or bookmark certain posts in collections that you create.</p> <p>Start by going to your profile, and tapping the \"Settings\" icon at the top-right of your screen, and then select \"Saved\":</p> <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8585%20copy.jpg?width=450&amp;name=IMG_8585%20copy.jpg\" alt=\"someone's instagram settings to find saved posts\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> <p>Next, press the \"+\" button and name your new Collection. <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8588-1.jpg?width=450&amp;name=IMG_8588-1.jpg\" alt=\"someone's instagram settings to find saved posts\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> <p>Click \"Next\", and select images from your \"Saved\" section.</p> <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8589.png?width=450&amp;name=IMG_8589.png\" alt=\"someone's instagram settings to find saved posts\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> <p>To save photos for future collections, tap the bookmark icon below the post you want to add, as shown below:</p> <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/save%20for%20future%20collections.jpeg?width=450&amp;name=save%20for%20future%20collections.jpeg\" alt=\"save for future collections\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\">Then, go back to your saved photos by following the previous steps.</img></p> <p>You'll see the photos you've saved — to add them to your Collection, select the Collection you want to add to, and tap \"Add to Collection.\" From there, you can add any of your saved photos.</p> <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/add%20to%20new%20instagram%20collection.jpeg?width=450&amp;name=add%20to%20new%20instagram%20collection.jpeg\" alt=\"add to new instagram collection\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" /></p> <h4>17. Create Stories Highlights to show Stories for longer than a day.</h4> <p>Like in Snapchat, posts to your story only stick around for your followers to see for 24 hours. But sometimes, you have a story that deserves more daylight to be told.</p> <p>That's where Stories Highlights comes in, a feature by Instagram that allows you to save stories together in the same space on your profile page. If you ever wondered what that \"New\" button with the \"+\" icon was below your profile image, this explains it.</p> <p>To make a Stories Highlight, tap this New option and select any number of past stories in your album:</p> <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/create%20stories%20highlights.jpeg?width=450&amp;name=create%20stories%20highlights.jpeg\" alt=\"create stories highlights\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" /></p> <span style=\"font-size: 13px; letter-spacing: 0.01em; text-align: center;\">Image via </span> <a href=\"https://business.instagram.com/blog/stories-highlights-and-archive/\" style=\"font-size: 13px; letter-spacing: 0.01em; text-align: center;\">Instagram</a> <p>Then, give it a cover photo and a name to display as its own Instagram Story on your profile page. You can remove Stories Highlights at any time by tapping and holding down this story.</p> <h4>18. Reorder Instagram Stories highlights.</h4> <p>The Highlights on your Instagram feed act as your brand's portfolio — you can use Highlights to demonstrate your company's values, showcase new products or services, or categorize various topics you post about frequently.</p> <p>For instance, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thenorthface/?hl=en\">The North Face</a> uses its Highlights section to highlight various initiatives that are important to the brand, including a section labelled \"VOTE\", \"Global Climbing Day 2020\" and \"Summer Basecamp\":</p> <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/change%20order%20instagram%20highlights.png?width=450&amp;name=change%20order%20instagram%20highlights.png\" alt=\"change order instagram highlights\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\">Since a user can only see the first four highlights when they first come across your feed, you'll want to ensure your first highlights are the ones you're most proud of. To do this, simply follow this trick:</img></p> <p>1. Hold down the highlight you'd like moved to the front of this list and click \"Edit Highlight\" when the slide-up appears.</p> <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8571%20copy.jpg?width=450&amp;name=IMG_8571%20copy.jpg\" alt=\"editing a highlight on instagram\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> <p>2. Next, find an image or video you'd like to add to the highlight. (Don't worry — you'll be able to delete this within 30 seconds, so you don't need to choose one that will stay on the highlight.)</p> <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/edit%20highlight.png?width=450&amp;name=edit%20highlight.png\" alt=\"edit highlight\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\">3. Click \"Done\" in the top right corner.</img></p> <p>4. Now, your Highlight will be first in the list. To remove the image or video you just added, follow the above instructions and simply un-check the image you added. Your highlight will remain at the beginning of the Highlight reel.</p> <h4>19. Change your Instagram Highlights Icon without publishing it to your feed.</h4> <p>The image you choose for each Highlight should accurately depict what type of content users can expect to see if they tap the Highlight, so you'll want to choose a compelling, engaging image.</p> <p>However, if you have a design, logo, or image you'd like to use that isn't in your Instagram feed, it's still possible to make it the Highlight Icon.</p> <p>To do this, click \"Edit Highlight\" (same as the step above):</p> <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8571%20copy-1.jpg?width=450&amp;name=IMG_8571%20copy-1.jpg\" alt=\"clicking on edit highlight button on instagram\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">Next, click \"Edit Cover\". Scroll through your camera roll to find an image you like.</img></p> <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/edit%20highlight%20cover%20photo.jpeg?width=450&amp;name=edit%20highlight%20cover%20photo.jpeg\" alt=\"edit highlight cover photo\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" /></p> <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/new%20photo%20for%20highlight.png?width=450&amp;name=new%20photo%20for%20highlight.png\" alt=\"new photo for highlight\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\">Once you choose an image from your camera roll, click \"Done\". Your Highlight cover image is now an image you've never posted on your Instagram account:</img></p> <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/new%20image%20for%20highlights.png?width=450&amp;name=new%20image%20for%20highlights.png\" alt=\"new image for highlights\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" /></p> <h4>20. Schedule posts in advance.</h4> <p>Instagram being a mobile app, you're probably in a routine of taking photos and posting them to your Instagram Story on the fly. But, you can also pre-post them from your computer for a set day and time in the future.</p> <p>This feature is available with a social media scheduling tool, <a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/articles/kcs_article/social/how-to-use-instagram-publishing-in-hubspot\">as well as HubSpot</a> if you have an Instagram business account. If you have this business profile, switch to it via the Instagram mobile app and follow the prompts to connect it to Facebook.</p> <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/professional-account.jpg?width=450&amp;name=professional-account.jpg\" alt=\"how to switch to instagram professional account\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> <p>Depending on the social scheduling tool you use, you might not include this step. Once you've toggled to the right account, however, you'll launch your scheduling tool, navigate to your current connected profiles, and see Instagram as an available integration.</p> <h4>21. Use 'Type Mode' to enhance your Instagram Stories.</h4> <p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-stories\">Instagram Stories</a> is a feature of Instagram that allows you to post ephemeral photos that show up separately from your profile and only last 24 hours. It's a great function for helping like-minded users discover your profile on Instagram's homepage.</p> <p>But since its beginning, Stories have become quite creative, and it takes more than a pretty filter to stand out to your audience. Enter \"Type Mode,\" an option similar to Snapchat that gives you the power to caption Stories that need extra context to resonate with someone. Here's how to use it:</p> <p>1. Open Instagram Stories by swiping right from your Instagram feed. This will launch your smartphone camera. Then, take a photo or video and press the \"Aa\" icon to the top-right of your screen, as shown below:</p> <h4><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8593.jpg?width=450&amp;name=IMG_8593.jpg\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" alt=\"the text button on an instagram story to add text\" /></h4> <p>This \"Aa\" icon will open Type Mode, where you have five fonts to choose from: <strong>Modern</strong>, <strong>Neon</strong>, <strong>Typewriter</strong>, <strong>Strong</strong>, and <strong>Classic</strong>. Here's what a sample Story looks like with Modern font:</p> <h4><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8594-1.jpg?width=450&amp;name=IMG_8594-1.jpg\" alt=\"adding text to instagram story\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></h4> <h4>22. Post content from other users to your Instagram Story.</h4> <p>Although Instagram Stories are a great way to give your content exposure on your followers' homepages, you might not always have something Story-worthy. In those times, you can share an inspiring post from someone else through your Instagram Stories. Here's how:</p> <p>1. Find a post you want to share in your Instagram Stories and tap the paper airplane icon, as shown below.</p> <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/post%20content%20from%20other%20users.jpeg?width=450&amp;name=post%20content%20from%20other%20users.jpeg\" alt=\"post content from other users\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" /></p> <p style=\"font-size: 11px; text-align: center;\">Instagram Account: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/freddysusa/?hl=en\">@Freddysusa</a></p> <p>This icon will open a screen allowing you to send this post to specific followers, or add to your Story. Tap the latter option, as shown below.</p> <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8597-1.jpg?width=450&amp;name=IMG_8597-1.jpg\" alt=\"adding someone's post to my instagram story\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> <p>Tapping this option will automatically turn the post into an Instagram Story, which you can edit and design to your liking the same way you would any other Instagram Story.</p> <a></a> <h3>Instagram User Preferences Features</h3> <h4>23. Get notifications when your favorite people post.</h4> <p>Never want to miss an Instagram post from your favorite influencers again? You can choose to get a notification every time a specific user posts a new photo. All you have to do is turn on notifications for each user individually.</p> <p>To turn on these notifications, visit a user's profile, click the three dots in the upper right-hand corner of the post, click \"Notifications\" from the menu, and finally toggle on notifications for either posts or stories from the menu that appears.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Get%20notifications%20when%20your%20favorite%20people%20post.jpeg?width=450&amp;name=Get%20notifications%20when%20your%20favorite%20people%20post.jpeg\" alt=\"Get notifications when your favorite people post\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8578.jpg?width=450&amp;name=IMG_8578.jpg\" alt=\"someone's instagram account to get notifications when influencers post\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8579.jpg?width=450&amp;name=IMG_8579.jpg\" alt=\"someone's instagram account to get notifications when influencers post\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11px;\">Instagram Account: </span><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thesisterstudioig/?hl=en\" style=\"font-size: 11px;\">Jen Reed @thesisterstudioig</a></img></img></img></p> <p>Want to turn post notifications off? Just follow the same steps. It's important to note that you must enable notifications from the Instagram app in your phone's settings — here's how.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>To allow notifications on iPhone/iPad:</strong> Go to \"Settings,\" then \"Notifications.\" Choose \"Instagram\" and then turn on the setting to \"Allow Notifications.\"</li> \n   <li><strong>To allow notifications on Android:</strong> Go to \"Settings,\" then choose \"Apps,\" then \"Instagram.\" Select the option to show notifications.</li> \n  </ul> <h4>24. Hide Photos You've Been Tagged In</h4> <p>When someone tags you in a photo or video on Instagram, it's automatically added to your profile under \"Photos of You,\" unless you opt to add tagged photos manually (see the next tip).</p> <p>To see the posts you've been tagged in, go to your own profile and click the person icon below your bio.</p> <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/see%20photos%20youve%20been%20tagged%20in.jpeg?width=450&amp;name=see%20photos%20youve%20been%20tagged%20in.jpeg\" alt=\"see photos youve been tagged in\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\">Next, click on an individual post (any in the group of tagged photos) and click \"Edit\" in the top right. Then, click \"Manually Approve Tags\":</img></p> <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8607.jpg?width=450&amp;name=IMG_8607.jpg\" alt=\"click manually approve tags to hide photos you're tagged in\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> <p>Then, to hide the posts you've been tagged in from other users, select the posts you'd like to remove from your profile, and when you're done, tap \"Hide Photos\" at the bottom of your screen. When prompted, tap \"Hide From Profile.\"</p> <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/hide%20from%20profile.jpeg?width=450&amp;name=hide%20from%20profile.jpeg\" alt=\"hide from profile\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" /></p> <p>This won't remove the posts themselves from Instagram, but it will remove them from your profile, so you and others can't access them.</p> <h4>25. Adjust your settings to approve tagged photos before they show up in your profile.</h4> <p>As we mentioned in the previous step, when someone tags a photo or video of you on Instagram, it's usually added to your profile automatically. But, you can change your Instagram settings to enable manually selecting which photos you're tagged in that show up on your profile.</p> <p>To add tags manually, follow the same steps above to get to the photos in which you've been tagged, and click \"Edit\" at the top right of your screen. Tap \"Tagging Options,\" and select \"Add Manually.\"</p> <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/approve%20tagged%20photos%20ahead%20of%20time.png?width=450&amp;name=approve%20tagged%20photos%20ahead%20of%20time.png\" alt=\"approve tagged photos ahead of time\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" /></p> <p>You'll still be notified when someone tags you in a photo. Once that happens, to manually add a tagged photo to your profile, tap the photo you were tagged in, then tap your username and select \"Show on My Profile.\" And if you'd rather it not be visible, choose \"Hide from My Profile\" instead.</p> <h4>26. Hide ads you don't find relevant.</h4> <p>Instagram tries to show you ads that are interesting and relevant to you. You might see ads based on people you follow and things you Like on Instagram, or the third-party websites and apps you visit.</p> <p>If you see sponsored posts you don't find relevant, though, you can let Instagram know and slowly teach its algorithm what you like and don't like to see.</p> <p>To hide ads on Instagram, tap on the three dots to the right of a post labeled \"Sponsored,\" and choose \"Hide This.\"</p> <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8619.jpg?width=450&amp;name=IMG_8619.jpg\" alt=\"hiding a starbucks ad on instagram\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\" /></p> <p>From there, it'll ask you to share why you don't want to see the ad anymore.</p> <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/IMG_8620.jpg?width=1125&amp;name=IMG_8620.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_8620\" width=\"1125\" style=\"width: 1125px;\" /></p> <p>You can also opt out of seeing ads based on sites and apps off of Instagram and Facebook from your device's settings. Note that even if you choose to opt out of seeing these types of ads, you'll still see ads based on your Instagram and Facebook activity.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>To limit ad tracking on an iPhone/iPad:</strong> Go to \"Settings\" and choose \"Privacy,\" then \"Advertising.\" From there, choose the option to \"Limit Ad Tracking\"</li> \n  </ul> <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-09-14%20at%202.30.43%20PM.png?width=400&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202020-09-14%20at%202.30.43%20PM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-09-14 at 2.30.43 PM\" width=\"400\" style=\"width: 400px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" /></p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>To turn off interest-based ads on Android: </strong>Go to \"Google Settings,\" then \"Ads.\" From there, choose the option to \"Turn off interest-based ads.\"</li> \n  </ul> <img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/opt-out-interest-based-ads-android.png?width=300&amp;name=opt-out-interest-based-ads-android.png\" alt=\"opt-out-interest-based-ads-android.png\" title=\"opt-out-interest-based-ads-android.png\" width=\"300\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <h4>27. Send photos privately to your friends.</h4> <p>Posting photos with all of your followers or with the public isn't the only way to share content on Instagram. You can also share them with individual or multiple users, kind of like a Facebook message or group text message.</p> <p>You can either send a new photo to friends, or send a photo that you or someone else has already posted.</p> <p>To send a new photo privately, upload a photo and begin editing it, as you would when editing a new post. When you get to the \"Share\" page, tap the top where it automatically says \"New Post,\" but when prompted, select \"Direct Message.\" From there, you can pick and choose whom you'd like to send the photo to.</p> <p>You can access your direct messages at any time by clicking the mailbox icon at the top right of your homepage.</p> <p>To send an existing photo privately, start by opening the post you want to share — it can be your own or someone else's, as long as the latter has a public account. Next, click the paper-airplane-like icon below the post, then select who you want to receive it when the \"Send to\" box appears.</p> <a></a> <h4>User Search Features</h4> <h4>28. Search Instagram users without an account.</h4> <p>As much as Instagram would like to see you ultimately create an account for yourself or your business, you can peruse the beautiful brands, people, and dogs that are waiting for you without an account to see if it's worth signing up.</p> <p>There are two ways to search for people on Instagram without logging in:</p> <h5>Entering a Username at the End of the Instagram URL</h5> <p>The first way to search users without an account is by using an Instagram username you already know, and adding it to the end of \"www.instagram.com/.\"</p> <p>For example, if you were to start with our Instagram username — which is simply \"HubSpot\" — you can enter the following into your browser's address bar: <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/hubspot\">www.instagram.com/hubspot</a>. This will bring you to our Instagram profile <em>as well as </em>the elusive search bar at the top of the page:</p> <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/search%20users%20without%20an%20account.png?width=2310&amp;name=search%20users%20without%20an%20account.png\" alt=\"search users without an account\" width=\"2310\" style=\"width: 2310px;\" /></p> <p>Once you've reached this page, you can use the search bar to the left of the \"Sign Up\" button to browse users who are already active on the platform.</p> <h5>Googling Them in an Instagram Site Search</h5> <p>A slightly \"hackier\" way of looking up users without an Instagram account of your own is to simply search their name in a Google site search. This means telling Google to only look up search terms on a website of your choice (in this case, Instagram).</p> <p>To site search a user, open a Google search and type the following: \"<strong>site:instagram.com [name of user]</strong>.\"</p> <p>By keeping all the text prior to the brackets in your search bar, you can shuffle through names of people and businesses and Google will produce results that live <em>only</em> on Instagram. Here's what a site search looks like for HubSpot, below. As you can see, Google produces our main profile, our culture-focused HubSpot Life profile, Instagram posts that include the #hubspot hashtag, and our HubSpot Academy Page.</p> <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/google-site-search-hubspot-instagram.png\" alt=\"Google site search for HubSpot, allowing you to search Instagram users without an account\" /></p> <p><em></em></p> <h4>29. Upload and browse video content on IGTV.</h4> <p>IGTV is one of the biggest new features by Instagram to date. This acronym, as you might assume, stands for \"Instagram TV,\" and it's basically an Explore page just for users' video content. The main benefits of IGTV? You can upload videos more than 60 seconds long, and you can create your own channel with, perhaps, a video series that can be broadcast across other video platforms like YouTube.</p> <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/browse%20igtv.jpeg?width=450&amp;name=browse%20igtv.jpeg\" alt=\"browse igtv\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" /></p> <p>Navigate to IGTV by going to your Explore page and selecting \"IGTV\" at the top, as shown above. A page will appear featuring topics and videos by some of the most prolific IGTV video creators on the platform today.</p> <p>As you view more videos, the topics you see on the IGTV homepage will begin to adapt to your interests and serve you more content around those interests. And, naturally, the same goes for your target audience.</p> <p>Create an IGTV channel by tapping the \"+\" icon to the top right of your screen, as shown below:</p> <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/create%20an%20igtv%20channel.jpeg?width=450&amp;name=create%20an%20igtv%20channel.jpeg\" alt=\"create an igtv channel\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" /></p> <p>With an IGTV channel created, you can then upload videos directly from your smartphone's camera roll to your channel.</p> <h4>30. Look through pictures without accidentally liking them.</h4> <p>It's pretty easy to learn how to like something on Instagram — so easy, in fact, that people do it accidentally: It's just a quick double tap of the photo once you've entered its full view.</p> <p>The thing is, it's so easy to do quickly by mistake.</p> <p>So, here's a quick Instagram cheat for you: To look through someone's photos without \"double-tap paranoia,\" scroll through Instagram feeds with your phone set to airplane mode. Without internet access, you won't be able to Like a photo, even if you accidentally double-tap it.</p> <p>The pictures won't load in the first place if you start on airplane mode, though. You'll have to go to the feed first to load the posts, then turn on airplane mode, then start scrolling.</p> <p>When you reach the end of the first rows of posts and want to load more, simply turn airplane mode off, let more load, and then turn it on again. Cumbersome? Maybe a little, but it could be worth the paranoia mitigation.</p> \n   <ul> \n    <li><strong>To turn on airplane mode on an iPhone/iPad:</strong> Swipe up from the bottom of the screen and click the airplane icon. Or, go to \"Settings\" and then \"Wi-Fi,\" and switch \"Airplane Mode\" on.</li> \n    <li><strong>To turn on airplane mode on an Android device:</strong> Swipe down from the top of the screen. Then, swipe from right to left until you see \"Settings,\" and then touch it. Touch \"Airplane Mode\" to turn it on.</li> \n   </ul> <h4>31. Browse posts from certain locations.</h4> <p>One fun thing you can do on Instagram is browse photos and videos from a specific location, or taken near your current location. I like to do that when I'm planning a trip somewhere, or want to check out a new restaurant and scroll through the pictures taken there.</p> <p>Here's how to do both of these things.</p> <h5>To Browse Posts From at a Specific Location:</h5> <p>You can either search for a specific place, or you can click into a geotag on an existing photo.</p> <p><strong>To search for a specific place:</strong> Tap the magnifying glass icon at the bottom of your home screen, which will bring you to the general search page. When you click into the search bar at the top, four tabs will appear. Choose \"Places,\" and type in the name of a place. When you press \"Search,\" it'll show you all the top and recent posts that were geotagged with that location.</p> <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/search%20for%20location%20on%20ig.jpeg?width=450&amp;name=search%20for%20location%20on%20ig.jpeg\" alt=\"search for location on ig\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" /></p> <p><strong><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/specific%20location%20on%20ig.png?width=450&amp;name=specific%20location%20on%20ig.png\" alt=\"specific location on ig\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" /></strong><strong>To look at posts with a certain geotag:</strong> Go to the photo that's geotagged with that location, and click the geotag. It'll show you all the top and recent posts that were geotagged with that location.</p> <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/geotag%20fenway%20park.jpeg?width=450&amp;name=geotag%20fenway%20park.jpeg\" alt=\"geotag fenway park\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" /></p> <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/geotag%20on%20ig.png?width=450&amp;name=geotag%20on%20ig.png\" alt=\"geotag on ig\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" /></p> <h5>Browse Posts Near Your Current Location:</h5> <p>Follow the same instructions above to get to \"Places.\" Tap the search bar, and select \"Near Current Location.\"</p> <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/browse%20instagram%20near%20current%20location.png?width=450&amp;name=browse%20instagram%20near%20current%20location.png\" alt=\"browse instagram near current location\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" /></p> <p>Choose which geotag you'd like to browse from the options that appear. Let's say I chose to browse posts with the Museum of Science geotag. When I click \"Museum of Science, Boston\" on the menu, I'll see the top and recent posts that were geotagged at that location.</p> <h3>How to Get Verified on Instagram</h3> <p>A verified badge (the blue check beside a celebrity or brand account name) tells users that you're, in Instagram's words, \"the authentic presence of a notable public figure, celebrity, global brand or entity it represents\".</p> <p>For instance, there are plenty of \"Reese Witherspoon\" fan pages on Instagram, but there's only one <em>real </em>Reese Witherspoon account, as verified by the blue badge:</p> <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/verify%20account%20reese%20witherspoon.jpeg?width=450&amp;name=verify%20account%20reese%20witherspoon.jpeg\" alt=\"verify account reese witherspoon\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" /></p> <p>To request a verified badge, you must be a public figure, celebrity, or brand and <a href=\"https://help.instagram.com/312685272613322?helpref=related\">meet certain requirements</a>. If you've determined you fit Instagram's criteria for verification, follow these steps to request a badge:</p> \n   <ol type=\"1\"> \n    <li>Go to your profile (the person icon in bottom left corner).</li> \n    <li>Tap the three lines in the top right corner.</li> \n    <li>Click \"Settings\" &gt; \"Account\" &gt; \"Request Verification\"</li> \n    <li>Fill out the form, including username, Full Name, Known As, Category, and government-issued phoot ID.</li> \n    <li>When you've filled out all form fields, click \"Send\".</li> \n   </ol> <p>It's important to note, you won't necessarily receive a verified badge if you request one. Learn more about what happens <a href=\"https://help.instagram.com/461238577687001\">after you request a verified badge</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Instagram Features &amp; Hacks</strong></h2> <p>I might be biased, but Instagram is one of the most fun (and visually appealing) social apps around. And now, with these tricks, you can use it to an even fuller extent.</p> <p>Plus, many of these features can help to enhance your brand's presence on Instagram. Now, you know how to use the app more efficiently, to make sure you're only tagged in photos you want to appear on your profile, and have even more ways to engage with the people by whom you'd like to be discovered.</p> <p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=4412d29d-6275-43cf-9c55-936f4fc50114&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \"

Back in 2016, The U.S. Department of Labor estimated this cost was close to 30% of the former employee's first-year earnings.</p> \n<p>Today, that figure could be even higher.</p> \n<p>Undoubtedly, recruiting and hiring candidates is an expensive and time-consuming process. This is on top of figuring out which candidates are <em>most</em> qualified to succeed at your company for the long haul.</p> \n<p>A vetting process should include a few critical elements. Let's cover how to run an effective vetting process that's efficient and free of bias as possible.</p> \n<h2>How long does the vetting process take?</h2> \n<p>The vetting process can take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks depending on what your process looks like, the seniority level for the role, and the industry.</p> \n<p>For instance, a role at the Federal Bureau of Investigation likely has a much longer vetting process than one at a SaaS company. The FBI likely conducts in-depth background checks beyond a candidate's criminal background whereas a SaaS company may focus the bulk of its vetting process on technical proficiency.</p> \n<p>Over time, your company will start compiling data on how long the process takes based on the factors mentioned above and build its strategy based on that.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h3>1. Write an accurate job description.</h3> \n<p>Your vetting process will be easier start-to-finish if you take the time to write an accurate and compelling job description.</p> \n<p>I spoke to <a href=\"https://ie.linkedin.com/in/clairebmccarthy\">Claire McCarthy</a>, team lead in sales recruiting, who told me the job description can help both you and the candidate ensure a mutually beneficial fit from the start.</p> \n<p>\"We have pretty comprehensive job descriptions and we want candidates to take the time to read them and ensure the role is a good match for their background and skillset, as well as their long-term goals,\" she said.</p> \n<p>McCarthy adds that it's valuable to focus on attributes when creating your job description.</p> \n<p>\"For instance, for a sales role, we might list 'customer-first mentality' as a requirement,\" she said.</p> \n<p>In addition, craft your description to attract a wide pool of diverse applicants, since diverse teams perform better, and come up with more innovative ideas.</p> \n<p>This is important because a<a href=\"https://hbr.org/2014/08/why-women-dont-apply-for-jobs-unless-theyre-100-qualified\"> </a><a href=\"https://hbr.org/2014/08/why-women-dont-apply-for-jobs-unless-theyre-100-qualified\">Hewlett Packard internal report found</a> that women historically won't apply for a job unless they meet all the qualifications, while most men will apply if they meet only 60% of them.</p> \n<p>However, it doesn't only affect candidates from a gender perspective. Racism, ableism, and ageism can also impact the hiring process – and it all starts with your job description.</p> \n<p>To do so, you can rely on tools like <a href=\"https://textio.com/\">Textio</a>, which help you identify and remove implicit and explicit biased language from your job description.</p> \n<p>The goal is to use inclusive language that welcomes and attracts a diverse range of talent.</p> \n<p>Take a look at the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-job-descriptions\">marketing job descriptions</a> you should recruit and hire to have an all-star team.</p> \n<h3>2. Leverage software to review candidates' application materials.</h3> \n<p>A vetting process should allow you to filter out candidates who don't have the skills necessary to succeed in the role. To do this, start by vetting the applicant's <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-write-a-resume\">resume</a>, cover letter, and other application materials they've submitted for review.</p> \n<p>Additionally, a vetting process can support your diversity and inclusion initiative by ensuring your HR team remains fair and unbiased when evaluating potential candidates.</p> \n<p>For instance, you might implement a blind search system in which resumes are scanned by software, such as <a href=\"https://www.greenhouse.io/\">Greenhouse</a>.</p> \n<p>By ensuring your resumes are automatically sorted based on skill, you're circumventing some of the unintentional biases that might lead your HR employees to make unfair judgments.</p> \n<h3>3. Use video interviews prior to phone calls.</h3> \n<p>There are certain questions you can ask to decipher whether or not a candidate has the correct skills for the role.</p> \n<p>You don't want your recruiters spending valuable time on phone calls when you can just as easily collect that information another way.</p> \n<p>At HubSpot, our hiring process includes video interviews, in which candidates must answer a series of questions and submit their recorded responses. The caveat here is that they must answer each question within a minute and they won't know what the questions are ahead of time.</p> \n<p>\"We do this for high volume roles, and use the video interview as a qualifier for whether or not the candidate moves forward with a phone interview,\" said McCarthy.</p> \n<p>Consider using video interviews to limit the amount of phone calls your HR team needs to make each day.</p> \n<h3>4. Evaluate candidates' qualifications using additional assessment tools.</h3> \n<p>To evaluate whether your candidate will succeed in the role, consider offering initial assessments.</p> \n<p>As a HubSpot writer, I was asked to write a blog post from scratch using one of HubSpot's prompt topics before being invited for an interview. This makes sense – why waste your time, and your candidate's time, if they don't have the skills you're looking for?</p> \n<p>From the candidate's perspective, it allows them to get a taste of what the role requires and show off why they're right for it.</p> \n<p>You might consider offering role plays for customer-facing positions, case studies for functional roles, or coding assessments for engineering positions.</p> \n<h3>5. Trust the process.</h3> \n<p>The point of having a process is to ensure consistency and promote fairness.</p> \n<p>This means across all tools and software you utilize just as much as the steps you follow.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, a vetting process is only effective if it's consistent and replicable.</p> \n<p>\"A vetting process is about establishing a process at the beginning and sticking to it,\" said McCarthy. \"Additionally, it's important to use a vetting process to operationalize how we review candidates and decide which ones are most qualified to move forward to next steps.\"</p> \n<p>Using these five tactics will mitigate the time and money your HR team spends on recruitment in 2022 while ensuring you hire the best applicants – a win all around.</p> \n<em>Editor's Note: This post was originally published in January 2019 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.&nbsp;</em>\n<br> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=20fe7a4f-8bfb-4924-9046-ef5a2f3f3c33&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"New Call-to-action\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/20fe7a4f-8bfb-4924-9046-ef5a2f3f3c33.png\"></a> </p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fvetting-process&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 23 Feb 2022 12:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/c42148d7-13dd-4c38-b907-cff1602ee62f.png","linkMd5":"30588118e842c8415a4177c0c867f8ca","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn19@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-26-48-385_83b23746ffd9fffb.webp","destWidth":840,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":8139,"destBytes":13774,"author":"Caroline Forsey","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/c42148d7-13dd-4c38-b907-cff1602ee62f.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn19@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-26-48-385_83b23746ffd9fffb.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/20fe7a4f-8bfb-4924-9046-ef5a2f3f3c33.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn60@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-26-51-051_e4e09f6d3d81a2f6.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fvetting-process&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn44@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-26-50-654_cc5c7e20b7a48857.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647246408224},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:26:48","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:26:48","title":"What Is Brand Perception? How to Measure It and 4 Examples","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-brand-perception","description":"<p>If you take a second to think about your shopping habits, you'll probably realize that a majority of the products you buy are influenced by brand perception. You're not the only one — <a href=\"https://learn.g2.com/branding-statistics\"><span>77% of B2C consumers</span></a> make purchasing decisions based solely on the brand name.</p>  \n<p>Brand perception, or the thoughts and feelings associated with a company, impacts why people wear a certain brand of clothing or pick one pasta sauce over another at the grocery store. Once consumers adopt an attitude about a brand, it's tough to change. That's why brands work hard to create positive associations in people's minds, rather than negative or neutral perceptions.</p> \n<p>When you know how people perceive your brand, it's easier to shape its reputation, help consumers understand what sets it apart, and develop brand equity. You do this by measuring brand perception and tracking customer sentiment over time.</p> \n<p>But before diving into the metrics, it's important to understand what creates brand perception and how it informs company and consumer decision-making.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=814dd420-0d49-40e0-b59c-f01066e186c1&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Download Now: Free Brand Building Guide\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/814dd420-0d49-40e0-b59c-f01066e186c1.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<h2>What is brand perception?</h2> \n<p>Brand perception is the sum of a consumer's feelings, experiences, and thoughts about a product or service. It's what people believe a brand represents, rather than what a brand says it represents.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/brand%20perception-v1.jpg?width=1794&amp;name=brand%20perception-v1.jpg\" alt=\"How to Understand the Value of Brand perception\" width=\"1794\" style=\"width: 1794px;\"></p> \n<p>Although brand perception is a mental association, it plays an essential role in creating emotional connections with consumers. People consider their attitude toward brands when choosing between competing products. They read reviews, chat with customer support, compare options with friends, or sign up for a free trial. All of these touchpoints affect brand perception and impact a company's success.</p> \n<p>If consumers think highly of a brand, they become more loyal to it. Consider how this dynamic plays out in everyday life. People get in meme wars over <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=apple+vs+android+meme&amp;client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiT_ryuu_r0AhVKaM0KHf2QAxcQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&amp;biw=1423&amp;bih=741&amp;dpr=2#imgrc=QFWJsh5kwFIW0M\"><span>Apple versus Android</span></a> products. A person who wears Nike shoes usually won't be caught in Adidas kicks. And you probably won't find Coca-Cola and Pepsi in the same fridge.</p> \n<p>Companies that understand brand perception use this information to develop <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/brand-equity\"><span>brand equity</span></a>. While brand perception can be narrowed down to what one customer thinks about your brand, brand equity is the combination of people's perceptions, experiences, and opinions that creates your reputation. A company with high brand equity attracts loyal customers who pick your product or service when given the choice between competitors.</p> \n<p>When a customer is <a href=\"https://home.kpmg/xx/en/home/insights/2019/11/customer-loyalty-survey.html\"><span>loyal to a brand</span></a>, 86% will recommend it to friends or family and 66% are likely to write a positive review. Those actions drive company growth and improve brand perception, which only helps your business.</p> \n<p>Although it may seem that brand perception is out of your hands, you can take steps to measure it and improve people's attitudes.</p> \n<h2>How to Measure Brand Perception</h2> \n<p>Data can help you understand how consumers, employees, stakeholders, and competitors perceive your brand. Since brand perception is a combination of reviews, reputation, experience, functionality, advertising, social engagement, and customer use, you should gather metrics from multiple sources.</p> \n<p>Here's how to measure brand perception:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Conduct brand perception surveys</strong> to learn what people think of your business and how it stacks up against competitors. Ask questions that touch on emotional, cognitive, and action-oriented factors, such as these examples from <a href=\"https://www.qualtrics.com/uk/experience-management/brand/perception-surveys/\"><span>Qualtrics</span></a>: \n  <ul> \n   <li>When you think of [the brand], what comes to mind first?</li> \n   <li>Which of the following words describe [the brand]?</li> \n   <li>What kind of feelings do you experience when you think of [the brand]?</li> \n   <li>How would you describe your level of emotional attachment to [the brand]?</li> \n   <li>How would you describe [the brand] to a friend?</li> \n   <li>How would you describe your last experience with [the brand]?</li> \n   <li>On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to recommend [the brand] to a friend or colleague?</li> \n  </ul> </li> \n <li><strong>Track online mentions</strong> using <a href=\"https://info.campussonar.com/social-listening-basics\">social listening</a> tools or Google alerts. You want to monitor social media comments, online reviews, relevant hashtags, forums (i.e. Reddit and Quora), and news mentions. As the brand grows, so will this dataset. I recommend creating a system to handle negative mentions as soon as possible and stay on top of talk about your brand, products, and marketing campaigns.</li> \n <li><strong>Do a brand audit</strong> to evaluate how your brand perception compares to competitors'. This should include research on primary and secondary target audiences, a competitive analysis of your products or services, a thorough evaluation of your communications strategy, and a deep dive into your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/brand-positioning-strategy\"><span>brand positioning</span></a>. (I recommend referencing this brand audit guide from <a href=\"https://visme.co/blog/brand-audit/\"><span>Visme</span></a>).</li> \n <li><strong>Collect data from customers</strong> at each point of the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/what-is-the-buyers-journey\"><span>buyer's journey</span></a>. This can include how buyers research information, evaluate products, compare between competitors, interact with customer support, make a purchase decision, onboard, and interact with the brand post-purchase.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Once you have enough data to measure brand perception, you can evaluate if consumer sentiment aligns with your brand identity. If so, stay the course. If not, you can learn how to improve <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/improve-customer-perception\"><span>consumer brand perception</span></a>.</p> \n<h2>Brand Perception Examples</h2> \n<p>From PR campaigns to packaging, brand perception is influenced by every touchpoint people have with a company. The following brand perception examples show how businesses can shape consumer sentiments so the inner identity matches the outer image.</p> \n<h3>1. Snickers</h3> \n<p>Candy lovers can choose between dozens of chocolate-covered bars, so what makes someone grab a Snickers instead of a Kit Kat? Yes, it may be taste or preference, but the brand has designed clever campaigns to make people believe that eating Snickers will transform you from hangry and unfocused to sharp and satisfied.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-embed-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0; max-width: 560px; max-height: 315px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;\">\n <div class=\"hs-embed-content-wrapper\">\n  <div style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0px;\">\n   <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DZdvFTgmeo0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen style=\"position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div> \n<h3>2. Orangetheory</h3> \n<p>You may have driven past one of these orange-hued workout studios on your daily commute or taken an online class during the pandemic. And while fitness crazes come and go, Orangetheory has carved out a brand perception that's kept the company going strong since 2010. The community-oriented classes make it the right fit for people looking to connect and compete with neighbors while working up a sweat. It's more casual than Crossfit but kicks up the intensity compared to group classes at national gyms, like Planet Fitness and LA Fitness.<img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ME__19BmV3Gala0b9NqcYZWJKV0IlAbLZL9yAnJuGUhHivg3UmUYK1DhiqTHmySWmdOhbnQ4STomwJRFff8Pxigjmpi6HvcWyAR3WY7kYZnpUMAswU3pCECqqMobzxwCeP76S2gA\" width=\"455\" height=\"546\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" alt=\"Orange Theory Fitness Brand Perception\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://tombras.com/campaign/orangetheory-fitness\">Image Source</a></p> \n<h3>3. Zoom</h3> \n<p>An innovative and beloved video platform at the start of the pandemic, Zoom quickly became the cause of remote workers' burnout. People loved how it kept them connected to teams, families, and friends.</p> \n<p>But the constant connection led to \"Zoom fatigue,\" an informal diagnosis that's been covered by Healthline, <a href=\"https://news.stanford.edu/2021/02/23/four-causes-zoom-fatigue-solutions/\"><span>Stanford</span></a>, the New York Times, and more. While companies still rely on Zoom for virtual meetings, the brand has had to adjust from its original \"Video conferencing that doesn't suck\" vibe to \"How the world connects\" as <a href=\"https://adage.com/article/marketing-news-strategy/zoom-launches-ad-campaign-aiming-keep-growing-beyond-pandemic/2364921\"><span>consumers shifted their perceptions</span></a>.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Zoom-Meetings.jpg?width=624&amp;name=Zoom-Meetings.jpg\" alt=\"Zoom fatigue meme: 1st day of Zoom meetings vs. 14th day of Zoom meetings\" width=\"624\" style=\"width: 624px;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.remote.tools/memes/zoom-memes\"><span>Image Source</span></a></p> \n<h3>4. Patagonia</h3> \n<p>The outdoor gear brand became famous for its innovative clothing and focus on responsible manufacturing, but a change in consumer perception caused the company to double down on its sustainability-driven identity.</p> \n<p>In the early 2010s, people began referring to the company as Patagucci — a satirical name that poked fun at the brand's high prices and its adoption among high-income workers. To sway consumers from placing Patagonia in the fast-fashion category, the company has launched a number of sustainability-focused initiatives, like its Worn Wear line of recycled clothing.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-embed-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0; max-width: 560px; max-height: 315px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;\">\n <div class=\"hs-embed-content-wrapper\">\n  <div style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0px;\">\n   <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cMgfVenLRSI\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen style=\"position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Knowing what people think of your brand is an important part of developing a successful business. It gives you the information you need to shape your brand identity, create impactful marketing campaigns, and make changes when consumer perception shifts.</p> \n<p>Now that you know how to measure brand perception, you can use it as a tool to make strategic brand decisions and drive your company forward.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\"
