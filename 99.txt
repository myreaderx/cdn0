Blockbusters are <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2020/3/10/21173376/coronavirus-cancel-coachella-tenet-wonder-woman\">delayed</a>. Drive-ins are <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2020/05/drive-in-movie-theaters-are-the-new-covid-era-gathering-spot.html\">having a moment</a>. And with the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/coronavirus-covid19\">Covid-19</a> pandemic still posing a clear threat to Americans, most people are still choosing to watch their summer movies at home. </p>\n<p id=\"ChzHrc\">But even without the usual slate of buzzy summer blockbusters, new movies are coming out every weekend. This week, there are four new — and unsettling — films worth watching. Two horror films put a new spin on old conventions: One’s about mothers and daughters, and the other’s about the dangers of going to a secluded house in the woods. One of the best films of the year, a horror-like story about a menacing, unseen boss, is newly streaming. And a 10-minute short film about the agony and ecstasy of the strange world we’re living in is freely available.</p>\n<p id=\"L5US46\">All four movies are nourishing to watch. But if you’re looking for something a little more lighthearted, you can always check out one of the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2020/6/26/21291757/best-movies-2020-so-far-streaming\">28 best films from this year so far</a>, or watch one of the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2020/7/10/21315901/best-new-movies-streaming-palm-springs-greyhound-old-guard\">extraordinary new releases</a> from <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2020/7/17/21324451/best-new-movies-streaming-freestyle-clemency-sunlit-father-flannery\">earlier this month</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"9Hohxq\"><em>Amulet</em></h3>\n<div id=\"9MFK6x\"><div style=\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uV_lUlOc4mQ?rel=0\" style=\"border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"encrypted-media; accelerometer; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"></iframe></div></div>\n<p id=\"55CiP4\">“Disturbing” is not quite strong enough a word to describe <em>Amulet</em>, a horror film about the traumas we keep locked up in our bodies until they refuse to be contained any longer. Written and directed by Romola Garai, <em>Amulet</em> is the story of Tomaz (Alec Secareanu), a former soldier living homeless in London. A nun (Imelda Staunton) helps him find a job in a dilapidated, secluded house inhabited by a young woman (Carla Juri) and, he’s told, her sick mother. But it starts to become clear that something odd is going on. Creepy, bloody, and flat-out weird in places, <em>Amulet</em> is a bold directorial debut for Garai and a disquieting reminder that getting rid of the past is never very easy.</p>\n<p id=\"ACLvON\"><strong>How to watch it:</strong> <em>Amulet</em> is playing in select theaters and drive-ins and is available to digitally rent or purchase on platforms including iTunes and Amazon. See <a href=\"https://www.amuletthefilm.com/\">the film’s website</a> for more details.</p>\n<h3 id=\"gxv9QY\"><em>The Assistant</em></h3>\n<div id=\"KYWBLo\"><div style=\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/z9761kQCNWc?rel=0\" style=\"border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"encrypted-media; accelerometer; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"></iframe></div></div>\n<p id=\"r9m6Mk\">It took more than two years after the story of Harvey Weinstein’s history of sexual assault broke for a truly great movie to come out about <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/identities/2020/1/6/21051600/harvey-weinstein-trial-sexual-assault-me-too\">the case</a>, and Kitty Green’s <em>The Assistant</em> is it. Julia Garner (<em>Ozark, The Americans</em>) plays Jane, a new assistant in the Tribeca offices of a high-powered movie studio executive. <em>The Assistant</em> follows Jane as she makes coffee and copies and also witnesses, to her growing horror, what she thinks might be her powerful boss’s inappropriate behavior. We don’t see the “Weinstein” character directly. Instead, we hear his voice and see his back from a distance; we also see the fear he provokes in his subordinates. He isn’t the point of the story, though. The point, as <em>The Assistant</em> makes blindingly clear, is that he gets away with his behavior because of the people around him. It’s one of the best, smartest, and most gripping films of 2020.</p>\n<p id=\"C3sfnF\"><strong>How to watch it: </strong><em>The Assistant</em> is newly <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1516588&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hulu.com%2Fmovie%2Fthe-assistant-94c3d0f4-b5d2-4252-aa12-b959e3f5c6f3&amp;referrer=vox.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vox.com%2Fculture%2F2020%2F7%2F24%2F21333146%2Fbest-new-movies-streaming-rental-amulet\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">streaming on Hulu</a>.

(Yay?) It’s the tale of two couples (played by Dan Stevens, Alison Brie, Sheila Vand, and Jeremy Allen White) who head to a fancy vacation home for a weekend of relaxation, hiking, and maybe some illicit substances. But if horror movies have taught us anything, it’s that you should never go stay at a vacation home in a remote location — especially if someone creepy shows up to let you in. <em>The Rental</em> has a familiar plot with familiar story beats, but it is so well-paced and deliberate, and its cast so good, that even though you know where it’s going, it’s still immensely satisfying to take the journey.</p>\n<p id=\"Ph6qtF\"><strong>How to watch it: </strong><em>The Rental</em> is playing at drive-in theaters and available to digitally rent or purchase on platforms including Amazon and Apple TV.

Over three months, the small number of people who began dancing grew and grew until a crowd was dancing frenetically in the town square, some of them collapsing and even dying. <em>Strasbourg 1518 </em>is not <em>about</em> the plague, but it evokes the event beyond just its name. In the 10-minute short, shot entirely in isolation by dancers across Europe and directed by Jonathan Glazer (<em>Under the Skin</em>), people dance alone in empty rooms to an intoxicating new composition by musician Mica Levi. A voice intones throughout: “How are you, from 10 to one? Ten to two?” and “Every morning, when I wake up, for 10 seconds I am free.” It’s a bit of performance art that captures the frustrations of being a physical body trapped by a pandemic, but in the way only artists of the 21st century could do.</p>\n<p id=\"9yQyRl\"><strong>How to watch it:</strong> In the US, <em>Strasbourg 1518</em> is streaming exclusively <a href=\"https://us.strasbourg1518.film/\">on its website</a>.</p>\n<hr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"9MmS0Y\">\n<p id=\"DdEUmD\"><strong>Support Vox’s explanatory journalism</strong></p>\n<p id=\"RBRwjt\">Every day at Vox, we aim to answer your most important questions and provide you, and our audience around the world, with information that has the power to save lives.

Britney Spears, the indelible bubblegum pop star, faced a new hearing on her conservatorship. </p>\n<p id=\"iW3g83\">For the past 12 years, Spears has been confined by a conservatorship that leaves her without control of her finances, business, or personal affairs. And for the past year or so, her fans have been speculating with increasing fervor that the conservatorship has left Spears, now 38, a prisoner in her own glamorous life and that she is in need of rescue. </p>\n<p id=\"IKRJ6f\">“She has NEVER had control over her life,” <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CCmj9u0H1u8/?utm_source=ig_embed\">said a post</a> on the celebrity-focused Instagram Diet Prada that spread rapidly across the internet early in July. “I don’t care if you personally like her or her music, NO ONE DESERVES THIS.” The post ended with the a now familiar rallying cry: Free Britney. </p>\n<p id=\"DO0zS5\">#FreeBritney is the hashtag Spears’s fans use to follow rumors about her conservatorship, under which Spears answers to a mandated caregiver, and advocate for its end. Together, they compare notes on anonymous reports about Spears’s living situation, pore through the posts her friends and relatives have “liked” recently, and work to decode Spears’s enigmatic social media posts. Last April, <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/8508234/britney-spears-protest-free-britney-los-angeles\">they held a protest in Los Angeles</a> demanding Spears be released.</p>\n<p id=\"hsrQCx\">To understand the #FreeBritney movement and the new conservatorship hearing, we’re going to have to delve into the nuances of California conservatorship law, Spears’s long and troubled career trajectory, and the deep protectiveness of her fans. And in the end, we’ll come back to the same question that’s been driving our fascination with Britney Spears since the “… Baby One More Time” video first blazed across <em>TRL</em> back in 1998: Is Britney Spears the architect of her own life, image, and career? Or is she a puppet for unscrupulous people who want to use her doe-eyed prettiness to build fortunes for themselves?</p>\n<p id=\"ux8o7n\">Just who is in control of this woman, anyway? </p>\n<h3 id=\"TbMDVq\">“A collapse on a scale that we’d really never seen”</h3>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/89-YwE-DdwywzjSl82DUaGaB-RU=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20148614/77518492.jpg.jpg\">\n      <cite>Robyn Beck/AFP via Getty Images</cite>\n      <figcaption>In 2007, Spears was pursued by paparazzi even to a child custody hearing at LA’s Family Court. Here, she waits for a sheriff’s deputy to tell her how to get into the court without being mobbed.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"06C6aI\">When Britney Spears entered conservatorship in 2008, it was the climax to a years-long run of steadily more outrageous public behavior. Gone was the aspirational pop princess of her heyday <a href=\"https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/britney-spears-ab-workout-151365/\">who famously did 1,000 crunches a day</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/08/britney-spears-2001-vmas-snake-alive\">writhed with a snake onstage at the VMAs</a>. In the mid-2000s, Britney Spears was going through a breakdown, one that the rising gossip blogs of the day served up to the public for avid consumption. </p>\n<p id=\"6niKvu\">There was Spears’s quickie Vegas wedding in 2004, <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/britney-spears-shotgun-wedding-turns-10-remember-55-magical-hours-234192/\">which lasted only 55 hours total</a>. Then there was the marriage to backup dancer Kevin Federline, also in 2004, which lasted two and a half years and was greeted by <a href=\"https://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/scientists-are-genuinely-losing-their-sht-arguing-over-which-is-the-most-overrated-animal/\">what E! tactfully described as “mystification</a>” from Spears’s public. </p>\n<p id=\"qgCoXI\">The end of Spears’s marriage to Federline in 2007 at first appeared to signal a return to form, says media studies professor Moya Luckett. “She seemed to be on the verge of getting back from what people read as a misstep with the Kevin Federline marriage,” Luckett says. “There was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjHcFQxhqC8\">an appearance on <em>David Lettermen</em></a> where people said, ‘Oh, she’s dressing better; she’s got herself back. We’ll now see Britney reappear as herself after she’s got rid of the dead weight of Kevin.” </p>\n<p id=\"BDJhua\">Instead, Spears’s every action became the topic of breathless tabloid coverage. The paparazzi followed her around for up-skirt shots. She started yelling at them in <a href=\"https://people.com/celebrity/britney-spears-lapses-into-a-british-accent/\">a British accent</a>. She <a href=\"https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/entertainment/a29681281/britney-spears-shaved-head-reason-2007/\">shaved her own head</a>, allegedly telling a nearby tattoo artist that she was sick of people touching her hair, while paparazzi photographed every angle through the windows of the hair salon. <a href=\"http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1892685_1892691_1892788,00.html\">She attacked a paparazzo’s car</a> with an umbrella. She went <a href=\"https://www.today.com/news/britney-spears-checks-herself-rehab-wbna17243855\">in and out of rehab</a>. She sleepwalked through her performance at the 2007 VMAs so badly that Perez Hilton lectured her for <a href=\"http://www.mtv.com/news/2760492/an-open-letter-to-britney-spears/\">being “disrespectful” to her fans</a>. </p>\n<p id=\"ZdbCBZ\">Spears gossip coverage became even more pantingly furious as her appearance changed. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/8/25/12630692/britney-spears-glory-career-history\">She went brunette</a>, and then lost her hair entirely and turned to wigs. And after injuring her knee, giving birth to twins, and taking a multi-year break from live performances, she’d gained weight, which the press treated as a salacious betrayal: <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=3582432&amp;page=1\">ABC News’s postmortem of those 2007 VMAs</a> quoted a celebrity publicist describing Spears as “heavy” before bracingly noting that an anonymous internet commenter had said of the starlet, “I’d hit it.” </p>\n<aside id=\"rAJ7kt\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"To understand Britney Spears, you need to understand her hair\",\"url\":\"https://www.vox.com/2016/8/25/12630692/britney-spears-glory-career-history\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"2IqP01\">“It was a collapse on a scale that we’d really never seen,” Luckett says. “And it was clearly abetted by the fact that gossip blogs had established themselves as very popular. With cameraphones, there was more access to this kind of information than we’d ever had before — both in terms of receiving the information and in terms of how many people could get on their phones and sell their pictures to the likes of TMZ.”</p>\n<p id=\"KGB5lK\">In January of 2008, <a href=\"https://people.com/celebrity/britney-spears-hospitalized-again-for-evaluation/\">Spears was twice placed under a psychiatric hold</a>. A month later, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/feb/02/musicnews.usa\">her father, Jamie Spears, petitioned the courts</a> for emergency “temporary conservatorship” over Spears. The order was granted. And 12 years later, Britney Spears is still under conservatorship.</p>\n<h3 id=\"eUAwpK\">“She has to ask permission, as if she were a child”</h3>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KtbIx2RZ0tTe_LJzNCdvf-qaK_M=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20148617/1163710102.jpg.jpg\">\n      <cite>Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic</cite>\n      <figcaption>Britney Spears at the <em>Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood</em> Los Angeles premiere, July 22, 2019.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"FDV3Dt\">“If you’re an adult, there is a legal presumption that you are competent to make decisions about a range of things, good, bad, or indifferent,” says Josephine Gittler, a law professor and the author of “<a href=\"https://law.uiowa.edu/josephine-gittler-wiley-b-rutledge-professor-law-has-co-authored-article-reforming-guardianship-and\">Reforming the Guardianship and Conservatorship System: An Introduction</a>.” “Your decisions can be good or bad, but you are entitled as an adult to make decisions about your finances and your property and your medical care. But all states have laws that recognize that some people have diminished decision-making capacity.”</p>\n<p id=\"Q5cV9h\">Conservatorship is designed to be the solution to the problem of a legal adult who has a brain injury or mental health condition that leaves them unable to care for their lives properly. Instead, the courts assign someone to do so for them. (Some states distinguish between conservatorship as covering financial matters and guardianship as covering personal matters, but California, where Spears lives, calls both conservatorships. Spears’s conservatorship covers both her finances and her day-to-day life.) </p>\n<p id=\"WdoPg8\">Proving that an adult is no longer competent to run their own life is a long and drawn-out process. Someone has to file a petition with the court, often Adult Protective Services or its equivalent. (In Spears’s case, it was her father.) The courts will send an investigator to observe the subject’s life and see if there’s really enough evidence to warrant a conservatorship. And the judge assigned the case will hear testimony from experts to see if the subject’s behavior meets the criteria for that state’s statutes. In California, in cases where the stated reason for the petition is mental health concerns, as it was for Spears, a psychiatrist would have to testify that the subject has a DSM-recognized diagnosis.</p>\n<p id=\"RX5e8b\">Once the conservatorship is in place, the conservator assumes final control over the subject’s decisions, which is where Spears is now. </p>\n<p id=\"4d9oDj\">“Anything she wants to do, she has to ask permission, as if she were a child,” says Elaine Renoir, president of the National Association to Stop Guardianship Abuse. “She doesn’t have the legal right to engage in a contract. That has to be done through a conservator.”</p>\n<p id=\"8vLGcI\">The exact details of Spears’s conservatorship are private. But <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/08/arts/music/is-britney-spears-ready-to-stand-on-her-own.html\">the New York Times reported in 2016</a> that her financial conservators — at the time, her father Jamie Spears and lawyer Andrew M. Wallet — kept track of “her most mundane purchases, from a drink at Starbucks to a song on iTunes.” Meanwhile, her personal conservator (first her father and now her “care manager” Jodi Montgomery) oversees<strong> </strong>Spears’s mental health treatment and approves her visitors. </p>\n<p id=\"r1r5U9\">Putting someone under conservatorship means giving someone else enormous power over them. So the potential for abuse is high. “The check on that can and should be court monitoring of the conservatorship,” says Gittler. “Routine monitoring occurs through reports that the conservator has to make to the court, which the court has a very high responsibility of reviewing in detail. Not all courts always do what they should do, and that’s been a concern that’s led to reform of guardianship.”</p>\n<p id=\"6x9NnM\">For their work, conservators are paid a healthy salary. According to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/08/arts/music/is-britney-spears-ready-to-stand-on-her-own.html\">that 2016 New York Times report</a>, Jamie Spears made an annual salary of $130,000 and took home 1.5 percent of the gross revenues from Spears’s Las Vegas residency. </p>\n<p id=\"50RJsV\">Under Jamie’s supervision, the Britney Spears financial empire flourished. After releasing four studio albums, doing a stint as a judge on the <em>The X Factor</em>, and holding down two multi-year Vegas residencies since her father took over running her life in 2008, plus establishing multiple lucrative merchandise deals, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/britney-spears-net-worth-money-spending-fortune-conservatorship#:~:text=Britney%20Spears'%20net%20worth%20is,she%20spends%20it%20%2D%20Business%20Insider\">Spears is now worth $59 million</a>. </p>\n<p id=\"FmcliT\">And none of the money she has earned, or the life that it funds, is under her control. </p>\n<h3 id=\"DKSpsl\">“Disturbing, to say the least”</h3>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"A handwritten sign on white posterboard reads, “JAIL JAMIE, FREE BRITNEY, INVESTIGATE LOU.”\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eIauVfZP1Hfn7oGwXVYQ3KJNXnw=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20148625/1257674679.jpg.jpg\">\n      <cite>Frazer Harrison/Getty Images</cite>\n      <figcaption>A sign from a #FreeBritney protest outside Spears’s conservatorship hearing on July 22, 2020.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"Jcvnca\">Spears’s fans have been suspicious of her conservatorship for as long as it has existed. Many of them point accusingly at all the work Spears has done over the past 12 years: If she is so unstable that she can’t be in control of her own life, they say, why was she <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/26/arts/television/26britney.html\">guest-starring on <em>How I Met Your Mother</em></a> just two months after the emergency conservatorship was established? Doesn’t that seem to suggest that the conservatorship exists less to safeguard Spears’s well-being than to maximize her income and, by extension, the income of those in control of her life?</p>\n<p id=\"34BV5n\">Gittler says it’s not uncommon for people under conservatorship to be active and productive in some parts of their lives but still not be considered legally competent to make their own decisions. “A person with Down syndrome, which may be minimal or profound, may be able to do all the activities of daily living, like holding a job, having a bank account, or purchasing food and clothing for themselves,” she says. “But they might not have the capacity to do their taxes. Mental illness may let them do some things but not others.”</p>\n<p id=\"ZqaroH\">Nevertheless, the secrecy surrounding the Spears conservatorship has added to the growing sense that there might be something sinister going on here. “The public has the right to know that the state is taking care of the citizens that need help,” says Renoir. “Everything’s so quiet with this case that it’s very disconcerting.”</p>\n<p id=\"JgWvTB\">Spears’s diagnosis and treatment plan remain private, as do the details of what she is and is not allowed to do. Few would dispute that Spears’s medical status is her own business and not information the public has any right to, but fans are troubled by how heavily mediated her access to the public appears to be.</p>\n<p id=\"ey0MHH\">Any reporters Spears talks to have to be vetted by her conservators first, with the result that Spears has only discussed her conservatorship in public once, in her 2008 documentary <em>Britney: For the Record</em>. (She said it was <a href=\"https://people.com/celebrity/britney-spears-calls-her-life-worse-than-a-jail-sentence/\">worse than being in jail,</a> because at least when you’re in jail, you know when you’ll get out.) She has <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/britneyspears/?hl=en\">a regularly updated Instagram</a>, but after <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/article/britney-spears-instagram-video-mental-health-response\">a prominent post</a> went up with an emoticon rather than Spears’s preferred emojis and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BxiP_-DgdQj/\">another one recycled a clip from 2018</a>, fans have begun to doubt whether Spears is always in control of what is posted on it. It’s rumored that <a href=\"https://www.tmz.com/2019/05/07/britney-spears-using-mother-lynne-mental-health-dark-period/\">Spears’s access to the internet is heavily curtailed</a> and that she is only allowed a flip phone. </p>\n<p id=\"H4q0Fs\">Spears has said publicly that she handles her Instagram herself. “For those of you who don’t think I post my own videos, I did this video yesterday,” she informed her followers in 2019, on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/ByBOp-cgVok/?utm_source=ig_embed\">a post</a> showing her modeling different dresses to Rihanna’s “Man Down.” “So, you’re wrong!” she concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"wLCOuE\">Fans remained unconvinced. “It sounds and looks so scripted!” says the post’s top reply.</p>\n<div id=\"9P4dCg\">\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned=\"\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/ByBOp-cgVok/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

That’s when comedians Tess Barker and Barbara Gray, hosts of the Spears-centric podcast <a href=\"https://britneysinstagram.libsyn.com/\"><em>Britney’s Gram</em></a>, <a href=\"https://britneysinstagram.libsyn.com/75-freebritney\">received a voicemail</a> from someone who said he used to be a paralegal at the law firm handling Spears’s conservatorship.</p>\n<p id=\"OviZd6\">Earlier in the month, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BvziBzUgQoz/?hl=en\">a post on Spears’s Instagram</a> announced that the singer had checked herself into a mental health facility for “a little ‘me time.’ :)” (Note, Spears’s fans insisted, the emoticon.) Months before that news broke, Spears had canceled her planned Vegas residency, ostensibly to spend time with her gravely ill father.</p>\n<p id=\"WbFRbW\">“What is going on is disturbing, to say the least,” the former paralegal said in the voicemail on <em>Britney’s Gram</em>. He alleged that Spears had been committed to a mental health facility against her will and that there was no timeline for her release. The trigger, he claimed, was that Spears had been seen driving with her boyfriend to pick up some fast food, even though her conservatorship forbids driving. Moreover, he said<strong> </strong>that she had begun to refuse to take her medication. Jamie Spears had decided to take drastic action and blame his own illness for it.</p>\n<p id=\"NdlZWE\">Barker and Gray have said they spoke to the paralegal separately and found him credible. No other outlet has ever been able to verify his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"h1hC0w\">Meanwhile, Spears’s camp maintained that the conservatorship remains necessary to keep Spears’s life on track. “The conservatorship is not a jail,” <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/the-battle-of-britney-spears/2019/05/17/edcc826c-7681-11e9-bd25-c989555e7766_story.html\">Spears’s manager Larry Rudolph told the Washington Post in 2019</a>.<strong> </strong>“It helps Britney make business decisions and manage her life in ways she can’t do on her own right now.” Those successful Vegas residencies, for instance, were courtesy of the conservatorship: Part of Spears’s contract demanded she remain under conservatorship for as long as she was in residency to ensure that she wasn’t a flight risk. Without the security of the conservatorship in place, the thinking went, Spears would go off the rails again, and she would surely lose the business advantages and the stable and happy life she had worked so hard to build.</p>\n<p id=\"axvIfg\">Rudolph added that Jamie Spears wanted the conservatorship to end as much as anyone else. “It’s his daughter,” Rudolph said. “He wants to see her happy [in] a functional life without any intervention like this.”</p>\n<p id=\"7uSajD\">In September 2019, Jamie Spears stepped down as conservator <a href=\"https://people.com/music/britney-spears-father-jamie-steps-down-as-her-conservator/\">after a physical altercation with one of Spears’s sons</a>. Her longtime caregiver, Jodi Montgomery, took his place.</p>\n<p id=\"LG0BlE\">And as fans began speculating wildly across the internet, Lynne Spears, Britney’s mother, entered the spotlight. Lynne has no legal involvement with the conservatorship, but she began <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/britney-spears-mother-likes-freebritney-comments-asking-end-daughters-1400332\">“liking” posts under the #FreeBritney hashtag</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"CiOOPg\">The Free Britney movement swelled.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ECqw0u\">“It’s not supposed to end with your dad being in control of your life!”</h3>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pdPDJBuZ2Oe8Ryofprjysdu99KM=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20148632/114505085.jpg.jpg\">\n      <cite>Ethan Miller/Getty Images for ABC</cite>\n      <figcaption>Spears performs in decorative manacles at the 2011 Billboard Music Awards in Las Vegas.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"p1hPtJ\">Media scholar Isabel Molina-Guzmán suggests that the Free Britney movement caught particular fire for coming so quickly on the heels of the Me Too movement. “We’re really paying attention to women’s agency and power right now, and here’s this super-successful celebrity who can’t make decisions for herself and her kids,” Molina-Guzmán says. </p>\n<p id=\"XsmKQx\">And Spears’s position, Molina-Guzmán adds, seems particularly wrong for the generations of fans who grew up idolizing her. “That’s fan culture: You aspire to be your idol, or to feel like your idol understands you, right?” Molina-Guzmán says. </p>\n<p id=\"6XXNJu\">In<strong> </strong>her heyday, Britney Spears was just about the most aspirational figure in popular culture. She was the girl everyone was supposed to want to be. And many of Britney’s fans in particular latched onto her when she was leaving the strictures of the Mickey Mouse Club, embracing an image more provocative than Disney would ever have allowed in a way that suggested she was trying to take ownership over her body. For her to be under conservatorship — to have lost legal control over her life and her body — doesn’t fit the narrative. </p>\n<p id=\"abi3nO\">“It’s not supposed to end with your dad being in control of your life!” Molina-Guzmán says. “So fans ending up looking for signs to try to justify their belief in a different ending.”</p>\n<p id=\"jBsnZf\">As the date for Spears’s latest conservatorship hearing approached, fans began combing her social media pages for cues. Wear yellow if you need help, they instructed; wear black if you’re sad. There are so many of these messages in the comments of every Britney Spears post that Spears could hardly avoid sending a coded message through her clothing if she tried, but nevertheless, when Spears showed up on her pages dressed in yellow and black, <a href=\"https://theblast.com/136565/britney-spears-midriff-monday-photo-sparks-suggestions-she-isnt-\">fans responded with shock and horror</a>. </p>\n<p id=\"1AJ6iR\">Luckett adds that fans’ distress is particularly exacerbated by their belief that Britney isn’t running her own social media. “Part of the Britney narrative and part of the persona that<strong> </strong>seems to be authentic — and you always have to be careful about this,” Luckett says, “is that she seems to want to speak directly to her public because she thinks they’ll understand what she’s going through.” </p>\n<p id=\"ggEFoF\">Luckett points to Spears’s <a href=\"https://www.today.com/popculture/britney-i-do-not-care-what-people-think-wbna13329706\">infamous 2006 interview with Matt Lauer</a>, for which Spears did her own makeup and during which she broke down in tears, as well as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney:_For_the_Record\">her documentary</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney_and_Kevin:_Chaotic\">her short-lived reality TV show with Kevin Federline</a>. The confessional nature of those accounts is a far cry from the suspicious “We all need to take time for a little ‘me time.’ :)” of 2019. If Spears’s fans think someone is keeping them from direct access to Britney, then they can understand themselves as being robbed of the part of Britney’s persona that made her so compelling to begin with. They start to feel outraged and protective.</p>\n<h3 id=\"iqfgga\">“Britney was the chief architect of Britney”</h3>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sSCkSuinHmNh_WEhsG_Nfk4iL8w=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20148638/111903818.jpg.jpg\">\n      <cite>Getty Images</cite>\n      <figcaption>Spears in 1998.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"ic4DqM\">Ultimately, the Free Britney movement revolves around one question: Is Britney Spears in control of her own life? And that’s the question we’ve been asking about her for her entire career.</p>\n<p id=\"EOymsR\">Early criticism of Spears sneered that she was a manufactured pop star, the product of a Swedish songwriting factory that had no real hand in either her music or her persona. “Seventeen-year-old actress Britney Spears couldn’t land more than a role in an off-Broadway update of <em>The Bad Seed</em> until she scored a contract with the Backstreet Boys’ record company,” begins <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20131211231544/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/baby-one-more-time-20030113\">a capsule review of Spears’s debut album</a>, ...<em>Baby One More Time</em>, in Rolling Stone in 1998. “She was flown to Sweden’s Cheiron Studios, the Lolita-pop dollhouse where ‘N Sync, Robyn, Five, Ace of Base and the Backstreeters all record their Eurofied impersonations of teen-targeted American R&amp;B.” </p>\n<p id=\"Gtat2u\">And at Cheiron, Rolling Stone concluded, super-producer Max Martin and his team had collaborated to transform a perky Disney drama kid “into a growling jailbait dynamo.” Spears, in other words, was a passive blank slate, an actress with basic singing and dancing abilities who got lucky. The star audiences fell in love with was the product of clever producers and marketing.</p>\n<p id=\"sUkoxA\">When Spears came up in the late ’90s, music criticism was still overwhelmingly dominated by rockism,<strong> </strong>a system of aesthetic evaluation that prizes the so-called authenticity and grittiness of rock above all else. Spears’s slick, breezy pop was an affront to rockist sensibilities, and claiming that Spears was fake was an easy way to dismiss her. </p>\n<p id=\"3U7yvQ\">Spears’s life, meanwhile, appeared to be entirely under her own control. Wasn’t she going out and partying every night with all of Hollywood at her feet? Wasn’t she reaping the rewards of all her producers’ hard work? And when she spiraled downward in 2007, it just proved that she should never have had that much freedom and that much control in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"7nufHl\">But over the past decade, the rise of poptimism, which celebrates the artifice and exaggeration of pop, has brought in a counter narrative. Spears, today’s critics note, was the one who came up with <a href=\"https://www.theringer.com/music/2020/5/14/21258289/britney-spears-oops-i-did-it-again-20-year-anniversary-retrospective\">the iconic Catholic schoolgirl and cheerleader motif</a> in the “Baby One More Time” video. She made the “Oops I Did It Again” video dance-centric rather than space-centric as her producers suggested. It was she who <a href=\"https://ew.com/music/2018/10/23/baby-one-more-time-britney-spears-oral-history/\">ad-libbed all those “oh bay-bay bay-bays,”</a> and she who used her dancer’s intuition to help select the beats for each track.</p>\n<p id=\"R3DByd\">“The public perception is that this is all created, that the record company created this — the artist, the music, the image,” <a href=\"https://ew.com/music/2018/10/23/baby-one-more-time-britney-spears-oral-history/\">said Rolling Stone editor Ron Levy in 2018</a>. “I have to tell you, if the record company could have created more than one Britney Spears, they would have done it, and they tried!”</p>\n<p id=\"Vsi3jp\">“Britney was the chief architect of Britney,” <a href=\"https://www.laineygossip.com/celebrating-20th-anniversary-of-britney-spears-oops-i-did-it-again-and-intro-for-may-15-2020/66255\">wrote gossip expert Elaine Liu in May 2020</a>. “Anyone who tells you different reveals themselves to be a pop culture amateur.”</p>\n<p id=\"jYzePK\">This celebration of Spears as her own auteur was part of the great poptimist revolution that reframed the way media gatekeepers wrote about popular culture over the past 20 years. It’s part of a movement to stop reflexively dismissing culture created for and by teenage girls and to instead celebrate that culture as its own form of aesthetic expression. </p>\n<p id=\"TDTQtn\">But now that our public image of Spears is able to afford her some credit for her artistic work, her personal life becomes a bigger question. Even if the rumors are wrong, and Spears does have control over her own social media accounts — well, what about the way she fills them with <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CCbi0-igE-S/\">blank-eyed selfies</a> and videos of her <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@britneyspears/video/6844989705151319301?lang=en\">practicing the same pose over and over again</a> or <a href=\"https://www.flare.com/celebrity/britney-spears-instagram-runway-videos/\">runway walking in a variety of different dresses</a>? What is going on there? </p>\n<p id=\"VBEoq3\">“Because the videos are a kind of art brut expressionism, empty of context, they fill viewers with questions,” <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/12/magazine/britney-spears-instagram-freebritney.html\">wrote Caity Weaver for the New York Times in 2019</a>. “What does she want us to feel when we watch? Is she to be viewed as an innocent girl playing dress-up? An empowered stylish woman stomping across marble floors she bought herself? A sexy human Barbie with an infinite closet? Regardless of intention, the clips are illegible, generating primarily a voyeur’s guilty, mystified confusion.”</p>\n<p id=\"KbJTZZ\">These repetitive, vacant videos feel somehow closely related to the ubiquitous paparazzi photos of 2007: Britney grinning into the mirror as she shaves her own head, Britney with the umbrella, Britney strapped down to a gurney in an ambulance. </p>\n<p id=\"Zl320h\">In 2007, we were watching someone spiral away from the constraint of her managers and image-handlers and ultimately even out of her own control. And now, here in 2020, we seem to be watching someone at the limits of a very narrow, very prescribed world. It’s as though all Spears can do, the only thing she has, is the ability to pace through the halls of her mansion and hit a mark, over and over and over again. And then, maybe, have someone else post the video online with a smartphone she’s not allowed to use herself.</p>\n<p id=\"wVDDnn\">The Free Britney movement takes this sense of constraint and extends it. </p>\n<p id=\"69EyUE\">“Her career has been on autopilot most of her life,” <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CCmj9u0H1u8/?utm_source=ig_embed\">says that recently viral Diet Prada post</a>. “If you look back at her music for years, she’s been telling everyone she’s too controlled and treated as a product.” It points to the many S&amp;M-inflected photo shoots Spears has participated in, in which <a href=\"https://theblast.com/129683/britney-spears-chained-up-album-art-linked-to-conservatorship-cr\">she’s shown in cages and chains</a>, and to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEZ2azbB9P8\">videos of Spears singing as a child</a>, in which her voice is notably deeper and fuller than it sounds in the sexy baby coo she made famous. It argues that Spears has been forced to sing outside of her natural register, to act and dance unnaturally in ways that her team will be better able to market.</p>\n<p id=\"YYlXhH\">The case Diet Prada is making for Britney is, in a way, a close cousin to the case the rockists made against her in the late ’90s. It argues that she is a manufactured product unable to control how the public sees her, performing as her managers have forced her to for her whole life. </p>\n<p id=\"GcWMoX\">For the rockists, that apparent constraint made Spears disposable and unserious. For the current #FreeBritney activists, it makes her a victim who must be rescued. But one way or another, the question of whether that constraint really exists is the question Spears has been facing for her entire public life.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cdcqLy\">“I am strong, and stand up for what I want!”</h3>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"A masked woman in a Britney Spears T-shirt carries a pink bullhorn and holds a sign saying, “The world is rooting for you, Britney.”\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/egdyppw7w-cW7CpM8bNFfT5S6W0=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20148648/1257674143.jpg.jpg\">\n      <cite>Frazer Harrison/Getty Images</cite>\n      <figcaption>A #FreeBritney protester outside Spears’s conservatorship hearing on July 22, 2020, in Los Angeles.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"g6mbNS\">Britney Spears has remained tight-lipped in public on how she feels about her conservatorship. And the private reactions of hers that have filtered out to the public are all laced with ambiguity.</p>\n<p id=\"8UKd8o\">In May 2019, a judge ordered a medical expert to examine Spears and her life to see if she is competent to control her own affairs. Court papers show no official petition from Spears for such an examination, but <a href=\"https://www.tmz.com/2019/05/13/britney-spears-free-social-media-conservatorship-jamie/\">TMZ reported</a> that she made a verbal request for one, and a conservatorship lawyer told <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/24/britney-spears-why-does-she-still-need-conservator/2288009001/\">USA Today</a> that if she had made such a request, appointing an expert to examine her case would have been the immediate response. </p>\n<p id=\"9AkY8F\">But at the next conservatorship hearing in September 2019, Spears no-showed. The lawyer appointed to advocate for her informed the judge that her absence meant she “did not object” to the conservatorship continuing. <a href=\"https://theblast.com/137527/britney-spears-suffers-technical-difficulties-during-virtual-cou\">She also no-showed the July 22 hearing</a>, ostensibly because of technical difficulties. Records of the case have now been sealed from public view.</p>\n<p id=\"Fh1Uv5\">Meanwhile, anonymous sources have suggested that <a href=\"https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/britney-spears-conservatorship-extended-till-end-of-august/\">Spears may have decided to stop working altogether</a> if it means she can get out of her conservatorship. </p>\n<p id=\"Jqkrk4\">In April 2019, Spears vaguely addressed the rumors floating around her <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BwnqpG5g7qn/?utm_source=ig_embed\">in an Instagram post</a>. “You may not know this about me, but I am strong, and stand up for what I want!” she wrote. What she needed most right then from her fans, she concluded, was something she’s been afforded precious little of throughout her multi-decade career: some space to herself.</p>\n<p id=\"jKpFed\">“Your love and dedication is amazing, but what I need right now is a little bit of privacy to deal with all the hard things that life is throwing my way,” she concluded. “If you could do that, I would be forever grateful.” </p>\n<p id=\"iJOYn9\">The post was capped off by a string of heart emojis.</p>\n<hr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"iwkww8\">\n<p id=\"DdEUmD\"><strong>Support Vox’s explanatory journalism</strong></p>\n<p id=\"RBRwjt\">Every day at Vox, we aim to answer your most important questions and provide you, and our audience around the world, with information that has the power to save lives.

Therefore, State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said, the US ordered China’s Houston diplomatic office closed “in order to protect American intellectual property and American’s private information.” But Ortagus didn’t specify how, exactly, the move would hinder China’s intelligence gathering in the US.</p>\n<p id=\"vnK2gU\">Unsurprisingly, China’s Foreign Ministry didn’t take kindly to the abrupt demand. It <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/07/22/894082208/u-s-orders-chinas-houston-consulate-to-close\">accused the US</a> of opening sensitive diplomatic pouches in October and June, a serious allegation the Trump administration has yet to address. Spokesperson <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/world/asia/us-china-houston-consulate.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage\">Wang Wenbin</a> called the consulate closure an “unprecedented escalation” and asserted that “China will certainly make legitimate and necessary reactions.” </p>\n<p id=\"skI6Tl\">On Friday, that reaction happened: China told the US it had 72 hours to close its <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/china-tells-us-to-shut-consulate-in-chengdu-in-retaliation-for-houston-order/2020/07/24/839108d0-cd62-11ea-99b0-8426e26d203b_story.html\">consulate in Chengdu</a>, a prominent outpost in the country’s southwest that was vital to America’s efforts to keep tabs on Tibet and Xinjiang. With the US consulate in Wuhan closed due to the coronavirus — Wuhan is the disease’s origination point — the Trump administration now has fewer diplomats on the ground to monitor China and stop spiraling relations from getting worse.</p>\n<p id=\"IvuSVv\">Shortly after the announcement, a heavy <a href=\"https://twitter.com/annafifield/status/1286536310266589184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1286536310266589184%7Ctwgr%5E&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fworld%2Fasia_pacific%2Fchina-tells-us-to-shut-consulate-in-chengdu-in-retaliation-for-houston-order%2F2020%2F07%2F24%2F839108d0-cd62-11ea-99b0-8426e26d203b_story.html\">police presence</a> guarded the soon-to-be-shuttered consulate.</p>\n<div id=\"pOGKUm\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The police presence outside the U.S. consulate in Chengdu is something<a href=\"https://t.co/B98a9HVedQ\">https://t.co/B98a9HVedQ</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/aBZU2By2Pz\">https://t.co/aBZU2By2Pz</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/V2lTPGbDkE\">pic.twitter.com/V2lTPGbDkE</a></p>— Anna Fifield (@annafifield) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/annafifield/status/1286536310266589184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 24, 2020</a>\n</blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</div>\n<p id=\"b6f4LR\">That somewhat mirrored how the Chinese reacted to the Houston news.

The <a href=\"https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/9_1_1961.pdf\">1961 Vienna Convention</a>, a set of international rules governing diplomatic relations, is clear that foreign officials must “respect the laws and regulations of the receiving State” and have “a duty not to interfere in the internal affairs of that State.” Ortagus specifically cited those sections of the Vienna Convention in her Wednesday statement.</p>\n<p id=\"1a2wmn\">Of course, every country — including the US — uses its diplomatic facilities to spy on the host country. That’s nothing new. But, if China was using the Houston consulate solely as a major spy hub — instead of its actual function to approve visas and help expats in Texas and nearby states — one could make a strong case Beijing gave up the right to keep that mission. </p>\n<p id=\"dAzgOV\">But the spying angle may not be the only aspect at play here.</p>\n<p id=\"WaKX5L\">President Donald Trump has a reelection to consider, and showing he’s tough on China — by shuttering a diplomatic post that’s been <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/china-vows-to-retaliate-after-us-orders-closure-its-consulate-in-houston/2020/07/22/41e5c6ea-cbf1-11ea-99b0-8426e26d203b_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-banner-main_china-us-tt-445am%3Ahomepage%2Fstory-ans\">open since 1979</a> — is one way to boost his national security bona fides. </p>\n<p id=\"1awH09\">“The Houston consulate is the only Chinese consulate in a red state, so that probably made it easier,” said Bonnie Glaser, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The <a href=\"http://www.china-embassy.org/eng/zmzlglj/t84229.htm\">others</a> are in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and the embassy in Washington, DC.</p>\n<p id=\"Ga25EQ\">Further, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo plans to give a <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/jul/21/mike-pompeo-china-speech-defends-trump-hawkish-pos/\">speech on Thursday</a> discussing what the administration perceives to have been the shortcomings of US foreign policy toward China in the past. Announcing the Houston move gives him something to boast about in the address. </p>\n<p id=\"bUkhgT\">“We put together a series of remarks aimed at making sure the American people understood the ongoing, serious threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party to our fundamental way of life here in the United States of America,” Pompeo told the <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/jul/21/mike-pompeo-china-speech-defends-trump-hawkish-pos/\">Washington Times</a> in a Tuesday interview to preview the speech.</p>\n<p id=\"JXODUF\">Finally, on Tuesday, Washington accused Beijing of working with <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/us-china-covid-19-vaccine-research/2020/07/21/8b6ca0c0-cb58-11ea-91f1-28aca4d833a0_story.html\">two hackers</a> who targeted firms working on coronavirus vaccines and treatments. It’s possible the Houston announcement was meant as a retaliation to that case.</p>\n<p id=\"5oadEm\">Even considering all that, most experts aren’t completely sure why this decision was made now as opposed to any other time if Chinese spying was of major concern to the administration. “At this point, the reasoning behind the US government’s action is unclear,” Aaron Friedberg, a China expert at Princeton University, told me, which is troubling since “closing a foreign consulate is a serious step.”</p>\n<p id=\"UbKbsn\">The answer may not lie in just one incident, but rather in a compendium of transgressions. </p>\n<p id=\"khBH1s\">For months now, Washington and Beijing have exchanged insults and taken countering actions which have further plunged ties to their worst point since the 1970s. The US closing China’s consulate — and the expected retaliation — likely forms yet another data point in a larger, ongoing struggle between two competing world powers.</p>\n<p id=\"tSc7KB\">“It’s hard to argue anymore that this is not a new cold war,” said Glaser.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Eveai0\">The US-China cold war is heating up</h3>\n<p id=\"MqFv6n\">Listen to US-China analysts and the first thing they’ll tell you is that the situation just keeps getting worse.</p>\n<p id=\"DEiGvy\">“The downward spiral is picking up speed,” said Jacob Stokes of the US Institute of Peace. “Bilateral relations are plumbing new depths every day.”</p>\n<p id=\"5yl23C\">Ryan Hass, the China director on the National Security Council from 2013 to 2017, explained to me just why that is: “A pattern seems to have taken hold, with the Chinese taking actions the US finds objectionable, America responding punitively, and then China retaliating in a reciprocal tit-for-tat fashion. I expect the same pattern to play itself out in the case of the closing of this consulate.”</p>\n<p id=\"tgYbK5\">Just look at a few of the events that have happened throughout the course of the Trump administration.</p>\n<p id=\"RcwXe5\">The president launched a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2018/9/18/17790600/us-china-trade-war-trump-tariffs-taiwan\">trade war</a> against China, imposing tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of goods. Beijing responded in kind, placing similar penalties on American-made products. Despite reaching a “<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2020/1/15/21064070/trump-china-phase-one-trade-deal-signing\">phase one</a>” deal earlier this year, the general trade relationship between the two countries hasn’t changed — except that <a href=\"https://qz.com/1687095/the-products-getting-more-expensive-under-trumps-trade-war/\">products are becoming more expensive to buy in the US</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"95RuLX\">In March, the Trump administration said only up to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/world/asia/china-journalists-diplomats-expulsion.html\">100 Chinese citizens</a> could work for five Beijing-owned outlets in the US. Weeks later, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/business/media/china-expels-american-journalists.html\">China expelled American journalists</a> from the New York Times, Washington Post, and the Wall Street Journal from the country. It also forced other outlets, namely Voice of America and Time magazine, to tell the government how they operate in China.</p>\n<p id=\"PpfkQv\">Last week, the <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/09/politics/xinjiang-chinese-officials-sanctions/index.html\">US sanctioned multiple Chinese officials</a> for the regime’s forced internment of over a million Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang, a region in Western China. One of the officials targeted was Chen Quanguo, the Communist Party secretary for Xinjiang. Almost immediately afterward, China retaliated by targeting US officials, including <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/13/asia/china-us-xinjiang-sanctions-intl-hnk/index.html\">Rubio and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX)</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"tSkirv\">And on Tuesday, as mentioned, Washington indicted the two hackers. The Justice Department also alleged they went after clergy and human rights activists in the US, China, and Hong Kong. It’s unclear what China will do in response to the 11-count indictment, but it will surely deny having anything to do with the hackers.</p>\n<p id=\"qAknMm\">During tense times like these, it’s normally best to use any and all channels of communication to stop matters from getting worse. But forcibly closing the Houston consulate potentially makes that harder. </p>\n<p id=\"LzdemM\">“This further reduces the few remaining diplomatic channels between the two sides and is a step that will prove difficult to reverse,” said Daniel Russel, the US assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs from 2013 to 2017.</p>\n<p id=\"eZHIRt\">Other experts agree. Not arresting the accused and shutting the entire consulate down instead will cause “a further downturn of the bilateral business and people-to-people relations between the two countries, which have traditionally provided some ballast in the relationship when government-to-government relations were strained,” said USIP’s Stokes. “Overall, this is another step toward ‘decoupling’ the United States and China.”</p>\n<p id=\"iJOYn9\">And if the US and China keep drifting further and further apart, the current “war” may not remain so “cold” much longer.</p>\n<hr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"nztthb\">\n<p id=\"DdEUmD\"><strong>Support Vox’s explanatory journalism</strong></p>\n<p id=\"RBRwjt\">Every day at Vox, we aim to answer your most important questions and provide you, and our audience around the world, with information that has the power to save lives.

Here’s what you need to know.</p> <p id=\"yVCnPB\">The streaming wars are well and truly upon us. </p>\n<p id=\"q6qzUY\">And they’ve become radically more complicated in just the past year. Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon — the big fish in a small pond — are still making big moves (especially in the original programming game). The slightly younger CBS All Access is still the streaming home of CBS programming, of <em>Star Trek</em>, and of <em>The Good Fight</em> (<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/5/5/21241559/good-fight-season-4-review-recap\">one of TV’s best shows</a>). </p>\n<p id=\"u7zA8i\">But the past seven months have heralded the arrival of Apple TV+, Disney+, HBO Max, and NBCUniversal’s Peacock, all pulling on their wetsuits to take a dip in a pond that seems to have less room by the day. When you consider that this census of streaming services doesn’t account for the scores of boutique options out there (to say nothing of streaming extensions of TV channels, like the Showtime and Starz apps), you begin to realize just how difficult it can be to figure out where to spend your streaming dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"pWhznE\">Allow us to help. Vox’s Culture writers have surveyed the eight biggest names in the game — Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV+, CBS All Access, Disney+, HBO Max, Hulu, Peacock, and Netflix — to determine the strengths and weaknesses of each one. If you’re a TV fan, some options will be better for you than others. The same is true if you’re a movie fan or someone who just likes to watch original programming. </p>\n<p id=\"Y83jhN\">We’ve done our best to assess who each service is “for,” and though we’re still in the early days of several of these services — HBO Max, for example, launched in late May, and Peacock just launched in July — it’s possible to see the outline of how the streaming battles will only intensify in the years to come. Read on for our rundown of which services you might find most appealing, depending on your personal viewing preferences. </p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"Red Netflix logo on a black background displayed on a phone.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g2W1Bc7ckHHfkHqHVPis-YbAb1Y=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20103704/1227670622.jpg.jpg\">\n      <cite>Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images</cite>\n  </figure>\n<h3 id=\"mWMT9l\"><a href=\"http://www.netflix.com/\">Netflix</a></h3>\n<p id=\"hgELHZ\"><strong>The basic setup: </strong>The heavy hitter, with a vast catalog of buzzy original content; movies and TV shows largely from the past few decades; and cinema and TV from around the world.</p>\n<p id=\"gBsHCx\"><strong>Originals: </strong>Though Netflix started out as a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2020/4/23/21230324/netflix-dvd-rental-classic-movies\">DVD-by-mail service</a> distributing other companies’ films, it’s really built its current<strong> </strong>business on its original content. And that content can be very good, extremely bad, or anywhere in between. But on the whole, its scale is impressive.</p>\n<p id=\"w5R5iN\">Netflix’s strong run of successful TV shows speaks for itself, starting with <em>House of Cards </em>in 2013 and expanding into shows that became so popular that you probably felt left out if you weren’t watching them: <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/orange-is-the-new-black\"><em>Orange Is the New Black</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2016/11/6/13515704/the-crown-review-netflix-queen-elizabeth-ii\"><em>The Crown</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/stranger-things\"><em>Stranger Things</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/7/22/16003944/ozark-review-netflix-jason-bateman\"><em>Ozark</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/6/24/15864284/netflix-glow-season-1-review-alison-brie\"><em>GLOW</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2015/11/8/9690904/master-of-none-netflix-review\"><em>Master of None</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/2/1/18205534/russian-doll-review-spoilers-netflix-natasha-lyonne-loop\"><em>Russian Doll</em></a>. Netflix also boasts successful docuseries, particularly true crime (<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/making-a-murderer\"><em>Making a Murderer</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2020/3/20/21187519/tiger-king-netflix-review\"><em>Tiger King</em></a>) and food-related (<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/11/20/18097588/salt-fat-acid-heat-netflix-best-tv-shows\"><em>Salt Fat Acid Heat</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2020/4/1/21202876/nailed-it-netflix-season-4-review\"><em>Nailed It!</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/5/28/11789324/chefs-table-netflix-season-two\"><em>Chef’s Table</em></a>) and stand-up comedy specials, the list of which is nearly endless. </p>\n<p id=\"nPNagc\">And while a lot of Netflix original films are thoroughly forgettable, it’s found a lot of success in a few genres, including <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/10/17/17989242/netflix-rom-com-summer-to-all-the-boys-ive-loved-before-set-it-up?__c=1\">romantic comedies</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/11/29/20976039/atlantics-netflix-review\">excellent foreign dramas</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/12/30/21042737/netflix-top-10-list-2019-adam-sandler-murder-mystery\">Adam Sandler movies</a> (yes, that’s a whole genre). The service’s documentary selection is pretty strong, often focusing on films with a socially or politically conscious angle (like <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/5/1/18522772/knock-down-house-netflix-streaming-review-aoc\"><em>Knock Down the House</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2017/10/26/18097767/15-best-documentaries-to-stream-right-now-strong-island\"><em>Strong Island</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/8/20/20812008/american-factory-review-netflix-dayton-china-obama\"><em>American Factory</em></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2020/1/24/21080170/crip-camp-review-netflix-streaming\"><em>Crip Camp</em></a>). Netflix has also converted more than a few A-list directors who might have been reticent to release their films primarily to a streaming service — like Martin Scorsese (<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/9/27/20887589/irishman-review-netflix-scorsese-deniro-pacino\"><em>The Irishman</em></a>), Noah Baumbach (<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/9/13/20864335/marriage-story-review-baumbach-driver-johansson\"><em>Marriage Story</em></a>), Tamara Jenkins (<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/1/26/16912914/private-life-review-netflix-tamara-jenkins-kathryn-hahn-paul-giamatti\"><em>Private Life</em></a>), and Alfonso Cuarón (<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/11/20/18102734/roma-review-netflix-cuaron\"><em>Roma</em></a>) — with its deep pockets and willingness to stay hands-off throughout the production process. </p>\n<p id=\"egZMrH\"><strong>Back catalog:</strong> Netflix’s back catalog is stronger in TV than in film. The service has some big-ticket shows — like <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2020/4/30/21239095/best-tv-shows-netflix-hulu-phone-streaming\"><em>Cheers</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/i-think-youre-interesting/2018/12/15/18141338/the-office-michael-schur-beginning-season-1\"><em>The Office</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/2/24/8100533/parks-and-recreation-obama\"><em>Parks and Recreation</em></a>,<em> </em><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2020/3/26/21194700/new-girl-netflix-zooey-deschanel-watch-review\"><em>New Girl</em></a>,<em> </em>and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/9/20/20873299/community-comedy-netflix-hulu-nbc-yahoo-jeff-winger-annie-troy-abed-britta-shirley-pierce\"><em>Community</em></a><em> </em>— as well as earlier seasons of shows that are currently airing (like <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/2/6/7992801/better-call-saul-review-amc\"><em>Better Call Saul</em></a>). You can watch everything from <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/5/19/15660502/twin-peaks-explained-showtime-david-lynch\"><em>Twin Peaks</em></a><em> </em>and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2014/10/22/7034073/five-scary-twilight-zone-episodes\"><em>The Twilight Zone</em></a><em> </em>to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2020/4/30/21239095/best-tv-shows-netflix-hulu-phone-streaming\"><em>The Andy Griffith Show</em></a> and <em>Thomas &amp; Friends </em>on Netflix. The service is also particularly good at distributing foreign TV shows (such as <em>Babylon Berlin</em>) and making them visible to an American audience, and vice versa for other markets. </p>\n<p id=\"WUVGji\">When it comes to films, though, Netflix heavily favors movies from about 1980 forward, with an emphasis on very recent films. (The “classics” section includes <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/7/1/8876073/back-to-the-future-anniversary-30\"><em>Back to the Future</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/2/2/10892054/groundhog-day-bill-murray-anniversary\"><em>Groundhog Day</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/6/11/11887708/ferris-buellers-day-off-30\"><em>Ferris Bueller’s Day Off</em></a>, and <em>Monty Python and the Holy Grail</em>, with a few older Westerns scattered throughout.) That’s good news if you just want to catch up on all the movies you’ve been meaning to see from the past few decades — you can watch <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/12/16/21012871/social-network-movie-facebook-zuckerberg-decade-2010s\"><em>The Social Network</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/4/24/17273954/avengers-infinity-war-review\"><em>Avengers: Infinity War</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/3/30/18286436/the-matrix-wachowskis-trans-experience-redpill\"><em>The Matrix</em></a><em>, </em>or <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/7/25/15985480/christopher-nolan-explained-dunkirk-inception-dark-knight\"><em>Inception</em></a> on Netflix right now — but less great if you’re exploring film history.  </p>\n<div id=\"nj2PaJ\"><iframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed-podcast/episode/65C3H1MkHOhAzlddXT2Mm6\" width=\"100%\" height=\"232\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"></iframe></div>\n<p id=\"GjeiQ0\"></p>\n<p id=\"xTP8dR\"><strong>The pros: </strong>Chances are, if you have any streaming subscriptions, you probably already have Netflix. But if you don’t, it’s worth checking out just to be in on the cultural conversation, and for the endless number of originals that are worth catching up on. Netflix also has a deep well of kid-friendly content.</p>\n<p id=\"GlaeTQ\"><strong>The cons: </strong>If you’re a film buff, Netflix’s selection can be infuriating, and it can be hard to find new releases that might interest you if you’re not paying close attention. Netflix also rarely produces commentaries or interviews related to its original movies and shows, which is disappointing if you’re looking to take a deep dive.</p>\n<p id=\"tu1BxJ\"><strong>Best for: </strong>Pretty much everyone: families, bored people, anyone who wants to get in on the Netflix original conversations, fans of bingeable TV shows, and movie lovers.</p>\n<p id=\"YsgJwT\"><strong>Cost: </strong>There are three tiers of Netflix subscriptions. <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/signup/planform\">$8.99 per month</a> will let you watch on one screen at a time in standard definition, and download some videos to one phone or tablet. For <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/signup/planform\">$12.99 per month</a>, you can watch on two screens simultaneously, in full HD in many cases, and download to two phones or tablets. <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/signup/planform\">$15.99 per month</a> bumps you up to four screens at once (handy if your whole family wants to watch different things), in full HD or ultra HD (4K), and download videos to four devices. You can also add a plan (<a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/signup/planform\">between $7.99 and $14.99 per month</a>, depending on the options you choose) to receive discs or Blu-ray by mail, which expands the back catalog capabilities considerably. <em>—Alissa Wilkinson</em></p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"A hand holding a smartphone with the Hulu logo on its screen.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TnLBCqF5ZdxQHavMGixmHnXzRhc=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20007585/1092262140.jpg.jpg\">\n      <cite>Chesnot via Getty Images</cite>\n  </figure>\n<h3 id=\"Q9z3Ff\"><a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;offerid=763711.10&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;u1=voxdotcom\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Hulu</a></h3>\n<p id=\"9Xt1q5\"><strong>The basic setup: </strong>The best streaming service for TV fans spent the first half of 2020 quietly getting even better.</p>\n<p id=\"T0ZpcZ\"><strong>Original programming: </strong>For years and years and years, Hulu existed in the shadows of Netflix and even Amazon Prime Video when it came to original TV series. Most of its efforts fizzled out, and even the occasional <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/10/8/9480809/casual-hulu-review\"><em>Casual</em></a> or <em>Difficult People</em> — good shows both — was more of a niche hit than anything else.</p>\n<p id=\"Lvvgc1\">Then came <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-handmaids-tale\"><em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em></a>. The massive hit, based on Margaret Atwood’s classic novel, debuted in 2017, won a whole mess of Emmys, and put Hulu’s original series on the map in a big way. Since then, not all of the service’s shows have been hits — its miniseries adaptation of <em>Catch-22</em> was an unfortunate miss — but it’s put out a surprisingly strong slate, including the winning teen comedy <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/2/8/18212017/hulu-pen15-review\"><em>PEN15</em></a>, the thoughtful slice-of-life series <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/5/1/18524448/best-tv-april-ramy-i-think-you-should-leave-fosse-verdon-game-of-thrones\"><em>Ramy</em></a>, and the gorgeously intricate adaptation of Sally Rooney’s novel <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2020/4/22/21229912/hulu-normal-people-review-tv-sally-rooney\"><em>Normal People</em></a>. And, honestly, that’s just for starters.</p>\n<p id=\"YtVbHl\">Beyond Hulu’s own originals, the service is also the streaming home of many of FX’s original series. When you consider that FX is perhaps second only to HBO in terms of creating tremendous television across literal decades of history, Hulu having so many FX shows becomes a huge notch in its favor. And recent FX series like <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/21265162/mrs-america-hulu-review-episode-8-houston-recap-fx-cate-blanchett\"><em>Mrs. America</em></a> and <em>Devs</em> were exclusive to “FX on Hulu”; because FX is still developing and making these shows, their quality can remain as consistent as FX’s shows traditionally have been, while airing on the more easily accessible Hulu platform.</p>\n<p id=\"r5HYaI\">Hulu also has a bunch of really great documentary films, many of which (like 2018’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/summer-movies/2018/8/17/17705484/minding-the-gap-interview-bing-liu-domestic-abuse-rockford-hulu\"><em>Minding the Gap</em></a>) are Hulu originals. The service doesn’t have the original film output of Netflix or Amazon, but it’s certainly no slouch, especially if you love nonfiction filmmaking.</p>\n<p id=\"Ut0eUv\"><strong>Back catalog: </strong>Hulu has long been the best streaming service for TV. It was started by two TV networks — NBC and Fox — and quickly brought in ABC as well. And though its roots in television are evident in some ways viewers may not always appreciate (its embrace of weekly episodic releases), those roots also mean it’s the one service that seems to place a huge premium on cultivating an extensive TV library.</p>\n<p id=\"UpcmfL\">Hulu has so many classic TV shows. Do you wanna watch <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/9/27/20884121/lost-watch-hulu-abc-island\"><em>Lost</em></a>? That’s here. How about <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/2/21/17018078/er-hulu-streaming-great-show\"><em>ER</em></a>? Yep. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/3/10/14807808/buffy-the-vampire-slayer-every-episode-ranked-20th-anniversary\"><em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em></a>? Of course! <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/12/1/9828370/designing-women-aids\"><em>Designing Women</em></a>? <em>Golden Girls</em>? <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2016/10/10/13227232/30-rock-top-5-episodes\"><em>30 Rock</em></a>? Yes, yes, and yes. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/1/28/18201305/bobs-burgers-best-tv-shows-fox\"><em>Bob’s Burgers</em></a>? Insert burger-related pun meaning “yes” here! To list all the classic TV shows available exclusively on Hulu would take up hundreds more words. Suffice to say, if you are a TV fan of long standing, Hulu is easily your best bet.</p>\n<p id=\"LG0KkM\">And, hey, if you just want to watch reruns of what’s on TV right now, Hulu is the best place for that, too, considering it’s got next-day reruns of most ABC, NBC, and Fox shows, along with several other series that don’t air on those networks. </p>\n<p id=\"AwUv7d\"><strong>The pros: </strong>In case I haven’t made it clear, Hulu is a wonderful place to watch great television, from the classics of the medium’s history to original series created by Hulu’s programming team to the many series created by the crack team at FX. Add to those the next-day reruns of some of the best broadcast TV shows and you have a service that, to my mind, is pretty unbeatable if you’re a TV fan.</p>\n<p id=\"moGUsX\">There’s less on Hulu for movie fans, but the service usually has a number of recent Hollywood hits, and its nonfiction offerings are considerable and diverse.</p>\n<p id=\"0Ri2b6\"><strong>The cons: </strong>If you don’t pay a few extra bucks for Hulu’s ad-free tier, the many, many ads are irritating, ubiquitous, and repetitive (as in you’ll see the same ad dozens of times during a <em>30 Rock</em> marathon). And, again, if you want to watch lots of movies, this probably won’t be the service for you. Finally, if you live anywhere but the US and a handful of other countries, you don’t have access to Hulu. It’s one of the services outlined in this story that isn’t global. </p>\n<p id=\"6s6o4F\">Also, Hulu recently became a subsidiary of Disney, instead of existing in the weird netherworld of being owned by several networks at the same time, as it had for most of its history. So far, it’s doing what it’s always done, but that might change as Disney asserts more control over the service. </p>\n<p id=\"5QQ7Oi\"><strong>Best for: </strong>Major TV fans.</p>\n<p id=\"fbDv5m\"><strong>Cost: </strong>Hulu Basic is <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;offerid=763711.10&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;u1=voxdotcom\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$5.99 per month</a>, but it has lots of ads. Hulu Premium is <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;offerid=763711.10&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;u1=voxdotcom\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$11.99 per month</a> and is worth it for the (almost) complete lack of ads. (A small handful of programs have one ad at the beginning and one ad at the end, due to old deals made with networks and studios.) Hulu also has two packages that offer live TV, for <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;offerid=763711.113&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;u1=voxdotcom\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$54.99 per month</a> on top of the Basic plan or <a href=\"https://signup.hulu.com/plans\">$60.99 </a><a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;offerid=763711.113&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;u1=voxdotcom\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">p</a><a href=\"https://signup.hulu.com/plans\">er month</a> on top of the Premium<strong> </strong>plan. (This could be a good way to get what amounts to a “cable subscription” alongside a streaming subscription.) Finally, a bundle including Hulu with ads, Disney+, and ESPN+ will run you <a href=\"https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/707630/9358?sharedid=voxdotcom\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$12.99 a month</a>.

The House that Bezos Built is able to funnel cash into producing a number of original TV series with heavy-hitter creative teams attached, and to acquire movies on the film festival circuit that will be contenders during awards season, making some corners of its library extra-compelling. </p>\n<p id=\"mKXNvm\">Among the shows Amazon has garnered attention for are <em>Transparent</em>, the identity-probing dramedy that was its first breakout hit; the 1950s-set period dramedy <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/11/30/16715280/marvelous-mrs-maisel-amazon-review\"><em>The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel</em></a>; and the irreverent, British dramedies <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/9/17/12934782/fleabag-review-amazon-season-one\"><em>Fleabag</em></a><em> </em>and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/4/10/11390840/catastrophe-amazon-season-two-recap-review\"><em>Catastrophe</em></a>. (There are theoretically other shows on Amazon that are just dramatic or just comedic and not both, but I’m hard-pressed to think of them.) </p>\n<p id=\"xk20vH\">Amazon’s also got a few high-profile nonfiction original series, like the Jordan Peele-produced docuseries about Lorena Bobbit and — on the other side of the spectrum — <em>Project Runway</em>’s heir apparent <em>Making the Cut</em>, co-hosted by Heidi Klum and Tim Gunn. (<em>The Grand Tour</em> from the <em>Top Gear</em> folks is another popular exclusive.) In the margins are perfectly fine shows that aren’t quite as much to write home about, from <em>Goliaths</em> and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/tv/2018/11/2/18046914/homecoming-amazon-julia-roberts-review\"><em>Homecoming</em></a> to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2014/12/29/7459811/mozart-jungle-review-amazon\"><em>Mozart in the Jungle</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2017/1/15/14239688/sneaky-pete-review-amazon\"><em>Sneaky Pete</em></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2020/4/28/21238252/upload-space-force-greg-daniels-interview-streaming-netflix-amazon\"><em>Upload</em></a>. </p>\n<p id=\"J0IraL\">On the movie side, recent awards contenders from Amazon Studios include <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2016/11/18/13641418/manchester-by-the-sea-review-casey-affleck-kenneth-lonergan-kyle-chandler\"><em>Manchester by the Sea</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/summer-movies/2017/6/21/15837678/big-sick-review-kumail-nanjiani-emily-gordon-zoe-kazan-islam\"><em>The Big Sick</em></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/9/7/20852678/honey-boy-review-shia-labeouf-lucas-hedges-noah-jupe\"><em>Honey Boy</em></a>. Amazon has also been theatrical distributor for several international and documentary films of note, like <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/10/22/13362998/the-handmaiden-review\"><em>The Handmaiden</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/conversations/2017/11/3/16601358/aiweiwei-artist-borders-human-flow-documentary\"><em>Human Flow</em></a>,<em> </em><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2017/10/26/18097639/15-best-documentaries-to-stream-right-now-i-am-not-your-negro-james-baldwin\"><em>I Am Not Your Negro</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/5/29/18633293/cannes-2019-best-movies-tarantino-parasite-lady-fire?utm_campaign=vox.social&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=sprout&amp;utm_content=1559158370\"><em>Les Miserables</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/8/9/20798812/one-child-nation-review\"><em>One Child Nation</em></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/1/28/14401542/the-salesman-movie-interview-asghar-farhadi\"><em>The Salesman</em></a> — all of which are well-regarded and very much fall into the “prestige” category, if that is important to you. </p>\n<p id=\"F0n6W8\"><strong>Back catalog: </strong>Here’s the thing: Amazon has a huge and varied library of TV and movies to rent or purchase à la carte — no subscription required. But if you’re an Amazon Prime member, a lot of that same content is available to stream for no additional cost.<em> </em><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/12/5/9851546/americas-next-top-model-series-finale-best-moments\"><em>America’s Next Top Model</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/3/28/15091874/bones-finale-recap-review\"><em>Bones</em></a>, <em>House</em>, <em>Law and Order: Special Victims Unit</em>, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/mr-robot\"><em>Mr. Robot</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/6/26/15845792/rupauls-drag-race-season-9-teen-fanbase\"><em>RuPaul’s Drag Race</em></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/5/1/18524161/spongebob-squarepants-anniversary-20-years-episodes\"><em>SpongeBob SquarePants</em></a> are some highlights that represent the breadth of TV shows on offer. There are also options to add on content from certain TV channels, like HBO and Nickelodeon, for an additional monthly cost. </p>\n<p id=\"Mie2kP\">Amazon has a decent collection of both older and newer films. You can stream <em>The Avengers</em> (the first one, that is), <em>Pretty in Pink</em>, and <em>Zombieland</em> with your Prime Video subscription, but you can also stream classics like <em>The Conversation</em>, <em>Roman Holiday</em>, and <em>Stop Making Sense</em> — relative oldies of the type that Netflix hasn’t shown much interest in for quite some time.</p>\n<p id=\"DFeSMr\"><strong>The pros: </strong>Amazon Prime Video’s movie library is easily the most impressive part of the service. It’s a great way to dip into the history of cinema, and there’s a good mix of acclaimed documentaries and international films too, many of which are hard to find on other services. That also goes for recent smaller releases — independent films you might have only learned about when they were nominated for a bunch of awards and have wanted to watch ever since. </p>\n<p id=\"HltkKI\">As for TV, when an Amazon original TV show is good, it’s really, really good. Like, you should probably watch <em>Fleabag</em> immediately if you haven’t yet. And the ability to add on content that is otherwise exclusive to other networks and streaming services (like CBS All Access, HBO, Showtime) is a nice flex.</p>\n<p id=\"ihVOD8\">One tiny feature that’s unique and fun: When you pause most shows or movies, a pop-up will show you who the actors are in the scene and the names of the characters they’re playing. Very helpful for anyone who’s always like, “Who’s that guy again?” a.k.a. all of us TV/movie nerds. </p>\n<p id=\"rtztnn\"><strong>The cons: </strong>The majority of Amazon’s third-party TV content — anything that isn’t an Amazon original series — is available to stream elsewhere, and other services sometimes have more episodes available of a given series than Prime does. (<em>SpongeBob</em>, however,<em> </em>is notably not streaming anywhere but Amazon.) The Prime interface is also pretty lousy if you want to watch anything that isn’t an Amazon-produced original series; it’s as if the platform intentionally discourages users from even trying to explore your options. </p>\n<p id=\"t7v5NF\">Additionally, rentable content is mixed in with streaming options, with only a small label delineating between what’s free for Amazon Prime members and what you have to pay extra for, even if you’re one of those members. There have been many times where I’ve been excited to see that a newish movie is available on Prime Video, only to find out that I have to rent it like any old plebe. </p>\n<p id=\"pG1aJF\">And since you can already rent or buy almost all TV shows and movies on Amazon (just like you can on services like iTunes and Vudu), it’s maybe not worth your while if you aren’t interested in the original programming  — especially if you’re averse to giving Amazon (and Jeff Bezos) any of your money. </p>\n<p id=\"yWsmK2\"><strong>Best for: </strong>People who already subscribe to Amazon Prime; fans of classic, independent, or international films. </p>\n<p id=\"y5ys3V\"><strong>Cost:</strong> <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2BdgJw2\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$12.99 per month ($119 per year)</a> for an Amazon Prime membership, which includes Prime Video; <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2BdgJw2\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$8.99 per month</a> for Prime Video alone. —<em>Allegra Frank</em></p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"HBO Max.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MVnr-9C61zlmGz4KQcMCFexoY1Y=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20007577/Screen_Shot_2020_05_28_at_4.30.44_PM.png\">\n      <cite>HBO</cite>\n  </figure>\n<h3 id=\"iqQtaB\">\n<a href=\"http://hbomax.com/\">HBO Max</a> (and the related HBO streaming platform, <a href=\"http://hbonow.com/\">HBO</a>)</h3>\n<p id=\"ubSErI\"><strong>The basic setup: </strong>You liked HBO? Here’s a product from mostly different people with HBO in the name!</p>\n<p id=\"aPwi4G\"><strong>Original programming: </strong><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/21267943/hbo-max-explained-hbo-hbo-go-hbo-now-friends\">HBO Max</a> is a “best of times, worst of times” kind of streaming service. As the streaming home of HBO television shows and movies, it’s the place to go to watch the network’s many, many great shows, from the upcoming <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/5/1/21244568/hbo-lovecraft-country-series-jordan-peele-trailer\"><em>Lovecraft Country</em></a> to the currently running (and quite good) obscurity <em>Betty</em>. HBO is one of the few networks actively making programming in other countries instead of just acquiring it from other countries (Netflix is kind of the only other service that produces its own non-English language series on a wide scale). It’s a regular player at the Emmys. It’s the home of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/9/24/20870750/succession-hbo-review-season-2-recap\"><em>Succession</em></a>, of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/3/23/17155658/barry-hbo-review-bill-hader\"><em>Barry</em></a>, of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/10/17/20918439/watchmen-hbo-review-damon-lindelof-regina-king-comic\"><em>Watchmen</em></a>, as well as a huge catalog of even older classic programs like <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2014/11/17/7234477/sopranos-streaming-one-episode\"><em>The Sopranos</em></a> and <em>The Wire</em>. HBO is perhaps the most prestigious name in American TV for a reason. </p>\n<p id=\"BOxsOh\">But HBO Max isn’t just HBO. If you just want HBO, you can subscribe to either the cable channel or its standalone streaming app, which is also called HBO. Both cost the same as HBO Max and feature less content. If you subscribe to HBO Max, you want all the other stuff, right?</p>\n<p id=\"ytNaxa\">Well, HBO Max has its own programming team. And once you get beyond the HBO catalog, HBO Max is a bit of a wasteland for original programming. There are some new Looney Tunes shorts. There’s <em>Love Life</em>, an Anna Kendrick rom-com TV series that is pretty mediocre. There’s a talk show featuring Elmo from <em>Sesame Street</em>. There’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/21270881/on-record-hbo-interview-drew-dixon-sherri-hines-sil-lai-abrams-russell-simmons\">a documentary about sexual misconduct allegations against Russell Simmons</a>. Eventually, there will be new seasons of the TBS black comedy <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/7/26/8930460/search-party-tbs-watch-this-streaming\"><em>Search Party</em></a>. There’s some reality show stuff.</p>\n<p id=\"pNtkC3\">And that’s ... kind of it. HBO Max has been hit hard by pandemic-related production shutdowns, so many of the original series it was going to roll out over the next several months have been put on hold, leaving the service almost entirely reliant on HBO to provide it with original programming. But this was supposed to be HBO <em>Max</em>. There was supposed to be other stuff! </p>\n<p id=\"96d2Pr\">Fortunately for all of us ...</p>\n<p id=\"BxEuxA\"><strong>Back catalog: </strong>Here is where HBO Max shines. The service boasts a huge collection of programming from the WarnerMedia library — including stuff from Warner Bros., HBO, and the Turner cable networks (among others). It also offers a whole bunch of programming licensed from other studios. (Curiously, HBO Max seems to have a lot of movies owned by Disney in its library.)</p>\n<p id=\"LUbKeN\">Most notable for many customers will be <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/9/20/20875107/friends-25th-anniversary-polarizing-legacy-homophobia\"><em>Friends</em></a>, which is now exclusively available to stream on HBO Max. But if you’re a fan of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/5/15/18623229/big-bang-theory-series-finale-explained-review-recap?utm_campaign=vox&amp;utm_content=chorus&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter\"><em>The</em> <em>Big Bang Theory</em></a>, it’s here. So is Adult Swim’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/7/26/9039013/rick-and-morty-review-season-2\"><em>Rick and Morty</em></a>. So is <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/11/20/18097564/doctor-who-bbc-america-best-tv-shows\"><em>Doctor Who</em></a>. So is the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/21263805/studio-ghibli-miyazaki-films-streaming-hbo-max-how-to-watch-princess-mononoke\">Studio Ghibli catalog</a> (<em>Spirited Away</em>, <em>My Neighbor Totoro</em>, etc.). So is a curated list of titles from the Turner Classic Movies library (something that will instantly put HBO Max leaps and bounds ahead of most other streaming services, which too often ignore classic film fans). So are dozens upon dozens of other titles. If you are primarily interested in streaming services for their back catalogs, HBO Max might be your best bet.</p>\n<p id=\"nBBe8i\"><strong>The pros: </strong>Hey, guess what, HBO is still a programming powerhouse, and HBO Max having the complete HBO library is a powerful argument in its favor if you’re not already subscribed to one HBO service or another. But even beyond HBO programming, HBO Max’s massive catalog of iconic titles from TV and film is going to look mighty tempting even before you factor in that HBO Max lured Studio Ghibli onto streaming (something that seemed incredibly unlikely to ever happen right up until HBO Max made it happen). The Studio Ghibli films and the Turner Classic Movies library will be more than enough for many film fans. The TV offerings (outside of HBO) aren’t as extensive, but <em>Friends</em> alone will be a huge reason to subscribe for many.</p>\n<p id=\"uTJSs7\"><strong>The cons: </strong>HBO Max, at least in the early going, is incredibly hard to discover programming on, either surfacing too few titles onto its main screens or making you scroll through endless alphabetical lists to find something you want to watch. If you want to watch brand new, original programming, that’s going to be a slower ramp-up than HBO Max probably expected. And it stinks that the vast, incredible TCM library is only going to be available to subscribers a few films at a time. (Seriously, what would it hurt to put all of those movies up at once?) Finally, if you’re currently an HBO cable channel or HBO app subscriber, it could be trickier than you’d want to upgrade to HBO Max (though you probably should), depending on where you subscribe. </p>\n<p id=\"vtcibb\"><strong>Best for: </strong>Big-time movie fans; people who instinctively start humming the <em>Sopranos</em> theme after hearing the “AHHHHH” over the HBO logo; anybody who wants to watch an Elmo talk show.</p>\n<p id=\"KwHRgU\"><strong>Cost: </strong><a href=\"https://www.hbomax.com/subscribe\">$14.99 per month</a>, though there may be numerous deals available depending on your cable provider. (If you’re already an HBO subscriber, you might already be rolled over to HBO Max automatically. You should check!) <em>—EV</em></p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"a cellphone screen displaying the Disney+ logo.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eEyPJ2HOMkCg2DkkyPo_Y9Q5zFE=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20007539/1215460359.jpg.jpg\">\n      <cite>Martin Bureau/AFP via Getty Images</cite>\n  </figure>\n<h3 id=\"9z5ekF\"><a href=\"http://disneyplus.com/\">Disney+</a></h3>\n<p id=\"knPeem\"><strong>The basic setup: </strong>The entire House of Mouse all under a single roof, from animated masterpieces to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/6/27/18715845/pixar-movies-rankings\">Pixar’s modern classics</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/star-wars\">Star Wars</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/marvel\">Marvel</a> Cinematic Universes, the Disney Channel TV library, National Geographic shows and documentaries, and 1950s and 1960s live-action movies you’ve never heard of. </p>\n<p id=\"kZbRvZ\"><strong>Original programming: </strong>Meager. The original programming on Disney+ mostly consists of TV series based on popular Disney-owned properties: Star Wars spinoff <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/11/12/20961484/mandalorian-star-wars-disney-plus-review-pedro-pascal\"><em>The Mandalorian</em></a>; planned shows centered on <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/2/2/21119571/falcon-winter-soldier-wandavision-loki-disney-plus-trailer\">Marvel characters like Captain America’s sidekicks Falcon and Winter Soldier</a>; and the very meta <em>High School Musical: The Musical: The Series. </em>There are also documentary series like <em>Encore!</em>, where adults return to their high school days to re-stage musicals they performed as teenagers; <em>The Imagineering Story</em>, focused on the people who work on the various rides and attractions at Disney theme parks; and various shows about nature and wildlife. Additionally, there’s a small slate of family-friendly original movies, including YA novel adaptations (<em>Stargirl</em>) and live-action remakes of classic animated films (<em>Lady and the Tramp</em>). But if you’re not already steeped in the world of all things Disney (and Marvel, Star Wars, and Pixar), none of these original shows or films will be very accessible, and there aren’t many more options.</p>\n<p id=\"6bBm4h\"><strong>Back catalog:</strong> Extensive. Disney+ is the only place where you can watch <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/11/12/20960187/disney-plus-lineup-movies-tv-shows-launch-cult-classics\">nearly every single animated and live-action film</a> by Disney or one of the major movie studios it owns, from the iconic (the entire <em>Star Wars</em> film franchise! All the Disney animated classics from its late-’80s-to-mid-’90s golden age!) to the obscure (<a href=\"https://collider.com/weirdest-movies-on-disney-plus/#hatching-pete\">what the heck is <em>Fuzzbucket</em></a>?). It also boasts a large number of Disney Channel TV shows and movies. And then on top of that there are the entire Pixar, Star Wars, and Marvel libraries (<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/12/20956671/disney-plus-marvel-spider-man-tom-holland-avengers-endgame-netflix-fox-xmen\">except for Sony-owned Spider-Man</a>), plus a whole slew of content from National Geographic. Oh, and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2016/10/16/13282672/the-simpsons-600-episodes-treehouse-of-horror-fox\">every season of <em>The Simpsons</em></a>, thanks to Disney’s acquisition of Fox in 2019.</p>\n<p id=\"P8A94Z\"><strong>The pros: </strong>If you’ve got kids or are a nostalgic fan of the House of Mouse, the overwhelming amount of Disney animated classics will certainly appeal. Same goes for the Disney Channel movies, if you were young and obsessed with them during the 2000s. And the Star Wars, Pixar, and Marvel movies are obviously big sells if they align with your personal preferences and fandoms. <em>The Mandalorian</em> is a lot of fun, and it gave the internet <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/11/23/20972511/baby-yoda-meme-the-mandalorian-gif-star-wars\">its lord and savior Baby Yoda</a>; meanwhile, the upcoming Marvel TV shows look promising.</p>\n<p id=\"R145ir\">But for me, what Disney+ is best for is endlessly watching episodes of <em>The Simpsons</em>. That show is the one thing on the subscription service that infinitely rewards rewatching, and it’s easy to put on any ol’ season and just leave it running for the rest of the day. (And I’m so grateful that the original 4:3 aspect ratio is now available.)</p>\n<p id=\"bEsuMn\"><strong>The cons:</strong> My biggest complaint about Disney+ is that its biggest sell is its library of things you probably have already seen 100 times. I love <em>The Lion King</em> — I used to watch it every day after school — and it’s nice to have it easily accessible, just as a comforting presence. But at age 26, I have few plans to watch that movie again any time soon, and the same is true for all the other Disney movies I love.</p>\n<p id=\"qZ2gS4\">None of the originals available right now merit a monthly Disney+ subscription on their own, and the upcoming shows and films that Disney has announced thus far will only boost the unique content on the platform by a smidgen.</p>\n<p id=\"FhLmrh\">With that said, I’m a childless 20-something — not the ideal Disney+ subscriber, based on what’s on offer right now. It is families who ultimately stand to gain the most from a Disney+ subscription. Most kids have gone at least partway down the Mickey Mouse-shaped rabbit hole in our Disneyfied world, through branded everyday merchandise, Disney pop stars, and the ubiquity of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/11/21/20966943/frozen-2-review-disney-nostalgia-madeleine\"><em>Frozen</em></a>. And even though the desire to watch and rewatch the same stuff is an ageless one, kids tend to have more patience and interest in repeat <em>Toy Story 4 </em>viewings any day of the week.</p>\n<p id=\"KCsLZd\"><strong>Best for: </strong>Families who are (re)discovering the classic Disney movie canon, or Star Wars/Marvel fans who like to pick apart the movies on a regular basis. Also: Fans of <em>The Simpsons.</em></p>\n<p id=\"wGA6s2\"><strong>Cost:</strong> <a href=\"https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/707638/9358?sharedid=voxdotcom\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$6.99 per month or $69.99 per year</a>.

Guess what! There’s a streaming service for that!</p>\n<p id=\"nEpfiM\"><strong>Original programming: </strong>Peacock’s closest comparison point might be HBO Max. In the same way that HBO Max is the streaming home of WarnerMedia’s vast archives, Peacock exists mostly to leverage programming from the enormous NBCUniversal back catalog. It boasts tons of famous comedies and dramas (including endlessly rewatchable mystery shows like <em>Murder She Wrote</em> and <em>Columbo</em>), and in 2021, it will become the exclusive home to <em>The Office</em>, which has been a big draw on Netflix.</p>\n<p id=\"I5P9L2\">Also like HBO Max, Peacock’s creation of original programming has been hindered by the production shutdown spurred by Covid-19. So when the service launched on July 15, it offered only a handful of original shows.</p>\n<p id=\"Ye35mg\">And those original shows are ... fine? The service (for me, at least) has been a bit glitchy, with those glitches predominantly hitting the original programming, which doesn’t make for a particularly smooth viewing experience. But even under perfect conditions, I can’t imagine I’d be too taken with Peacock’s reimagining of Aldous Huxley’s <em>Brave New World</em> for the Instagram filter era (the new series updates the original text just enough to be frustrating when it keeps lots of other elements from it that feel vaguely nonsensical in 2020, like a terror at the idea of monogamy being outlawed) or the pleasant but unremarkable comedy <em>Intelligence</em>.</p>\n<p id=\"u6ofGk\">Peacock has also launched with a handful of nonfiction programs, in particular a documentary series starring Ryan Lochte that seems as though it was designed to benefit from an Olympics boost that won’t materialize with the games postponed to 2021. (Every streaming service has had production plans thrown into disarray by the pandemic; only Peacock seems to have lost an entire cornerstone of its launch strategy, which was planned to revolve around the Olympics.)</p>\n<p id=\"2AwOZD\">But one of the real reasons to check out original programming on Peacock is to find the ways it replicates just ... watching TV. The service has multiple channels for NBC’s news and sports and late-night programming, and you can just sit there and watch them stream by, as if you were watching regular old TV. It’s not a particularly revolutionary idea, but it’s well handled, and I expect it to become a bigger staple of Peacock in the future. It’s at least a new (old) idea for a streaming service.</p>\n<p id=\"nsLrm8\"><strong>Back catalog: </strong>As with HBO Max, Peacock has a really extensive array of TV shows and films, many of which are beloved for one reason or another. If you adore classic NBC comedies like <em>Parks and Recreation</em>, <em>30 Rock</em>, and <em>Cheers</em>, they’re all here. (Though if you want to watch <em>Friends</em>, <em>Seinfeld</em>, or <em>Community</em>, they’re all on different streaming services.) There are plenty of terrific dramas available, too, like the aforementioned <em>Columbo</em>, which is perhaps the best detective drama ever made, and the ever-amazing <em>Battlestar Galactica</em> remake from the 2000s.</p>\n<p id=\"147TJK\">But Peacock’s back catalog is ... patchier. Many of the shows most strongly associated with NBC (like, again, <em>Friends</em>) are actually owned by other companies with their own streaming services (in this case, WarnerMedia and HBO Max), which means they aren’t streaming on Peacock. At present, the service has <em>way</em> too many one-season flop series, few of which fall into the “one-season wonder” category.</p>\n<p id=\"i0H27c\">Movie-wise, the platform is slightly more exciting, with plenty of famous Universal horror films from the 1930s and ’40s (like <em>Bride of Frankenstein</em>) and a variety of more modern hits, including the first three <em>Jurassic Park</em> movies. Its offerings aren’t <em>as</em> extensive as those in the HBO Max catalog, but there’s plenty to watch all the same.</p>\n<p id=\"4A3gGS\"><strong>The pros: </strong>The attempt to turn a streaming service into a collection of traditional TV networks is a smart idea, executed (mostly) well, and it feels like a good way to get around the fact that having too many <em>choices</em> can make it hard for viewers to just pick something to watch already. The more these channels are programmed by folks who have cool and idiosyncratic ideas of how to use the NBCUniversal catalog to showcase cool stuff, the more they’ll become their best selves.</p>\n<p id=\"taL24C\">The other big pro is that Peacock has three separate tiers — a completely free tier with copious ads, a mid-budget tier with a few ads, and an expensive tier with no ads. The “free tier” option feels like a potential game changer to me, if Peacock can nail the mix of ads to programming and particularly if it can sell enough ads to not have to air the same five or six over and over and over again, a problem that bedevils other ad-supported streaming services.</p>\n<p id=\"CBv4rw\">(I should note that not all of Peacock’s programming is available as part of the free tier, but most of it seems to be.)</p>\n<p id=\"lW56J1\"><strong>The cons: </strong>Peacock’s library just isn’t there yet. There’s a ton of good stuff, but when you actually start digging through it, there’s not as <em>much</em> good stuff as there is on HBO Max, Hulu, or Netflix. Still, with a free tier available, it’s worth perusing from time to time as the service continues to add programming. In some ways, Peacock’s 2020 launch feels like a prelude to when the service gains exclusive rights to <em>The Office</em>, at which point it will hopefully have its feet under it.</p>\n<p id=\"9zYu0B\"><strong>Best for: </strong>People for whom the phrase “must-see TV” spurs contented sighs.</p>\n<p id=\"jE80zr\"><strong>Cost: </strong>The baseline plan is completely free. The mid-tier plan is $4.99 a month. The most expensive plan is $9.99 a month. (According to Peacock, the most expensive tier does contain ads in a few programs due to streaming deals that are specific to those programs, but I have yet to encounter any.) <em>—EV</em></p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"Apple TV+ logo.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CV96YYB959DtJkiNk_xqqmydb9A=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20007496/apple_tv_plus.jpg\">\n      <cite>Apple</cite>\n  </figure>\n<h3 id=\"Nbs49o\"><a href=\"http://tv.apple.com\">Apple TV+ </a></h3>\n<p id=\"BNkWjX\"><strong>The basic setup:</strong> Apple’s tentative foray into the streaming world, sort of confusingly named after its set-top box.</p>\n<p id=\"SrDggZ\"><strong>Original programming:</strong> Apple TV+ is an interesting case in that almost all of its content is original and exclusive. Not that there’s much of it available: Apple TV+ only has <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/10/31/20938996/apple-tv-plus-review-the-morning-show-see-dickinson-for-all-mankind-the-elephant-queen\">about 25 shows on offer</a>. Most of those are adult-oriented and totally melodramatic, like Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon’s over-the-top, inside-TV-baseball thriller <em>The Morning Show</em> and Chris Evans’s <em>Defending Jacob</em>, a maudlin adaptation of a popular crime novel. (There’s also Jason Momoa’s wretched <em>See, </em>an expensive fantasy show gunning for the title of “the next <em>Game of Thrones</em>” with zero success.) </p>\n<p id=\"bXgddi\">The comedies fare much better. <em>Dickinson</em> is a funny and affecting standout, with Hailee Steinfeld as a teen Emily Dickinson in a fun mashup of 19th-century life with contemporary style. The anthology series <em>Little America</em>, from Kumail Nanjiani and Emily V. Gordon, has also been widely well-received. (Disclosure: <em>Little America</em> is co-produced by Epic, which is owned by Vox Media.) And the newest addition is <em>Central Park</em>, a musical-comedy cartoon from the <em>Bob’s Burgers</em> crew that seems pretty dang delightful. </p>\n<p id=\"JIDEUW\">Otherwise, there are a few shows for kids, like a <em>Sesame Street</em> spinoff focused on STEM and a reboot of Jim Henson’s <em>Fraggle Rock </em>series. <em>Oprah’s Book Club</em> is also a monthly show. </p>\n<p id=\"PfVTzj\"><strong>Back catalog:</strong> There isn’t one. Well, except for the entire run of <em>Fraggle Rock</em>, from the show’s HBO days. The original series ran for five seasons and 96 episodes — more than half the number of episodes of all of Apple’s original shows combined. (The Apple TV+ app does give you access to rentals via iTunes, but that doesn’t require a subscription.)</p>\n<p id=\"ncB0H7\"><strong>The pros:</strong> The comedies are genuinely entertaining, even provocative. If it were on any other platform, <em>Dickinson</em> would likely be a huge hit, especially with the Tumblr teens. Same goes for<em> Little America</em>, a critically beloved show that’s held back by its very restrictive and unexciting platform. </p>\n<p id=\"iHpq2U\">Also, the Apple TV+ website and app are both very pretty, if that matters to you.</p>\n<p id=\"BYkZ07\"><strong>The cons: </strong>Apple TV+ suffers from the biggest issue a streaming service can have: There’s not much to watch. Once you finish the few gems, that’s it. Nothing on Apple TV+ is made for rewatching, especially since so much of what’s there is heavy drama. And without any ol’ TV standbys to tune into when you’re content-starved, there’s no reason to visit Apple TV+ on a regular basis.<strong> </strong>For the most part, Apple is riding on name recognition and the fallacy that “prestige” drama automatically equals good drama. (It does not.)</p>\n<p id=\"WouDNS\"><strong>Best for:</strong> The Apple faithful, especially since any new Apple device purchase currently includes a free one-year subscription to Apple TV+. That means tons of people are eligible to at least try out the service for a while. </p>\n<p id=\"vmnLn0\"><strong>Cost:</strong> <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1516588&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fapple-tv-plus%2F&amp;referrer=vox.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vox.com%2Fculture%2F2020%2F5%2F29%2F21263715%2Fhbo-max-peacock-netflix-hulu-disney-plus-amazon-apple-cbs-all-access-streaming-service-guide\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$4.99 per month, or $49.99 per year</a>.

Also: football.</p>\n<p id=\"i7G8OI\"><strong>Original programming:</strong> There’s a small selection of decent originals on CBS All Access — 12 in total, which might sound paltry to Amazon Prime, Hulu, or Netflix subscribers. The most eye-catching shows are either revivals or spinoffs of popular franchises: A remake of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/4/3/18290709/twilight-zone-review-recap-jordan-peele-explained-cbs-all-access\"><em>The Twilight Zone</em></a><em> </em>(with Jordan Peele as executive producer); <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/5/5/21241559/good-fight-season-4-review-recap\"><em>The Good Fight</em></a>, a spinoff of CBS’s beloved <em>The Good Wife</em>; <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/2/11/16994072/star-trek-discovery-finale-recap-will-you-take-my-hand\"><em>Star Trek: Discovery</em></a>; and <em>Star Trek: Picard</em>. Each of those shows has some scintillating buzz, like Peele’s name or the return of Patrick Stewart as Captain Jean-Luc Picard, or a built-in fanbase — as a <em>Good Wife</em> fan, I would probably subscribe to CBS All Access for <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/5/5/21241559/good-fight-season-4-review-recap\"><em>The Good Fight</em></a> alone.</p>\n<p id=\"M3LUR4\">A pretty entertaining show that slinks by without as much fanfare is Marc Cherry’s <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2019/08/why-women-kill-review-cbs-all-access.html\"><em>Why Women Kill</em></a>. It’s a murder mystery wrapped in camp,  with delectable costumes and an absolutely wild turn from Lucy Liu as ’80s socialite Simone, a performance that’s essentially Joan Collins-style drag. Cherry, known for creating <em>Desperate Housewives</em>, taps into his earlier show’s same spirit of unsatisfied women living secret lives (and some resorting to murder to escape them) — but with less restraint.</p>\n<p id=\"1BSgoB\"><strong>Back catalog: </strong>I’ve gotten to the point in the coronavirus quarantine where I’ll watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u-xmuj_XJ8\">Parvati’s blindside of J.T.</a> on <em>Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains </em>(season 20, which aired in 2010) over and over again, just to feel something. And if you, like me, feel a strong loyalty toward <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/10/14/17968430/survivor-season-37-episode-3-recap-review\"><em>Survivor</em></a><em>, </em>its 40 seasons, and its more than 550 contestants to date, you could lose yourself in the S<em>urvivor</em> catalog alone.</p>\n<p id=\"xZsQ8Y\">Keeping in the reality television vein, the streaming platform has 746 episodes of <em>Big Brother</em> and 122 episodes of <em>Undercover Boss</em>.</p>\n<p id=\"HBSy9S\">Notably missing are episodes of <em>The Amazing Race. </em>All Access doesn’t have full episodes of the show<strong>,</strong> while <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/The-Amazing-Race-Season-29/dp/B06XY2YKGP\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon Prime</a> has seasons 1 through 29. If you’re a fan of CBS scripted series like <em>The Big Bang Theory</em> or <em>CSI</em>, you’ll also be disappointed to learn that, while originally airing on CBS, neither show is available in its entirety on All Access (<em>CSI</em> has three seasons available; <em>The Big Bang Theory </em><a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/big-bang-theory-sets-staggering-multi-billion-dollar-hbo-max-streaming-deal-1240250\">will stream exclusively on HBO Max</a> instead). The beloved comedy <em>How I Met Your Mother </em>is also notably absent.</p>\n<p id=\"SeaDKi\">All Access also has a random but enjoyable assortment of movies available to stream, ranging from <em>A Clockwork Orange</em> to <em>A League of Their Own,</em> <em>Gattaca,</em> all three <em>Godfather</em> movies, and <em>Save the Last Dance 2</em>.</p>\n<p id=\"LjT2YV\"><strong>The pros: </strong>If you’re a fan of <em>Survivor</em>, <em>Big Brother</em>, <em>Star Trek</em>, <em>The Twilight Zone</em>, or the work of the showrunner duo known as the Kings (Robert and Michelle King) like<em> The Good Fight</em> and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/10/25/20926068/evil-season-1-episode-5-october-31-recap-cbs-halloween\"><em>Evil</em></a>, you can absolutely not go wrong with CBS All Access. The back catalog for most of the network’s TV titles is also extensive.</p>\n<p id=\"QTAja2\">Fans of sports, those fun athletic events canceled before the pandemic hit, can stream every NFL game once those return, whenever that may be. CBS All Access also grants viewers live access to awards shows that air on CBS, like the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1516588&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbs.com%2Fshows%2Fspecials%2F&amp;referrer=vox.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vox.com%2Fculture%2F2020%2F5%2F29%2F21263715%2Fhbo-max-peacock-netflix-hulu-disney-plus-amazon-apple-cbs-all-access-streaming-service-guide\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Grammys</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.tonyawards.com/news/date-set-2020-tony-awards-june-7-cbs/\">Tonys</a>. </p>\n<p id=\"huEMIq\">There’s also a lot more content — <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/7/21250402/cbs-all-access-relaunch-streaming-viacom-nickelodeon-mtv-sports-news\">30,000 episodes’ worth</a> — to look forward to in the future, as the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/8/12/20802777/cbs-viacom-merger-plan-explained-streaming-discovery-amc-starz-apple-netflix-hbo\">CBS-Viacom merger</a> will eventually bring shows from Nickelodeon, MTV, BET, Comedy Central, and the Smithsonian Channel to the platform.</p>\n<p id=\"jSIcYW\">Finally, there’s a slew of classic television series available including <em>I Love Lucy</em>, <em>Perry Mason</em>, and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/5/19/15660502/twin-peaks-explained-showtime-david-lynch\"><em>Twin Peaks</em></a>. <em>7th Heaven</em> (which started in 1996) and <em>JAG</em> (1995) also appear in the classics section, presumably to remind us we are all constantly aging.</p>\n<p id=\"MgCKcS\"><strong>The cons: </strong>Because CBS sold the streaming rights to some of its biggest shows, signature CBS stuff like <em>The Big Bang Theory</em>, <em>How I Met Your Mother</em>, the full series of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/5/14/8606919/csi-canceled-cancellation-finale\"><em>CSI</em></a>, and<em> </em><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/3/19/11587100/behind-the-scenes-of-the-amazing-race-and-its-social-media-star-season\"><em>The Amazing Race</em></a> won’t be found on CBS All Access.</p>\n<p id=\"4dKNwF\">And given that the platform is so CBS-specific, there’s not a huge variety of non-CBS shows or tons of original programming like there is on Netflix or Hulu. If you aren’t already a fan of CBS shows or <em>Star Trek</em>, you may not be swayed by the current catalog. You might be better served by waiting for its expanded catalog — shows from all those Viacom networks — to kick in (<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/a-rebranded-and-updated-version-of-cbs-all-access-will-launch-this-summer/\">reportedly by this summer</a>), or by using CBS All Access as a supplement to another platform.</p>\n<p id=\"LAptKs\"><strong>Best for:</strong> CBS and classic TV diehards who are overwhelmed by the constant influx of new, exclusive content released on platforms like Netflix and Hulu.

The coronavirus is spreading rapidly through the Rio Grande Valley in Texas. | Carolyn Cole/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images</small>\n\n  <p>With daily cases, hospitalizations, and deaths still on the rise, the coronavirus pandemic is not slowing down in the US.</p> <p id=\"LnMH5E\">More Americans are currently hospitalized with <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/coronavirus-covid19\">Covid-19</a> than at almost any other point in the pandemic, a grim indicator that the coronavirus pandemic is not slowing down in the US.</p>\n<p id=\"UHAyxD\">On July 22, 59,628 people across the United States were in the hospital after testing positive for the novel coronavirus, according to data reported as of July 23 by the <a href=\"https://covidtracking.com/\">Covid Tracking Project</a>; a peak of 59,539 was reached on April 15, when the New York City area was the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/coronavirus-covid19/2020/3/27/21195162/new-york-coronavirus-news-andrew-cuomo-hospitals-population-ventilators\">epicenter</a> of the US outbreak.<strong> </strong>(As the Covid Tracking Project <a href=\"https://covidtracking.com/blog/erratic-hospital-numbers-deaths-still-rising-this-week-in-covid-19-data-july\">notes</a>, the national and state hospital data are erratic and incomplete at the moment, and reported totals may continue to shift.)</p>\n<p id=\"Niw9cj\">What’s clear is that Covid-19 has migrated across the country to many more regions in the three months since. In the spring, hospitalizations were overwhelmingly concentrated in the Northeast, but now more than half of hospitalized Covid-19 patients are in the South. The West has also seen the number of hospitalized Covid-19 patients double since April, while the Northeast now accounts for fewer than 5,000 of the nearly 60,000 current hospitalizations.</p>\n<p id=\"dU1aai\">The current total is likely an undercount. Two states, Kansas and Hawaii, do not report current hospitalization data, and some states may temporarily <a href=\"https://covidtracking.com/blog/erratic-hospital-numbers-deaths-still-rising-this-week-in-covid-19-data-july\">not be reporting full hospitalization numbers</a> because of a <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/22/us-hospitals-scramble-to-adopt-new-hhs-coronavirus-data-system-some-states-see-data-blackout.html\">recent change in the reporting system</a> ordered by the Trump administration.</p>\n<p id=\"anMeIe\">“The hospitalization number is the best indicator of where we are,” Eric Topol, a professor of molecular medicine and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, told Vox. “We’re going to go to new heights in the pandemic that we haven’t seen before. Not that what we saw before wasn’t horrifying enough.”</p>\n<p id=\"9QtcXL\">The growth has been driven by accelerating spread in <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/7/8/21311347/arizona-coronavirus-pandemic-covid-outbreak\">Arizona</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/7/6/21308351/california-coronavirus-pandemic-covid-outbreak\">California</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/7/17/21324398/florida-coronavirus-covid-cases-deaths-outbreak\">Florida</a>, Georgia, and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/covid-19-coronavirus-us-response-trump/21326204/texas-coronavirus-rio-grande-houston\">Texas</a> in particular. On April 15, when New York City hospitals were nearly being overrun with Covid-19 patients, Texas had about 1,500 patients hospitalized with the disease. Today, more than 10,000 Texans are hospitalized with Covid-19.</p>\n<p id=\"2080QH\">Some areas are reaching a woeful tipping point of hospitals stretched to maximum capacity, scrambling to find beds in other facilities for Covid-19 patients. Miami-Dade County <a href=\"https://www.miamidade.gov/information/library/2020-07-20-new-normal-dashboard.pdf\">reported this week</a> that the number of patients in need of ICU care had exceeded the number of available ICU beds. More than 50 hospitals across the state say they have no ICU beds available. </p>\n<p id=\"6XU1Th\">Texas Medical Center in Houston <a href=\"https://www.tmc.edu/coronavirus-updates/overview-of-tmc-icu-bed-capacity-and-occupancy/\">has already filled up</a> its usual non-pandemic ICU unit and been forced to rely on its surge capacity plans to handle the patient load. Earlier this month, 10 out of the 12 hospitals in the Rio Grande Valley <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2020/07/04/texas-coronavirus-rio-grande-valley-hospitals/\">reported</a> that they were completely full and needed to start transferring patients to hospitals elsewhere in the state.</p>\n<aside id=\"wmfmCD\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Just 3 states meet these basic criteria to reopen and stay safe\",\"url\":\"https://www.vox.com/2020/5/28/21270515/coronavirus-covid-reopen-economy-social-distancing-states-map-data\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"oXsZU3\">This was, unfortunately, to be expected. Nearly all of the states currently experiencing an increase in new cases and hospitalizations started relaxing their social distancing restrictions in May and June before meeting the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/5/28/21270515/coronavirus-covid-reopen-economy-social-distancing-states-map-data\">government’s reopening guidelines</a> of having sufficiently reduced the virus’s spread and adequately ramped up their testing and tracing capabilities. New cases began rising and hospitalizations followed a few weeks after that. Now deaths are ticking up again, reversing a steady decline that had begun in early May.</p>\n<p id=\"EzJE5v\">Four million Americans have had confirmed cases of Covid-19. More than 143,000 of them have died. With hospitalizations surging and several states still reporting thousands of new cases a day, experts say we are in for a difficult August and fall. </p>\n<p id=\"ACSe0Y\">“We’ve still got 91 to 92 percent of people who are still vulnerable, who have not been infected,” said Topol. “And so that just shows how many more people can be hurt. Obviously many won’t get so sick, but many will.”</p>\n<p id=\"pS7E2Y\">The new hospitalizations, and the untenable pressure they’re putting on the health care system, are also a reminder of how critical it is for states to implement and enforce measures like <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/21299527/masks-coronavirus-covid-19-studies-research-evidence\">mandatory face masks</a>, and for the federal government to solve <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/7/10/21317860/coronavirus-testing-problems-delays-shortages-covid\">testing</a> and contact tracing problems. “It should be an all-points bulletin to really bear down on this because otherwise there’s no limit on where this might go,” said Topol.</p>\n<h3 id=\"LVRp2I\">Hospitals are running out of staff, supplies, and beds for Covid-19 patients</h3>\n<p id=\"HwH5Be\">Hospitals in hot spots across the country are expanding and even maxing out their staff, equipment, and beds, with doctors warning that the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/3/10/21171481/coronavirus-us-cases-quarantine-cancellation\">worst-case scenario</a> of hospital resources being overwhelmed is on the horizon if their states don’t get better control of the coronavirus.</p>\n<p id=\"HdnmOW\">“With Covid, a lot of times people who aren’t sick enough yet get pushed to the back, and then they can become really, really sick unfortunately because we were focusing our efforts on the people who are on the brink of death,” an emergency room doctor at the Banner Health system in the Phoenix metro area, who asked to go unnamed fearing retaliation from his employer, told Vox recently.</p>\n<p id=\"4PfDS7\">Other doctors in Arizona, where <a href=\"https://www.azdhs.gov/preparedness/epidemiology-disease-control/infectious-disease-epidemiology/covid-19/dashboards/index.php\">85 percent of hospital beds statewide were in use</a> as of Thursday, have said the scarcity of resources means they’ll soon be <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/coronavirus-covid19/2020/3/31/21199721/coronavirus-covid-19-hospitals-triage-rationing-italy-new-york\">rationing medical care</a>, as doctors in Italy <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/radio/day6/covid-19-in-italy-sports-season-shutdown-re-reviewing-contagion-comedian-mae-martin-more-1.5495224/covid-19-forces-italian-doctors-to-make-life-and-death-choices-about-rationing-care-1.5495232\">were forced to do</a>.  </p>\n<p id=\"ncqJu8\">“The fear is we are going to have to start sharing ventilators, or we’re gonna have to start saying, ‘You get a vent, you don’t.’ I’d be really surprised if in a couple weeks we didn’t have to do that,” says <a href=\"https://uacomp.resoapps.com/RA101908-Murtaza_Akhter/biography/index.hml\">Murtaza Akhter</a>, an emergency medicine physician at Valleywise Health Medical Center in Phoenix.</p>\n<p id=\"1zO49F\">The rampant transmission of the virus in Arizona and resulting pressure on hospitals are particularly infuriating to some emergency room and ICU staff, who say they’re having to make decisions on the fly that they’re uncomfortable making.</p>\n<p id=\"id556S\">“Sending people with Covid home with oxygen tanks because we don’t have the resources for them? This is something I’ve never done in my life before,” says Akhter. “This is crazy. And this is gonna be even worse in a couple of weeks. So far we’re trying to hold steady, but how long will that last?”</p>\n<p id=\"38jJeM\">The psychological toll, he says, is serious too.</p>\n<p id=\"i6WVGn\">“To come off a shift and be like, ‘I’m losing hope’ — that’s a dangerous place to be in,” he says. “I don’t want to feel that way. And that’s because despite the horrible numbers, despite the fact I’m still getting the Covid cases [in the ER], despite what we’ve been saying to the media from the front line, I drive home from work and I literally see lots of people congregating together closely and in the grocery store not wearing masks.”</p>\n<p id=\"PS3Khf\">Texas hospitals say they are in better shape now with personal protective equipment than they were in March and April, but that could change as the crisis gets worse. Roberta Schwartz, executive vice president at Houston Methodist, says her facilities have sometimes had trouble getting gowns and disinfectant wipes. John Henderson, who represents a trade association for rural hospitals in the state, says he recently “got a couple of SOS calls.”</p>\n<p id=\"TZWh9N\">Staffing is a universal problem in hot spots. Houston Methodist has already brought in out-of-state nurses and asked its administrative staff with nursing certifications to start doing medical work again. Nurses are also being asked to work longer and overnight shifts.</p>\n<p id=\"cGo2h6\">Rural hospitals in Texas aren’t running out of beds yet, but they are running into a staffing shortage. These facilities might typically have five patients in a given unit, and the hospitals have staffed them accordingly. But now there might be as many as 20 patients. </p>\n<p id=\"RTRl2U\">“You’re working every nurse as much as you can work them and still not meeting the need,” Henderson says.</p>\n<p id=\"8A5xou\">It’s not clear where more staff could come from. The state has already sent about 2,300 volunteers to the Rio Grande Valley, one of the hardest-hit areas in the state. </p>\n<p id=\"g2us6p\">“Other areas are requesting that workforce support,” Henderson says. “But there’s not much more in terms of resources to be sent.”</p>\n<p id=\"32A5UR\">Another concern is ventilators. Rural hospitals in Texas would ordinarily transfer their patients in serious condition, the kind who might be on a ventilator for days, to a larger hospital in the city. But because urban hospitals are already overrun with Covid-19 patients, there is nowhere for the rural hospitals to send their patients. Instead, they are forced to keep those patients, causing their beds to fill up even more quickly.</p>\n<p id=\"LNuOGj\">And while the current coronavirus patients are younger than those seen in the spring, Henderson says his hospitals don’t have enough of the nasal oxygen hookups that are used to help those patients breathe on their own and prevent them from being put on a ventilator.</p>\n<p id=\"AB801B\">“They’ve shown to be effective, but everybody’s trying to get them,” he says.</p>\n<p id=\"hUlm4X\">El Centro Regional Medical Center in Imperial County, one of California’s biggest Covid-19 hot spots right now, has already brushed up against its worst-case scenario. The hospital recently saw its available ventilators dwindle to one.</p>\n<p id=\"swrmbu\">Adolphe Edward, the hospital’s CEO, convened an impromptu committee to evaluate the patients currently on ventilators so they could prioritize if another patient who needed one came through their door. They checked the patients’ lung capacity and considered whether they could risk taking one or two of them off the ventilator if the need arose.</p>\n<p id=\"EK7vBS\">Luckily, Edward figured out a workaround. He called another nearby hospital and asked if they had any ventilators available. They had two, which they shipped over to El Centro. For now, the machines are still there, though Edward says he and the other hospital have stayed in constant contact in case the ventilators need to be transferred again.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Ycclih\">Daily deaths are creeping up again but are still far below the earlier peak</h3>\n<p id=\"K4zuOc\">While daily Covid-19 hospitalizations surging, another key metric, daily deaths, 1,126, was still less than half of its May 7 peak of 2,742, according to the <a href=\"https://covidtracking.com/data/charts/us-daily-deaths\">Covid Tracking Project</a>. Yet the trend is ominous, since daily deaths were dropping steadily by mid-June and then began rising again in early July. </p>\n<p id=\"rHsngX\">On Thursday, Florida reported a new <a href=\"https://www.wesh.com/article/florida-coronavirus-deaths-july-23/33404536#\">record single-day death toll</a> of 173. Texas hit its own respective record on Wednesday, with <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/07/22/covid-live-updates-us/\">193 deaths</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"Pzja7G\">Since many Covid-19 fatalities to date have occurred among people who were hospitalized for weeks before succumbing, experts say they expect deaths will continue to rise in the coming days and weeks. Yet it’s possible, they say, that fewer people who are hospitalized will end up dying in this summer stage of the pandemic as compared to the spring.  </p>\n<p id=\"VljtEX\">“Hospitalizations undoubtedly are going to be associated with more deaths or chronic illnesses, but I’m hoping that the deaths are not as steep as they were back in March and April,” said Topol. “And maybe that’s because they are more young people that are sick and they will pull through. Maybe it’s also because the treatments are getting better, not just the drugs but just the whole approach.”</p>\n<p id=\"yNvuIC\">Overall, he says, “The hope is that the relationship between hospitalizations and fatalities won’t be as tight as it was, but we have to watch this closely because that’s the optimistic view.”</p>\n<p id=\"6yi0hD\"><strong>Update, July 24:</strong> This article and its headline previously stated that hospitalizations had surpassed a peak reached in April. They have been updated to reflect irregularity in the hospitalization data.</p>\n<div id=\"Sr5lxK\">\n<div data-analytics-viewport=\"video\" data-analytics-action=\"volume:view:article:middle\" data-analytics-label=\"Why you should wear a face mask to fight coronavirus|75577\" data-volume-uuid=\"c30d9af46\" data-volume-id=\"75577\" data-analytics-placement=\"article:middle\" data-volume-placement=\"article\" data-volume-autoplay=\"false\" id=\"volume-placement-713\" class=\"volume-video\"></div>\n\n</div>\n<hr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"iJOYn9\">\n<p id=\"DdEUmD\"><strong>Support Vox’s explanatory journalism</strong></p>\n<p id=\"RBRwjt\">Every day at Vox, we aim to answer your most important questions and provide you, and our audience around the world, with information that has the power to save lives.

Senate Republicans may be ready to confirm her anyway.</p> <p id=\"MWTddH\">Judy Shelton has been approved by the Senate Banking Committee and seems likely to be <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/business/economy/shelton-federal-reserve-trump-senate.html\">confirmed by the full Senate</a> to fill one of two vacancies on the seven-member Federal Reserve Board of Governors.</p>\n<p id=\"5NxR5c\">President Donald Trump’s two previous picks, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/5/1/18524707/stephen-moore-federal-reserve-nomination\">Herman Cain and Stephen Moore</a>, failed in the Senate due to weak qualifications and various hints of scandal. Christopher Waller, Trump’s other current pick, is considered more conventional.</p>\n<p id=\"pV17Dv\">Whether Shelton will succeed where Cain and Moore failed is unclear, but she does present the same problem that’s bedeviled Trump: He wants to keep interest rates low so that the economy soars and helps him win reelection in 2020. He certainly could find a well-qualified person with a reputation for integrity who holds this principled view on interest rates, but he doesn’t seem to want well-qualified, principled people. </p>\n<p id=\"1H6I0M\">Instead, Trump seems to want loyalists who will support whatever it is he happens to say or want at the moment. And Shelton — who spent the Barack Obama years railing against the Federal Reserve’s efforts at economic stimulus but now says she favors low interest rates to stimulate the economy — very much seems to be cut from that cloth.</p>\n<p id=\"m8Q4LL\">Modern central banking is built on a foundation of independence from the day-to-day political needs of elected officials. That tradition has held up in the Trump years, but arguably more due to Trump’s sloppiness than to anything else. And with Trump’s reelection prospects currently in doubt, Republican senators who’d blocked funny business earlier in his term seem more open to it now.</p>\n<h3 id=\"M492Nj\">The modern Federal Reserve is independent</h3>\n<p id=\"Z9gWmS\">The modern Fed’s independence is an outgrowth of the wild inflation of the 1970s spurred by Richard Nixon’s meddling.</p>\n<p id=\"czLLRQ\">Nixon appointed Arthur Burns to run the Fed during his first term and then sought to control Fed policy through both overt and sleazy means. Nixon’s basic goal was to keep the economy hot through his 1972 reelection campaign, even if that meant running some risk of inflation. Inflation, of course, became a major problem in the mid-1970s. As inflation came back under control in the early 1980s, the conventional wisdom became that central bank independence was key to avoiding it.</p>\n<div id=\"outbrain_widget_0\"><iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"482\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?p=VMP8285661197\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></div>\n<p id=\"capUWu\">There’s a theory that an incumbent president will always want to err in the direction of a little less unemployment now, even if it means a little more inflation. Although that may be a reasonable trade-off on any given day, over the long run it inevitably means a lot of inflation. And as the theory goes, in the end this won’t even get you sustainable low unemployment — just the dreaded “stagflation” of the late 1970s.</p>\n<p id=\"rnoiNR\">During the 1980s and ’90s, this evolved into a norm of Fed independence that had grown so strong, economic policy officials in the Obama administration would routinely decline to comment at all on monetary policy, either on or off the record.</p>\n<p id=\"QNrvvU\">Still, at the end of the day, the Fed chair and other members of the board are presidential appointees. Trump isn’t exactly a huge respecter of norms or a big believer in independence. He wants a Fed that will do what he wants.</p>\n<h3 id=\"AzDQqb\">Trump’s monetary policy takes have been all over the map</h3>\n<p id=\"AaqsCT\">Trump, like other Republicans, spent the Obama years complaining that the federal deficit was too high even as standard economic models argued that large deficits could help ameliorate a major recession. Since taking office, Trump and congressional Republicans have worked relentlessly to push deficits higher even as the unemployment situation has improved.</p>\n<p id=\"PnTkzE\">A similar turnabout has happened more quietly on the monetary policy front.</p>\n<p id=\"91PVLG\">Conservative think tanks spent the Obama years warning darkly that monetary stimulus was “<a href=\"https://economics21.org/html/open-letter-ben-bernanke-287.html\">debasing the dollar</a>.” Paul Ryan called on the country to altogether abandon discretionary monetary policy and move to a “<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/08/forget-paul-ryans-budget-his-scariest-idea-is-about-the-federal-reserve/261066/\">commodity-based currency</a>” that would serve as a kind of updated version of the gold standard. Trump himself argued that the strong stock market performance under Obama was <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/we-are-in-a-bubble-trump-debate-attacks-federal-reserve-chair-yellen-2016-9\">a kind of unreal bubble</a> induced by low interest rates.</p>\n<p id=\"fc0zg1\">Since Trump took office, mainstream conservatives have been quiet on this front. And Trump <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/7/19/17591620/trump-fed-not-thrilled\">has made it clear</a> — <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/10/11/17963476/donald-trump-fed-loco-crazy\">over</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/12/19/18146352/trump-federal-reserve-interest-rate\">over again</a> — that he wants and expects low interest rates to support his reelection bid. In early April 2019, he laid out a plan to gain control of the Fed by <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/4/4/18295509/trump-herman-cain-fed-nomination\">appointing Cain and Moore to two board vacancies</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"ENjw3b\">Cain was a plainly unqualified pick with little relevant experience and a scandal-plagued past. He <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/22/herman-cain-withdraws-from-consideration-for-fed-board-trump-says.html\">took himself out of the running</a> a couple of weeks after the story of his potential nomination broke, citing the idea that he could earn more money — and <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/herman-cain-himself-expects-cumbersome-scrutiny-if-his-fed-nomination-proceeds-2019-04-06\">skip the “cumbersome” vetting process</a> — by avoiding government service. That left Moore, whose nomination collapsed after the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/29/us/politics/stephen-moore-fed-women.html\">revelation of a long series of misogynistic writings</a> offered a plausible pretext for Senate Republicans to spike him.</p>\n<p id=\"34kOdU\">So now we get Shelton, the American director of the <a href=\"https://www.ebrd.com/\">European Bank for Reconstruction and Development</a> who served as an adviser to Ben Carson’s 2016 before hopping on the Trump train. Shelton is the author of the 2009 book <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=KvN7iDVvVagC\"><em>Money Meltdown</em></a>, which warned that the global monetary system was dangerously inflationary and urged the world to convene a new international conference to return to the gold standard and restore “sound money.” </p>\n<p id=\"S4w0h8\">In reality, inflation has been persistently low since 2009 in the US, Europe, Japan, and several smaller developed countries. During a 2016 interview, however, she <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/08/18/trump-gold-standard-economic-advisor-woman-judy-shelton/\">criticized former Fed chairs Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen</a> for keeping interest rates too low for too long, saying, “I would have gotten back to normalization of interest rates much more quickly.”</p>\n<p id=\"6hFLaP\">Yet by 2019, Shelton was mysteriously telling the New York Times that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/21/business/economy/trump-fed-judy-shelton.html\">she thinks interest rates are too high</a> and would support cutting them back to the near-zero levels that she denounced as too stimulative when the unemployment rate was much higher than it was last year.</p>\n<p id=\"nAxTTG\">Perhaps most tellingly, when the Financial Times interviewed her for a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/46c4b186-8308-11e9-b592-5fe435b57a3b\">May 2019 article about her monetary policy views</a>, she chose to do the interview at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC. She also suggested that Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s private resort in Florida, might be an ideal place to host her proposed international conference on the gold standard. She was saying, in other words, that she’s a Trump loyalist beyond all else. And while on one level she should be more confirmable than Moore or Cain, having already received Senate confirmation for her current lower-profile job, she poses all the same risks of politicization and lost independence as they did. But Republican senators seem increasingly unbothered.</p>\n<h3 id=\"0hIIti\">A time bomb for Biden?</h3>\n<p id=\"FJjLKh\">One possible reason for the shift: It currently seems more likely than not that Trump will lose reelection in November.</p>\n<p id=\"KwpIBk\">The Fed board, unlike regular Cabinet or sub-Cabinet appointments, does not turn over with the arrival of a new administration. Shelton would be just one of <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/about_12844.htm\">12-person committee</a> setting interest rates. But Trump has already appointed several governors to the Fed board, and Shelton could be a thorn in the Biden administration. And conversely, if the seat is allowed to remain vacant, it would be filled by a Biden appointee. Under the circumstances, that may be reason enough to give her the thumbs-up.</p>\n<hr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"DICIWE\">\n<p id=\"DdEUmD\"><strong>Support Vox’s explanatory journalism</strong></p>\n<p id=\"RBRwjt\">Every day at Vox, we aim to answer your most important questions and provide you, and our audience around the world, with information that has the power to save lives.

And while the repercussions for the entertainment industry may seem to pale in comparison to the clear threat the virus poses to human life, the ripple effects do have implications for the<strong> </strong>people around the world who make a living producing and distributing movies, music, and more. </p>\n<p id=\"gbvDlB\">The immense and lucrative Chinese film industry <a href=\"https://qz.com/1791867/the-coronavirus-outbreak-is-crippling-chinas-film-industry/\">was hit almost immediately</a> as movie theaters across the country were closed and major releases were delayed. <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/film/news/hollywood-companies-coronavirus-1203504876/\">Hollywood soon began to feel the effects</a>, too, and as time passes, the impact of the coronavirus on the global film and entertainment industries will certainly grow.</p>\n<p id=\"WerXVK\">Consequences of the pandemic on these industries could range from lowered attendance at film festivals and disruptions in film distribution to delayed or canceled movie releases and concert dates to curtailed on-location film shoots.

Most recently, Christopher Nolan’s new film <em>Tenet</em> was delayed indefinitely, as was the live-action <em>Mulan </em>film and Wes Anderson’s <em>The French Dispatch. </em>Release dates for upcoming <em>Avatar</em> sequels and a trio of <em>Star Wars</em> films were pushed a year further out. <em>A Quiet Place Part II </em>and<em> Top Gun Maverick </em>were also delayed into 2021.</p>\n<h3 id=\"VbJyLh\">Major entertainment festival cancellations and postponements</h3>\n<p id=\"oJ3X7d\"><strong>K-pop concerts canceled, including BTS shows: </strong>On February 28, the hugely popular K-pop group <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/6/13/17426350/bts-history-members-explained\">BTS</a> <a href=\"https://time.com/5792331/bts-seoul-concerts-canceled-coronavirus/\">canceled a series of concerts</a> in Seoul.<strong> </strong>The shows were<strong> </strong>scheduled for April 11 and 12 and April 18 and 19 at Seoul’s Olympic Stadium. The group’s management agency said the decision was made due to the impossibility of predicting the scale of the outbreak in South Korea come April and cited the health and safety of the musicians themselves, workers, and concertgoers. Two hundred thousand fans were expected to attend.</p>\n<p id=\"kMO6HL\">Days earlier, BTS had asked fans to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-51613223\">avoid a series of TV appearances</a> scheduled to promote their newest album, <em>Map of the Soul: 7</em>, which had originally been planned to include studio audiences. The group also appealed to fans via a streamed press conference. “Health is always on our minds these days, and our messages of facing your inner self and loving yourself are ultimately only possible when you’re healthy, especially since it is very risky outside these days,” one of the singers, Jimin, said. ”I hope you take care of yourself.”</p>\n<p id=\"jZqiWa\">The entire Korean entertainment sector has been affected by the outbreak, and <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/biz/asia/k-pop-korea-showbiz-coronavirus-1203503030/\">K-pop has been hit particularly hard</a>, with groups including GOT7, Winner, Sechs Kies, (G) I-DLE, and others canceling scheduled tour dates. Variety <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/biz/asia/k-pop-korea-showbiz-coronavirus-1203503030/\">reported</a> that box office revenue in South Korea was down 30 to 40 percent in January 2020 compared to previous years.</p>\n<p id=\"PrlOF3\"><strong>SXSW canceled: </strong>On March 6, the city of Austin, Texas, declared a state of disaster, requiring the cancellation of public gatherings and events for the near future. The most notable of those is <a href=\"http://vox.com/culture/2020/3/6/21166241/sxsw-2020-canceled-south-southwest-coronavirus\">the cancellation of South by Southwest</a>, the annual music, film, TV, and technology festival that serves as a significant financial powerhouse for the city.</p>\n<p id=\"gJEGJP\">The announcement came after a week full of major companies — including Netflix, Apple, Amazon, WarnerMedia, Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, Mashable, Intel, and more — dropping out of the well-attended event, canceling panels, premieres, and other appearances. Days later, <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/music/news/sxsw-lays-off-one-third-of-employees-in-heartbreaking-step-1203528553/\">SXSW organizers<strong> </strong>announced</a> that they had laid off<strong> </strong>one-third of the festival’s employees in what they called “a necessary, but heartbreaking, step.”</p>\n<p id=\"dacTwZ\"><strong>Emerald City Comic Con delayed: </strong>The organizing body behind Emerald City Comic Con, the largest convention of its kind in Seattle, Washington, announced on March 6 that it<strong> </strong>will <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/3/6/21168294/emerald-city-comic-con-canceled-postponed-coronavirus-seattle-events\">postpone the event</a> until sometime this summer.

(The festival had been slated to take place May 12 to 23 and draws thousands of industries and press from around the globe each year.) The festival first <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/film/festivals/coronavirus-cannes-film-festival-first-case-confirmed-1203518700/\">issued a statement</a> on February 28 after the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/02/28/world/europe/28reuters-china-health-france.html\">first case of coronavirus in nearby Nice, France</a>, was confirmed by the city’s mayor, saying that organizers were monitoring the situation but planned for the festival to go forward. (Cannes is a seaside resort town located on the French Riviera, about 30 km from Nice.) </p>\n<p id=\"TJa1oR\">By late spring, the organizers announced that the 2020 edition would be canceled. All films that would have played in the official and sidebar programs at the festival will bear the official Cannes seal when released in theaters or potentially at partner festivals in the fall, such as those that take place in Venice and Toronto. <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/2020/06/cannes-2020-lineup-films-competiton-1202235061/\">They announced these selections</a> on June 3. </p>\n<p id=\"X323Nq\"><strong>Coachella delayed, then canceled: </strong>Goldenvoice, the organizers of Coachella —<strong> </strong>one of the largest annual music festivals in the US — announced on March 10 that <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2020/3/10/21173170/coachella-2020-dates-postponed-rescheduled-coronavirus\">the festival would be postponed</a> due to concerns about Covid-19. Another Goldenvoice festival, the country-music-oriented Stagecoach, was also delayed.</p>\n<p id=\"04N12h\">The Indio, California-based event was originally set to run for two weekends (April 10-12 and April 17-19), with the same talent lineup performing both weekends. The postponement moved Coachella to October 9-11 and October 16-18; Stagecoach 2020 was pushed back from April to October 23-25.</p>\n<p id=\"WZZnQK\">But on June 10, both events were canceled <a href=\"https://www.rivcoph.org/Portals/0/Documents/CoronaVirus/June/News/coachella-june.pdf\">by an order from the public health officer</a> of Riverside County, California.</p>\n<p id=\"AeAhkG\"><strong>Electronics Entertainment Expo (E3) canceled: </strong>The 2020 <a href=\"https://www.e3expo.com/\">Electronic Entertainment Expo</a> (E3) — the single biggest trade show in the video game industry — has been canceled. The Entertainment Software Association, which organizes the event, announced that it would not go forward with the annual event due to coronavirus fears in California, where E3 takes place. The event was scheduled for June 9 to 11.</p>\n<p id=\"TNxKf0\">The organization said it will contact exhibitors and attendees about receiving full refunds for passes, and that it is considering ways to “coordinate an online experience” in lieu of the in-person event. It also maintains that E3 will return next year as planned. </p>\n<p id=\"hnVnTn\"><strong>The NBA suspended basketball games indefinitely:</strong> A player on the Utah Jazz tested positive for coronavirus on March 11, leading NBA officials to call off that night’s Jazz game just before tip-off.

Regarding his next film, he said:</p>\n<blockquote><p id=\"BSfkjh\">For some film companies and studios involved in pre-production, a lot of costs are going down the drain, and those that already started production have to be somehow cut short or suspended. Some of them are already in the process of distributing films and they’ve paid for a lot of promotion and PR costs.

Instead, they were part of the Homeland Security Department’s contingent in Portland, which the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/7/20/21328387/portland-protests-unmarked-arrest-trump-wold\">Trump administration has deployed</a> over the explicit objections of both <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/23/donald-trump-portland-oregon-mayor-ted-wheeler-teargas-federal-agents\">Wheeler</a> and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/07/19/892855753/oregon-gov-kate-brown-federal-officers-are-adding-gasoline-to-a-fire\">Oregon Gov. Kate Brown</a> (D). The DHS officers operate in military-style gear without obvious identification. They have been <a href=\"https://www.bellingcat.com/news/americas/2020/07/20/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-battle-of-portland/\">extremely violent</a>, using <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/7/23/21334645/portland-protest-police-federal-maguire\">heavy-handed tactics that have escalated the conflict</a> in downtown Portland. They have been filmed grabbing suspected protesters off the streets and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/7/20/21328387/portland-protests-unmarked-arrest-trump-wold\">throwing them into unmarked vans</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"w3Ezb6\">And now President Trump wants to send these detachments to other parts of the country — announcing, on Wednesday, “a surge of federal law enforcement” to <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/22/trump-law-enforcement-chicago-albuquerque-378692\">Chicago and Albuquerque</a>, language that likens the federal deployments to those cities to troop deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>\n<p id=\"TZyO4P\">How could an American president start abusing federal authority in such a blatantly authoritarian fashion? How could he get one of the country’s two major parties<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/republican-silence-what-s-happening-portland-jarring-n1234684\"> to acquiesce to this</a>, especially the party that claims to be for federalism and states’ rights? How could any of this be happening?</p>\n<p id=\"nr78au\">What we’re seeing, according to experts on comparative democracy and American politics, is our polarized political system reaching its breaking point — and our democracy buckling under the pressure of Trump’s authoritarian impulses and near-total control of the Republican Party.</p>\n<p id=\"TmBtXd\">There is no legitimate justification for deploying these federal troops over local objections. The protests in Portland are limited to a small area and are primarily peaceful protests rather than riots. The violence that does grow out of those protests, like the <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/07/17/gun-violence-shootings-rise-some-cities-across-nation/5436291002/\">recent rise in gun violence in Chicago</a>, is a quintessentially local issue; the federal government has no business getting involved absent local request.</p>\n<p id=\"30H2dk\">But Trump is running a “law and order” reelection campaign that works by entrenching partisan divides and stoking racial resentment. His unprecedented deployment of federal law enforcement personnel is a means to that end; he gets away with it because American politics is so dangerously polarized that Republicans are willing to accept virtually anything if it’s done to Democrats.</p>\n<p id=\"zx7Vs2\">“Accepting this type of ‘occupation’ of American cities by unidentified federal agents requires such an extreme level of dehumanization of the citizens — which is probably why Trump repeatedly labels these cities as being run by ‘liberal Democrats,’” says Lilliana Mason, a political scientist at the University of Maryland. </p>\n<p id=\"S8WFgx\">“At this point in our political circumstances, that label alone is enough to allow law-abiding Americans in those cities to be viewed as less worthy of basic democratic protections — and to permit harm to come to them at the hands of the state.”</p>\n<h3 id=\"2qNi6M\">The dangers of Trump’s Portland policy</h3>\n<p id=\"i5sPDN\">To understand why scholars like Mason are so alarmed by this development, it’s important to put Trump’s handling of the Portland case in context. </p>\n<p id=\"oGHy6V\">It’s certainly true that there’s been real unrest in Portland. There was <a href=\"https://www.bellingcat.com/news/americas/2020/07/20/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-battle-of-portland/\">one particularly bad riot on May 29</a>; since then, protesters have been gathering outside of two buildings in downtown Portland, the federal courthouse and the Justice Center, which houses the headquarters of the Portland Police Bureau and the city jail. Ostensibly, the federal troops have been sent in to protect federal property (the courthouse).</p>\n<p id=\"RCn6fP\">But there’s no evidence that local authorities need or want their help; the violence has been fairly contained to a 12-block zone that <a href=\"https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/2020/07/feds-right-wing-media-paint-portland-as-city-under-siege-a-tour-of-town-shows-otherwise.html\">the Oregonian</a>, a local newspaper, describes as “a tiny point of the city.” In fact, local reporters suggest that use of force by law enforcement is primarily responsible for things turning violent — and that federal troops have been particularly, dangerously heavy-handed.</p>\n<p id=\"U91KJl\">“I have been in the streets of Portland documenting this movement since the very first riot,” reporter Robert Evans writes in <a href=\"https://www.bellingcat.com/news/americas/2020/07/20/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-battle-of-portland/\">Bellingcat</a>. What’s happening now is “the end result of more than six weeks of escalating state violence against largely nonviolent demonstrators.”</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A0JxkmbLdPgc1Z69qZtzzRrHOr8=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20149977/1227759599.jpg.jpg\">\n      <cite>Ankur Dholakia/AFP/Getty Images</cite>\n      <figcaption>Demonstrators marching in Portland on July 23.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"tl14a1\">This kind of violent federal deployment over the objections of state and local officials has no real precedent in American history. The closest parallels are Reconstruction, when Union troops occupied the states of the defeated former Confederacy, and military deployments to the South during the civil rights era to enforce desegregation orders. </p>\n<p id=\"ZNCm4Q\">In both of those cases, it was uniformed soldiers that were sent, not unidentified state security forces from <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/7/20/21328387/portland-protests-unmarked-arrest-trump-wold\">an alphabet soup of obscure DHS agencies</a>. More fundamentally, these troops were being used to protect moves toward racial progress — not suppress protesters who were there to demand it.</p>\n<p id=\"WNlmHz\">In fact, outside of the context of a domestic insurgency like <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2019/4/23/18512495/lyra-mckee-northern-ireland-new-ira-suspect\">the Troubles in Northern Ireland</a>, there is no example of state security forces being deployed under circumstances like this inside <em>any </em>democratic<strong> </strong>state.</p>\n<p id=\"N2l9uI\">“There is precedent in democracies of national police being used to deal with mass unrest,” says Daniel Ziblatt, a political scientist at Harvard and co-author of <em>How Democracies Die. “</em>But there is no mass unrest on a scale to justify this, and it is being done in an entirely lawless, nonconsensual away <em>over</em> the heads of state and local officials.”</p>\n<p id=\"FJ3aJ0\">There are, however, eerie similarities to what governments do during civil wars. </p>\n<p id=\"Fk6b5A\">During Sri Lanka’s fight with the Tamil Tiger insurgency between 1983 and 2009, state security officials would use unmarked white vans to scoop up citizens who had run afoul of the Sri Lankan government. This sort of abduction typically ended in the detainee’s torture or disappearance; they were so common at one point that Sri Lankan citizens started using the term “white-vanning” as a shorthand. Obviously, that’s not what’s happening to protesters detained in Portland, but experts find the echoes chilling.</p>\n<p id=\"vlyiNO\">“In Sri Lanka, the white, unmarked van is the symbol of state terror,” says Kate Cronin-Furman, a political scientist at University College London who’s worked in that country. “As an American citizen, it’s quite shocking to see something so strongly associated with some of the world’s worst state repression of dissidents unfolding in our own cities.”</p>\n<p id=\"ls3MG2\">The point of all these comparisons is not merely to say that what Trump is doing is scary or undemocratic. </p>\n<p id=\"SSC2QR\">Rather, it’s to illustrate what this says about the mindset that goes into launching a program like this. The federal deployments to Portland and the tactics they use given the context are not normal. They are the tools of authoritarian states and military occupations. </p>\n<p id=\"1UpYNS\">To even think about this kind of deployment in Portland, let alone to see the brutal results and then to announce expansions to other cities, reflects a radical de-democratization of American politics: a sense, on the part of the president and his allies, that the residents of Portland and Chicago are the enemy. </p>\n<p id=\"IABLSn\">And that, experts say, reflects a deep rot in our country’s democracy.</p>\n<h3 id=\"VTRoYL\">Beyond polarization, the abyss </h3>\n<p id=\"mSIWT0\">It’s obvious to everyone that American politics is extremely polarized. The question is how powerful this polarization is. Are there limits to what political actors will do in the name of pursuing their partisan interests and hurting the other team?</p>\n<p id=\"OQQ8Zk\">The Portland situation represents an edge case in these discussions. Trump is engaging in behavior that should clearly be unacceptable in a democracy; the historical and international comparisons make that excruciatingly clear. </p>\n<p id=\"cmziFr\">Yet, with a <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/508158-rand-paul-no-place-for-feds-rounding-people-up-at-will-in-portland\">handful </a>of exceptions, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/republican-silence-what-s-happening-portland-jarring-n1234684\">you aren’t hearing a peep of protest</a> from congressional Republicans. Top federal officials, like <a href=\"https://www.justsecurity.org/71535/bill-barrs-playbook-his-false-claims-about-prior-military-force-on-u-s-soil/\">Attorney General Bill Barr</a> and <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/news/2020/07/16/acting-secretary-wolf-condemns-rampant-long-lasting-violence-portland\">acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf</a>, are all-in on these deployments.</p>\n<p id=\"FzoWb9\">“This siege can end if state and local officials decide to take appropriate action instead of refusing to enforce the law,” Wolf said in <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/news/2020/07/16/acting-secretary-wolf-condemns-rampant-long-lasting-violence-portland\">a July 16 statement</a>. “DHS will not abdicate its solemn duty to protect federal facilities and those within them.”</p>\n<p id=\"zATCcN\">Trump’s most important outside validators, the hosts of Fox News’s slate of opinion programming, are <a href=\"https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/fox-news-fuels-trumps-dangerous-portland-law-and-order-strategy\">cheering him on</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"ZM3EGW\">To understand this assent, it’s worth unpacking the way polarization works in the United States a bit more deeply.</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"President Trump Holds Briefing At White House\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Psy84-pesqz8e1LmMcLvM_Y43mQ=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20150099/1257843982.jpg.jpg\">\n      <cite>Drew Angerer/Getty Images</cite>\n      <figcaption>Trump speaks during a coronavirus press conference.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"RVf24J\">One key element of what we’ve seen in the United States in the past several decades is the rise of what’s called “<a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0002716218811309\">negative partisanship</a>”: the growth of a political identity defined not so much around liking one’s own party as hating the other one. A negative partisan feels like they “win” by inflicting defeats on the other team rather than passing their own positive legislative agenda (though sometimes they’re the same thing). </p>\n<p id=\"SkupbF\">But in a democracy, rising negative partisanship is playing with fire. For a democratic system to work, all sides need to accept that their political opponents are fundamentally legitimate — wrong about policy, to be sure, but a faction whose right to wield power after winning elections goes without question. But if political leaders and voters come to hate their opponents so thoroughly, they may eventually come to see them not as rivals but as enemies of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"BWKKRl\">We’ve seen evidence that this kind of extreme negative partisanship has become dominant on the Republican aisle, ranging from the blockade of Merrick Garland’s Supreme Court nomination to the wide-ranging efforts at the state level to disenfranchise Black (and Democratic-leaning) voters. What we’re seeing in Portland represents negative partisanship breaking through the limits: fusing with <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2017/03/17/why-does-donald-trump-demonize-cities/\">longtime Republican and Trumpist demonization of American cities</a> to take things to a previously unthinkable low.</p>\n<p id=\"j7VI1V\">“I don’t even think calling it polarization is sufficient,” Mason, the Maryland scholar, says. “We are witnessing a crisis of democracy that is perfectly acceptable to a significant portion of the population — as long as it hurts their enemies.” </p>\n<p id=\"NhBFQ1\">The second important aspect of polarization to consider is the way it alters the incentive structures of legislators.</p>\n<p id=\"kjalqP\">In America’s Madisonian system, Congress is supposed to be an institution with a shared sense of purpose: a legislature that’s antagonistic to the president, that aims to put a check on presidential power to safeguard its own influence. </p>\n<p id=\"0E8f4Q\">But in an extremely polarized environment, members of Congress are pushed to align more with a president of their own party than with the institution. Republican senators act like Republican partisans first and members of Congress second; if they don’t, they suffer the wrath of primary voters all too willing to punish deviation from the president’s line.</p>\n<p id=\"wMz8sM\">This has, throughout the Trump presidency, made him largely immune to congressional oversight, the Ukraine impeachment <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/2/5/21115539/trump-impeachment-acquittal-vote-democracy\">being the most vivid example</a>. Now it allows him to get away with the imposition of a kind of occupation on American citizens with no real risk of congressional blowback. </p>\n<p id=\"oTNEXh\">“Due to extreme polarization and Trump’s popularity among Republicans, the entire Republican Party is abdicating responsibility for oversight,” Stephen Levitsky, a Harvard professor and Ziblatt’s <em>How Democracies Die</em> co-author, said. “We knew polarization and populism were a problem, but no one had any idea of just how far the implications stretched.”</p>\n<p id=\"vGve8D\">The causes of this crisis, this beyond-polarization level of abuse, are profound and structural (on this, I’d recommend <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Why-Were-Polarized-Ezra-Klein/dp/147670032X\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">my colleague Ezra Klein’s book</a>). But one reason Portland has become such a dangerous situation is that it’s fused some of the deepest drivers of polarization, America’s culture wars and conflicts over identity, with Trump’s personal authoritarian instincts.</p>\n<p id=\"1kxA1P\">The unrest in Portland began as part of the nationwide uprising in the wake of George Floyd’s killing. While the protests have taken on a life of their own today, they still center on grievances concerning the disproportionate use of force by police — against both African Americans and nonviolent protestors demanding their rights. </p>\n<p id=\"Gvv2db\">The extreme federal deployment there isn’t just about demonizing Democrats and antifa; it’s a means for the president to activate the kind of racial grievance politics that propelled him to power in the Republican Party. His mechanism for doing so is by leaning into the side of his political personality that <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/29/politics/trump-phone-calls-national-security-concerns/index.html\">admires foreign dictators like Vladimir Putin and Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan</a>, both of whom have notably suppressed protests by force.</p>\n<p id=\"U3vNHg\">“It’s not just about partisanship — it’s about who gets to be considered a ‘real’ American, with the full rights and privileges that entails. But it also clears the way for Trump’s push toward authoritarian rule,” Mason concludes. “It feels like the brakes are off.”</p>\n<hr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"iJOYn9\">\n<p id=\"DdEUmD\"><strong>Support Vox’s explanatory journalism</strong></p>\n<p id=\"RBRwjt\">Every day at Vox, we aim to answer your most important questions and provide you, and our audience around the world, with information that has the power to save lives.

Here’s his case for taking UFOs seriously.</p> <p id=\"OymIm7\">Earlier this year, the Pentagon <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/28/us/pentagon-ufo-videos.html\">released three videos</a> of UFOs recorded by the Navy — one taken in 2004 and the other two in 2015. The videos, which first leaked a couple of years ago, show … well, it’s not exactly clear. </p>\n<p id=\"SQYzUQ\">There are various objects — two of which look like aircraft — spinning through the sky and moving in ways that defy easy explanation. As the images bop across the screen, you can hear the pilots’ excitement and confusion in real time as they track whatever it is they’re seeing. </p>\n<p id=\"i11DGg\">I’m not what you would call a UFO enthusiast, but the videos are the most compelling I’ve ever seen. They seem to confirm, at the very least, that UFOs are real — not that aliens exist, but that there are unidentified objects buzzing around the sky.</p>\n<p id=\"rYzQuI\">Now, do I <em>think</em> aliens are real? Yeah, probably. Are they flying spaceships into our atmosphere? Who the hell knows?</p>\n<p id=\"t1LJNA\">The best anyone can say is that there’s a non-zero chance that some of these UFOs were made by non-human hands, and that, I’d argue, is reason enough to talk about them. But it’s barely cracked the news cycle. Even in a pandemic, you’d think we’d have a little time for UFO talk. </p>\n<p id=\"l3c2rd\">So in an attempt to force a UFO conversation into the public discourse, I contacted Alexander Wendt, a professor of international relations at Ohio State University. Wendt is a giant in his field of IR theory, but in the past 15 years or so, he’s become an amateur ufologist. He wrote <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0090591708317902\">an academic article</a> about the political implications of UFOs in 2008, and, more recently, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_RquOChJuE\">he gave a TEDx talk</a> calling out the “taboo” against studying UFOs.</p>\n<p id=\"S8v8kb\">Wendt is about the closest thing you’ll find to a UFO expert in a world in which ufology isn’t a real science. Like other enthusiasts, he’s spent a lot of time looking at the evidence, thinking about the stakes, and theorizing about why extraterrestrials would visit Earth in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"91jinN\">We spoke in May, but UFOs are back in the news after the New York Times reported on Thursday that the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/us/politics/pentagon-ufo-harry-reid-navy.html?smid=tw-share\">Pentagon’s UFO unit</a> has been renamed and relocated inside the Office of Naval Intelligence, and will apparently make some of their findings public.</p>\n<p id=\"GdbQti\">So I’m reposting this conversation, which has been lightly edited for clarity, where we discuss why scientists refuse to take UFOs seriously, why he thinks there’s a good chance ETs are behind the aircraft in those videos, and why he believes the discovery of extraterrestrial life would be the most significant event in human history.</p>\n<h4 id=\"wnpWFz\">Sean Illing</h4>\n<p id=\"DO2PpY\">Do you believe in extraterrestrial life? </p>\n<h4 id=\"Ju4WJo\">Alexander Wendt</h4>\n<p id=\"GJiECJ\">Well, it’s kind of like asking if somebody believes in God. It’s just an odd question. I certainly believe that it’s very likely there’s extraterrestrial life somewhere in the universe, and I suspect even most scientists might agree with that now. The real question is, are ETs here? And that’s obviously a much more debatable question. </p>\n<h4 id=\"FC9oIf\">Sean Illing</h4>\n<p id=\"xtfsMW\">Are they here?</p>\n<h4 id=\"vZArhW\">Alexander Wendt</h4>\n<p id=\"BL4EG0\">I think the odds are high enough that we should be investigating it. It’s as simple as that. </p>\n<h4 id=\"PieYwO\">Sean Illing</h4>\n<p id=\"7dEXF8\">Why would aliens conceal their existence? I know you have theories on this —</p>\n<h4 id=\"k7biLt\">Alexander Wendt</h4>\n<p id=\"ADJjb8\">It’s possible they’ve been here all along. And that’s something that I’ve been thinking about lately, which is a bit unsettling. Because it means it’s their planet and not ours. They could just be intergalactic tourists. Maybe they’re looking for certain minerals. It could just be scientific curiosity. It could be that they’re extracting our DNA. I mean, who knows? I have no idea. All I know is that if they are here, they seem to be peaceful.</p>\n<h4 id=\"RRNUe0\">Sean Illing</h4>\n<p id=\"f1E02I\">You’ve thought about this a lot, Alex. You must have a hunch as to which of those scenarios is most likely.</p>\n<h4 id=\"jA90a0\">Alexander Wendt</h4>\n<p id=\"0RN6zK\">I think if they are here, they’ve probably been here a very long time — that’s my guess. And, look, there are medieval woodcuts that seem to show UFOs. There are UFO stories in the Bible, apparently, or at least stories that are interpreted that way. So I think they’ve probably been here a long time if they’re here.</p>\n<div id=\"AM8tsQ\"><div style=\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 75%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QKHg-vnTFsM?rel=0\" style=\"border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"encrypted-media; accelerometer; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"></iframe></div></div>\n<h4 id=\"vsSwZV\">Sean Illing</h4>\n<p id=\"vuGgHU\">We’re having this conversation because <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_RquOChJuE\">you’ve been very public</a> about calling out a “taboo” against studying UFOs. What’s your claim here?</p>\n<h4 id=\"q5ynxN\">Alexander Wendt</h4>\n<p id=\"RA3riY\">It’s very simple. There are things going on in the sky that are strange and do not have an obvious explanation. These are UFOs, and like any other unidentified phenomenon, human beings are curious creatures and normally scientists will rush out to study whatever we find fascinating or puzzling. But in this case, scientists won’t touch it with a 10-foot pole. And that’s the taboo. </p>\n<p id=\"ss932A\">So even though the Navy is now saying, “Hey, we’ve got UFOs on film, here they are,” the scientists are still not going to study them. So there seems to be something blocking the scientific community from engaging this phenomenon, even though anything else even remotely this interesting would generate limitless research dollars. </p>\n<h4 id=\"O1d99B\">Sean Illing</h4>\n<p id=\"TX6aiY\">Is this some kind of conspiracy of silence? How does a taboo like this take hold in the first place?</p>\n<h4 id=\"SGibYs\">Alexander Wendt</h4>\n<p id=\"pCIbYJ\">We argued in our <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0090591708317902\">2008 academic paper</a> that the modern state is what we call anthropocentric. Basically, that means human beings are sovereigns. In ancient times, it was the gods or nature that was thought to rule over everything. Now it’s human beings. And this principle is embodied in the state. And if you call that into question, if you call into question that the state is not the only potential sovereign here, the whole legitimacy of the state is called into question. So the whole worldview of the modern state is very vulnerable to the UFO question. You can’t even ask the question because it raises the possibility that there could be ETs here. And that would just blow everything wide open.</p>\n<h4 id=\"ye6sLj\">Sean Illing</h4>\n<p id=\"OUrJ3B\">That’s an argument for why states might not be interested in this question, but it doesn’t explain why non-state actors or the private sector isn’t particularly eager to study this.</p>\n<h4 id=\"hTuTwU\">Alexander Wendt</h4>\n<p id=\"et3MjZ\">Now, that’s a very good point. In our paper, we only dealt with states. What’s interesting lately is that states seem more willing to engage with this than scientists. I think there’s a hubris in the scientific community, a belief that human beings are the most intelligent species on this planet, and it’s very hard to come to grips with the idea that if there are aliens here, they’re obviously much smarter than we are. </p>\n<p id=\"j6Vebn\">I’ve received a lot of emails from individual scientists in response to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_RquOChJuE\">my TEDx talk</a>. And all of them said the same thing, which is, “Thank you, we wish we could study this, but we can’t because our lives depend on getting grants from the government and other research institutes, and if anybody gets worried that we’re interested in UFOs, boom, they won’t get a cent and their careers will be in the tank.” But I still think most scientists believe this is all nonsense anyway, and that’s frankly disappointing. </p>\n<div class=\"c-float-right c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"pRJtQs\"><q>“I worry about my fellow human beings more than I worry about the aliens”</q></aside></div>\n<h4 id=\"flVEBk\">Sean Illing</h4>\n<p id=\"qnn67y\">I think there are other explanations here, but we’ll get to that. First, let’s talk about <a href=\"https://www.navair.navy.mil/foia/documents\">these Navy videos</a>. What do you think you’re seeing when you watch these?</p>\n<h4 id=\"oiw97R\">Alexander Wendt</h4>\n<p id=\"jMx43n\">The first thing I’d say is that it doesn’t matter what I think because I’m not a scientist, right? I don’t know what’s on those videos. But to me, I listened to the pilots, to their voices, and I trust them much more than I would trust myself. And they’re clearly seeing something extraordinary. Now, whether it’s alien life, who knows? It’s a plausible explanation. My point is that we should be agnostic about this and simply study it scientifically. Let’s do the science and then we can talk about what we found. Until we’ve done that, it’s all bullshit.</p>\n<h4 id=\"S9hEs4\">Sean Illing</h4>\n<p id=\"47AfUV\">Is it possible that there is no real taboo and that the lack of rigorous study has more to do with the limits of the field or the paucity of evidence than anything else?</p>\n<h4 id=\"SFT9u2\">Alexander Wendt</h4>\n<p id=\"Pnxuur\">Well, it’s true that the evidence we have is very vague. Most of it is anecdotal. It’s not scientific. A lot of it is eyewitness reports. On the other hand, the evidence has been going on for many decades. It’s very consistent, in many ways. It’s all over the world. There’s a huge number of cases and there is physical evidence in the form of videos or radar accounts. And when that evidence comes from the US Navy, it’s safe to say that it’s legit and not doctored.</p>\n<div id=\"FPFVAw\"><div style=\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cdJLaqNEFMM?rel=0\" style=\"border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"encrypted-media; accelerometer; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"></iframe></div></div>\n<h4 id=\"V9vh8o\">Sean Illing</h4>\n<p id=\"yW33YG\">But what would a science of UFOs even look like? How do we study empirically something for which there’s so little empirical evidence?</p>\n<h4 id=\"pCgUuL\">Alexander Wendt</h4>\n<p id=\"97ex4f\">Like Elizabeth Warren says, I have a plan for that.</p>\n<h4 id=\"FGwptm\">Sean Illing</h4>\n<p id=\"DGSmGL\">Great, let’s hear it.</p>\n<h4 id=\"uYKuH1\">Alexander Wendt</h4>\n<p id=\"ngGTwc\">About five years ago, some colleagues of mine and I formed a nonprofit called UFODATA. And the objective we set for the nonprofit was to create a ground-based network of surveillance stations that would monitor the sky 24/7 with cameras and various other technologies, looking for UFOs. Anything comes along, boom, the cameras start snapping pictures or radar or film until the UFO passes. The technology is very sophisticated now and very cheap.</p>\n<h4 id=\"vHORVu\">Sean Illing</h4>\n<p id=\"2a27pz\">I don’t quite understand the need for that. There are thousands of satellites and radar systems operating all over the world at every moment, surveilling and recording and tracking. An obvious question is, why are there not more sightings? Why is there not more evidence? Why are there so few compelling pieces of evidence?</p>\n<h4 id=\"Kc1IiO\">Alexander Wendt</h4>\n<p id=\"V0sWO9\">I think part of the problem is that a lot of the parameters of these technologies that we use to look for asteroids and meteors and all these other things are such that UFOs may not be within those parameters. And so they’ll just be discarded as noise or unnoticeable junk. So that’s one explanation for why we see less than we might. </p>\n<p id=\"RRZcqv\">Secondly, no one has bothered to actually look for UFOs. We’re looking for ETs around distant stars, we’re looking for comets, we’re looking at all kinds of other things in the atmosphere. No one, as far as I know, is seriously looking for UFOs. But to me, it doesn’t really matter why we don’t see more. What matters is those three videos that the Navy released. I defy anyone to watch those and come away thinking there’s nothing there worth investigating. Those pilots who spent thousands of hours in the sky, who are flying the most sophisticated machines in the entire world, are seeing something that they have never seen before and are completely blown away by it. </p>\n<p id=\"IKDTU9\">Again, these are videos released by the Navy, and so I’m inclined to believe what I’m seeing. What’s striking is that the objects don’t behave like natural phenomena. One of the objects rotates as it’s flying against the wind, which is not normal. And the pilots are clearly under the impression that these objects are under intelligent control. </p>\n<h4 id=\"hD5j3d\">Sean Illing</h4>\n<p id=\"o0QPaS\">Are you persuaded at all by some of the non-ET explanations? For instance, that some of the UFOs are actually weather balloons or drones or shadows of aircraft above, and that what appear to be advanced maneuvers are really just the product of infrared glare or camera angles or eyewitness errors.</p>\n<h4 id=\"JzVH3x\">Alexander Wendt</h4>\n<p id=\"sdXJOx\">I think the majority of UFO reports probably have conventional explanations like that and they’re just misidentifications by observers on the ground. That’s probably the majority of cases. So it’s really the hardcore minority cases that don’t have those kinds of obvious explanations. And that’s where we have better physical evidence, or authoritative sources, like the military. And it’s really easy to throw out skeptical possibilities. But I look at those videos and they don’t look fake to me at all.</p>\n<h4 id=\"ovkZM9\">Sean Illing</h4>\n<p id=\"OaPq1C\">No, they don’t.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Sh4vPr\">Alexander Wendt</h4>\n<p id=\"iQBx4X\">The pilots clearly don’t think so, either.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Pq8UxN\">Sean Illing</h4>\n<p id=\"U0rXaO\">Tell me the truth: You think it’s aliens, right?</p>\n<h4 id=\"7ax6k4\">Alexander Wendt</h4>\n<p id=\"suqbzC\">I think so. If I were placing a bet, I guess I would say 51 to 49 in favor of ETs. But it wouldn’t surprise me at all if the opposite were true. Again, we haven’t done the science.</p>\n<h4 id=\"fwCdmj\">Sean Illing</h4>\n<p id=\"TRvVMh\">That’s a big number, Alex.</p>\n<h4 id=\"UMhAIb\">Alexander Wendt</h4>\n<p id=\"McKvii\">It is.</p>\n<h4 id=\"vF93YV\">Sean Illing</h4>\n<p id=\"173URr\">To say that something is hard to explain is not to say that it’s inexplicable, though. It’s entirely possible — likely, even — that there’s a simple account of these encounters and we just don’t have it yet. What’s the Occam’s razor explanation for these UFO sightings?</p>\n<h4 id=\"uIMcdh\">Alexander Wendt</h4>\n<p id=\"yI0g5U\">To me, the Occam’s razor explanation is ETs.</p>\n<h4 id=\"80Z4we\">Sean Illing</h4>\n<p id=\"ZErvJ5\">Really?</p>\n<h4 id=\"mix5Ih\">Alexander Wendt</h4>\n<p id=\"dGRpwi\">It explains all the cases just like that. And you don’t need a whole bunch of different theories  or assumptions for all these different phenomena, right? Because the phenomena are different. But I guess I don’t see a competing explanation of any kind that would explain some of the stuff that we either have on film or the pilots have seen. And, again, why didn’t the military come up with these alternative explanations? They must have thought about them and concluded it doesn’t fit the data.</p>\n<h4 id=\"UuMDcP\">Sean Illing</h4>\n<p id=\"9VnpnA\">I’m not sure that’s right. They may have a strong hunch but simply can’t prove it, so it remains officially “unidentified.” We can definitely say that the chances that aliens are involved is non-zero, but beyond that, I have no idea.</p>\n<h4 id=\"7x8EAc\">Alexander Wendt</h4>\n<p id=\"VpSIuI\">That’s pretty close to my position.</p>\n<h4 id=\"sUVtlV\">Sean Illing</h4>\n<p id=\"gqhcq2\">But a weather balloon or malfunctioning radar systems or just eyewitness mistakes seem like much simpler explanations.</p>\n<h4 id=\"JlT1Pu\">Alexander Wendt</h4>\n<p id=\"dPOz8J\">But you’d have to explain why multiple instruments were all malfunctioning in the same way at the same time. You’ve got multiple jets up there, you’ve got radar on the ships down below tracking at the same time. You’ve got communications going on with people on the ships and the planes and the guys in the planes. So whatever explanations people do offer, they’ve got to fit the data. </p>\n<p id=\"c1F0A5\">It doesn’t look like that was a weather balloon that those guys were seeing. I assume professional fighter pilots are pretty good at spotting and recognizing weather balloons, and surely that’s a common occurrence. It’s easy to be a skeptic here, I get that. All I’m saying is that there’s enough here to justify the science. The puzzle is that we’re not doing the science. To me, that’s the essential phenomenon that’s of interest. </p>\n<h4 id=\"2uRHBT\">Sean Illing</h4>\n<p id=\"aC8CdM\">Why should scientists care about UFOs? Why should philosophers care? Why should anyone care?</p>\n<h4 id=\"OCLFXp\">Alexander Wendt</h4>\n<p id=\"1eDCcc\">Because if ETs were discovered, it would be the most important event in human history.</p>\n<h4 id=\"oQC8Oc\">Sean Illing</h4>\n<p id=\"gb99IQ\">Why?</p>\n<h4 id=\"aFgib1\">Alexander Wendt</h4>\n<p id=\"bIYduJ\">If it became known, it could be a very dangerous event in the sense that we might see a collapse of state authority. We might see chaos. The possibility of contact with a civilization that has vastly more knowledge than we do is exciting and terrifying and unpredictable. </p>\n<h4 id=\"7hpQHY\">Sean Illing</h4>\n<p id=\"BT79HJ\">I mean, isn’t that a case for putting our heads down and minding our fucking business? <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/stephen-hawking-death-alien-contact-aliens-theory-ufo-search-breakthrough-844920\">Stephen Hawking</a> famously warned humanity about the perils of first contact with an alien species. “If aliens visit us,” he said, “the outcome would be much as when Columbus landed in America, which didn’t turn out well for the Native Americans.” </p>\n<p id=\"uSpY5X\">Was he wrong?</p>\n<h4 id=\"hrUOmb\">Alexander Wendt</h4>\n<p id=\"93mnA0\">My feeling is that if they’re here, they’re almost certainly peaceful, because if they were not peaceful they would have wiped us out a long time ago. They can probably do it very quickly. So my assumption is they don’t mean any harm. But it’s still the case that society could implode or destabilize as a result of colliding with ETs.</p>\n<h4 id=\"1esFQJ\">Sean Illing</h4>\n<p id=\"lrtC2B\">That’s a big assumption. If they are here, they might be peaceful, sure. But they might also be on a scouting operation. They might be looking for holes in our defenses, weaknesses in our societies and in our physical bodies. The point, obviously, is that we have no freaking idea. So maybe that’s the case for following Hawking’s lead here, right? Maybe it’s best to not go poking about for superior life.</p>\n<h4 id=\"f9hzhs\">Alexander Wendt</h4>\n<p id=\"bYkEBH\">I’ve thought about this, and I worry less about poking around and getting conquered and more about the potential realization that these things are here and then an internal implosion of our society. So I worry about my fellow human beings more than I worry about the aliens. So I guess in that sense, I disagree with Hawking’s premise that they’re out to get us. But sure, it’s possible they’re on a surveillance mission. But people have been reporting UFOs for at least 80 years, and that’s a really, really long surveillance mission. And also, why would they want to conquer us? That’s like us conquering ants. </p>\n<div id=\"OMOeMQ\"><div style=\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/u_RquOChJuE?rel=0\" style=\"border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" allow=\"encrypted-media; accelerometer; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"></iframe></div></div>\n<h4 id=\"PQ1XfE\">Sean Illing</h4>\n<p id=\"taT8h4\">If some of these UFOs are the products of alien life, why haven’t they made their presence more explicit? If they wanted to remain undetected, they could, and yet they continually expose themselves in these semi-clandestine ways. Why?</p>\n<h4 id=\"bL5Na3\">Alexander Wendt</h4>\n<p id=\"4wCeYP\">That’s a very good question. Because you’re right, I think if they wanted to be completely secretive, they could. If they wanted to come out in the open, they could do that, too. My guess is that they have had a lot of experience with this in the past with civilizations at our stage. And they probably know that if they land on the White House lawn, there’ll be chaos and social breakdown. People will start shooting at them.</p>\n<p id=\"xJs4dR\">So I think what they’re doing is trying to get us used to the idea that they’re here with the hopes that we’ll figure it out ourselves, that we’ll go beyond the taboo and do the science. And then maybe we can absorb the knowledge that we’re not alone and our society won’t implode when we finally do have contact. That’s my theory, but who knows, right? </p>\n<h4 id=\"Wzi8Pq\">Sean Illing</h4>\n<p id=\"YiX0fV\">It’s an interesting theory, and as likely as any other, but Hawking’s theory is every bit as plausible —</p>\n<h4 id=\"HDAA8e\">Alexander Wendt</h4>\n<p id=\"eIh6dD\">That’s right. But people have speculated that any civilization that’s able to travel between the stars would have to become nonviolent, because they would never survive long enough if they’re violent among themselves to actually reach a point where their technology was that sophisticated. And human beings don’t seem to be as violent as we used to be, so there’s that.</p>\n<h4 id=\"PWiEs4\">Sean Illing</h4>\n<p id=\"svP3Qn\">I’d say our institutions have evolved and the incentives guiding our behavior have evolved, but I don’t think we have. I think human beings are as nonviolent as their circumstances allow them to be.</p>\n<h4 id=\"9qFdor\">Alexander Wendt</h4>\n<p id=\"4W9VR2\">That’s fair.</p>\n<h4 id=\"iEYC9u\">Sean Illing</h4>\n<p id=\"I4u6Kh\">If there’s a non-zero chance that aliens are real and they know we’re here, it’s crazy that governments aren’t more concerned about the dangers. We’ve all seen the same movies. How do you explain the apparent indifference here?</p>\n<h4 id=\"aFwxew\">Alexander Wendt</h4>\n<p id=\"jkAi7X\">For governments, there’s no real upside to talking about this. They can’t control this. If there are ETs, they don’t have the power to do anything about it. They’re helpless in the face of ETs. And there’s a big downside risk of social chaos, loss of authority, loss of control and all that. So I think governments have lots of reasons to let a sleeping dog lie, which is why the Navy’s thing is so surprising in a way. </p>\n<h4 id=\"Pn1gyU\">Sean Illing</h4>\n<p id=\"nyAQfa\">Maybe several governments already know of ETs and aren’t revealing that knowledge for all the reasons you suggest.</p>\n<h4 id=\"rpDhQx\">Alexander Wendt</h4>\n<p id=\"SqFvk7\">I’m a strong disbeliever in any kind of conspiracy argument. I don’t think there has ever been a conspiracy to cover up the truth that we know that aliens are here. At most, we’ve covered up the fact that we have no idea what’s going on. </p>\n<div class=\"c-float-right c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"DuudZu\"><q>“For governments, there’s no real upside to talking about this. They can’t control this.”</q></aside></div>\n<h4 id=\"BIGqsV\">Sean Illing</h4>\n<p id=\"AMytn1\">What’s the argument or the piece of evidence that gives you the most pause? What makes you think there’s nothing here?</p>\n<h4 id=\"i2e0fT\">Alexander Wendt</h4>\n<p id=\"oNKaXM\">That’s a good question. That I don’t have a good answer shows my bias in a way. I guess I’d like to see more videos of the sort the Navy just released. It’s likely they have other videos they haven’t released. So I guess I would like to see more physical evidence. I suppose that’s my answer: The thing that gives me the most pause is that we have so little evidence.</p>\n<h4 id=\"dO4an6\">Sean Illing</h4>\n<p id=\"ha5Nib\">You said a minute ago that we might be in a pre-contact situation in which ETs are gradually acclimating us to their presence. If that’s true, what should we be doing to prepare for whatever comes next?</p>\n<h4 id=\"4kYLlp\">Alexander Wendt</h4>\n<p id=\"MfxYEp\">Actually, that’s the next article I would like to write. I don’t know what the answer is right now. I only write articles where I don’t know the answer ahead of time. But I guess I will say this: Montezuma could’ve prepared a lot better for Cortes than he did, had he only known Cortes was coming. </p>\n<hr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"iJOYn9\">\n<p id=\"DdEUmD\"><strong>Support Vox’s explanatory journalism</strong></p>\n<p id=\"RBRwjt\">Every day at Vox, we aim to answer your most important questions and provide you, and our audience around the world, with information that has the power to save lives.

It offered $3 an hour in hazard pay for those who came in and “catastrophe pay” for workers who stayed home.</p>\n<p id=\"xY3y5s\">“At first, I think they did really well,” she said.</p>\n<p id=\"Ctflsr\">But things have changed. The pay bump wound down at the end of May, after which workers were offered three choices: keep their jobs at likely reduced hours, take an unpaid leave of absence through September, or take a separation package. Her store has since started back up with “<a href=\"https://www.starbucks.com/promo/happyhour#:~:text=Happy%20Hour%20is%20available%20on,and%20Starbucks%20Reserve%C2%AE%20beverages.\">happy hours</a>,” five-hour buy-one-get-one specials that entice customers to pack into the cafe to score a deal.</p>\n<p id=\"1ShShn\">One of Eva’s colleagues, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told me the happy hour crowd “throws every safety protocol we have out the door.”</p>\n<p id=\"CWRiIH\">“It feels like now, Starbucks just is really trying to make its money back,” Eva said. “I didn’t expect this.”</p>\n<p id=\"EQLqpV\">When the Covid-19 pandemic took hold in the United States this spring, companies jumped on the opportunity to advertise the ways they were supporting their customers and workers. The <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/4/8/21212435/coronavirus-tv-ads-mcdonalds-toyota-state-farm-dominos\">commercials became repetitive and indiscernible</a><strong> </strong>from one another, but corporate America’s message was clear: <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90483063/were-all-in-this-together-why-brands-have-so-little-to-say-in-the-pandemic\">We’re all in this together</a>. </p>\n<p id=\"7hRMuL\">Now companies have begun quietly rolling back many of the benefits, perks, and allowances they so loudly announced earlier this year. The state of the Covid-19 pandemic isn’t materially different than it was a few months ago — arguably, it’s now more widespread and worse. But corporations seem ready to move on.</p>\n<p id=\"4nKLNN\">“It’s just unclear that we could point to anything that’s different that would provide a reason to think that companies had strong moral reasons to be taking these steps in March and April, and that somehow those reasons are now gone,” said Brian Berkey, an assistant professor of legal studies and business ethics at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p id=\"orygDh\">It turns out that “we’re all in this together” was a limited-time offer.</p>\n<h3 id=\"jGNIwK\">Many industries are quietly sunsetting the “nice” things they were doing</h3>\n<p id=\"Gk8BFk\">Poking around in different industries and on different companies, I found multiple examples of customer benefits and assistance being rolled back. <a href=\"https://news.mcdonalds.com/news-releases/news-release-details/thank-you-meals\">Thank-you meals</a> from restaurants for health care workers are much harder to find. Insurers such as <a href=\"https://www.progressive.com/support/covid19/\">Progressive</a> and <a href=\"https://www.geico.com/about/coronavirus/\">Geico</a> paused policy cancellations for non-payment, but both programs ended in May.</p>\n<p id=\"3rnvbC\">Health care workers and first responders are still in the trenches, but many of the programs meant to thank and reward them have long expired. Many internet companies have put an end to their deals. Verizon’s extra 15 GB of data for its customers <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21231803/verizon-extends-15gb-of-extra-data-deal-to-customers-through-may\">ended May 31</a>, and T-Mobile’s unlimited data offer stopped June 30. The FCC’s <a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/keep-americans-connected\">pledge</a> for companies to ensure customers don’t lose their broadband or telephone connections during the pandemic also ended June 30 — now it’s up to individual service providers to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"TnP4M2\">The airline industry has garnered a lot of attention for its reaction to the pandemic, especially as travelers <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/4/30/21242816/coronavirus-travel-airlines-crowded-planes\">assess the risk of getting on a plane</a>. This summer, both American Airlines and United Airlines <a href=\"https://www.travelandleisure.com/airlines-airports/american-airlines-united-airlines-seating-capacity-coronavirus\">decided to start selling middle seats again</a>, which obviously makes social distancing impossible. Other airlines, <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2020/07/14/delta-coronavirus-earnings-middle-seat-flights/\">such as Delta</a>, are still keeping those seats open.</p>\n  <figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"A man with his head in his hands on an airplane.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GgxAbi3zct2NCZ29ZjsWFJDtUao=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20108934/1224444481.jpg.jpg\">\n      <cite>Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images</cite>\n      <figcaption>Passengers wear masks on an American Airlines flight to Dallas on July 2, 2020. The day before, American announced it was ending capacity restrictions for flights.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"ghPrk0\">In some cases, executive pay that was cut in response to the crisis <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2020/06/25/ceo-pay-cuts-reinstated-coronavirus/\">is being restored</a>, even where workers are struggling. Many corporations have ended hazard pay for front-line workers, even as many of those same companies have started to require customers to wear masks — an implicit acknowledgment that the hazard still exists.</p>\n<p id=\"nWht4v\">In many cases, as I discovered while I was reporting this story, it was difficult to get companies to say what they were or weren’t doing anymore. </p>\n<p id=\"d8pCYm\">“We have a really good understanding of what companies have done, and now the question is, what is being rolled back?” said Alison Omens, chief strategy officer at Just Capital, a nonprofit that tracks and ranks companies on social responsibility. “There was a lot of transparency at first, and now it’s not as clear if those policies are still in place.”</p>\n<p id=\"NXiCJH\">Wells Fargo confirmed it has paused foreclosed property sales and evictions, but it is repossessing cars again. Bank of America has alerted some customers it is ending credit card payment deferrals on August 15, though a spokesperson insisted the company will “continue to have flexibility and will work with our customers as needed to help them throughout the current environment.”</p>\n<p id=\"VNn009\">Banks are, of course, taking a hit during the pandemic — during the second quarter, for example, Bank of America <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/bank-of-americas-2q-results-hurt-by-pandemic-like-others/2020/07/16/0c3700d8-c75d-11ea-a825-8722004e4150_story.html\">processed 1.8 million credit card deferral requests</a>, and the bank has put aside $4 billion to cover credit losses. But it’s hard to see the megabanks as victims here. A repossessed car for an individual can mean a loss of a way to get to work, to school, to buy necessities. For Wells Fargo, it’s the most minuscule drop in the bucket.</p>\n<p id=\"N7kwwH\">“I strongly suspect that Wells Fargo wouldn’t be in danger of going under if they held off on repossessing cars for somewhat longer,” Berkey said. “In other cases, it might be true that a company would really be in danger of insolvency if it didn’t step back on certain policies that it might have adopted for a short period of time.”</p>\n<p id=\"S6c7eX\">“What’s at stake for the people involved in the company is much less morally important than what’s at stake for consumers or others,” he added. “It might be that the company is just obligated to let itself lose out on competitiveness.”</p>\n<h3 id=\"ocsfAq\">Companies are starting to treat the pandemic as a permanent condition, even as they roll back benefits</h3>\n<p id=\"RT0JE0\">It’s not just customers that companies have been pretty vocal about helping during the pandemic. It’s also workers. As <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/5/16/21258834/coronavirus-essential-workers-hazard-pay-kroger-target-covid\">Vox’s Anna North outlined in May</a>, a lot of companies were pretty fast getting rid of “hero pay.”</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"Y6r0be\"><q>“Why would they not continue our extra pay now, when things are skyrocketing?”</q></aside></div>\n<p id=\"O6HoIa\">Rob got an extra $2 an hour for hazard pay around the time he started<strong> </strong>working at BJ’s Wholesale Club in Florida in March — until this summer, when it stopped. A few weeks later, on July 20, the store made masks mandatory for customers nationwide. Hazard: still present. Hazard pay: over.</p>\n<p id=\"T8SA8O\">“It’s only getting worse. Why would they not continue our extra pay now, when things are skyrocketing?” Rob said. “Otherwise, I wouldn’t really speak out, but it seems ridiculous, when things are getting to be worse, they’re going to stop giving the benefits.”</p>\n<p id=\"3HxlOS\">Starbucks, Kroger, and other companies also dropped coronavirus pay bumps and bonuses, even as cases increase across the country. Workers are left to try to implement the policies on the ground, often at low wages. One of the Texas Starbucks workers told me that if a customer refuses to wear a mask, they’re instructed to ask them to go outside and then shuttle back and forth to<strong> </strong>get the customer their order. “It’s a lot of back and forth,” the worker said. A spokesperson for Starbucks said the company is “actively listening” to what its partners are saying about what’s going on in the stores, and that the health and safety of its workers and customers come first.</p>\n<p id=\"r5fhXm\">Even for the companies that have kept hazard pay going, their workers are sometimes stuck in a constant limbo as they wonder<strong> </strong>whether benefits will be extended. For instance, Home Depot decides every few weeks whether to continue bonuses. “Basically, we never know if it’ll be extended or not until payday,” Ray, a Home Depot employee in Connecticut, told me.</p>\n<p id=\"vrySSQ\">To be sure, at some businesses margins are tight to the point that it’s hard to sustain extra pay for workers, and the longer the pandemic goes on, the harder it will be for them to stay afloat — let alone provide extra pay for employees. But then you look at businesses like Amazon, which has seen sales soar: It stopped extra pay for warehouse workers, many of whom say <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/6/29/21303643/amazon-coronavirus-warehouse-workers-protest-jeff-bezos-chris-smalls-boycott-pandemic\">they are working in tough conditions</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"JBJfmA\">“At a place like Amazon, one of the most profitable companies in the world, Jeff Bezos himself could personally fund it out of his own wealth,” said Elizabeth Anderson, a philosophy professor at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor.</p>\n<p id=\"gCumpd\">Amazon spokesperson Timothy Carter told Vox in an email that the company has paid its team members nearly $800 million since the Covid-19 outbreak began, and now — with “demand stabilized” — it’s returned to paying employees the usual $15 an hour. Bezos’s net worth <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-20/jeff-bezos-adds-record-13-billion-in-single-day-to-his-fortune?sref=Wg6QzS2e\">jumped by $13 billion on July 20 alone</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"KWVddW\">Darden Restaurants, which owns chains such as Olive Garden, Longhorn Steakhouse, and the Capital Grille, <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2020/06/25/ceo-pay-cuts-reinstated-coronavirus/\">has already restored its CEO’s pay cut</a>, even though the restaurant industry hasn’t recovered and many workers in the field are having a hard time getting by.</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"QBjiIQ\"><q>“Executives are still getting paid the same in a lot of these firms, despite the fact that there’s a bloodbath underneath them in terms of ordinary workers”</q></aside></div>\n<p id=\"O34UAB\">“Executives are still getting paid the same in a lot of these firms, despite the fact that there’s a bloodbath underneath them in terms of ordinary workers,” said Waheed Hussain, a philosophy professor at the University of Toronto.</p>\n<h3 id=\"CLS2oU\">This is what happens when we let corporate America decide what’s right</h3>\n<p id=\"zjzuHD\">In some ways, companies have stepped up where the government has not — requiring masks, paying some employees more, and working with customers who can’t pay their bills. It’s part of a broader trend of Americans increasingly <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/business-and-finance/2018/3/20/17107626/corporate-america-nra-guns-daca-trump\">looking to companies to enact change</a> and be better citizens. Even if it is a bit of a PR stunt, big donations are meaningful, and when used right, companies have the power to influence policy decisions in ways that ordinary people often don’t.</p>\n<p id=\"fALAHL\">Derrick Feldmann, co-author of <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/books/the-corporate-social-mind-how-companies-lead-social-change-from-the-inside-out/9781734324808\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Corporate Social Mind</em></a>, said firms should think about how to design services and products to take into account the post-pandemic reality. “If you honestly have your pulse on what the consumer is dealing with outside of their own relationship with you, you’ll quite understand that not only is the pandemic going on, but there are other effects that have a little bit of lag time,” he said.</p>\n<p id=\"VoMUIk\">Some firms have made some long-term adjustments. Target has made its extra $2 in pay permanent, bumping up workers from $13 to $15 an hour, though it’s worth noting the $15 minimum was scheduled to happen in 2020 regardless. Many health insurers have extended coronavirus coverage on a rolling basis as the pandemic continues — a spokesperson for Cigna, for example, said it would be extending its July 31 deadline for waiving out-of-pocket costs related to the disease until at least October 31. The oil company BP initially put forth a program in the US giving first responders a 50-cent per-gallon discount on gas; it’s since phased that out and is now providing a 15-cent per-gallon discount for 60 days.</p>\n<p id=\"kYw6p2\">“The offer is not as rich as it first was — it would be very difficult as a business to keep that offer going,” said Jo Brecknock, a spokesperson for BP. The company also <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherhelman/2020/06/08/bp-set-to-slash-10000-jobs-i-cant-make-your-worries-disappear-says-ceo/#7d028bb353bc\">plans to cut thousands of jobs</a> in response to the pandemic and what’s going on in the oil market.</p>\n<p id=\"AqFzrG\">“Some of these moves going back to normal may actually be shortsighted for business,” said Nien-he Hsieh, a professor of business administration at Harvard Business School. “There are some studies that show that raising wages during periods like this can be helpful in the long run because they lower churn, improve retention, and improve morale. Similarly, maintaining customer trust can be a long-term benefit. And also, in terms of thinking about a business, when you want to restart, having to rehire people can be difficult.”</p>\n<p id=\"9JH9oc\">Corporations are, of course, motivated by profit, and we’re in a world of shareholder primacy, where they work to maximize making money for their shareholders above all else. Doing a nice thing for a customer or employee pays some dividends, but not a ton.</p>\n<p id=\"lbTvOJ\">“Businesses are hemmed in by shareholder expectations, so unless you change that part of the environment, you’re not going to get anything different in terms of corporate policies with respect to ordinary consumers and workers,” Hussain said.</p>\n<p id=\"5PyDjd\">Companies have a choice here, now and always. Nobody is ever forcing them to do stock buybacks or give giant CEO bonuses instead of increasing pay and benefits for workers. And there is an argument to be made right now that <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/covid-19-coronavirus-economy-recession-stock-market/2020/5/6/21248069/stock-market-economy-federal-reserve-jerome-powell\">the stock market has become so disconnected from economic reality</a> that if there were ever a time to ignore shareholders a little bit, it’s now. Instead of <a href=\"https://www.rollcall.com/2020/07/22/liability-protection-coronavirus-lawsuit-health-business/\">lobbying for Congress to give them liability protections in the next stimulus bill</a>, they could push lawmakers to extend unemployment for the workers they’re forced to lay off.</p>\n<p id=\"Wa0s5K\">The problem is, businesses don’t have the motivation to make those choices, at least not in the US. If the government doesn’t compel them, much of the time, they’re going to choose the more lucrative option. </p>\n<p id=\"Rq4WJJ\">Corporations often follow the news cycle and jump from issue to issue with statements and initiatives that correspond. In June, as the protests over the police killing of George Floyd took over the news, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/06/brands-racism-protests-amazon-nfl-nike/612613/\">the same brands that were telling us they cared about us in the coronavirus pandemic were saying they’re now all about racial justice</a>. That’s fine, but you have to ask what’s beyond that, and whether projects continue once the hype fades. </p>\n<p id=\"iJOYn9\">In the case of the pandemic, the first wave of corporate responses seems to have dwindled much faster than the disease itself.</p>\n<hr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"Yhumsr\">\n<p id=\"DdEUmD\"><strong>Support Vox’s explanatory journalism</strong></p>\n<p id=\"RBRwjt\">Every day at Vox, we aim to answer your most important questions and provide you, and our audience around the world, with information that has the power to save lives.
