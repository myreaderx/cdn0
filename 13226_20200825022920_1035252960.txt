So what <em>did</em> we learn about the state of marketing in 2019?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Number 1: CX is King</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The number one takeaway from 2019? It’s all about the customer journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This might seem obvious &#8211; marketing has <em>always</em> been concerned with the customer journey. We want to know what customers are looking for, how we can best offer it, how we can convince them that our product is the right choice. But 2019 is when we saw real, widespread adoption of Customer Experience (CX)-centered marketing, a new lens for looking at the journey to purchase.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the traditional marketing approach considers prospects in a funnel, moving from awareness to consideration to purchase, the CX approach considers prospects from their own point of view. Potential customers probably don’t see themselves as, well, potential customers. They don’t think “hm, now I’ve entered the consideration phase.” They see themselves as trying to solve a problem, and what marketers see as funnel stages, buyers see as a series of tasks to complete in order to reach a solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>CX marketing is all about trying to share that view. What task is the buyer trying to accomplish, and how can the marketer help them get there? This requires knowing the customer extremely well, but it pays off when marketers are able to produce content that resonates tightly with their audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Further reading: <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://learn.percolate.com/customer-journey-starter-kit-planning\" target=\"_blank\">The Customer Journey Starter Kit</a>, <a href=\"https://learn.percolate.com/five-tensions-marketing-orchestration\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">The Five Tensions of Marketing Orchestration</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Number 2: Margin for Error is Lower Than Ever</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We don’t have to tell you that yesterday’s marketing innovation is today’s table stakes &#8211; you live it every day, just like we do. As access to data has increased marketer’s capabilities, expectations for marketing have increased right along with them. Customers now expect all marketing they encounter to be personalized to them (in fact, more than half of buyers <a href=\"https://www.salesforce.com/content/dam/web/en_us/www/assets/pdf/datasheets/salesforce-research-fourth-annual-state-of-marketing.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">told Salesforce</a> they would switch brands if it wasn’t).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it’s not just customer expectations that have increased. Measuring marketing has always been notoriously tough, but data and digital marketing tools now offer more resources than ever before to help marketers evaluate their effectiveness. The c-suite now expects marketing leadership to be able to demonstrate ROI for their activities, in a way that simply wasn’t possible 5 or 10 years ago. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding to the pressure? For many marketers, one thing that <em>didn’t</em> increase in 2019 was the budget. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The net result is that marketers’ margin for error is shrinking fast. Success in 2019 meant working efficiently with the resources available, particularly data, to create the right content for the right people, make sure it was delivered at the right time, and measure the right results. Strategies, workflows and metrics all needed to be tightly aligned across teams to minimize mistakes, and create the best outcomes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Further reading: <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://learn.percolate.com/orchestration-affecting-cx\" target=\"_blank\">Is Orchestration Affecting My Customer Experience?</a>, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://learn.percolate.com/guide-to-atomizing-content\" target=\"_blank\">A Guide to Atomizing Content for ABM</a>, <a href=\"https://learn.percolate.com/guide-creative-process-management\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">A Guide to Creative Process Management</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Number 3: Ecosystem is the Future and the Future is Now</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>None of that tight alignment comes easily. There are a lot of moving pieces involved in a successful marketing campaign, and they all need to move together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea of a connected martech ecosystem is hardly new. Enterprises are increasingly building martech stacks made up of the best tools in each category, and selecting for robust APIs to ensure seamless transfer of data. Technology is now an integral part of marketing, and that means your tech stack needs to work together just like your team. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well-integrated, best-of-breed martech stacks are the engine that power the modern marketing machine. Silos in your martech can slow down your workflows, increase your chances of mistakes, and get in the way of your teams’ vital communications. Combined with that lower margin for error, this meant that marketers simply couldn’t <em>afford</em> to have martech silos in 2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Further reading: <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://learn.percolate.com/best-of-breed-advantage\" target=\"_blank\">The Best of Breed Advantage</a>, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://learn.percolate.com/marketing-case-for-apis\" target=\"_blank\">The Business Benefits of APIs</a>, <a href=\"https://learn.percolate.com/marketing-tech-stack-workbook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">The Marketing Tech Stack Diagram Workbook</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>All in all it’s a challenging time to be a marketer, and it’s an exciting time to be a marketer.

But few industries have changed as much, and as quickly, as financial services.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just a few years ago, most significant financial transactions were offline, and service areas were largely defined by geography.&#160; A significant part of the value proposition for a financial services provider was based on personal relationships and in-person communication. With the shift to digital, consumer behavior and expectations have changed significantly. Now, consumers can go online and select a financial service provider from anywhere, in just a few clicks.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For consumers, this is convenient! For financial services marketers, who suddenly find themselves in an exponentially more crowded field, with fewer opportunities to differentiate? Not so much. The plethora of online choices often leads to consumer perception that financial services are a commodity with little meaningful distinction between providers. Meanwhile, bypassing the  in-person experiences that have traditionally been financial providers’ strength means that consumers will have fewer touchpoints with a provider before they make their selection &#8211; which means fewer chances to reach them with messaging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This new normal means there is little margin for error. Financial services marketers must reach their target audience with compelling, differentiated messaging that helps them understand the value of their offering vs. the competition. Campaigns must be well-strategized, on-brand, and operationally effective, And that, in turn, requires excellent orchestration of marketing efforts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s easy enough to say, but what does it mean in practice for financial services marketers?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We spoke to over 1100 FinServ marketers over the past year about the challenges they experienced, and their biggest pain points in trying to orchestrate marketing. Nearly all of them, we learned, faced the same three pains:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Differentiating the message and staying ahead of new rivals</li><li>Organizing content and campaigns efficiently and effectively</li><li>Tracking ROI and attributing new business to marketing</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We dive into these questions &#8211; and how to address them &#8211; in our new ebook <a href=\"https://learn.percolate.com/how-finserv-marketers-can-win-the-marketing-orchestration-game-download\">How Financial Services Marketers Can Win the Marketing Orchestration Game</a>.

As we head back to the office to start the new year, most of us are resolving to do things like exercise more, eat fewer holiday cookies, and finally achieve longstanding goals. True, most resolutions don’t make it to February &#8211; but here’s 5 New Year&#8217;s resolutions for 2020 that marketers should actually keep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1: Get Serious About Your Customers’ Journey</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The top lesson <a href=\"https://blog.percolate.com/2019/12/3-things-we-learned-in-2019-about-the-state-of-marketing/\">we learned in 2019</a> was that generic marketing messages based on broad audience segments have officially expired. Customers expect a personalized experience that demonstrates understanding of their pain points &#8211; and if they don’t get that, they’ll go elsewhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you haven’t yet built out the kind of detailed customer journey map that helps you <a href=\"https://blog.percolate.com/2019/04/getting-real-on-customer-experience/\">understand what your customers are trying to accomplish</a> at each stage (and how to provide it), there’s no time like the present. It’s not just about meeting expectations; ultimately, a deep understanding of the customer will help you <a href=\"https://blog.percolate.com/2019/04/getting-real-on-customer-experience/\">produce more effective marketing</a> with the resources you already have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2: Get to the Root of Content Challenges<br /><br /></strong>For most of the 20th century, the biggest challenge for marketers was the limited number of channels for reaching their customers. In the 21st century, the situation is flipped: channels are plentiful, and the limiting factor is creating enough relevant, high-quality content to make use of them.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve discussed this <a href=\"https://learn.percolate.com/bottleneck/\">content bottleneck</a> before, and it’s very common for enterprises to face challenges in their content creation, though the details may vary. Sometimes the issue is that the organization simply can’t create enough content. Other organizations may have a quality issue &#8211; the amount of content is good, but it’s not the right fit for the audience, and so it isn’t resonating with customers. Still others may have all the pieces they need, but struggle to connect them to the right place and time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Content challenges are common &#8211; and it’s also common for the root causes of those challenges to be unclear. If you aren’t sure what’s causing the problem, though, you can’t take steps to fix it. Make 2020 the year you get to the bottom of things (and if you need someplace to start, <a href=\"https://blog.percolate.com/2019/06/pinpoint-your-content-issue-with-our-handy-chart/\">give our diagnosis chart a try</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3: Break Bad Organizational Habits</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a lot of talk about how enterprises should break down their organizational silos. And that talk is correct. Silos slow down your processes, create more opportunities for error, and make it hard to measure big-picture success. Breaking them down, however, can also be a significant project, especially for long-established enterprises. Significant, but not impossible &#8211; and <a href=\"https://blog.percolate.com/2019/08/why-busting-martech-silos-is-worth-the-effort/\">well worth the effort</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A good first step to breaking down larger team barriers can be to tackle the walls between your various martech systems. Once your <a href=\"https://blog.percolate.com/2019/08/what-do-apis-really-mean-for-marketers-anyway/\">data is able to flow freely between your different tools</a>, you’ll remove one of the key visibility barriers that keeps teams apart.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2010, silos were a hassle, but in 2020 they’re a serious liability. Resolve to get your teams (and systems) working together more closely this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4: Make Sales a True Partner</strong>&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s no secret that sales and marketing departments are more frequently rivals than friends. Different goals and incentives can lead to tense relationships, at SMBs and larger enterprises alike. But with increasing customer expectations (and shrinking margin for error), it’s vital for marketers and sellers to remember they’re on the same team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like most relationship issues, there’s usually blame on both sides. Marketers can resolve to start fresh for the new year by taking <a href=\"https://blog.percolate.com/2019/08/5-steps-to-better-b2b-sales-marketing-alignment/\">steps to improve alignment with sales</a> &#8211; like making communication and feedback front and center.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most frequently cited issues between sales and marketing is the ability for sellers to find what they need in a timely manner, with the information they need to use it correctly. <a href=\"https://blog.percolate.com/2019/11/better-together-percolate-joins-seismic-to-improve-the-customer-journey/\">Technology can help</a>, but tackling this issue ultimately requires commitment from the marketing team to prioritize alignment, and treating sales like a partner. The increased engagement with customers will make it all worth it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5: Treat Ecosystem Like a Strategic Advantage</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We already talked about needing to break down silos, technological and otherwise, in order to avoid potential pitfalls. But it’s not all about trying to avoid problems. The API-connected martech ecosystem also presents <a href=\"https://learn.percolate.com/marketing-case-for-apis\">a world of opportunities</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A well-integrated <a href=\"https://blog.percolate.com/2019/10/3-reasons-the-best-martech-stacks-are-best-of-breed/\">best-of-breed martech stack</a> takes the best of what the 7000-providers-and-counting martech field can offer, and brings it together to enable faster collaboration, new workflows, and deeper insights into what’s working and why.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To take full advantage of the opportunity, however, you need to have the right mindset toward your martech stack: that it’s a strategic advantage, not just an operating expense. As you go into 2020, approach marketing technology with an eye towards the greater whole, and how each tool can better work together to help your team win.&#160;</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 07 Jan 2020 15:00:59 +0000","feedId":13226,"bgimg":"https://blog.percolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/woman-overlooking-sf-580x174.png","linkMd5":"fabdeb6a47c0ebe02abef180093076d8","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn14@2020_6/2020/08/25/02-27-18-419_2d4e1c27e6baffc2.webp","destWidth":580,"destHeight":174,"sourceBytes":124840,"destBytes":8804,"author":"Laura Knight","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.percolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/woman-overlooking-sf-580x174.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn14@2020_6/2020/08/25/02-27-18-419_2d4e1c27e6baffc2.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598322437006},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:27:17","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:27:17","title":"Become an Expert with Percolate Academy","link":"https://blog.percolate.com/?p=12084","description":"<img src=\"https://blog.percolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/man-studying-laptop-580x174.png\">\n<p>Percolate empowers marketers with the tools to better orchestrate their activities and create content that will effectively connect with audiences.

Enterprise marketing RFPs might not ever be <em>fun</em>, but with the right preparations, the process can be significantly less painful than standing in line for a Real ID.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://learn.percolate.com/rfp-planning-guide-download\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">The Marketing Orchestration RFP Planning Guide</a> is free to download, and goes in-depth on the steps you can take to ensure your RFP goes according to plan. Short on time? Here’s the three most important things to remember.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Take Time to Lay Your Groundwork</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s tempting to dive right in and start moving forward, but preparing for an RFP is definitely a situation where patience pays off.&#160; Putting in the time to start things off right can clear the way for the process go more smoothly later on. There are two areas you’ll want to focus on for groundwork: who you need, and what you already have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Who you need” might end up being a bigger list than you expect: marketing orchestration touches a lot of functions across an organization, and as a result a lot of people might end up either as stakeholders or end users. Identifying these people and bringing them into the process at the beginning can prevent later conflicts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“What you already have” is a bit more straightforward: these are the systems you already have in place in your martech stack. Taking stock of these before you begin helps you better understand the gaps in your current technology, and how an orchestration platform will fit in (and if your martech stack is complex enough that it’s a challenge to navigate, <a href=\"https://learn.percolate.com/marketing-tech-stack-workbook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">we have a book to help with that too</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get Clear on Your Requirements</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If there’s one thing that can reliably derail an RFP, regardless of industry or company size, it’s a lack of clarity. If you don’t have well-defined objectives for your new technology, or what it needs to be able to do, you run the risk of scope creep or stakeholder disagreements bringing everything to a standstill.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The easiest way to avoid blockers around requirements is to make sure they’re documented and prioritized at the start of your process. This includes both the business objectives you’re trying to achieve, and the technical capabilities you’ll need to get there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ask Questions With Long Answers</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you’re trying to get the right information from your potential solution providers, the key is not in <em>what</em> you ask. It’s <em>how</em> you ask.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Questions that are written with yes/no answers may seem straightforward, but they open up a can of “yes, but” worms. A solution provider might technically offer a particular feature or capability, but their version may not actually do what you need. Rather than asking if a solution can do something, frame your questions around the task or goal you’re trying to accomplish, then ask for examples of how the solution will help.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use case questions help avoid misunderstandings about a solution’s capabilities, and also give prospective partners a better idea of what your RFP is all about. That in turn helps them prepare material that’s most relevant to your actual needs, so your meetings can cut straight to the point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Download <a href=\"https://learn.percolate.com/rfp-planning-guide-download\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">The Marketing Orchestration RFP Planning Guide</a> for more information, and get your RFPs moving forward.<br /></p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 14 Jan 2020 15:32:53 +0000","feedId":13226,"bgimg":"https://blog.percolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/people-table-industrial-580x174.png","linkMd5":"f49d71da2d2f07e279582bfa2572a43f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn90@2020_5/2020/08/25/02-27-18-431_853f3e7c738f0f24.webp","destWidth":580,"destHeight":174,"sourceBytes":144027,"destBytes":10494,"author":"Laura Knight","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.percolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/people-table-industrial-580x174.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn90@2020_5/2020/08/25/02-27-18-431_853f3e7c738f0f24.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598322437006},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:27:17","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:27:17","title":"Percolate’s Intelligent Integrations, Explained","link":"https://blog.percolate.com/?p=12072","description":"<img src=\"https://blog.percolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Integrations-580x174.png\">\n<p>In our increasingly interconnected world, it would seem reasonable that the software systems we work in would be connected as well. However, it often feels as though we bounce between disparate systems, manually moving data and hunting for information. We spend inordinate amounts of time going between information silos, time that could be spent doing work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What if you could have the exact information you needed at the exact moment you needed it? We can’t grant the ability to be omniscient (sorry) but at Percolate, we’ve spent a year building products to support martech integrations that work the way you need them to. Our goal is to allow marketers to integrate their martech tech stack with Percolate with ease. With Percolate at the center of an integrated, orchestrated ecosystem, marketers can send and receive the information they need from numerous different systems in order to do their work. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not enough to build an integration &#8211; it should be intelligent. An integration should have the ability to be flexible without being difficult or confusing to use. An intelligent integration raises the bar higher, and surfaces the right information at the right time. The phrase “intelligent software integration” make evoke thoughts of an expensive, arduous development project, but it doesn’t have to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For teams with access to technical resources such as software developers, we’ve built the Percolate Developer Platform. The Developer Platform is built for both robust custom integrations and out-of-the box Percolate integrations to systems such as Seismic and Allocadia. It gives marketers the ability to iframe other applications into Percolate and provides the engine to run multiple software integrations simultaneously, as well as access to webhooks and SDKs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We know not every team has access to software developers who can build custom integrations, or the budget for it. For these teams without technical resources, we’ve built Percolate Relay. Powered by Workato, Relay allows users to build codeless integrations and automations. The dedicated Percolate connector integrates with Percolate campaigns, content, assets, and tasks, as well as hundreds of other platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Relay uses triggers and actions to move data into, out of, and within Percolate programmatically. Relay takes the guesswork out of knowing where in-flight content is within the production cycle, or the manual nature of creating placeholder content for a marketing campaign. Relay harnesses the Percolate API and repackages it to make it accessible to everyone, regardless of technical skills. Building an integration or automation in Relay is as simple as dragging and dropping the actions into place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A marketer trying to track the budget of a marketing campaign can view that information without navigating to another system. A marketer wanting to push finished collateral to another system can now publish it from Percolate with one click. A marketer trying to gather information from multiple teams and functions can ingest that information into Percolate with no manual effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By giving a layperson the ability to create intelligent integrations single-handedly, any marketer now can have the ability to do their work in the most efficient, bespoke way possible.<br /></p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 29 Oct 2019 13:00:45 +0000","feedId":13226,"bgimg":"https://blog.percolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Integrations-580x174.png","linkMd5":"b87b07748703d32db3751d4d9248baae","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn85@2020_4/2020/08/25/02-27-17-706_ef33920b117219dc.webp","destWidth":580,"destHeight":174,"sourceBytes":128524,"destBytes":14972,"author":"Alice Pelletier","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://blog.percolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Integrations-580x174.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn85@2020_4/2020/08/25/02-27-17-706_ef33920b117219dc.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598322437007},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:27:17","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:27:17","title":"Your Guide to Effective Marketing Orchestration","link":"https://blog.percolate.com/?p=12074","description":"<img src=\"https://blog.percolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/woman-reading-phone-outside-580x174.png\">\n<p>You don’t need us to tell you that the pressure on marketers to do more with less is higher than ever.

If your marketing is currently losing money to inefficiency, chances are it’s related to one or more of these: wrong content, duplicate content, or unused content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Wrong Content</strong> encompasses two main issues. The first is pretty straightforward &#8211; the content is wrong because it’s incorrect. Informationally wrong content is an easy fix, though correcting it can still introduce extra headaches and expenses to your content cycle. The second issue is a little more complex &#8211; content that is not informationally, but <em>existentially</em> wrong.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re doing customer experience (CX) or account-based marketing (ABM), you need a lot of content to support your strategy. If you’re doing both, you need even <em>more</em> content. But it’s not solely a volume issue &#8211;&#160; just having a giant pile of random content won’t actually help your CX or ABM. You need a high volume of content that’s relevant to your very specific customer, and designed to address their very specific needs. If it doesn’t do that, then it’s the wrong content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wrong content costs you money both by wasting the resources used to create it, and by losing potential opportunities by not connecting with the right people. So what do you do about it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Solving the wrong content problem starts way back at the beginning of the content production process. Once you’ve determined your strategy and what you need to support it, make sure everyone involved in creating your content has that information, including the objective for each piece and how its fits into the bigger picture. With that information in hand, your team is positioned to create the right content, the first time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Duplicate content</strong> is the inverse problem of wrong content. In this scenario, your organization knows what content is needed and which customer it should address. The issue is that multiple teams decide to create the necessary content, without realizing they’re all working on the same thing. You end up with multiple variants on the same content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spending time and resources creating redundant output is obviously a waste of budget &#8211; for the same cost, you could have had each team create something unique, and have that many more content pieces finished. It can also cost more than just money. Presenting potential customers with a competing spread of similar content pieces can leave them more confused than persuaded, and possibly cost you an opportunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The key to solving the duplicate-content problem is cross-organization communication. It’s easy for marketing teams to become siloed, especially teams with regional or business unit separation. You need to ensure everyone in your organization has visibility into what everyone else is working on, regardless of what team they’re on. Awareness of what’s in progress on other teams will prevent your content creators from unknowingly double- or triple-booking on the same content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Unused content</strong> is one of the most frustrating types of marketing inefficiency, particularly for your content teams. In this situation, your team has done exactly what they were supposed to do. They’ve created the content you need to address your prospects’ needs and move them forward, and now that content is ready to go to work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Except&#8230;it doesn’t. It sits, languishing on someone’s hard drive or on an intranet server somewhere, never to be used. Your sales team might not even know it exists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the short term, unused content costs money by wasting the resources used to create it. Because the content never finds its way into the marketplace, you don’t get any return on that resource investment. In the longer term, you once again face an opportunity cost &#8211; you’ll never realize the revenue that might have come from the piece connecting with buyers and convincing them to choose you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what to do? This is an area where the importance of sales-marketing alignment really can’t be overstated. Your team produces quality content, Sales wants quality content to help sell, it’s all a matter of <a href=\"https://blog.percolate.com/2019/08/5-steps-to-better-b2b-sales-marketing-alignment/\">fixing the communications breakdown.</a> Better communications practices in general can help with this, as well as tech solutions like sales enablement platforms. The important thing is, have a single place where yours sales team can find all current content, and take an active role in making sure they know what’s available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides just being a drain on your budget, these three inefficiencies have another thing in common: they’re all symptoms of larger orchestration issues, that can have a negative effect on your marketing.

/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Platform-specific metadata enables marketing teams to better control the number and types of fields that creators see when planning and producing Content in Percolate,&#160;displaying only fields relevant to the platform being published to.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"padding:20px;color:#0a506c;\"><em>For example,&#160;it is now possible to prevent creators from&#160;seeing&#160;metadata fields related to social media,&#160;if they are&#160;working on an email, which has little relevance to social media.</em>&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Better control content publishing</strong>&#160;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are times when a piece of content published through Percolate can’t be updated any&#160;further or&#160;has outlived its purpose. When that happens, you can leverage the&#160;new&#160;<em>Unpublish&#160;</em>status type.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://blog.percolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-2-600x342.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-12109\" srcset=\"https://blog.percolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-2-600x342.png 600w, https://blog.percolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-2-300x171.png 300w, https://blog.percolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-2-768x437.png 768w, https://blog.percolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-2-580x330.png 580w, https://blog.percolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-2.png 808w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The Unpublish status type effectively indicates when a piece of content is no longer available to the public. However, creators may still access the content within Percolate for record keeping purposes or continued updates and production, and eventually republish the content.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Access Percolate, from anywhere</strong>&#160;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Percolate mobile app for iOS has been completely redesigned to deliver a better way to collaborate&#160;with your teams to&#160;review and approve Campaigns and Content.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://blog.percolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-5-564x1000.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-12112\" srcset=\"https://blog.percolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-5-564x1000.png 564w, https://blog.percolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-5-169x300.png 169w, https://blog.percolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-5-327x580.png 327w, https://blog.percolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-5.png 578w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 564px) 100vw, 564px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>When you first open the&#160;app,&#160;you’ll see all the latest activity from your team(s), including user activity, recent notifications, and comments. From there, you can easily review scheduled Campaigns and Content from the corresponding calendars, and review and approve work in progress.&#160;&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve also doubled down on security, enabling Touch ID / Face ID / Passcode locking to ensure that only the right people have access to your Percolate environment.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Extend functionality, with powerful integrations</strong>&#160;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Two new integrations&#160;extending the functionality of&#160;Percolate are now available, in the form of&#160;content activation with&#160;<em>Seismic</em>, and budget management with&#160;<em>Allocadia</em>.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Seismic integration</strong>&#160;</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://blog.percolate.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-3-600x536.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-12110\"

delivering the most compelling stories throughout your buyers’ journeys.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The integration enables marketers to take content created in Percolate and publish it to Seismic, leveraging custom data mapping to&#160;automatically&#160;help sellers curate, activate, discover, and engage buyers with the most relevant content for them.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Allocadia integration</strong>&#160;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Allocadia integration for Percolate&#160;provides a way for teams to connect budgeting activities to marketing efforts, and obtain new visibility into campaign performance, content optimization, and cross-channel ROI.&#160;&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img

/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>As financial information is created and adjusted in Allocadia, it syncs with campaign information in Percolate, leveraging mapped metadata to ensure&#160;consistent visibility into&#160;measurement and reporting.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What&#8217;s next?&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you are a current Percolate customer</strong>, you can log into Percolate and

release.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you are not yet a Percolate&#160;customer</strong>&#160;and want to become more familiar with us,&#160;we encourage you to&#160;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"
