For the most part, it’s managed to keep to its schedule, even if the usual glamorous launch itineraries have been swapped out for socially distanced virtual events and car loans.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>This year also saw the retirement of Bentley’s Mulsanne model, the company’s former flagship. Cut from a different cloth than its suite of core models, the Bentley Mulsanne was a true throwback to an earlier era, hand-built on a bespoke platform and incorporating the final version of Bentley’s venerable L-Series V8 engine, originally introduced in 1959. Without the Mulsanne, and with the first all-electric Bentley coming ever closer (a date of 2025 has been suggested), the company is in a state of transformation, simultaneously trying to shape a more contemporary and sustainable definition of luxury, while taking care not to shed the sporting luxury ethos that has defined the brand for 100 years.</p> \n<div class=\"media-element-container media-wysiwyg\"> \n <div id=\"file-287369\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg\"> \n  <div class=\"content\"> \n   <img class=\"media-element file-wysiwyg\" data-delta=\"1\" src=\"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/new_bentayga_-_alpine_green_-_6_0.jpg?itok=Q8aemRSF\" width=\"1460\" height=\"974\" alt=\"\" />\n  </div> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div class=\"image-caption\">\n  Bentley Bentayga in Alpine Green \n</div> \n<p>This summer saw the introduction of a radically revised Bentayga, Bentley’s first foray into the SUV market. The car was originally launched in 2015 and although it has been a strong sales success, it’s never quite shaken its slightly compromised aesthetic image; the Bentayga began life as an ugly duckling. It had much in common with the original <a href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/tags/porsche\" title=\"Porsche\">Porsche</a> Cayenne, in that it fell short of conveying the key characteristics of its brand, despite containing all the key ingredients.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Since the original Bentayga’s debut, Bentley has gone on to create a triumphant new version of its Continental Grand Tourer, available both in droptop and coupe form with a choice of W12 (coupe only) or V8. It also produced a new generation Flying Spur, the four-door limousine that takes the reigns from the Mulsanne as the new flagship. Both GT and Flying Spur are effortlessly elegant, exceptionally powerful automobiles that also manage to be desirable luxury objects. Can the overhauled Bentayga keep up?&nbsp;</p> \n<div class=\"media-element-container media-wysiwyg\"> \n <div id=\"file-287370\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg\"> \n  <div class=\"content\"> \n   <img class=\"media-element file-wysiwyg\" data-delta=\"2\" src=\"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/bentley_continental_gt_v8_14_0.jpg?itok=LI_PZ9Df\" width=\"1460\" height=\"973\" alt=\"\" />\n  </div> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div class=\"image-caption\">\n  Bentley Continental Grand Tourer \n</div> \n<p>The new car is no longer the ugly duckling of the flock. The detailing has been substantially overhauled, inside and out, with a new nose and new tailgate, both of which draw on the svelte but authoritative forms of the coupe and saloon. In total,1,000 changes differentiate the car from the 20,000 examples already sold (accounting for nearly half of all annual Bentley sales). Inside, there’s a welcome update of the touchscreen interface, bringing it more in line with the best offerings from elsewhere in the VW Group, along with digital dials, wireless phone charging, and an updated removable touchscreen for rear passengers. It goes without saying that the craft, detail and quality remain exceptionally high; this is one of the great contemporary automotive interiors. In 2+2 format (a mildly infuriating waste of space, given this car’s massive scale), every passenger is given a little kingdom of their own, a world of wood and leather.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>On the road, the V8 Bentayga embodies that most fundamental of Bentley qualities – effortless power. You sit high, simultaneously commanding over and isolated from all that surrounds you. Refinement is second-to-none, with the engine relegated to a distant hushed rumble at low speeds. Nosing the beast around tight city streets isn’t without its perils, but the cameras and sensors do a good job of guiding you away from embarrassment and eternal YouTube infamy. On highways and fast A roads, the Bentayga is just as much a competent grand tourer as any other Bentley, albeit slightly less fuel efficient (relatively speaking) and not quite as well suited to fast twists and turns. What it does best is blast its way towards the distant horizon, enveloping its occupants with an unassailable sense of power and tradition.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The Continental GT coupe shares the Bentayga’s spirit but presents it in a different form. Both <a href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/tags/cars\" title=\"Cars\">cars</a> have a mechanical complexity akin to that of the highest-end audio or mechanical wristwatch - admirable to certain quarters but baffling to the rest of us. These are truly the last of the V8s. Bentley is working furiously on every aspect of electrification, hoping that the switch from internal combustion to battery is as seamless as possible. Both GT and Bentayga have reached their apogee; it remains to be seen where next to go. §</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~4/a3Bzw4QhwPg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 12:37:35 +0000","feedId":9788,"bgimg":"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/wp_large/s3/2020/08/bentley_continental_gt_v8_14.jpg","linkMd5":"0aca18cc1c251a7a3662dc280d31555c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn92@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-35-15-427_465479dd1059ce1d.webp","destWidth":848,"destHeight":565,"sourceBytes":42264,"destBytes":32096,"author":"","enclosureType":"image/jpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/wp_large/s3/2020/08/bentley_continental_gt_v8_14.jpg","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/new_bentayga_-_alpine_green_-_6_0.jpg?itok=Q8aemRSF":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn42@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-35-19-242_5d1d2ebf7f3f15de.webp","https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/bentley_continental_gt_v8_14_0.jpg?itok=LI_PZ9Df":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn62@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-35-20-712_0fed9c10ee743bec.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~4/a3Bzw4QhwPg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn74@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-35-21-299_a8e43bc4f4bcf771.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598315696879},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:34:56","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:34:56","title":"Yinka Ilori’s colourful skatepark in France is a pillar of the community","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~3/LpMTI7GuWa4/yinka-ilori-colorama-skatepark","description":"<p>British-Nigerian Yinka Ilori presents the Colorama Skatepark, a new project created in Roubaix, France, as part of Lille’s World Capital of Design 2020. Sport and street art merge in this characteristically colourful space, featuring modular artworks which serve as the structure for the space.</p>\n<p>The skatepark by Ilori is part of cultural centre La Condition Publique, a creative laboratory in Roubaix merging art, urbanism and environmental sustainability. It takes over ‘Halle B’, a 1550 m² area inside a 20th century warehouse renovated by French architect Patrick Bouchain in 2004, and previously used for exhibitions and events. The institution’s brief was simple: to bring together different audiences and create a space that’s inclusive.</p>\n<div class=\"media-element-container media-wysiwyg\">\n<div id=\"file-287597\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n    <img alt=\"Yinka Ilori Skatepark Lille\" title=\"Yinka Ilori Skatepark \" class=\"media-element file-wysiwyg\" data-delta=\"1\" src=\"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/_maxime_dufour_photographies_-13_juillet_2020_-_00321-201_0.jpeg?itok=-LKwL3tN\" width=\"1460\" height=\"973\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>‘Skateboarding is a unique art form on its own,’ says Ilori. ‘It’s performative: there’s an audience, you’re doing tricks. So there is that element of display and flamboyancy - it’s quite a big thing to watch.’ The designer learned from a team of professional skateboarders, working closely with them for guidance throughout the process, which often made him reconsider his design choices.</p>\n<p>‘I think as designers, we have to understand that sometimes we’re not designing only for ourselves, but for the people,’ he says. ‘This was quite a collaborative process, which I’m really grateful for.’</p>\n<blockquote class=\"w-wide-quote\"><p>\n‘I guess the takeaway for me is, never underestimate the power of the community, and of people coming together to play.’\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Ilori’s design features different modules including ramps, partitions and blocks, and integrated the newly designed elements within the existing space through colour. The modules, as well as the structural columns and brick walls were painted in a tonal palette featuring pops of gold and fluorescent hues combined with earthy shades. The design was in part inspired by the building’s 19th century façade, characterised by lacquered tiles that Ilori recreated as a motif on the walls.</p>\n<div class=\"media-element-container media-wysiwyg\">\n<div id=\"file-287617\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n    <img alt=\"Yinka Ilori Skatepark Lille\" title=\"Yinka Ilori Skatepark \" class=\"media-element file-wysiwyg\" data-delta=\"2\" src=\"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/_maxime_dufour_photographies_-13_juillet_2020_-_00321-155_0.jpeg?itok=0vG5Xx0M\" width=\"1460\" height=\"973\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>‘I wanted to create a space that is joyful and inclusive, and that allows room for stories to be told and created. That’s why I use colour, to create memories,’ he continues. For the designer, it was important to create a space that would become a pillar of the community, a safe space for local children: ‘skateboarding is not only about skating, but it’s also about being part of a community, it’s also being part of a family,’ he says. </p>\n<p>Further cementing the skatepark’s role in Roubaix, two classes from the local high school took part in the project’s construction, and the park also offered an opportunity for youth employment, with new ad-hoc apprenticeship positions. ‘The kids came down to help us build and paint as well, it was great to get their input as well and I think there are also future designers and makers here,’ adds Ilori. ‘I guess the takeaway for me is, never underestimate the power of the community, and of people coming together to play.’ §</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~4/LpMTI7GuWa4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 13:25:25 +0000","feedId":9788,"bgimg":"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/wp_large/s3/2020/08/_maxime_dufour_photographies_-13_juillet_2020_-_00321-173.jpeg","linkMd5":"fa2827a7e67326a26e9ca3b59f623fcb","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn16@2020_4/2020/08/25/00-35-14-749_76de17dfa5798675.webp","destWidth":848,"destHeight":565,"sourceBytes":64681,"destBytes":49198,"author":"","enclosureType":"image/jpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/wp_large/s3/2020/08/_maxime_dufour_photographies_-13_juillet_2020_-_00321-173.jpeg","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/_maxime_dufour_photographies_-13_juillet_2020_-_00321-201_0.jpeg?itok=-LKwL3tN":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn58@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-35-19-422_189e9e7f806203c0.webp","https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/_maxime_dufour_photographies_-13_juillet_2020_-_00321-155_0.jpeg?itok=0vG5Xx0M":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn52@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-35-17-281_09ceb9113fc2a956.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~4/LpMTI7GuWa4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn88@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-35-20-852_ba1a18dc1545dff9.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598315696876},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:34:56","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:34:56","title":"The art world is rallying behind Beirut","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~3/48CO8q3_PDk/art-relief-funds-beirut-following-explosion","description":"<p>On 4 August, a colossal explosion ripped through the Lebanese capital, Beirut causing widespread destruction, mourning, anger and prompting many still-unanswered questions.

Other artists who have submitted work include Aldo Álvareztostado, Cvmaea Halim, Anna Aagaard Jensen and Younès Rahmoun. In its short lifespan, the initiative has raised almost $100,000, funds directed to NGOs including&nbsp;Impact Lebanon, the Lebanese Red Cross and Baytna Baytak, a social initiative helping to locate housing for those who lost their homes in the blast. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/artrelief4beirut/\">@artrelief4beirut</a></p> \n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned=\"\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CDqqbiWHNZZ/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

The art fund pledges to use donations to support the Beirut arts community impacted by the explosion in ‘transparent and flexible ways’, and will announce its methodology in the coming weeks. A statement from Mophradat on 12 August read, ‘We will direct 100% of donations to arts individuals and institutions while keeping in the spirit of our mandate, to support artists and thinkers, feminist and queer people and initiatives, and provide tools to help sustain practices rather than focus on individual projects.’&nbsp;<a href=\"http://mophradat.org/beirut-art-fund/\">mophradat.org</a></p> \n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CD1SVBjlV5y/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

and Gulf Photo Plus, Dubai’s centre for photography have joined forces for a print sale, titled For the Love of Beirut. Within 24 hours of the blast, they had rallied over 60 artists from 30 countries – all with personal connections to the city – to share images of personal significance that had been taken in and around the Middle East. Notable contributors include Magnum photographers Newsha Tavakolian and Peter van Agtmael; Pulitzer prize winning photojournalist Michael Robinson Chávez; and Beirut photographer Myriam Boulos, whose powerful images of post-explosion Beirut capture the urgent drive for change. ‘The contributions to the sale have been hugely generous, offering their most coveted work to support the city we love,’ say organisers Tanya Habjouqa and Mohamed Somji. Available to ship worldwide, the open editions are sized 10x15”, with all proceeds (net of actual costs) going to the Lebanese Red Cross.&nbsp;Until 26 August midnight Beirut time.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gulfphotoplus.com/fortheloveofbeirut\">gulfphotoplus.com</a>&nbsp;</p> \n<div class=\"media-element-container media-wysiwyg\"> \n <div id=\"file-287534\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg\"> \n  <div class=\"content\"> \n   <img class=\"media-element file-wysiwyg\" data-delta=\"1\" src=\"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/myriam_boulos_feed.jpg?itok=vzb6yOqo\" width=\"944\" height=\"1416\" alt=\"\" />\n  </div> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div class=\"image-caption\"> \n <p>An image by Lebanese photographer Myriam Boulos, shot the day after the Beirut blast: ’Ahmad takes a break to pray in Mar Mikhael.

Based in Brussels and with backgrounds in architecture and fashion respectively, the pair designed and made furniture for themselves, before launching their studio and debut collection this year.</p> \n<p>While working at architecture practice Explorations Architecture, Decommer had collaborated with Dominique Perrault on new furniture for Paris’ Bibliothèque Nationale, sparking his interest in design. Delaunay studied fine art and developed his scenographic approach working as a visual merchandiser for Ralph Lauren and <a href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/tags/paul-smith\" title=\"Paul Smith\">Paul Smith</a>; he currently divides his time between Paris and Brussels, working for Chloé.</p> \n<p>‘I am more technical, Hugues is more conceptual and colour-minded. We complement each other,’ says Decommer. ‘We like geometry and symmetry, but we also like asymmetry and breaking the visual balance,’ adds Delaunay.</p> \n<div class=\"image-caption\"> \n <div class=\"media-element-container media-wysiwyg\"> \n  <div id=\"file-287390\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg\"> \n   <div class=\"content\"> \n    <img alt=\"White surface table tops with colourful elements\" class=\"media-element file-wysiwyg\" data-delta=\"3\" src=\"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/cobra_jeroenverrecht_5470.jpg?itok=lSDWLj0h\" width=\"1460\" height=\"2092\" />\n   </div> \n  </div> \n </div> \n <p>&nbsp;</p> \n <p>The volumes supporting the table tops emerge from the simple white surfaces </p>\n</div> \n<h2>Solids by Cobra Studios</h2> \n<p>Two years in the making, Cobra Studios’ debut collection, Solids, is inspired by Roman ruins, which the designers have studied during trips to the Italian capital, and which have fascinated Decommer since childhood. In particular, he was interested in how these ancient elements are at once disconnected from and coexist with the modern city. The new designs are based on ‘a vision of a Roman Forum’; majestic columns and walls are translated into a series of pure shapes made out of resin in bright jewel hues. These elements pierce through simple white tabletops, in tactile, sanded acrylic with a chalky finish, that appear to float.</p> \n<p>While the dining table and a low coffee table were planned from the start, the third element, a side table, was created to make use of leftover shapes. The tables’ names nod to their classical inspiration: ‘Cicero’ (the dining table), ‘Santa Maria dei Clarici’ (the coffee table), and ‘Priape’ (the side table). Completing the collection is the ‘Otho’ lamp, with steel tubes and textured glass, that references postmodern forms.</p> \n<h2>Design process</h2> \n<p>Throughout the design process, Decommer and Delaunay experimented with materials and played with found objects. For production, they worked with friends and people in their local creative community, learning along the way. ‘We want to create our own identity and our own entity,’ says Decommer, adding that they want to continue combining design and production, overseeing every element themselves, keeping things at a manageable scale. But they recognise the opportunities that come from sharing ideas and being open.</p> \n<div class=\"image-caption\"> \n <div class=\"media-element-container media-wysiwyg\"> \n  <div id=\"file-287392\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg\"> \n   <div class=\"content\"> \n    <img alt=\"Tables from Cobra Studios\" class=\"media-element file-wysiwyg\" data-delta=\"5\" src=\"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/cobra_jeroenverrecht_5377_0.jpg?itok=KLOqjkEu\" width=\"1460\" height=\"2093\" />\n   </div> \n  </div> \n </div> \n <p>&nbsp;</p> \n <p>The Cicero dining table is created as a combination of geometric volumes, with a contrast between the silky grey top and legs in various bright shades </p>\n</div> \n<h2>Brussels</h2> \n<p>Their home city is an important influence on their work. ‘When we arrived in Brussels six years ago there was an underground design scene, but now you have the impression that the city and the authorities are pushing that forward to create a vibrant place,’ says Decommer, referencing projects such as the Kanal Centre Pompidou, which opened in 2018.</p> \n<p>‘The city is generating excitement about where it can go and what could happen in the next few years; everybody’s going with that flow. It’s eclectic.’ The duo’s predominantly Turkish neighbourhood has also been an inspiration, and they are currently looking at earthy materials, such as terracotta and stone, and working on a collection that will incorporate more varied visual elements.</p> \n<p>Other upcoming projects include private commissions, as well as a collection of seating (‘We need chairs, so let’s just design them ourselves and try to have fun in the process,’ they say), and designs inspired by architectural elements such as arches (they have been looking at Rome’s Palazzo della Civiltà Italiana). The pair are also exploring reusing and recycling materials and objects, including their left-over resin stock, to create new pieces. The Solids collection is a firm start from a studio full of promise. §</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~4/-MWKc7BJgtI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 14 Aug 2020 10:48:48 +0000","feedId":9788,"bgimg":"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/wp_large/s3/2020/08/cobra_jeroenverrecht_5425.jpg","linkMd5":"cfb396355f07938fdd38e6a01c46f9b6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn84@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-35-14-822_fc881358d998198e.webp","destWidth":848,"destHeight":565,"sourceBytes":65677,"destBytes":27908,"author":"","enclosureType":"image/jpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/wp_large/s3/2020/08/cobra_jeroenverrecht_5425.jpg","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/cobra_jeroenverrecht_5470.jpg?itok=lSDWLj0h":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn38@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-35-18-057_2e4d105e2fdb21d4.webp","https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/cobra_jeroenverrecht_5377_0.jpg?itok=KLOqjkEu":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn49@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-35-19-952_c8a745e4da058430.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~4/-MWKc7BJgtI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn40@2020_6/2020/08/25/00-35-18-327_8749074c707e2af7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598315696879},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:34:56","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:34:56","title":"Nyyukin gives Brutalist-inspired jewellery a playful spin","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~3/-drmWf5mku0/nyyukin-brutalist-inspired-jewellery","description":"<p>Sharp edges are juxtaposed against curves in a new <a href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/tags/jewellery\" title=\"Jewellery\">jewellery</a> collection from German brand Nyyukin, which has been inspired by the&nbsp;rough façades of a city for a new family of stainless steel cuffs.</p> \n<p>The metal’s hard-wearing nature made it an organic choice for the strong curl of the 003 cuff, although its natural rawness appealed too. ‘We have used both titanium and stainless steel in our designs; these raw, sturdy, functional materials are most often used in buildings, spacecrafts and tech products,’ says Vera Henco, founder and head of the brand. ‘Yet when treated right, they can suddenly be turned into super sleek, dainty pieces of jewelry.

The initiative has attracted some of London’s brightest talents to submit thought-provoking ideas that address health, sustainability and the environment.</p>\n<p>The shortlist, featuring all BAME-led practices, has just been announced, and the final winner of the competition will be commissioned to design one of Brick by Brick’s small site projects, due to start in the autumn. As well as a search for a bold new idea, the competition has been an important way for Brick By Brick to meet new architects with ethnically-diverse workforces, better reflective of the Croydon community it works with.</p>\n<p>The six shortlisted practices each demonstrated a variety of approaches, starting points and concepts. Through their design, Architecture Doing Place, researched supply chains, economic opportunities, and social mobility that occurs during the exchange from taxpayers, councils, and their investments. Gbolade Design Studio’s community living design encourages strong, integrated and extraordinary neighbourhoods through design. Similarly prioritising outstanding quality and great design, Kristofer Adelaide Architecture was inspired by Berthold Lubetkin’s quote, ‘Nothing is too good for ordinary people’.</p>\n<div class=\"media-element-container media-wysiwyg\">\n<div id=\"file-287452\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n    <img alt=\"Nimtim design\" class=\"media-element file-wysiwyg\" data-delta=\"1\" src=\"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/nimtim_architects.jpg?itok=tyq-falw\" width=\"1460\" height=\"2065\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"image-caption\">\nDesign submission by NimTim Architects\n</div>\n<p>NimTim Architects, also <a href=\"https://www.wallpaper.com/architecture/architects-directory-2020-nimtim-uk\" target=\"_self\">selected for this year’s Wallpaper* Architects’ Directory</a>, proposed a simple question to the people of Croydon – what kind of home and neighbourhood do you want to live in? While Jas Bhalla Architects chose to explore the typology of homes above linear retail parades, common in Croydon, showing how these often overlooked and undervalued places could in fact be generous and flexible places to live. McCloy + Muchemwa (supported by CZWG) used modular design and structural timber to think about sustainable building practices.</p>\n<p>Chloe Phelps, Head of design and commercial at Brick By Brick / Common Ground Architecture, said: ‘This competition has introduced us to lots of talented architects that we were not previously aware of. It has been a great opportunity to stand back and reflect on who is designing our homes and to make sure that they represent the diversity of Croydon, and to encourage other organisations to do the same. We’re really excited to see what the final six teams will produce and how their ideas can be incorporated into our development programme to bring about a permanent change.’</p>\n<div class=\"media-element-container media-wysiwyg\">\n<div id=\"file-287453\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n    <img alt=\"Jas Bhalla design\" class=\"media-element file-wysiwyg\" data-delta=\"2\" src=\"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/jas_bhalla_architects.jpg?itok=FwOeudV1\" width=\"1460\" height=\"1141\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"image-caption\">\nDesign submission by Jas Bhalla Architects\n</div>\n<p>The Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust was an ideal collaborator to help Brick By Brick reach this diverse talent.

This year, in the midst of Covid-19, conditions were a little different. Adamant that the show must go on, the gallery adopted for a pared-back approach, moving from a physical exhibition to the digital realm. For ‘Embark III’, eight artists were shortlisted including Mausham Raj Manglla who is exhibiting vivid watercolour portraits and Kavya Kumar Bhatt, whose intricate and surreal ink compositions use the stippling technique to create an air of visual deception. As part of its push to celebrate young art, Gallery Ark has forgone its commission, with artists receiving 100 per cent revenue from sales of their work. ‘As a part of the contemporary art ecosystem, we felt it was important to create a platform to support promising talent at this critical point in their careers,’ says gallery director, Nupur Dalmia. ‘This year, the logistics of selection and display were much trickier, but we are delighted to finally have been able to pull off the exhibition in its digital iteration.’&nbsp;<a href=\"https://theark.in\">theark.in</a>; <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/gallery_ark/?hl=en\">@gallery_ark</a></p> \n<blockquote>\n <p> The New Artist </p>\n</blockquote> \n<div class=\"media-element-container media-wysiwyg\"> \n <div id=\"file-287474\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg\"> \n  <div class=\"content\"> \n   <img class=\"media-element file-wysiwyg\" data-delta=\"2\" src=\"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/anusheh-zia-ravine-2020_0.jpg?itok=x1Er46IX\" width=\"1416\" height=\"944\" alt=\"\" />\n  </div> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div class=\"image-caption\">\n  Anusheh Zia, \n <em>Ravine</em>,&nbsp;2018. \n <em>© Anusheh Zia / Image Courtesy of Anusheh Zia</em> \n</div> \n<p>An online residency programme spotlighting recent graduates from across the UK, The New Artist was launched in early August in direct response to the pandemic’s effects on emerging artists at critical points in their careers.

In October, he is curating the Palazzo Monti degree show, which&nbsp;showcases&nbsp;works by 18 students from academies across Italy, followed by a show of artists (mostly under the age of 30) at Mana Contemporary in New Jersey. §&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.palazzomonti.org\">palazzomonti.org</a>; <a href=\"https://www.aucart.com\">aucart.com</a></p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~4/dOToBiYJLeQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 21 Aug 2020 14:13:03 +0000","feedId":9788,"bgimg":"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/wp_large/s3/2020/08/oscar-yi-hou.jpg","linkMd5":"5cf266920ff1d402362cc1c4815f24c2","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn20@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-35-14-787_9f974a761f1597a4.webp","destWidth":484,"destHeight":565,"sourceBytes":63702,"destBytes":58754,"author":"","enclosureType":"image/jpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/wp_large/s3/2020/08/oscar-yi-hou.jpg","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/responses-to-urvashi_0.jpg?itok=WRpBRPWG":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn70@2020_6/2020/08/25/00-35-21-402_7a05d5362aad6ced.webp","https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/alisa-omelianceva_0.jpg?itok=0pkkkbjx":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn86@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-35-18-896_8ffdd37f67b36c74.webp","https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/mausham-manglla-ark_02_0.jpg?itok=0EAJ-uJA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn28@2020_3/2020/08/25/00-35-20-478_b6ccb45d0431bf28.webp","https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/anusheh-zia-ravine-2020_0.jpg?itok=x1Er46IX":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn88@2020_3/2020/08/25/00-35-16-180_8a6f5047e0a5781e.webp","https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/dsc_0029_2.jpg?itok=N-VrbERu":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn93@2020_6/2020/08/25/00-35-20-970_75fe9193e9fa2e68.webp","https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/unnamed-1_0.jpg?itok=uI45jzaA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn34@2020_3/2020/08/25/00-35-17-944_7246faaba3f6ab2f.webp","https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/nevine_mahmoud_1.jpg?itok=sX6cZ60J":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn12@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-35-16-435_3d66d007b69b91b2.webp","https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/lux.jpg?itok=JRCYgxvm":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn56@2020_6/2020/08/25/00-35-16-037_6af0b0ab439c0a2d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~4/dOToBiYJLeQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn24@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-35-19-669_4374c421ab189388.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598315696878},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:34:56","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:34:56","title":"Is this railway arch roastery the future of London’s coffee scene?","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~3/HmLxI2E0bVI/watch-house-roastery-coffee-shop-london","description":"<p>Though the usually teeming streets around Tower Bridge are eerily quiet for a Wednesday morning, there is a small, socially-distancing crowd outside the newly opened Watch House Roastery in Bermondsey. The smell of scientifically-brewed coffee has lured them from their pandemic hideouts.</p>\n<p>The space, tucked into one of the railway arches on Maltby Street, is welcoming; despite the urge of this writer to shy away from all forms of non-essential human contact, until the end of time. But Watch House’s well-crafted coffee might just tip into the bucket of essentialism. Head of Coffee Ryan Garrick, a self-styled brew nerd, is enthusiastic and knowledgeable; weighing his beans on scales to the milligram, while describing their origin down to the street name.</p>\n<div class=\"media-element-container media-wysiwyg\">\n<div id=\"file-287450\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n    <img class=\"media-element file-wysiwyg\" data-delta=\"2\" src=\"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/imgl5560.jpg?itok=M8X-J0lB\" width=\"1460\" height=\"1825\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>He talks about coffee like a sommelier talks about wine; noting the ‘balance of craftmanship and controlled precision’ required to make a truly great cup. He’s convinced there’s a market for exceptional coffee in the UK – think: £14 for a flat white – in the same way as very special wines. Although the price points remain closer to earth for the time being, Garrick (who qualified along with his Watch House team to the World Barrista Championship in Melbourne this year, since postponed by the pandemic) thinks the Maltby Street Roastery is the perfect playground in which to develop these ideas.</p>\n<p>After months of rigorous tasting trials, five beans (split into three ‘moods’ – Rituals, Ventures and Rarities) are available. The Businde variety from the Rarities collection is of particular note. ‘Coffee blossom, strawberry jam, Assam teaI,’ read the tasting notes. To this untrained palate, it simply tastes really good. ‘The average customer might not tell the difference in the same was as a coffee expert might,’ says Garrick. ‘But it’s about the pursuit of better.’</p>\n<div class=\"media-element-container media-wysiwyg\">\n<div id=\"file-287449\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n    <img alt=\"Coffee product from Watch House Roastery in London\" class=\"media-element file-wysiwyg\" data-delta=\"1\" src=\"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/embed_watch-house-businde.jpg?itok=OiOeOzWq\" width=\"887\" height=\"940\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The space – which is one part coffee shop three parts experimental laboratory – was designed by London-based architecture and design studio (and Square Mile Coffee veterans) Kirkwood McCarthy. A U-shaped bar made from the same terracotta bricks that scale the walls is an impressive focal point of the arched building, which used to house Monmouth Coffee. Floor-to-ceiling windows offer views of the roaster and training room, giving visitors behind-the-scenes access to the Modern Coffee experience. At the back, a quiet ‘cupping room’ is the training ground for Watch House baristas and will be open for customer tastings and workshops as lockdowns ease. The darkened space (a cooling respite from this summer’s awkward heat) is separated from the factory floor by wooden sliding doors to create a fully immersive, and safe, experience.</p>\n<p>While the Maltby Street flagship is new, there are four other, smaller outposts dotted across the capital; meaning you shouldn’t have to travel too far to curb your Watch House craving. If you’d prefer to not leave your house at all, a recently launched subscription coffee service has you covered. §</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~4/HmLxI2E0bVI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 14 Aug 2020 13:19:28 +0000","feedId":9788,"bgimg":"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/imgl5560.jpg?itok=M8X-J0lB","linkMd5":"ec802ebbd1805f1e1b9937e4d23ac5b9","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn48@2020_6/2020/08/25/00-35-13-382_48019bcc080ff000.webp","destWidth":1460,"destHeight":1825,"sourceBytes":273046,"destBytes":197786,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/imgl5560.jpg?itok=M8X-J0lB":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn48@2020_6/2020/08/25/00-35-13-382_48019bcc080ff000.webp","https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/embed_watch-house-businde.jpg?itok=OiOeOzWq":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn57@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-35-20-673_58fc88f5ba3efed2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~4/HmLxI2E0bVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn24@2020_4/2020/08/25/00-35-21-082_75c9b965083ae460.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598315696879},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:34:56","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:34:56","title":"The minimal shapes of Studio Khachatryan","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~3/ff51rducqek/studio-khachatryan-st-vincent-antwerp","description":"<p>Multidisciplinary <a href=\"https://www.wallpaper.com/tags/antwerp\" target=\"_blank\">Antwerp</a> space St Vincent presents a summer exhibition of works by Studio Khachatryan, with a range of works including <a href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/tags/lighting\" title=\"Lighting\">lighting</a>, furniture and objects.</p> \n<p>Founded by Armenian, Belgium-based Noro Khachatryan in 2010, the studio operates with a multidisciplinary approach, touching upon product and <a href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/tags/furniture-design\" title=\"Furniture design\">furniture design</a> as well as architecture and <a href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/tags/sculpture\" title=\"Sculpture\">sculpture</a> with a distinctively sleek aesthetic, attention to craftsmanship techniques and natural materials. The exhibition will show limited edition pieces designed between 2016 and 2020, exploring Khachatryan’s mathematical approach to design and the pure visual language of his works.</p> \n<p>All pieces in the exhibition can be traced back to a minimal, archetypal design language, stemming from a varied pool of visual inspirations. The <em>Meronyms</em>, for example, are a series of abstract objects whose volumes reference classical urban architecture. ‘The structures in this series reflect the relationship between interior and exterior within the city’s public spaces, and the way this relationship is often translated by materials,’ says Khachatryan. Made of black Noir de Mazy <a href=\"https://www.wallpaper.com/tags/marble\" target=\"_blank\">marble</a>, the pieces eschew traditional functions, being defined solely by their structural inspiration – platform, corner and column – thus leaving the user to approach them functionally as they please.</p> \n<div class=\"media-element-container media-wysiwyg\"> \n <div id=\"file-287415\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg\"> \n  <div class=\"content\"> \n   <img alt=\"Meronyms by Studio Khachatryan\" title=\"Meronyms by Studio Khachatryan\" class=\"media-element file-wysiwyg\" data-delta=\"2\" src=\"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/meronyms_corner.jpg?itok=kG08l74f\" width=\"1460\" height=\"1095\" />\n  </div> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div class=\"image-caption\">\n  ’Corner’, from the \n <em>Meronyms</em> collection \n</div> \n<p>Other pieces in the show include the <em>Jag</em> bronze candle holders, the <em>If</em> side tables in marble and brass and the slim <em>Dy</em> pendant lamp. Every object by Studio Khachatryan is the result of a precise composition of geometries, and is enriched by the material palette and by the technical precision with which it is assembled.</p> \n<p>For the occasion, Khachatryan will also unveil the <em>Post</em> tables, a pair of plinth-like objects made of two intersecting white onyx volumes. Once again, the functional approach is left to the user, with shapes that can suggest a more domestic direction or become a white canvas-like display element.</p> \n<p>A self-proclaimed materialist, through this body of work Khachatryan demonstrates the potential richness of a minimalist design language, and the fine line between function&nbsp;and abstraction. §</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~4/ff51rducqek\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 09:58:03 +0000","feedId":9788,"bgimg":"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/wp_large/s3/2020/08/if_series.2.1.jpg","linkMd5":"7447ae5766e51d1c2f096ce8802f0212","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn4@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-35-14-755_c49d96b7a7d2704a.webp","destWidth":424,"destHeight":565,"sourceBytes":25111,"destBytes":18344,"author":"","enclosureType":"image/jpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/wp_large/s3/2020/08/if_series.2.1.jpg","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/meronyms_corner.jpg?itok=kG08l74f":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn20@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-35-21-118_2e13e87de57c898a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~4/ff51rducqek":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn82@2020_6/2020/08/25/00-35-19-517_cbf6bdb58b6d6d82.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598315696879},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:34:56","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:34:56","title":"The Zurich List: art, culture, design and architecture in Mitteleuropa’s most handsome city","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~3/Zxfhaq4HSRs/the-zurich-list-art-culture-design-architecture","description":"<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~4/Zxfhaq4HSRs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 18 Aug 2020 12:00:42 +0000","feedId":9788,"bgimg":"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/wp_large/s3/2020/08/z2_2.jpg_1033x1547.jpg","linkMd5":"e3cb7ed672038c1718982277df55e6c7","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn16@2020_4/2020/08/25/00-35-15-875_5b9c59ea96fb845b.webp","destWidth":377,"destHeight":565,"sourceBytes":43845,"destBytes":37776,"author":"","enclosureType":"image/jpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/wp_large/s3/2020/08/z2_2.jpg_1033x1547.jpg","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~4/Zxfhaq4HSRs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn90@2020_6/2020/08/25/00-35-18-106_b31466cad74ca9ed.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598315696878},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:34:56","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:34:56","title":"Scents to savour: Perfumer H transforms smells into tastes ","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~3/LA4yG9yp-wo/savoury-scents-perfumer-h-transforms-scents-into-tastes","description":"<p>Cucumber, pear, and salt might sound like ingredients better suited to a dinner plate than a perfume bottle, but British perfumer <a href=\"https://www.wallpaper.com/tags/lyn-harris\" target=\"_self\">Lyn Harris</a> has transformed those familiar flavours into sensory delights well-matched to both.

The house renovation has a unique new upper volume crafted in sheet metal. Its shape, which curves, shifts and folds around the lower level, has been extruded from imaginary lines extended from the urban planning regulation lines of the residential street.</p>\n<p>‘We are often inspired by industrial architecture,’ says Pietro Ferrario, principal at Oasi Architects. ‘There is something simple in its expression and clear in its execution.’</p>\n<p>There isn’t much industrial architecture in this quiet suburb, but the project required a refreshing approach. The former house on the site had been built in the 1990s and defied many of the local planning laws, leaving it essentially illegal. Working with the plot was always going to be tricky, but the client and architect worked together to make something of it. The client, a contractor who built the project himself, was aware of the legal problems associated with the house when he bought it cheap because of them. He called up Oasi Architects who gave him the confidence to take on the project.</p>\n<div class=\"media-element-container media-wysiwyg\">\n<div id=\"file-287287\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n    <img alt=\"Exterior and swimming pool\" class=\"media-element file-wysiwyg\" data-delta=\"1\" src=\"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/20200518_mg_5289_segrate_172.jpg?itok=dL34B7fm\" width=\"1460\" height=\"2190\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Instead of a limitation, the architects used this as a starting point to shape the new design. Giving a new sense of character to the house, they defined the perimeter and shape of the new first floor by extruding the curves and alignments from the imaginary legal lines that the new house had to follow.</p>\n<p>When they took the design to the local administrators, they loved the project, and even encouraged them to use a unique material for the facade. The contractor chose a metal facade system that was to give the house an industrial character.</p>\n<div class=\"media-element-container media-wysiwyg\">\n<div id=\"file-287373\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n    <img alt=\"Interior\" class=\"media-element file-wysiwyg\" data-delta=\"2\" src=\"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/20200518_mg_5009_segrate_92_0.jpg?itok=921E8-Ar\" width=\"1460\" height=\"2190\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>While inspired by the crude simplicity of industrial architecture, Oasi Architects start each project with the same question: How can architecture contain life?</p>\n<p>The interiors feature concrete floors at ground level and a grey stone staircase, however wood brings a lot of warmth.

But after visiting a few sites and convening with his wife and children, it became apparent that a tailor made house that is both contemporary and respects its context and doesn’t burden the environment was the right way to go for them. The result was Cold Spring Residence, a clean, minimalist structure nestled into a slope overlooking the Hudson River Valley.  </p>\n<p>‘I started with certain preconceived notions of what I wanted. A fairly minimal, barn-like structure,’ recalls Della Valle. ‘After a point I kicked out my preconceptions and the land took the lead. Now, when you show up to the house you have no idea how big it is, you just see a black box.’ One of the site’s challenges and key zoning conditions was that any new structure built there should be as invisible as possible and not obstruct any views - essentially, like it isn’t even there. </p>\n<p>This felt appropriate and fully in line with the family’s goals, who had specified the need for a structure that touches ‘the land as lightly as possible’ and is environmentally friendly. Della Valle worked with passive house sustainability standards to create his retreat, including solar panels for year-round energy, a well-insulated building envelope and careful management of the site’s water resources. </p>\n<div class=\"media-element-container media-wysiwyg\">\n<div id=\"file-287564\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n    <img alt=\"Della Valle retreat outside \" class=\"media-element file-wysiwyg\" data-delta=\"1\" src=\"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/2c6a3478.jpeg?itok=YqMjNKDH\" width=\"1200\" height=\"835\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The building, a two-volume structure with a black upper part and a sunken, exposed concrete lower half, may seem simple and fairly austere, but this was the result of an overall approach rather than simply an aesthetic choice for the family. ‘It’s the first time I had a completely empty canvas,’ explains Della Valle. ‘There is a degree of modesty, we didn’t want anybody to know it was here. By leaving the concrete and the wood being the only materials, we prioritised the landscape and nature.’ And while the building is in fact fairly generous, it does a great job at hiding its size within the slope remaining very low key and discreet – virtually invisible – from outside the property lines.</p>\n<p>This is an approach that resonates with Della Valle’s wider portfolio and ethos - his firm, Dumbo-based Alloy, is behind projects that offer a pared down, thoughtful simplicity, be it sensitive historical conversions or clean, geometric contemporary forms, both iterations often in the residential realm. ‘One design thesis of the house was that it had to be quite simple,’ he says. ‘I perceive my job as finding beauty in efficiency. We are trying to prioritise where the value is.’</p>\n<p>His family certainly helped with decision-making where needed, in what was, overall, an organic and peaceful process. ‘They were hands off but also completely there when I needed them – and set the primary goals for the project,’ says the architect. Now, the house caters for different needs, from relaxation and leisure activities through its generous living spaces, breathtaking views and outdoors areas and swimming pool, to casual workspaces – an office for Della Valle and a studio for his wife, an artist, both of which were used extensively during the recent pandemic-induced restrictions of movement in the State. </p>\n<p>As to whether the fact of being an architect as well as a developer made this process any easier for him, Della Valle explains that yes, it probably has: ‘I treated [the house project] a bit like my projects in the office. Once I completed my drawings, I didn’t want to make any changes. All of our time is very valuable, so once my family and I decided on what we wanted, I was very confident with those decisions - and I made a point of trying to decide everything in advance.’ </p>\n<p>Careful planning, a series of sustainability-led decisions, minimal decor and a collaborative approach between architect and clients led to a homely getaway that celebrates its site and is in tune with the context around it. §</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~4/8hjDECATdBE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 19 Aug 2020 10:14:17 +0000","feedId":9788,"bgimg":"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/wp_large/s3/2c6a3478.jpeg","linkMd5":"e61d38d5f4c4ff9ea499b43bc5d68d5c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn51@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-35-14-764_87544ae60bf2b974.webp","destWidth":812,"destHeight":565,"sourceBytes":123245,"destBytes":119112,"author":"","enclosureType":"image/jpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/wp_large/s3/2c6a3478.jpeg","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/2c6a3478.jpeg?itok=YqMjNKDH":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn4@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-35-21-122_dd98acb9842c72f7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~4/8hjDECATdBE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn65@2020_4/2020/08/25/00-35-19-286_c5345465ca792f43.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598315696878},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:34:56","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:34:56","title":"MoreySmith’s central London office champions a sense of belonging","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~3/JaUyZ2YDGiI/moreysmith-office-interior-central-london","description":"<p>The swift decline and practical obsolescence of the traditional office has been remarked on by many, not least the millions of us who are now adjusting to very different patterns of life and work.

This summer, the studio moved into new, self-designed offices in central London, set across three floors of a renovated Victorian warehouse, close at hand to the company’s other workspace, which is retained as a creative studio.</p> \n<p>Linda Morey-Burrows is adamant that although density is down, some form of human connection is essential. ‘I do think that social space will be increasingly important,’ she says. The MoreySmith offices include plenty of flexible, collaborative spaces, a place to eat together and a Yoga space. While expansion was necessary due to the success of the business, so too was the need to improve social distancing. To that end, no staff sit directly facing each other, with 2m of clear space between each workstation.</p> \n<div class=\"media-element-container media-wysiwyg\"> \n <div id=\"file-287509\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg\"> \n  <div class=\"content\"> \n   <img alt=\"moreysmith office desks\" class=\"media-element file-wysiwyg\" data-delta=\"1\" src=\"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/000052580001.jpg?itok=QwpxmIso\" width=\"1460\" height=\"2045\" />\n  </div> \n </div> \n</div> \n<p>‘People will want their own persona space but they also want to be treated well,’ she says of the industry in general, adding that ‘the desk could even die [completely] with new technology.’ Instead, MoreySmith imagine offices becoming more like hybrid spaces, akin to a library or university study area rather than a rigorous call-centre rows of desks or cubicles.</p> \n<p>Their new workplace allows the studio to practice what it preaches, with plenty of greenery, sunlight, and a natural but pared back palette of materials (it is after all a place for experimenting with different finishes and fixtures). Artwork is also given price of place, with ‘5th March 1972’, a 7.5m long piece by Bob and Roberta Smith, serving as a focal point, with its textured surfaces of recycled wood.</p> \n<p>Sustainability is just as important as the quality of the space itself and Morey-Burrows and her team have taken care to re-use and re-purpose existing furniture and fittings wherever possible, including ex-display <a href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/tags/lighting\" title=\"Lighting\">lighting</a> systems and a reclaimed timber floor.</p> \n<p>With their own space encouraging a more ascetic and focused attitude towards coming into the office, MoreySmith is also decoding a new future for their clients. ‘I’ve been looking at what materials are better for reducing virus transmission, like wood, untreated leather, copper,’ she says, adding that more research is needed into anti-viral design.</p> \n<p>‘I think that bigger brands and companies will have to work even harder to make their workspaces more attractive,’ she says, ‘it’s a bit like the struggle facing retail [before COVID]; those that did well created a more experiential shopping experience. The office is the same. Belonging and community are needed to draw people in.’ As for themselves, MoreySmith are proud to have created an office that ‘everyone was excited to come back to.’ §</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~4/JaUyZ2YDGiI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 10:00:00 +0000","feedId":9788,"bgimg":"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/wp_large/s3/2020/08/000052580009.jpg","linkMd5":"f67dcde51719565d833750dbe3b60276","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn88@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-35-14-713_6b5e5e97a33890fd.webp","destWidth":372,"destHeight":565,"sourceBytes":26473,"destBytes":17802,"author":"","enclosureType":"image/jpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/wp_large/s3/2020/08/000052580009.jpg","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/000052580001.jpg?itok=QwpxmIso":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn50@2020_3/2020/08/25/00-35-19-522_319f82fd1d45bd17.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~4/JaUyZ2YDGiI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn92@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-35-16-147_99c35cef7e972088.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598315696876},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:34:56","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:34:56","title":"The sustainable collection made using clothing from Ghanian markets","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~3/R-cz3mc9_R0/collina-strada-browns-upcycled-collection","description":"<p>When it comes to pushing the boundaries of sustainable fashion, few brands have been as committed to the cause as Collina Strada – one of the three ascendant labels in New York, which we have profiled in our September ‘Style Special’ issue, which hits global newsstands this week. Originally founded by designer Hillary Taymour as a line of handbags and accessories back in 2009, today’s Collina Strada has become an experimental platform for highlighting social issues and creating awareness in exciting wearable form.<br />\n <br />\nThis week, Collina Strada unveils an exclusive capsule collection, developed for Browns in London, which builds upon the ideas Taymour explored in her Autumn/Winter 2020 collection. Made by repurposing discarded secondhand clothing purchased at Ghana’s Kantamanto market in Accra that originated from the United States, both collections are a critique of the waste and pollution that comes with the used goods economy.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Collina Strada x Browns dress\" src=\"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/collina5.jpg\" /></p>\n<div class=\"image-caption\">\nCollina Strada x Browns\n</div>\n<p>Access to the fabrics was made possible through Taymour’s ongoing partnership with The OR Foundation, a US-based non-profit organisation disrupting the dominant consumer relationship with fashion. Dedicated to researching and exposing the ecological impacts of the fashion system, the foundation’s research project ‘Dead White Man’s Clothes’ – a literal translation of the Akan phrase for ‘second hand clothing’ – shines a light on the fact that over 15 million items of clothing from North America passes through Kantamanto every week for recycling, but around 40% leaves the market as waste, ending up in Ghana’s landfills, informal burn piles or even cast out to sea.<br />\n <br />\n‘I wanted to help bring awareness to the OR foundation and design pieces that can be sold online completely out of second hand waste,’ explains Taymour of how the collaboration came to be. ‘Every piece in this collection is made from t-shirts purchased in Ghana, [which] made it to the Katamanto markets that would eventually end up in a landfill. I went through hundreds of tees and individually laid out where each one would go on each garment with the pattern.’<br />\n <br />\nEach pieces in the capsule collection is conceived with an ease of wear. ‘[They’re] easy comfortable pieces that can go from day to night,’ she asserts. ‘These were all hand dyed and painted for the collection using interchangeable tie dyes [that] I have used throughout normal Collina Strada collections. Each garment is sewn locally and garment dyed in Bushwick.’<br />\n <br />\nThe garments are individually treated with an organic grid motif, which Taymour calls ‘Pool’. ‘I really am drawn to its fluid feeling as a dye,’ she shares. ‘It still feels like a tie-dye, without it necessarily screaming The Grateful Dead.’<br />\n <br />\nHolly Tenser, Browns’ womenswear buying manager, adds, ‘Hillary is one of the most relevant designers when it comes to conscious fashion. Her complete respect for the environment and the world we live in has been an integral part of her brand and ethos. She works with leftover fabrics to make her clothes and manages to draw prints or mix colours that are so powerful and unique, creating clothes that are instantly identifiable which is such an important attribute.’<br />\n <br />\nTo fully close the circle, Collina Strada will be donating a percentage of the wholesale cost – an amount that Browns has pledged to also match - to The OR Foundation. §<br />\n  </p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~4/R-cz3mc9_R0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 09:00:01 +0000","feedId":9788,"bgimg":"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/wp_large/s3/2020/08/collinaf.jpg","linkMd5":"5243f1b34e2d81d8af2ac8e8a0faf08b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn96@2020_3/2020/08/25/00-35-15-598_5ab4f8957ae63e80.webp","destWidth":484,"destHeight":565,"sourceBytes":49693,"destBytes":44654,"author":"","enclosureType":"image/jpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/wp_large/s3/2020/08/collinaf.jpg","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/collina5.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn83@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-35-17-871_2972ecf46081ced8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~4/R-cz3mc9_R0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn93@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-35-18-193_25d78b4e7729489d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598315696876},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:34:56","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:34:56","title":"Singapore Archifest pavilion ‘reclaims connectivity’ in an age of distance","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~3/MpEtzdxUlRk/reclaiming-connectivity-archifest-2020-pavilion-singapore","description":"<p>Singapore studio ADDP Architects and Los Angeles based OWIU Design have revealed their joint winning competition entry for a pavilion, which will be the centrepiece of this year’s Archifest event in Singapore this September.

While it was in a state of disrepair, the architects chose to preserve what was left, and built a respectful addition to create one of the exhibition halls on the same footprint.

For the sculptor and longtime New Yorker Rogan Gregory however, his recent move to Los Angeles and taking up a new studio space in Santa Monica was independent of the pandemic.</p> \n<p>‘I do a lot of work out in Los Angeles already, I have my foundries out there,’ shares Gregory, who lived in New York City for over 20 years before moving to Montauk and then to Amagansett in Long Island, where he’s lived full-time for the last five. ‘I’m very sensitive to the natural world and while I find and see inspiration in the change of seasons, I‘m more inspired by life; things growing and life-forms.

The minimal, warehouse-style space perfectly serves as a blank canvas for Gregory to sketch, mould and build his wide array of works, which range from statuesque, yet amorphous chairs, and sea creature-like pendant lights, to sculptural bronze floor-standing lights that resemble fauna. ‘It’s a very simple white box. I put a skylight in and a roll-down door, and that’s exactly what I need,’ he states.</p> \n<p>‘In LA, I have a lot more space, there’s less of a grind, I can think clearer. From an environmental standpoint, everything is more open and bigger in California. In Amagansett, there are a lot of trees, so your point of view is blocked. I love trees, don’t get me wrong, and I will miss them, but generally speaking, when everything is bigger, you tend to go bigger,’ he says, sharing that he’s currently working on a few outdoor commissions. ‘Obviously when you’re outdoors, the sky’s the limit.’</p> \n<div class=\"media-element-container media-wysiwyg\"> \n <div id=\"file-287239\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg\"> \n  <div class=\"content\"> \n   <img alt=\"Sculptures and reference objects on shelves in Rogan Gregory’s new studio in LA\" title=\"Artist Rogan Gregory’s new LA studio\" class=\"media-element file-wysiwyg\" data-delta=\"2\" src=\"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/rogangregorystudio_mr_skj_05.jpg?itok=9NZDp86T\" width=\"944\" height=\"1180\" />\n  </div> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div class=\"image-caption\">\n  Maquettes for commissions and an animal skull arranged on the shelves in Gregory’s studio&nbsp; \n</div> \n<p>‘Much of Rogan’s work is commission-based,’ says Evan Snyderman, principal of R &amp; Company, the gallery that represents Gregory. ‘What is unique about his approach is how much he cares about the way the work connects to the environment it’s created for and how it complements the architecture or the interior it exists within. Every single piece is made in his studio by his own hands, so there is a direct connection to the work, which in turn creates an energy. Clients are drawn to the gesture of a line or a form that alludes to the works’ sensuality.’</p> \n<p>Whether it’s the congregation of arching bronze lights that look ‘almost like aliens gathering before they get released’ or a striking black-and-white <a href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/tags/sculpture\" title=\"Sculpture\">sculpture</a> that Gregory refers to as ‘the horse’, which you can sit on and will eventually be realised in bronze, all of the work starts off as either a drawing or maquette.</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p> ‘I get up in the morning and draw, or I make maquettes. If I do that for two to three hours, I feel fine. It’s almost like therapy. If I don’t do it, then I’m grouchy’ </p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>‘I get up in the morning and draw, or I make maquettes. If I do that for two to three hours, I feel fine. It’s almost like therapy. If I don’t do it, then I’m grouchy,’ Gregory says. ‘Anything you can think of, you can realise the general idea of [in a sketch]. Making a maquette is a much more accurate depiction of what the eventual piece will be. It depends on the piece really.’</p> \n<p>With much of his inspiration drawn from the natural world, albeit loosely, like ‘thinking about what life could exist on an exoplanet or some liveable planet elsewhere’, or through a lens of weightlessness ‘like you’d find in the ocean’, there is a simultaneously organic and futuristic energy to Gregory’s pieces. The artist, who likes to surf and dive, says, ‘I imagine that a lot of animals that exist in the deep, deep ocean might be similar to what could exist in a place with a different atmosphere, different gravitational pull and the absence of light.’</p> \n<div class=\"media-element-container media-wysiwyg\"> \n <div id=\"file-287240\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg\"> \n  <div class=\"content\"> \n   <img class=\"media-element file-wysiwyg\" data-delta=\"3\" src=\"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/rogangregorystudio_mr_skj_06_bw.jpg?itok=TWwBQaGa\" width=\"944\" height=\"1180\" alt=\"\" />\n  </div> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div class=\"image-caption\">\n  Gregory’s\n <em> Asymmetrical</em> chair (left) and \n <a href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/tags/sculpture\" title=\"Sculpture\">sculpture</a> \n <em>Lazy Rider </em>(right) \n</div> \n<p>Despite producing more sculptural pieces of late, Gregory asserts that he does not have a preference for making non-functional over functional pieces. ‘I vacillate between the two. I don’t feel like I want to restrain myself. It wasn’t okay 10 to 15 years ago for people to do both the functional and the fine art, but nowadays [you can],’ he says. ‘I was a clothing designer for a long time, and you had to be functional. So I do come from the belief that things have to be well made. I just like things to be well made.’ §</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~4/srsCxvGzFRg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 10:46:10 +0000","feedId":9788,"bgimg":"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/wp_large/s3/2020/08/r_gfeature.jpg","linkMd5":"e10c98dea59317696cc718e17d24bd12","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn27@2020_3/2020/08/25/00-35-14-793_0d8c9a410a58dffb.webp","destWidth":484,"destHeight":565,"sourceBytes":21236,"destBytes":14596,"author":"","enclosureType":"image/jpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/wp_large/s3/2020/08/r_gfeature.jpg","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/rogangregorystudio.jpg?itok=5L5cGWW2":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn16@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-35-16-380_55b8ec006a930348.webp","https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/rogangregorystudio_mr_skj_05.jpg?itok=9NZDp86T":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn36@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-35-17-481_69d2749b69ec2c03.webp","https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/rogangregorystudio_mr_skj_06_bw.jpg?itok=TWwBQaGa":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn96@2020_4/2020/08/25/00-35-19-551_c87189ec37c2c040.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~4/srsCxvGzFRg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn40@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-35-19-793_6cd6175fb6150e79.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598315696880},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:34:56","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:34:56","title":"Francesca Venturoni’s Rome apartment renovation celebrates earthy tones","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~3/BgEmRve2lao/studio-venturoni-interior-design-rome","description":"<p>‘My career in London has allowed me to understand the importance of detail,’ says Milanese-based architect and interior designer Francesca Venturoni of her experience with firms like <a href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/tags/zaha-hadid\" title=\"Zaha Hadid\">Zaha Hadid</a> Architects and One Works. The devil is certainly in the detail for a new project from her studio – the interior makeover of an apartment in Rome.</p> \n<p>‘Everything must be in the right place and we should not be afraid to express bold concepts, even in a domestic setting,’ Venturoni continues.

Included in the product mix are Driade armchairs, <a href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/tags/kartell\" title=\"Kartell\">Kartell</a> lamps, a Magis chair and Flos lamp.</p> \n<p>The joined living and kitchen area is also where the studio takes some darker turns with the doors and kitchen units, bringing modernity to the heritage building that is a stone’s throw away from the Trevi fountain by architect Nicola Salvi and Giuseppe Pannini. In contrast, the gold detailing, and the mustard and blue soft furnishings in the bedroom create a more classic atmosphere that nod to the historic surroundings.</p> \n<p>Venturoni has studied and worked in from cities Phoenix to Copenhagen, and these influences can be seen in the apartment from the minimal sconces and table lamps to brass accents. While she is global in her inspiration, her heart remains in Milan and its innate culture of design. §</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~4/BgEmRve2lao\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 10:46:46 +0000","feedId":9788,"bgimg":"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/wp_large/s3/01_entrance_dining1_studioventuroni_phbonechi_trevi_rev.jpg","linkMd5":"19cdec868e916d2e3c4e2395f8872906","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn24@2020_3/2020/08/25/00-35-15-303_9753741af821cbfb.webp","destWidth":922,"destHeight":565,"sourceBytes":71682,"destBytes":57640,"author":"","enclosureType":"image/jpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/wp_large/s3/01_entrance_dining1_studioventuroni_phbonechi_trevi_rev.jpg","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/02_living4_studioventuroni_phbonichi_trevi.jpg?itok=bv7PMPbb":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn45@2020_6/2020/08/25/00-35-18-987_95c4d74bdefe8b3d.webp","https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/06_kitchen-2_studioventuroni_phbonechi_trevi.jpg?itok=F0Z536tO":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn31@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-35-16-645_207c2e241f593912.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~4/BgEmRve2lao":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn78@2020_3/2020/08/25/00-35-21-388_a1653f49b394f811.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598315696879},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:34:56","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:34:56","title":"Suburban Silicon Valley home provides a refuge for nature","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~3/gW6uzHpfGPE/dawnridge-house-field-architecture-california-usa","description":"<p>For Palo Alto based Field Architects, composing a new build home on a plot in one of Silicon Valley’s suburbs was all about connecting with the land; getting to know their site and making, not only the most its surface potential, but also ensuring the landscape has room to breathe and existing natural conditions are respected and incorporated into their proposal. The result is Dawnbridge, a private house created next to a creek and sheltered underneath large oak trees. </p>\n<p>‘Dawnridge re-envisions the site as a reawakened fragment of the natural environment settled in a developed setting,’ say the architects. Studying their parcel’s topography and native flora and fauna, the team identified their focus: to attempt to ‘revive a fragment of the area’s natural environment’, in what is an increasingly urban neighbourhood. </p>\n<div class=\"media-element-container media-wysiwyg\">\n<div id=\"file-287175\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n    <img alt=\"FIELD architecture Dawnridge facade\" class=\"media-element file-wysiwyg\" data-delta=\"1\" src=\"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/field_dawnridge_37.jpg?itok=8pYNrnEC\" width=\"1460\" height=\"1094\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>‘We designated more than half of the site as a natural, protected habitat, prioritising the restoration of an intermittent freshwater stream that winds along the northern edge of the site,’ continue the architects. The remainder of the plot – the chosen buildable area – is now occupied by a fairly low volume, softened by vertical timber cladding that guides the gaze upwards towards the trees and sky. Rounded corners and expanses of glass that create reflections and a dialogue with the garden reinforce the structure’s subtlety. </p>\n<p>The internal programme allows for generous spaces and comfortable living, but works in tandem with the landscape. The house’s only dining area, for example, is in fact located outdoors, blurring the boundaries between inside and out. Materials and colours (ash wood, light grey concrete) were selected to match the environment – built and natural. Tall ceilings, large opening and terraces make sure residents are continually connected with the garden. </p>\n<p>This residence was designed as a refuge – both for the family that lives in it, but also the area’s delicate ecosystem, championing an architectural approach that promotes health and wellbeing for all. §</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~4/gW6uzHpfGPE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 11:20:37 +0000","feedId":9788,"bgimg":"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/wp_large/s3/field_dawnridge_48.jpg","linkMd5":"e381dc337a76dbc2f20aa65d788c2bf1","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn36@2020_4/2020/08/25/00-35-14-783_0532dd2986ca92a3.webp","destWidth":424,"destHeight":565,"sourceBytes":46784,"destBytes":43820,"author":"","enclosureType":"image/jpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/wp_large/s3/field_dawnridge_48.jpg","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/field_dawnridge_37.jpg?itok=8pYNrnEC":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn100@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-35-17-010_fe5368e046e44005.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~4/gW6uzHpfGPE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn4@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-35-16-889_75f5ee9ad5e958e1.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598315696879},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:34:56","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:34:56","title":"Remembering legendary Brazilian modernist Jorge Zalszupin (1922-2020)","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~3/aI0hD7GsOJA/in-memoriam-jorge-zalszupin-obituary-1922-2020","description":"<p>The design world has lost a master with the passing of Jorge Zalszupin, aged 98 years. Polish by birth and Brazilian at heart, he lived life to the fullest, often describing his story as ‘a succession of miracles’ – a personal reflection no doubt born of the same innate elegance as his iconic furniture.</p> \n<p>He was born Jerzy Zalszupin on 1 June 1922 in Warsaw, Poland to Jewish parents. At the age of 18 he moved to Bucharest to escape Nazi occupation, graduating from Romania’s top architecture program in 1944. He began his career as an architect in France, rebuilding after WWII. Here, the lasting weight of war and unrelenting reverence for history and its traditions took a toll on this modernist eager to move forward.In 1949, he emigrated to Brazil, excited by the possibilities in a country that was rapidly modernising and becoming more politically and culturally progressive at equal pace. He was also deeply inspired by the innovative work of Oscar Niemeyer and other modernists of the time.</p> \n<p>Within a decade of arriving awestruck in Rio de Janeiro with no prospects or Portuguese language skills, the tenacious Zalszupin had made a name for himself, started a family, became a Brazilian citizen and launched his own architecture firm, Escritório Téchnico Prumo in São Paulo. He also started collaborating with Niemeyer himself, designing furniture for the most important commission in the country’s history, the sweeping new capital city of Brasília.</p> \n<div class=\"media-element-container media-wysiwyg\"> \n <div id=\"file-287579\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg\"> \n  <div class=\"content\"> \n   <img alt=\"Espasso trolly by zalszupin\" class=\"media-element file-wysiwyg\" data-delta=\"1\" src=\"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/zalszupin_trolley_2.jpg?itok=lF5WHYb5\" width=\"920\" height=\"564\" />\n  </div> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div class=\"mt-3 image-caption\">\n  Tea cart by Jorge Zalszupin, 1947. \n <em>Courtesy Galerie Chastel-Maréchal. © Agence Phar - J. Beylard et V. Luc</em> \n</div> \n<p>Zalszupin began designing furniture at the requests of his clients, who wanted continuity between the interiors and the modern homes and office spaces he designed for them. With a serious dearth of options in the market and a ban on imported goods, he began designing furniture and coordinating fabrication with a few skilled craftsmen. It wasn’t long until he founded L’Atelier, a design studio, manufacturer and retailer of high-quality modern furniture.</p> \n<p>The Poltrona Dinamarquesa, or Danish Chair was his first independent effort, and is considered an icon of <a href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/tags/brazilian-architecture-and-design\" title=\"Brazilian design\" class=\"word-link\">Brazilian design</a> – even with an overt nod to Danish masters Hans Wegner and Finn Juhl. The sensual curves of the arms and slim, tapered legs give it Brazilian flair, recalling certain architectural details of Niemeyer’s Alvorada Palace in Brasília. This is the point where Zalszupin’s legacy begins.</p> \n<div class=\"media-element-container media-wysiwyg\"> \n <div id=\"file-287580\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg\"> \n  <div class=\"content\"> \n   <img alt=\"Brazilian design sofa\" class=\"media-element file-wysiwyg\" data-delta=\"2\" src=\"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/06-espasso-brazilian-design.jpg?itok=4JArhS2S\" width=\"770\" height=\"472\" />\n  </div> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div class=\"mt-3 image-caption\">\n  ’Brasiliana’ sofa, by Jorge Zalszupin \n</div> \n<p>‘He is a legend of Brazilian <a href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/tags/modernism\" title=\"Modernism\">modernism</a>, who created timeless furniture designs of exceptional quality,’ said Lissa Carmona Tozzi, CEO of ETEL, who together with her mother, designer Etel Carmona worked directly with Jorge to reissue a range of his pieces in 2006. They ensured the longevity of the works by adhering to restrictions on many of the rare Brazilian woods originally used in the products, such as jacarandá or Brazilian rosewood.</p> \n<p>Other iconic pieces, like the Poltronas Presidencial and Brasíliana, or the Pétalas table series pushed Brazilian furniture manufacturing forward in 1959, pioneering the use of bent-plywood furniture construction in the country. While he was a master at working with native wood species, he also explored other materials with the same eye for innovation, from steel to marble to fibreglass and even moulded plastics later in his career. These techniques are now commonplace in Brazil, but before Zalszupin helped develop a more sophisticated supply chain, they weren’t.</p> \n<p>This lesser-known legacy as an industrialist, innovator and leader in an era of protectionism is significant too. ‘I’m not sure I could be a furniture designer in Brazil at this level today without the contributions of Jorge Zalszupin as a manufacturer, innovator and a businessperson. He and his teams laid the foundation for our industry,’ said São Paulo-based furniture designer Guilherme Wentz.The succession of miracles that Jorge Zalszupin saw as his life will continue, as his legacy inspires and supports designers, enthusiasts and industry professionals for generations to come. §</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~4/aI0hD7GsOJA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 18 Aug 2020 13:00:00 +0000","feedId":9788,"bgimg":"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/wp_large/s3/2020/08/jorgezalszupin.jpg","linkMd5":"a1b3baf61ee5d3e51495766c2f577185","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn11@2020_6/2020/08/25/00-35-15-929_82a404c5a891fe91.webp","destWidth":455,"destHeight":565,"sourceBytes":72016,"destBytes":70408,"author":"","enclosureType":"image/jpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/wp_large/s3/2020/08/jorgezalszupin.jpg","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/zalszupin_trolley_2.jpg?itok=lF5WHYb5":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn99@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-35-20-577_341635f64c7d0841.webp","https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/06-espasso-brazilian-design.jpg?itok=4JArhS2S":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn77@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-35-20-856_28a2c6136369db5b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~4/aI0hD7GsOJA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn22@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-35-17-922_480507ad4741342c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598315696878},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:34:56","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:34:56","title":"Dyson family plan to open art collection to the public with new gallery ","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~3/eIM5UYxlfZs/dyson-family-modern-art-gallery-dodington-park","description":"<p>For many&nbsp;private art&nbsp;collections, private is the operative word.

There are also many trendy, playful brands. Particularly when it comes to personalized paper goods, we found few offerings with a contemporary, clean and timeless aesthetic. We hope to fill that gap with a brand and set of products that celebrate a subtle, understated design, beautiful <a href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/tags/typography\" title=\"Typography\">typography</a> and a rich assortment of paper options.’</p> \n<p>Under their keen eye, the Montreal-based firm has selected paper stock made by a fourth generation family-run mill in the United States. Apart from its papers’ exquisite quality, the mill also uses steam plants, wind-powered energy and continually recycles water for reuse. Available in an array of textures and shades, the house collection of letter paper and note cards comes matched with its signature debossed envelopes in a winning shade of sage green.</p> \n<div class=\"media-element-container media-wysiwyg\"> \n <div id=\"file-286921\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg\"> \n  <div class=\"content\"> \n   <img class=\"media-element file-wysiwyg\" data-delta=\"2\" src=\"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/set_catalonia.jpg?itok=ga7E-Frb\" width=\"1460\" height=\"1825\" alt=\"\" />\n  </div> \n </div> \n</div> \n<p>Better still, Maurèle invites customers to create their own personalized stationery from a series of templates inspired by the desks of some very famous creative figures. Whether it’s the oversized, bold centered type of the Catalonia, which mirrors the personal stationery of Salvador Dali (granted his moniker used to take up 1/3 of a page), or the minimalist, mirrored proportions of the Taliesin, a tribute to the personal letterheads of both Frank Lloyd Wright and Helmut Lang, each template can be further tailored to one’s tastes by selecting from Maurèle‘s library of typefaces, which have been curated from the world’s most foremost foundries.</p> \n<p>‘We became obsessed,’ de la Montagne recalls. ‘We spent months scouring the web, blogs and our design networks to come up with a list of type designers and type foundries from different corners of the globe. We wanted to curate an assortment that featured both big and smaller foundries as well as independent type designers not tied to a particular studio. We collaborated with a handful of really talented designers to grow our list of potential fonts to 60. We then spent countless hours debating and refining until we whittled that number down to 13.

The significant UK label has gained a new logo for its capsule collection, launching this week. The cube-shaped logo, rendered in shades of grey, appears on each piece, including t-shirts, socks, coach jackets and bucket hats. It’s a bold move for the label, which has ‘consciously avoided’ emphasising logos in the past, says co-founder Jimmy Collins.</p> \n<p>But, in a time of forced disconnection, YMC looked to a friendly face to work on the project, as a way of introducing a revitalised energy. Family friend Pref, a British graphic artist working in <a href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/tags/typography\" title=\"Typography\">typography</a> and graffiti, has been known to the brand since childhood. He used the YMC (You Must Create) wording to inspire the logo’s design.</p> \n<div class=\"media-element-container media-wysiwyg\"> \n <div id=\"file-287410\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg\"> \n  <div class=\"content\"> \n   <img class=\"media-element file-wysiwyg\" data-delta=\"1\" src=\"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/000075270009_final.jpg?itok=y8wKxKY3\" width=\"1388\" height=\"1703\" alt=\"\" />\n  </div> \n </div> \n</div> \n<p>‘The unique combination of characters and words in the brand names and slogans gave me an opportunity to create something new with my style,’ he explains. ‘Each varying combination of letters offers different visual possibilities. My final aim is to create something that is technical and innovative but at the same time legible, simple and concise.’</p> \n<p>While 2020 is now known universally as a year of (not so great) surprises, YMC has relievingly provided us with its familiar, punk-ish and London-centric feel throughout the capsule, with the rejuvenated logo marking the biggest shift.</p> \n<p>All involved put the project’s success down to the neighbourly, collaborative tone of the partnership. ‘Working with Pref has been a collision of worlds in many ways,’ says Collins. ‘His work with <a href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/tags/typography\" title=\"Typography\">typography</a>, strong words and humour was the reason we approached him.’</p> \n<p>Pref agrees: ‘It’s important to curate the right artist/brand with the right style and ethos, more than anything else – once that’s done the rest of process should take care of itself. Each side of the collaboration must compliment the other and feel free to do what it is they do without being hindered. A successful collaboration should make it possible to stretch beyond what might normally be possible for each of the parties on their own.’ §</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~4/e1RKx0hhbvo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 17:01:45 +0000","feedId":9788,"bgimg":"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/wp_large/s3/2020/08/ymcf.jpg","linkMd5":"ebf1c18db6d791c574a1f41e0e202415","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn8@2020_4/2020/08/25/00-35-16-066_f55ae36bf5973aa9.webp","destWidth":484,"destHeight":565,"sourceBytes":28442,"destBytes":18330,"author":"","enclosureType":"image/jpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/wp_large/s3/2020/08/ymcf.jpg","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/000075270009_final.jpg?itok=y8wKxKY3":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn51@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-35-16-853_44fe4d943b80cede.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~4/e1RKx0hhbvo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn88@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-35-17-336_99ec5c0b3ab9cec1.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598315696879},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:34:56","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:34:56","title":"Designer Norma Kamali’s morning meditation routine","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~3/upbYa8ohbik/designer-norma-kamali-shares-her-morning-meditation-routine","description":"<p>Long before ‘wellness’ made its way into our vocabulary, Norma Kamali was putting <a href=\"https://www.wallpaper.com/tags/wellness\" target=\"_self\">healthy rituals</a> at the heart of her brand.

With the puffer coat and high heeled sneaker among her other design innovations, she has always been one step ahead.</p>\n<p>Growing up in NYC in the 1950s, Kamali’s mother was an advocate for juicing, encouraging a life-long dedication to plant-based living.

Preparation for sleep begins the minute you wake and everything you do throughout the day affects your sleep, not just when you put your head on the pillow.</p>\n<p>Here, the designer shares with us the seven steps to her healthy morning rituals - from sun salutations to steam showers and green juices.</p>\n<h2>Wake up early</h2>\n<p>I require seven to eight hours sleep a night and therefore I am in bed early to wake up at 5am. My bedroom is dark and the temperature cool and I wake up without an alarm. By waking up early I have time to follow my morning rituals. A good sleep is so important for me as it diffuses the stresses of the day, but I also find that many of my creative ideas come to me in my sleep, or just as I wake.</p>\n<h2>Brush teeth with tooth soap</h2>\n<p>The ingredients from tooth soap [sugar-free tooth cleaning droplets] work as a pulling method to remove bacteria from the mouth. I then use a mouth rinse called Swish that alkalines the body.</p>\n<div class=\"media-element-container media-wysiwyg\">\n<div id=\"file-287229\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n    <img alt=\"black and white illustration of woman meditating in leopard spandex and glasses \" title=\"black and white illustration of woman meditating in leopard spandex and glasses \" class=\"media-element file-wysiwyg\" data-delta=\"2\" src=\"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/normalife_body2.jpg?itok=BV_Qhfgj\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1697\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"image-caption\">\n<em>Illustrations by Gian Furlan </em>\n</div>\n<h2>Drink lemon and ginger warm water</h2>\n<p>I use lemon and ginger as a morning tea that is comforting but also helps with the elimination of toxins.

I dedicate my meditation everyday and my mind starts a creative idea process that works best in the morning. I have been practicing meditation since 1970.</p>\n<h2>Steam shower</h2>\n<p>Before I shower I fully do a dry massage with SMOOTH my exfoliant, made with charcoal and aloe and finely ground olive pits all over face and body. As the colour changes from black to a pale shade I enter the shower and rinse my skin to a smooth moisturised finish. I turn on the steam and breath in the moisture.

As a space focused on the wellness of the Black community, it’s important to us that we consider the relatively limited experience that the fitness industry has with Black people. When class concepts are born out of Black culture (such as hip hop dance), they are repackaged to serve predominantly white members. But much of fitness culture was born out of what has been popularised in our euro-centric society,’ explains Symone. <br />\n <br />\nSymone has been refining the concept since April 2019 and was ready to sign a lease on a space the week that New York City went into lockdown. While the opening of a physical space is still very much on the cards, Symone is currently crowd-funding towards the launch of a digital platform that will host guided meditations, provide fitness coaching, nutritional coaching, and facilitate community connections, that are targeted for the Autumn.<br />\n <br />\n‘Crowd-funding is a really powerful [tool] where we can put the power into the hands of the community, rather than people who are very far removed from the ones we are trying to serve,’ explains Symone about her chosen route.</p>\n<div class=\"media-element-container media-wysiwyg\">\n<div id=\"file-287188\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n    <img alt=\"man doing downward stretch against grey background\" title=\"man doing downward stretch against grey background\" class=\"media-element file-wysiwyg\" data-delta=\"3\" src=\"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/blaque4.jpg?itok=jeru_iRb\" width=\"1460\" height=\"2190\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>‘I feel often times that we don’t have so much autonomy over the companies that come into our neighborhoods. They’re just there and we take them. I felt like this was a great opportunity for our community to essentially vote for what they want with their own dollars. It’s about a cohesive community rather than one individual or a few individuals being able to dictate the world around them.’</p>\n<p>Ultimately, Blaque is set to be a place where the physical, mental, and lifestyle needs of Black people will be catered for. ‘The fact that we could walk into service-based businesses and just expect that whatever they offered didn’t work for us, it was just how life is – I felt like that was a problem,’ Symone shares about her motivation.</p>\n<p>‘I’ve worked in the fitness industry for ten years and even the geographical separation between where I lived and where I worked was a daily reminder of the prerequisite to distance myself from my roots to make a living in the fitness industry.’ she adds.</p>\n<div class=\"media-element-container media-wysiwyg\">\n<div id=\"file-287193\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n    <img alt=\"man doing side stretch against a grey background \" title=\"man doing side stretch against a grey background \" class=\"media-element file-wysiwyg\" data-delta=\"4\" src=\"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/blaque5_0.jpg?itok=5lsXCPYa\" width=\"1460\" height=\"2190\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>‘In order to access opportunity in the industry, I was relegated to serving a primarily white member base instead of my own community which is where the real need is. There is a wild juxtaposition between waking up at 4am to go to work in midtown Manhattan and improve the lives of people whose experiences don’t reflect yours while watching your own community’s health suffer.’</p>\n<p>And while Blaque certainly does not exclude people of other backgrounds, it is specifically designed to meet the needs of members of the Black community first. ‘There is something so unapologetic in the name, which I love, because it’s important to say who we are,’ Symone says. ‘We are very specific about who we’re serving and that’s a group of people that haven’t been served for a really long time. There’s really no shame in that.’ §</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~4/7HZCQRN7VzI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 08:00:00 +0000","feedId":9788,"bgimg":"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/wp_large/s3/2020/08/feature_blaque.jpg","linkMd5":"d1a0eaf57fe87725866877cdf17f630e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn28@2020_6/2020/08/25/00-35-15-834_cd0691bfdb8b5759.webp","destWidth":484,"destHeight":565,"sourceBytes":28733,"destBytes":20314,"author":"","enclosureType":"image/jpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/wp_large/s3/2020/08/feature_blaque.jpg","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/blaque_body3.jpg?itok=K322f91B":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn42@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-35-18-915_66c6eccaed49f699.webp","https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/landscape2_blaque.jpg?itok=0HYFnbi_":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn67@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-35-18-066_196e09ff802d80a1.webp","https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/blaque4.jpg?itok=jeru_iRb":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn28@2020_3/2020/08/25/00-35-16-524_69781b3481a5f00a.webp","https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/blaque5_0.jpg?itok=5lsXCPYa":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn98@2020_3/2020/08/25/00-35-18-382_e186a38d9276ba91.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~4/7HZCQRN7VzI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn2@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-35-18-961_5a5bcb2128990a37.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598315696879},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:34:56","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:34:56","title":"I do!

The Un-Signet Rough Diamond ring is designed to ensure all eight sides of the octahedral uncut rough diamond can be seen.

A proposed HQ for the Fabien Cousteau Ocean Learning Center, Proteus is designated to sit on a plot about 18m beneath the waves just off the Caribbean island of Curaçao.</p> \n<div class=\"media-element-container media-wysiwyg\"> \n <div id=\"file-287312\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg\"> \n  <div class=\"content\"> \n   <img class=\"media-element file-wysiwyg\" data-delta=\"4\" src=\"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/proteus_process-sketch_002_land.jpg?itok=gLNTX3B6\" width=\"1460\" height=\"853\" alt=\"\" />\n  </div> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div class=\"image-caption\">\n  Proteus early sketches \n</div> \n<p>The project has been a couple of years in the making. ‘Early in the project two years ago, Fabien Cousteau and I looked at many exploratory designs from the 1960s and 70s,’ Béhar explains, ‘it was a golden era of interest for the oceans pioneered by the Cousteau family history.’ The brief was to develop Proteus using new materials, especially composites, and create what Béhar calls a ‘a state-of-the-art scientific environment with a comfortable social interior space.’&nbsp;</p> \n<blockquote class=\"w-wide-quote\">\n <p> ‘I have always had a strong connection and appreciation for the ocean. There’s a respect for the ocean – its power and its mystery.’ </p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>This kind of lab is essential for long-term research, as they allow divers to become acclimatised to undersea pressures. Proteus is a modular design with space for up to 12 people at a time. ‘The technology to make Proteus a reality is here, from fabrication coming from modern hull design and the use of composite materials to sustainably powering the station with a mix of renewable sources including wind, solar and Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC),’ Béhar explains. For Cousteau, a permanent underwater research station is a lifelong ambition, one that aligns with a lifetime of involvement with studying and conserving ocean habitats. Béhar is totally on board with the ethos. ‘As a California resident and long-time surfer, I have always had a strong connection and appreciation for the ocean. There’s a respect for the ocean – its power and its mystery.’</p> \n<div class=\"media-element-container media-wysiwyg\"> \n <div id=\"file-287289\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg\"> \n  <div class=\"content\"> \n   <img class=\"media-element file-wysiwyg\" data-delta=\"1\" src=\"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/proteus_full_view_0.jpg?itok=OKXdE0b1\" width=\"1460\" height=\"1030\" alt=\"\" />\n  </div> \n </div> \n</div> \n<p>Ultimately, the Proteus station is projected to be around 4,000 sq ft, over three times larger than any other undersea habitat. Béhar’s early sketches show an organic circular structure, anchored to the seabed on legs, with a spiralling ramp connecting two principal cylindrical spaces. Mounted off the spiral are living and working pods, giving the facility the look of a piece of growing coral or an exotic shell. The winding ramp houses the common spaces, including the living room and galley and there’s also a moon pool, an open water dock for submersibles. Béhar is particularly proud of the inclusion of a ‘greenhouse’, a potentially vital source of fresh food for a habitat where open flames are banned. ‘The larger area is where scientists and aquanauts spend most of their indoor worktime. These are open and convivial as being underwater for weeks can be isolating,’ says Béhar, adding that the ramp is also a good spot for exercising.</p> \n<p>There are still details to finesse. ‘Most of the technology is available today, but some will have to be created as we go forward,’ says Cousteau, ‘For example, the submarine coupling needs to be determined. It’s a little like the International Space Station, when you have to couple other vessels to it. We have the same issue down below, but instead of the vacuum of space, we have to deal with the multiple atmospheres, or pressures, of water. It is also dependent on the type of sub used.’ Cinematic in scope and scale, Cousteau and Béhar are hoping that Proteus brings fresh awareness of the issues facing the ocean, as well as providing a platform for ongoing discovery. §</p> \n<div class=\"media-element-container media-wysiwyg\"> \n <div id=\"file-287294\" class=\"file file-image file-image-png\"> \n  <div class=\"content\"> \n   <img class=\"media-element file-wysiwyg\" data-delta=\"3\" src=\"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/screen_shot_2020-08-12_at_11.47.18.png?itok=VHe3zKA2\" width=\"902\" height=\"1270\" alt=\"\" />\n  </div> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div class=\"image-caption\">\n  Proteus early sketches \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~4/DUu_Vrjxt_I\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 12 Aug 2020 12:52:52 +0000","feedId":9788,"bgimg":"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/wp_large/s3/2020/08/proteus_process-sketch_002_feat.jpg","linkMd5":"73b383a6afcf0e0ff2fd9f2c3d7498ab","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn79@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-35-15-126_9b984e094a3ef639.webp","destWidth":484,"destHeight":565,"sourceBytes":50130,"destBytes":44560,"author":"","enclosureType":"image/jpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/wp_large/s3/2020/08/proteus_process-sketch_002_feat.jpg","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/proteus_process-sketch_002_land.jpg?itok=gLNTX3B6":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn81@2020_4/2020/08/25/00-35-18-866_feb6069001320504.webp","https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/proteus_full_view_0.jpg?itok=OKXdE0b1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn40@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-35-20-554_1fd110c15e14e867.webp","https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/screen_shot_2020-08-12_at_11.47.18.png?itok=VHe3zKA2":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn18@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-35-18-017_d1d1f0bd518bc60c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~4/DUu_Vrjxt_I":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn13@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-35-18-994_d772906f6b595fa9.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598315696879},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:34:56","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:34:56","title":"Melbourne’s MPavilion reflects upon its contribution to urban health","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~3/uroBMUEAFxw/mpavilion-book-naomi-milgrom-foundation-australia","description":"<p>Since it’s first edition six years ago, the MPavilion has become a highly-anticipated event for the city of&nbsp;Melbourne and all architects, collaborators and visitors involved.&nbsp;An initiative of&nbsp;the Naomi Milgrom Foundation, the pavilion is hosted in&nbsp;Queen Victoria Gardens and&nbsp;designed&nbsp;by a new architect each year.

At a time when home can feel isolating, the programme created a critical space for community, and the camera became a tool for students to confront unexpected circumstances.’</p>\n<p>Ranging from portraits and self-portraits to still-life compositions and everyday scenes in the home, the poignant images on display in the online exhibition reflect a vivid array of perspectives, styles and issues, while exuding a level of introspection and artistry that truly goes beyond the artists’ years. §</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~4/63XWSzJ_ANk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Sun, 16 Aug 2020 08:00:00 +0000","feedId":9788,"bgimg":"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/wp_large/s3/2020/08/april_riley_new-heights_feature.jpg","linkMd5":"09673563202183eabe0955536c767a65","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn91@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-35-15-685_2371b1cb53545d62.webp","destWidth":484,"destHeight":565,"sourceBytes":19989,"destBytes":16804,"author":"","enclosureType":"image/jpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/wp_large/s3/2020/08/april_riley_new-heights_feature.jpg","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/april_riley_new-heights.jpg?itok=4Cyy-fK6":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn50@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-35-18-418_cc57973d2863f9a9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~4/63XWSzJ_ANk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn23@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-35-20-391_6cdd8ee937427f4e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598315696879},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:34:56","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:34:56","title":"Artist’s Palate: Claudia Comte’s ‘Eggplant Baby’","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~3/AIARcD9fmiU/artists-palate-claudia-comte-eggplant-baby","description":"<p>Swiss artist Claudia Comte has had a meteoric rise in the past few years. From underwater cactus sculptures and dazzling Op Art interventions, to a forest of carved reliquaries and a functional fairground installed in Art Basel’s Messeplatz: her output is varied, memorable, and always characterised by a sense of humour. The same goes for her ‘Eggplant Baby’, a dish that she recently used to kick start the birth of her son, Kai Nikolai. The recipe originates from Scalini’s, an Italian restaurant in Georgia, US, and is said to have induced labour for more than 300 expectant mothers. As Comte recalls: ‘My partner, Samuel Leuenberger, prepared the meal for me, and remarkably within a few hours I was in labour!’ </p>\n<p><strong>Recipe for ‘Eggplant Baby’</strong></p>\n<p>‘The measurements below serve much much more than just a mother, baby, father family unit. It’s a dish that can be shared!’</p>\n<p><strong>Ingredients for the marinara sauce</strong></p>\n<p>2 teaspoons of grated garlic<br />\n3 teaspoons of olive oil<br />\n1.8kg chopped tomatoes (canned or fresh)<br />\n230g chopped onions<br />\n100g chopped parsley<br />\n1 teaspoon of oregano<br />\n1 teaspoon of grated red pepper<br />\n30g chopped basil<br />\n1 pinch of thyme<br />\n1 pinch of rosemary<br />\n1 teaspoon of salt<br />\n1 teaspoon of pepper</p>\n<p><strong>Preparation of marinara sauce</strong></p>\n<p>First, fry the onions in a large saucepan with hot olive oil. Add garlic and fry again for 1 minute. Now add the tomatoes and bring everything to the boil before you reduce the heat. Then put the remaining ingredients in the pot and let it simmer for 1 hour. Stir every now and then.</p>\n<p><strong>Ingredients for the eggplant and parmesan bake</strong></p>\n<p>3 medium sized eggplants<br />\n230g flour<br />\n6 beaten eggs<br />\n940g breadcrumbs of Italian bread (Ciabatta)<br />\n1.8 l marinara sauce<br />\n100g grated Romano cheese<br />\n100g grated parmesan cheese<br />\n100g chopped mozzarella cheese<br />\n460g ricotta cheese<br />\nOlive oil</p>\n<p><strong>Preparation for the eggplant and parmesan bake</strong></p>\n<p>Wash and chop the eggplants first (either with or without the skin is fine). Spread the eggplants on a paper towel and sprinkle them with salt. Put another layer of paper towel on top and weigh the whole thing down for an hour so that the excess liquid can flow out.</p>\n<p>Dip the individual pieces of eggplant one after the other in flour, beaten eggs and the breadcrumbs. You can then fry the eggplants in olive oil until they are golden brown. Spread the marinara sauce, eggplant, ricotta, parmesan and romano cheese alternately in layers in a baking dish until the baking dish is almost completely full. Then sprinkle a layer of mozzarella on top.</p>\n<p>Now everything goes into the oven for about 25 minutes at 190 degrees (please preheat).</p>\n<p>Bon appetit and good luck! §</p>\n<div class=\"image-caption\">\n<em>A version of this article originally featured in the September 2020 issue of Wallpaper* (W*257) – on newsstands now and available for free download <a href=\"https://www.wallpaper.com/design/september-2020-issue-free-download\">here</a></em><br />\n \n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~4/AIARcD9fmiU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 13:00:00 +0000","feedId":9788,"bgimg":"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/wp_large/s3/2020/08/untitled-2_feature.gif","linkMd5":"dd307c9f6e5d67f2ca075705f55e48fb","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn68@2020_6/2020/08/25/00-35-15-180_96fc07340878de3b.webp","destWidth":484,"destHeight":565,"sourceBytes":138157,"destBytes":14894,"author":"","enclosureType":"image/jpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/wp_large/s3/2020/08/untitled-2_feature.gif","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~4/AIARcD9fmiU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn8@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-35-16-928_e844a344b25acf31.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598315696876},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:34:56","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:34:56","title":"We’re adding these bucket bags to our summer style list","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~3/a-TsDMGeZdU/bucket-bags-women-ss20","description":"<p>You may have had an array of exciting activities doodled on your 2020 bucket list, most of which will now remained unticked.

This artisanal aptitude isn’t new – silk and cotton garments have been mended and patched together since the 17th century in Japan and, in North West Nigeria, indigo dye pits have been in operation for over 500 years – but it is enjoying a resurgence in menswear.</p> \n<p>Many of the pre-industrial production methods employed by the four designers featured here are intrinsically sustainable and culturally profound. Evidence of the human hand takes on a more significant role at this unparalleled time: it forces us to reconsider our own place in the world. &nbsp;</p> \n<h2>Prospective Flow</h2> \n<p><img alt=\"Prospective Flow\" src=\"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/flow.jpg\" /></p> \n<p>Prospective Flow was launched in Los Angeles in 2009 by three Japanese brothers with the founding motto: ‘Today is the future our ancestors dreamed of. Keep the heritage flowing.’ Daisuke, Yusuke and Kensuke Muramatsu are devoted to the concept of ‘Onko-chishin’, a Japanese expression meaning: the attempt to discover new ideas by studying the past through scrutiny of history. ‘There are a lot of things going on in the world right now – things are changing on a daily basis – and that’s why we need to maintain our concept even more,’ Daisuke says. ‘We still believe that the world is a better place today than it was in the past. The admiration of genuine products has been passed on from generation to generation.’ Their workwear-inspired clothes have a lived-in serenity. ‘Today, in the era of smartphones and social media, technology is evolving faster than ever. And although new technological advancements can be exciting, they can also become overwhelming. When it comes to garments that you are going to put next to your skin, people prefer the sense of warmth they can feel from something that’s made by hand.’</p> \n<div class=\"image-caption\"> \n <a href=\"https://www.prospectiveflow.com\" target=\"_blank\">prospectiveflow.com</a> \n</div> \n<h2>Adam Pogue x Smock</h2> \n<p><img alt=\"Pogue Adam Smock\" src=\"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/pogue.jpg\" /></p> \n<div>\n ‘It’s become too easy to throw things out and replace them,’ the Los Angeles-based textile artist Adam Pogue says. He has created a line of limited edition French workwear jackets for Mohawk General Store’s in-house line Smock: ‘We came up with the idea to make back and elbow patches that I would sew onto the garments – essentially they were like tiny quilts. Each one unique. I’d cut into the jackets and repair them and the patchwork became more random.’ Each vintage piece is appliqued with hand-dyed fabrics by Pogue and in true artisanal fashion, each wears its patina with pride. ‘They’re great because of the oil stains and wear and tear they’ve collected over the years which kind of gives a roadmap for each jacket to repair and reuse.’ Pogue who studied architecture and \n <a href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/tags/sculpture\" title=\"Sculpture\">sculpture</a>, first began crafting materials together to decorate his apartment, upholstering a sofa in Japanese boro-style. His serene constructivist collages champion a wider philosophy too: ‘If I can make something or repair something, (rather than buy something) then that’s what I’ll do.’\n <br /> &nbsp;\n</div> \n<div class=\"image-caption\">\n <a href=\"https://www.mohawkgeneralstore.com/collections/smock-x-adam-pogue\" target=\"_blank\">mohawkgeneralstore.com/collections/smock-x-adam-pogue</a>\n</div> \n<div> \n <h2>Monad London</h2> \n <p><img alt=\"Monad London\" src=\"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/monad2.jpg\" /></p> \n <div class=\"image-caption\"> \n  <em>Art Direction and photography: Ade Udoma and Michelle Helena Janssen</em> \n </div> \n <p>Much of our perception of textile craftsmanship is oriented around the ancient techniques of Japan with less attention paid to the Kofar Mata dye pits in Kano, North West Nigeria. ‘I grew up in Nigeria so I had an implicit awareness of African textile crafts but I didn’t appreciate it until recently,’ designer Daniel Olatunji says. Hearing about the indigo traditions of his homeland whilst a student at Central Saint Martins in London,&nbsp;Olatunji moved back after graduating and set about learning as much as he could. His clothes – made using antique linens and homespun cottons – reflect a new feeling in menswear that refuses to be rushed. ‘I enjoy the process of making. I find it very meditative. The first time I saw the Fulani tribesmen in the north of Nigeria that grow and hand-weave cotton I was completely awestruck. The looms are built by the artisans using materials found around them and recycling parts from previous looms. This is also a reaction to my time working for more corporate and commercial brands where you see so much waste,’ he says. ‘Reviving and maintaining these processes can go some way to creating a more sustainable model for our industry. And our planet.’</p> \n <div class=\"image-caption\"> \n  <a href=\"https://www.monadlondon.com\" target=\"_blank\">monadlondon.com</a> \n </div> \n</div> \n<h2>Koromo</h2> \n<p><img alt=\"Koromo Kyoto\" src=\"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/koromo.jpg\" /></p> \n<p>With their opulent use of boro – the patchworking technique developed in the north of Japan during the Edo Period – the Kyoto-based label typifies how we often expect ‘crafted’ clothes to look. ‘Kyoto is a place where the making of clothes enters the field of fine arts,’ designer Kayoko Kondo says. ‘In our current world of advanced mechanisation, without the feeling of love, we can’t work tirelessly in same way as hundreds of years ago. What’s most important with clothing is first that you just love it and second, that you’ll live with it your whole life.’ When the label launched in 2004, Kyoto’s antique markets were stuffed full of elaborate antique kimonos, whilst old pieces of indigo-dyed cloth were thrown away. Now things are different: ‘Once I sewed some boro cloth together and made it into a jacket. I displayed it in my shop and many people gathered around, some frowning, some smiling, some criticising it loudly. It felt like being at one of the amusement parks I had gone to as a child!’ Kondo says. Now, there’s been a global shift to revisiting tradition: ‘Just as a wild stitch can be more attractive than a neatly aligned seam, the heart may throb more for rough nonconformity than for pristine fabric. Craftsmanship is a sensory realm.’&nbsp;§</p> \n<div class=\"image-caption\"> \n <a href=\"https://koromo-kyoto.com\" target=\"_blank\">koromo-kyoto.com</a>\n <br /> &nbsp; \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~4/_sl_ADH-t4A\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 11:30:59 +0000","feedId":9788,"bgimg":"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/wp_large/s3/2020/08/monadf.jpg","linkMd5":"d4c95349b55390a856a7b7dc433255a0","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn55@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-35-15-455_1ae1bfc5d0ae46aa.webp","destWidth":484,"destHeight":565,"sourceBytes":16186,"destBytes":8852,"author":"","enclosureType":"image/jpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/wp_large/s3/2020/08/monadf.jpg","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/flow.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn72@2020_6/2020/08/25/00-35-20-167_c76aedd98f3a8194.webp","https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/pogue.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn36@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-35-18-282_7ae061e5245547df.webp","https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/monad2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn32@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-35-18-279_7b2540aad24b2825.webp","https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/koromo.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn56@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-35-21-303_1332051ac0352f91.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~4/_sl_ADH-t4A":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn56@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-35-18-423_1a3498bca516dcbb.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598315696879},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:34:56","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:34:56","title":"In memoriam: Luchita Hurtado (1920 – 2020)","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~3/TtcagJ4N_gU/in-memoriam-luchita-hurtado-obituary-1920-2020","description":"<p>Luchita Hurtado passed away on 13 August at her home in Santa Monica, California. She would have celebrated her 100th birthday in October.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Born in 1920 in Maiquetía, Venezuela, Hurtado spent the last seven&nbsp;decades investigating notions of universality and transcendence through a playful and ever-evolving practice. Ranging from abstraction and mysticism to landscape and the body, her experimental work&nbsp;has always aligned with important moments of her life.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Even though she spent most of her career away from the spotlight, the artist initially started to engage with paint in her teenage years: after immigrating to New York in 1928, she studied <a href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/tags/painting\" title=\"Painting\">painting</a> at the Art Students League. Her early work was abstract and colourful, mainly consisting of surrealist landscapes and tribal figures. At the time, Hurtado was associated with the geometric abstraction movement, and identified the canvas as a medium for intimate meditations on humanity, the cosmos, and nature.</p> \n<div class=\"image-caption\"> \n <div class=\"media-element-container media-wysiwyg\"> \n  <div id=\"file-287488\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg\"> \n   <div class=\"content\"> \n    <img class=\"media-element file-wysiwyg\" data-delta=\"6\" src=\"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/15.hurta95655-hires.jpg?itok=7T7J6r4c\" width=\"1460\" height=\"897\" alt=\"\" />\n   </div> \n  </div> \n </div> \n <p><em>Luchita Hurtado,&nbsp;Self Portrait,&nbsp;1973.&nbsp;© Luchita Hurtado.&nbsp;Courtesy the artist and <a href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/tags/hauser-wirth\" title=\"Hauser &amp; Wirth\">Hauser &amp; Wirth</a>.&nbsp;Photography: Jeff McLane</em> </p>\n</div> \n<p>In the early 1940s, Hurtado joined Dynaton, an international network of painters, writers, and intellectuals with whom she would regularly travel across the US and Mexico. The various styles she embraced spoke of her own experiences, as well as the places she visited: everywhere she went, the artist would draw on different values and movements, and adapt her practice accordingly.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Hurtado first presented her work in 1958, while taking part of a group show at the art centre in La Jolla in California. In the years that followed, she travelled regularly between Los Angeles and Taos, a small town in New Mexico. This peripatetic period saw a drastic shift in her creative process: highly influenced by the social movements that characterised the 1960s, she decided to leave behind abstraction to focus on producing naturalistic and figurative work. Among others, the artist developed a keen interest in the liberation of women, and gradually explored the female form in her work. This culminated in her series of contemplative self-portraits – the ‘I am’ paintings – in which she provides a personal and assertive perspective on femininity, while unveiling various aspects of sexuality through an intelligent selection of raw metaphors.&nbsp;</p> \n<div class=\"media-element-container media-wysiwyg\"> \n <div id=\"file-287485\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg\"> \n  <div class=\"content\"> \n   <img class=\"media-element file-wysiwyg\" data-delta=\"4\" src=\"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/8.hurta94362-hires.jpg?itok=FbWeAaWC\" width=\"1416\" height=\"944\" alt=\"\" />\n  </div> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div class=\"media-element-container media-wysiwyg\"> \n <div id=\"file-287483\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg\"> \n  <div class=\"content\"> \n   <img class=\"media-element file-wysiwyg\" data-delta=\"2\" src=\"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/13.hurta95571-hires.jpg?itok=MF_E0I84\" width=\"1416\" height=\"944\" alt=\"\" />\n  </div> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div class=\"image-caption\">\n  Above:&nbsp;Luchita Hurtado,\n <em>&nbsp;Untitled</em>,&nbsp;1969.

These works emphasise the connection between the body and the natural environment, a recurring theme for the artist.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The past few years were significant for Hurtado’s career: in 2018, her work was presented at the Hammer’s biennial exhibition, alongside installations by 31 other artists. A few months later, she was the subject of a solo retrospective at Serpentine Sackler Gallery in London, titled ‘I Live I Die I Will Be Reborn’, which articulated a fierce love of the planet and an urgent call to fight climate change. The exhibition travelled to LACMA in early 2020.</p> \n<p>‘We are close to committing suicide. This is not just a story, this is a matter of fact,’ Hurtado said of her environmentalism&nbsp;to the Financial Times last year . ‘There are far more species leaving than there are arriving, it’s all unbalanced.

While this time of year usually sees Beirutis and foreigners congregating in droves at the beach or having a festive dinner by the sea, the city was now in a two-week lockdown following a surge in Covid-19 cases. Most had just finished work and were inside their homes. The country was already reeling from a state of financial collapse, spikes in unemployment and even power shortages. But then something worse happened. Two massive explosions at the Port of Beirut resulted in a state of apocalyptic destruction that, at the time of publication, left around 220 dead, 400 still missing, 6,000 injured and 300,000 homeless in a matter of 24 hours. The blasts took place in a warehouse at the port after an estimated 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate, which had been stored on site for six years, exploded into gigantic clouds of white and orange smoke.</p> \n<p>While the reason the explosive material ignited remains unclear, no sight can parallel the destruction and utter carnage of present-day Beirut. At least 8,000 buildings, mostly located in the historic quarters and pulsating cultural districts of Gemmayzeh and Mar Mikhael, were damaged; according to Unesco, around 60 historic buildings are at risk of collapse. Many of the conversations in this article were interrupted due to the bad connection after the explosion.</p> \n<p>[embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/CD4GuRmpF1U/[/embed]</p> \n<p>‘The blasts destroyed the cultural heart of Beirut,’ said designer <strong><a href=\"https://roulasalamoun.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Roula Salamoun</a></strong>, whose office in Hamra was fortunately not as damaged as those in the epicentre. ‘We are going through erasure, and that’s very dangerous because we already went through it after the civil war [of 1975–90]. If we wipe out <a href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/tags/museums\" title=\"Museums\">museums</a> and institutions, then we wipe out our past and we wipe out our culture, our society and our heritage.’</p> \n<blockquote class=\"w-wide-quote\">\n <p> ‘The tragedy is that we are now just content at being alive – that’s how dramatic things have turned,’&nbsp;– Roula Salamoun </p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>Beauty has always sat alongside violence in Beirut. It is no stranger to destruction and its urban landscape reflects its wounds. The civil war left the city severely scarred with bullet holes that permeated its historic structures for years. Then in 2006 another Israeli invasion left the city in a state of shock. Rebuilding has become a constant in the Lebanese mind and character. But even as Lebanese and designers courageously move to fix their beloved, many affirm that this time reconstruction must be different.</p> \n<p>Rania Abboud is the communication director of <strong><a href=\"https://pslab.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">PSLab</a></strong>, a design and manufacturing company of site-specific luxury <a href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/tags/lighting\" title=\"Lighting\">lighting</a> products. Its Beirut headquarters is 500 metres away from the port. The blast left it in shambles, glass flew everywhere coupled with the blood of wounded staff.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"w-wide-quote\">\n <p> ‘One quarter of the city became white in the blast. It affected four of the most prominent streets in the city. Chaos was everywhere. I grew up during the war and I have never witnessed destruction like this,’&nbsp;– Rania Abboud, PSLab </p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>‘The only building that we might be able to save is the <a href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/tags/bauhaus\" title=\"Bauhaus\">Bauhaus</a> building on our premises. All the rest is gone.’, recalls Aboud.</p> \n<p>Located in Mar Mikhael, similarly near the port, is the studio and showroom of design duo <strong><a href=\"http://www.davidandnicolas.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">David/Nicolas</a></strong>, founded in 2011 by David Raffoul and Nicolas Moussallem. ‘For the first few days we were not even able to speak about what happened. It was so traumatic,’ says Raffoul, a week after the blast left their space in ruins.</p> \n<p>[embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/CDi7tNtnPj5/[/embed]</p> \n<p>Moussallem was just locking the door of the studio when the explosions happened. ‘The key broke in half,’ he remembers. He and a colleague were immediately blown through the glass and through the wall into the store next door. They quickly ran out of the shop, past the dead and the injured, covered in blood and trying to find refuge. ‘At first we thought there was a bomb in our space, but then we walked out and saw that the whole street was destroyed. We walked further and saw that the whole neighborhood was destroyed, and a bit more and we saw finally that the entire city was destroyed.’</p> \n<p>Raffoul was in the neighbourhood of Achrafieh, having just finished a gym session. ‘Nicolas called me and said, “David, there is no more studio,”’ he recalls.</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p> ‘We lost everything in one second. Material suddenly became not important when compared with our lives.’&nbsp; — David Raffoul, David/Nicolas </p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>Raffoul rushed back to save their archive, their key to being able to rebuild. The building where their studio is located is a historic structure, and while it can be fixed, the risk of something falling on it and damaging it again is high. While Moussallem and Raffoul aim to repair it, they are presently planning to invest more in their Milan space.</p> \n<p>‘We are not able to fathom the damage,’ says designer <strong><a href=\"https://www.nadadebs.com/en/home\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Nada Debs</a></strong>, whose boutique and studio in Gemmayze were completely destroyed. ‘If you saw this in a movie, you would say it was too much and that it looked artificial, and that you would have to reduce the impact!’</p> \n<div class=\"media-element-container media-wysiwyg\"> \n <div id=\"file-287659\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg\"> \n  <div class=\"content\"> \n   <img class=\"media-element file-wysiwyg\" data-delta=\"2\" src=\"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/rni-films-img-5f668a2c-4b72-424c-90e7-f766456962fa.jpg?itok=qCshRl3s\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" alt=\"\" />\n  </div> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div class=\"image-caption\">\n  A sketch of David/Nicolas’ ’Monocle’ cabinet lies among the debris of their destroyed studio in Mar Mikhael.\n <em> Image courtesy of David/Nicolas</em> \n</div> \n<p>Debs, like many architects and designers in Beirut, is eager to rebuild and stay in her beloved city, but not without a change. ‘All around us are these old beautiful homes with older people living in them, now completely destroyed, and that is heartbreaking,’ adds Debs, as she was walking to the protest that took place the Saturday after the explosion. ‘Most of the creative industry, all located in Gemmayze and Mar Mikhael, has been hit. Me and my team organised ourselves very quickly and now we are ready to help others. This is the way forward – we all need to support each other.’</p> \n<p>Located on Rue Verdun, one of the most prestigious streets in Beirut’s downtown, the flagship store of leading carpet purveyor <strong><a href=\"http://www.iwanmaktabi.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Iwan Maktabi</a></strong> was badly damaged. The brand’s antique carpets date back to the early 20th century in Isfahan, Iran, while their contemporary carpets feature designs from prominent brands including Jan Kath and CC-Tapis. There’s now a white piece of fabric hanging from the one of the windows, with English and Arabic writing declaring: ‘We are staying.’</p> \n<p>[embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/CDvUQq6Jhpq/[/embed]</p> \n<p>‘We have always been resilient enough to be able to keep rebuilding, but now I am offended when people call us Lebanese resilient,’ said Mohamed Maktabi, the company’s general manager. ‘The phoenix rising from the ashes — that’s what we always have been, but this time is different. I don’t want to build again — I have been building all of my life! I want to have the choice to die of natural causes and not like this!’&nbsp;But they, like many Beirutis, have vowed to rebuild, while knowing there is, as Maktabi says, ‘a high chance of it being destroyed again.’</p> \n<blockquote class=\"w-wide-quote\">\n <p> ‘The phoenix rising from the ashes — that’s what we always have been, but this time is different. I don’t want to build again — I have been building all of my life!’&nbsp;– Mohamed Maktabi, Iwan Maktabi </p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>The destruction also reached the Al-Amin Mosque, a Sunni-Muslim mosque in downtown known for its blue dome and minarets, completed in 2008. Inside, the Ottoman-inspired decorations of <a href=\"http://www.dada-associates.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Nabil Dada</a>, one of the city’s most celebrated architects, were damaged. The walls were originally adorned with vibrantly coloured and patterned tiles, which Dada had spent two days sourcing in Iznik, Turkey, a town famous for its tile-making traditions that date back hundreds of years.</p> \n<p>Dada says the damage inflicted on the city actually could have been much worse. ‘If it weren’t for the grain silo building [built by Palestinian banker Yusuf Beidas in 1968, it took the brunt of the explosions’ impact], we would have lost even more,’ explains Dada on the phone from Beirut. ‘Buildings facing the port lost their entire façade. The colour of the cloud from the explosion was this orange that we had never seen before.’ Dada and his team are now in the process of cleaning the debris from their damaged office.</p> \n<p>[embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/CDvP2j1JLOd/[/embed]</p> \n<p>Even as architects and designers courageously work to reconstruct their homes and workspaces, many don’t have the means to rebuild as before. Lebanon’s financial collapse has left most in a state of constant uncertainty.</p> \n<p>‘I don’t have the means to rebuild my [showroom and] office like it used to be,’ says furniture and <a href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/tags/jewellery\" title=\"Jewellery\">jewellery</a> designer <strong><a href=\"https://www.karenchekerdjian.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Karen Chekerdjian</a></strong>. ‘I invested everything I have done over 15 years into it.’</p> \n<p>For the first ten days after the blast Chekerdjian decided to shutter her business. But then she changed her mind. ‘I can transform it into something else – a storage and a studio, but not a showroom anymore. I can’t shut it easily and need to find a way to fix it, but I don’t know how I will manage to rebuild because it’s very expensive.’</p> \n<div class=\"media-element-container media-wysiwyg\"> \n <div id=\"file-287658\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg\"> \n  <div class=\"content\"> \n   <img class=\"media-element file-wysiwyg\" data-delta=\"1\" src=\"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/karen_chekerdjian_02.jpg?itok=Sd3oQ-hh\" width=\"1460\" height=\"973\" alt=\"\" />\n  </div> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div class=\"image-caption\">\n  Designer Karen Chekerdjian surveys the damage to her showroom, whose walls had been destroyed by the explosions of 4 August. The mobile still hanging in the space is the first piece of furniture she’d created. \n <em>Photography: Alain Sauma</em> \n</div> \n<p>She will continue to produce her <a href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/tags/jewellery\" title=\"Jewellery\">jewellery</a> locally, but now focus entirely on international sales. ‘This is the reverse of what I have done before,’ she said. ‘My business used to rely on 80 per cent of sales from Lebanon and 20 from outside. I have to reverse it now, otherwise I cannot survive.’</p> \n<p>Entrepreneur and philanthropist Cherine Magrabi runs <strong><a href=\"https://www.houseoftoday.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">House of Today</a></strong>, a non-profit platform supporting emerging Lebanese designers. She was in France when the explosion hit, and quickly mobilised to help struggling Lebanese creatives.&nbsp;‘This explosion shattered their dreams, their future,’ she says. ‘We need to raise awareness locally and abroad.’</p> \n<p>House of Today is now helping designers to refurbish their studios, to get them back up and running as soon as possible. Those in need can fill out an application on its website. In the meantime, Magrabi is also raising money to provide opportunities for Lebanese students to pursue design studies abroad, and for designers to enroll in overseas residency programs.</p> \n<p>Even before the explosions rocked Beirut, the Lebanese economy was in a state of free fall. All sectors were affected. ‘The <a href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/tags/jewellery\" title=\"Jewellery\">jewellery</a> industry was already at risk of disappearing,’ says <a href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/tags/jewellery\" title=\"Jewellery\">jewellery</a> designer <strong><a href=\"http://www.gaellekhouri.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Gaelle Khouri</a></strong>. ‘Local demand for luxury products was already severely dampened in light of the capital controls imposed by Lebanese banks and the steep reduction in people’s purchasing power.’ Craftspeople, such as the Armenians who came to Lebanon for a better life, are now fleeing back to their home countries or to finding refuge elsewhere in the world, she notes.</p> \n<p>Khouri’s studio and apartment in Mar Mikhael are completely damaged. ‘The waiters in the coffee shop around the corner are both dead,’ she laments.</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p> ‘We are traumatised. This comes after a succession of crises that have hit Lebanon. The global community needs to help Lebanese creatives.’&nbsp;– Gaelle Khouri </p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>The creative community, says Khouri, will rise again, just as Beirut will rise again. ‘As designers what we must do now is channel this trauma into our creativity,’ she tells me over the phone. To this end she has created a ring titled ‘I have a Dream’, reflective of Lebanon’s endurance over the last four decades. It is entirely handmade in Lebanon by local craftspeople impacted by the 4 August explosions, and has been donated &nbsp;to the Auverture Raffle for Beirut, to raise funds for the Lebanese Red Cross and Lebanese Food Bank. It shows a hand, mutilated yet clutching a blossoming flower. ‘It embodies the eventual re-birth of Lebanon, driven by the fortitude and resilience of its exceptional people,’ Khouri describes. ‘Lebanese citizens have always faced challenges head-on and learned to grow and adapt in the face of disturbing tragedies. Thanks to their strong aspiration for the beauty of life, Lebanon is today on its way to a revolution.’ §</p> \n<p>[embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/CD9V1UjFnKs/[/embed]</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>\n <div class=\"key-fact-module\">\n  <br /> \n  <h2>The people of Beirut are in urgent need of international support following the devastating explosions of 4 August.

The designs consist of subtle decorative details and come in various shapes and sizes including the fan-shaped ‘Flaneur’ model, all of which are defined by the joyful curves that are typical of Cibic’s works.</p> \n<h2>Hinoki by Federica Biasi</h2> \n<div class=\"media-element-container media-wysiwyg\"> \n <div id=\"file-286622\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg\"> \n  <div class=\"content\"> \n   <img class=\"media-element file-wysiwyg\" data-delta=\"1\" src=\"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/hinoki_screens_design_federica_biasi_for_manerba_5.jpg?itok=0pR1UfNW\" width=\"1460\" height=\"1039\" alt=\"\" />\n  </div> \n </div> \n</div> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.wallpaper.com/handmade\" class=\"word-link\" target=\"_blank\">Wallpaper* Handmade</a> 2018 veteran, Federica Biasi, has designed a range of freestanding and tabletop panels called ‘Hinoki’ for Italian office furniture maker Manerba. These slim panels come in subtle tones that are based on the chromatic scheme of Manerba’s existing product line. Made from polycarbonate, which was chosen for its wearable, scratch-resistant and flexible qualities, the translucent panels physically divide spaces without compromising the feeling of spaciousness. Thanks to the semi-transparent material, the panels still allow for a sense of closeness to others nearby, as shapes and forms can be discerned through the vertical surface. The panel can be freestanding, on wheels or attached to a desktop. The modular system has endless customisable potential with the option of additional accessories such as cork, magnetic board, hooks, elastics, shelves and mobile hangers, while for spaces that require more privacy it can be covered in sound-absorbing fabrics.&nbsp;</p> \n<h2>L20 Sofa by JaK Studio</h2> \n<div class=\"media-element-container media-wysiwyg\"> \n <div id=\"file-286727\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg\"> \n  <div class=\"content\"> \n   <img class=\"media-element file-wysiwyg\" data-delta=\"8\" src=\"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/04_table_0.jpg?itok=NnxGSqzP\" width=\"1460\" height=\"1095\" alt=\"\" />\n  </div> \n </div> \n</div> \n<p>One of the biggest challenges in the face of the new work-from-home culture is the clash of our personal and work environments. Award winning JaK Studio have designed a solution for this by redesigning the classic L-shaped sofa to transform into a working pod. This versatile sofa can be folded out into a sofa bed with bedside table or turned on its side to create a sound proofed work space. Adapting to compact urban spaces, the L20 sofa concept looks at the most central feature in the home and how we can use this to transform the heart of the domestic space into a working environment. The idea behind the concept was inspired by JaK Studio’s director Jacob Low’s observation of his own children building dens during lockdown, using anything they could find around the home. ‘It dawned on me that the limit to what we can use our homes for is infinite if we are creative. The sofa bed was a revolutionary piece of furniture when it was first designed but it has not evolved further,’ says Low. Fitted with all the necessary work accessories including drop down desk, reading light, USB port and laptop charging points, this multipurpose piece of furniture gives us a real glimpse into future living.</p> \n<h2>Saltine and Toast by Pair</h2> \n<div class=\"media-element-container media-wysiwyg\"> \n <div id=\"file-286625\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg\"> \n  <div class=\"content\"> \n   <img class=\"media-element file-wysiwyg\" data-delta=\"4\" src=\"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/pair_saltine_12.jpg?itok=hHzt9eci\" width=\"1460\" height=\"1460\" alt=\"\" />\n  </div> \n </div> \n</div> \n<p>US-based Pair has devised two models of unobtrusive dividing screens for office spaces. The studio is specialized in functional furniture specifically for the workspace, and these two new projects expand on their expertise. Saltine (pictured here) is a clever solution that attaches a screen on brackets to existing office desks, eliminating the concern of these structures taking up valuable floor space. The adjustable height provides the user with the option of a completely enclosed private space or a more informal desk division. Made from materials that can be easily cleaned such as glass and acrylic, Pair has created a universal solution for a sanitised and focused desk space that reduces the spread of germs in compact working environments.</p> \n<p>Toast is an adaptable, floorstanding space divider&nbsp;made from lightweight material and allows for&nbsp;work separation wherever needed, not least because it can be turned horizontally or vertically depending on the height required. This sound-absorbing panel comes in a variety of playful or subtle colours and tones. Made from recycled materials, it creates a quiet, private environment whilst also sparking collaborative innovation as its tackable surface is the perfect moodboard.&nbsp;</p> \n<h2>Screens by Tihany Design</h2> \n<div class=\"media-element-container media-wysiwyg\"> \n <div id=\"file-286626\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg\"> \n  <div class=\"content\"> \n   <img class=\"media-element file-wysiwyg\" data-delta=\"5\" src=\"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/_amber_screen_view.jpg?itok=6Bjqa7eI\" width=\"1460\" height=\"973\" alt=\"\" />\n  </div> \n </div> \n</div> \n<p>Experts in hospitality design, Tihany’s new solution to dining diligently in these unprecedented times is a series of elegant concepts&nbsp;featuring screens made of glass, and wooden decorative panels for his hospitality clients. These easily moveable and cleaned screens can be adapted in their design details to fit seamlessly with the interiors of the restaurant; so much so, that once in place they feel as if they have always been there.</p> \n<p>Providing a more intimate dining experience, the varying designs feature sleek geometric shapes evocative of the Art Deco style. ‘The screens are designed with wellness and comfort in mind, but they actually evoke a kind of public privacy that we feel might actually offer a positive spin on rebuilding the experience of dining out,’ says Tihany’s Managing Partner Alessia Genova. ‘It becomes an opportunity to focus on the faces and food in front of you while still enjoying the atmosphere, the service, and everything we’ve been missing while apart from our favorite restaurants’. These screens will help restaurants from Miami’s Novikov to Hong Kong’s Amber (pictured) as they navigate reopening safely and adapt to the new normal for dining out.</p> \n<h2>Clikclax by Zahava</h2> \n<div class=\"media-element-container media-wysiwyg\"> \n <div id=\"file-286627\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg\"> \n  <div class=\"content\"> \n   <img class=\"media-element file-wysiwyg\" data-delta=\"6\" src=\"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/gum_03.jpg?itok=PgDz8U1D\" width=\"1460\" height=\"973\" alt=\"\" />\n  </div> \n </div> \n</div> \n<p>Australian designer Zahava Elenberg has conceived a fun and uplifting desk tidy system which provides the necessary divisions to ensure a clean and safe working environment. Clikclax is a bright multicoloured and multi-purpose system of interlocking perspex sheets which nods to the vintage children’s game, Playplax, synonymous with toys in the 70s. Comprising varying shapes and sizes of sheets that interlock with the cylindrical bases to form shelves, divisions and storage solutions, the desktop system has endless functionality and adaptability to be erected on any flat surface.</p> \n<p>‘Clikclax is a verb as well as a noun,’ Zahava says. ‘My dream is to see people Clikclaxing all over the world — in a range of situations, from offices and co-working spaces to schools and student accommodation, hotels, galleries and libraries, at communal tables in cafes and restaurants, and on floors for kids to play together, apart. I can also see Clikclax working on a larger scale, as people-sized partitions and wayfinding demarcations. There’s nothing we can’t click together.’</p> \n<h2>Dutch Invertuals</h2> \n<div class=\"media-element-container media-wysiwyg\"> \n <div id=\"file-286677\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg\"> \n  <div class=\"content\"> \n   <img class=\"media-element file-wysiwyg\" data-delta=\"7\" src=\"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/dutch_invertuals.jpg?itok=4X6xvghv\" width=\"1460\" height=\"973\" alt=\"\" />\n  </div> \n </div> \n</div> \n<p>When it comes to room dividers, this Eindhoven-based design collective is not trying to blend in. Their custom-made dividers available in four varying shapes (circular, oval, diamond and crescent) ensure safe surroundings are achieved with a light and uplifting aesthetic. Distinctive in their bold and bright material options of acrylic transparent, acrylic translucent and fabric, they can also be customised in shape, size and colour combinations upon request. The dividers, which are made in the US, can be combined and layered to create life sized, vertical geometric montages. Mounted on a powder coated steel frame on wheels, they are easily moveable and bring life to anywhere indoors in need of a safe and sanitised solution.§</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~4/YsrBoZo1FgE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 13:18:13 +0000","feedId":9788,"bgimg":"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/wp_large/s3/2020/07/matteocibicdivider-fusinalab-1a.jpg","linkMd5":"345809e9e201c823f9aa942f6cd54753","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn71@2020_6/2020/08/25/00-35-15-181_9868e988c152f054.webp","destWidth":565,"destHeight":565,"sourceBytes":35693,"destBytes":25280,"author":"","enclosureType":"image/jpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/wp_large/s3/2020/07/matteocibicdivider-fusinalab-1a.jpg","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/discovery_space_01.jpg?itok=zwqSWO9w":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn12@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-35-19-753_8835bdf7cbd39f61.webp","https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/matteocibic-divider-1a-black.jpg?itok=SZ55J1zf":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn46@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-35-21-195_f971067d199d94ed.webp","https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/hinoki_screens_design_federica_biasi_for_manerba_5.jpg?itok=0pR1UfNW":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn74@2020_4/2020/08/25/00-35-18-740_1344c3ad4beaa86a.webp","https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/04_table_0.jpg?itok=NnxGSqzP":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn76@2020_3/2020/08/25/00-35-19-553_de49074ce0eca794.webp","https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/pair_saltine_12.jpg?itok=hHzt9eci":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn13@2020_3/2020/08/25/00-35-18-316_aaca04ef292bff36.webp","https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/_amber_screen_view.jpg?itok=6Bjqa7eI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn86@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-35-21-464_9e4d9db603059356.webp","https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/gum_03.jpg?itok=PgDz8U1D":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn89@2020_4/2020/08/25/00-35-20-143_a14eba13d93e0a14.webp","https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/dutch_invertuals.jpg?itok=4X6xvghv":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn19@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-35-17-115_24fed478b7b6651b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~4/YsrBoZo1FgE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn66@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-35-18-580_c50f0a73d2fa31db.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598315696880},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:34:56","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:34:56","title":"Annie Leibovitz on the legacy of Henri Cartier-Bresson","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~3/HHAT81fcOXI/annie-leibovitz-henri-cartier-bresson-palazzo-grassi","description":"<p>Leibovitz remembers, as a young <a href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/tags/painting\" title=\"Painting\">painting</a> student at the San Francisco Art Institute, studying one of the iconic photojournalist Henri Cartier-Bresson’s most famous images.&nbsp;The now illustrious American portrait photographer found the image in the university’s library, in a newly published book titled <em>The World of Henri Cartier-Bresson.</em></p> \n<p>A member of the French army during the Second World War, Cartier-Bresson escaped from a prisoner-of-war camp in 1943 and joined a French underground photographic unit, covering the liberation of France and the retreat of the German army. In the spring of 1945, he found himself photographing a displaced persons camp in Dessau, Germany, between the American and Soviet zones.&nbsp;‘The photograph shows the moment when a Gestapo informant is confronted by a woman she betrayed,’ Leibovitz writes. ‘The informant is humiliated, the betrayed woman in a rage and about to strike a blow, the spectators in thrall at the scene – all conveyed with great simplicity.’</p> \n<p>In the catalogue of a new exhibition ‘Le Grand Jeu’, on show now at Palazzo Grassi, Venice, Leibovitz says: ‘Seeing Cartier-Bresson’s work made me want to become a photographer. The idea that a photographer could travel with a camera to different places, see how other people lived, make <em>looking</em> a mission — that that could be your life was an amazing, thrilling idea.’</p> \n<div class=\"media-element-container media-wysiwyg\"> \n <div id=\"file-287305\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg\"> \n  <div class=\"content\"> \n   <img class=\"media-element file-wysiwyg\" data-delta=\"1\" src=\"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/004_hcb.jpg?itok=196rlNNh\" width=\"1398\" height=\"944\" alt=\"\" />\n  </div> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div class=\"image-caption\">\n  Henri Cartier-Bresson, \n <em>Dimanche sur les bords de Seine, France, 1938</em>, gelatin silver print, 1973.&nbsp;\n <em>© Fondation Henri Cartier-Bresson / Magnum Photos.</em>&nbsp;Selected by Annie Leibovitz as part of her&nbsp;curated section of&nbsp;‘Le Grand Jeu’ at Palazzo Grassi \n</div> \n<p>The exhibition’s title ‘Le Grand Jeu’ is a reference to the group of photographs that Cartier-Bresson, the man now best known for coining the term ‘the decisive moment’, considered to be his ‘Master Collection’. The selection was made in 1972, in Houston, in the home of the renowned photography collectors John and Dominique de Menil.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>When Cartier-Bresson stayed with them one summer, they asked the French photographer to compile his selection. Almost 50 years later, the 385 photographs he chose for the de Menils have been gathered at Palazzo Grassi, in an exhibition born of a partnership between the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris, the Pinault Collection and the Fondation Henri Cartier-Bresson.But, as a way of providing an additional element of curation to Cartier-Bresson’s selection, the exhibition’s overall curator,</p> \n<p>Matthieu Humery, invited five co-curators to provide their response to Cartier-Bresson’s work.&nbsp;Annie Leibovitz was one of those curators, alongside art historian Sylvie Aubenas, writer Javier Cercas, collector François Pinault and film director Wim Wenders.&nbsp;Each had to follow a basic rule; they were to choose 50 images from amongst the 385. Beyond that, they were given free reign to do whatever they liked with the sequencing and editing of Cartier-Bresson’s work.</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p> ‘You can see the way Cartier-Bresson composed. How he found a situation that he liked and then waited for something to happen within it’ </p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>To contend with the task, Leibovitz first pinned all the photographs, which she had printed the size of index cards, in rows on a wall of her studio. She then picked out the pictures that had a strong influence on her work and remained etched on her mind from her time as a student.&nbsp;‘Some of the photographs I chose are hard to look at. Some of them are important, famous pictures because of their subjects,’ Leibovitz says.</p> \n<p>‘You can see the way Cartier-Bresson composed. How he found a situation that he liked and then waited for something to happen within it. How there is something going on in the foreground and something else in the background or in another part of the scene. It’s almost the way your eye sees. Something is happening in front of you, and something else is happening farther off. It’s interesting to see what he does over and over again.’</p> \n<div class=\"media-element-container media-wysiwyg\"> \n <div id=\"file-287306\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg\"> \n  <div class=\"content\"> \n   <img class=\"media-element file-wysiwyg\" data-delta=\"2\" src=\"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/hcb_install_1.jpg?itok=BIQrEo5L\" width=\"944\" height=\"1416\" alt=\"\" />\n  </div> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div class=\"image-caption\">\n  Installation view of&nbsp;Annie Leibovitz’s curated section in ‘Le Grand Jeu’&nbsp;at&nbsp;Palazzo Grassi, Venice \n</div> \n<p>Leibovitz met Cartier-Bresson once, in 1976, when she was a young photographer at <em>Rolling Stone</em>. Jann Wenner, the magazine’s editor, asked her to work on a special issue of the magazine, in which she would make a series of portraits of other photographers. Included were Andy Warhol, Richard Avedon, Jacques-Henri Lartigue, Helmut Newton and Ansel Adams.</p> \n<p>Leibovitz wrote a letter to Cartier-Bresson at his home in Paris and got no response. ‘So I made a pilgrimage to Paris to find him. I didn’t have an appointment. I just went to the Magnum office and he happened to be there,’ she says.&nbsp;Leibovitz walked home with Cartier-Bresson before having lunch at his house. ‘But he continued to refuse to let me photograph him or interview him,’ she says.&nbsp;</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p> ‘I made a pilgrimage to Paris to find him. I didn’t have an appointment. I just went to the Magnum office and he happened to be there.&nbsp;But he continued to refuse to let me photograph him or interview him’&nbsp; </p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>Leibovitz left without a portrait, and had a sleepless night. Early the next morning, she went back to a footbridge they had walked over the day before. ‘It was on his way to Magnum, and I thought that maybe he would come there again,’ she says. ‘It was neutral territory.’&nbsp;After an hour, Cartier-Bresson appeared on the street, and Leibovitz started taking pictures without him being aware of her presence.</p> \n<p>‘When he realised that the person taking photographs was me, he started yelling,’ Leibovitz remembers. ‘I didn’t understand everything he said, because I was concentrating on the pictures, but the gist was that I had betrayed him,’ Leibovitz says.</p> \n<p>‘He composed himself, and we walked together to the Magnum office. Along the way he explained that he didn’t want to be photographed because he felt that he wouldn’t be able to do his work on the street if people knew what he looked like,’ Leibovitz says. ‘They would behave differently if they knew he was taking their picture. This is something I only understand now.’ §</p> \n<div class=\"media-element-container media-wysiwyg\"> \n <div id=\"file-287307\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg\"> \n  <div class=\"content\"> \n   <img class=\"media-element file-wysiwyg\" data-delta=\"3\" src=\"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/003_hcb.jpg?itok=FinzJK2W\" width=\"944\" height=\"1399\" alt=\"\" />\n  </div> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div class=\"image-caption\">\n  Henri Cartier-Bresson,&nbsp;\n <em>Bougival, France</em>, \n <em>1956</em>, gelatin silver print, 1973 \n <em>© Fondation Henri Cartier-Bresson / Magnum Photos. </em>Selected by Annie&nbsp;Leibovitz for her curated section in&nbsp;‘Le Grand Jeu’&nbsp; \n <p>&nbsp; </p>\n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~4/HHAT81fcOXI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Sat, 15 Aug 2020 10:00:00 +0000","feedId":9788,"bgimg":"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/wp_large/s3/2020/08/feature_2.jpg","linkMd5":"248c33a5a6c553078777d4f1ac17f788","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn11@2020_4/2020/08/25/00-35-14-634_67b74821dd0617c1.webp","destWidth":484,"destHeight":565,"sourceBytes":43295,"destBytes":33016,"author":"","enclosureType":"image/jpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/wp_large/s3/2020/08/feature_2.jpg","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/004_hcb.jpg?itok=196rlNNh":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn40@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-35-16-660_a3b8e83712c69f2b.webp","https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/hcb_install_1.jpg?itok=BIQrEo5L":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn8@2020_3/2020/08/25/00-35-21-132_ed4093f79999a68e.webp","https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/003_hcb.jpg?itok=FinzJK2W":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn48@2020_4/2020/08/25/00-35-16-856_cdc1437e836b3f83.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~4/HHAT81fcOXI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn93@2020_3/2020/08/25/00-35-17-357_e8eb058706708ac9.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598315696879},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:34:56","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:34:56","title":"New take on the Greek beach house by Athens based R.C.TECH","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~3/a2pn4ZQ1DDw/neratza-beach-house-rctech-greece","description":"<p>On a flat piece of land along the coastline of the Northern Peloponnese region in Greece, overlooking the Parnassos mountain to the north, a single level holiday house stretches out along the coastline, with a beach-side swimming pool running parallel to the sea.

And our two covers have fully embraced this.</p> \n<p>For her newsstand cover and 22-page feature, conceptual artist Clare Strand was inspired by Edwin Abbott Abbott’s <em>Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions</em> to create a series of graphic interventions on George Harvey’s black-and-white fashion photography. She was drawn to the idea of readers engaging and interacting with the images and even creating their own artworks. Much like the protagonist of <em>Flatland</em>, we’re being challenged by Strand to seek a new perspective, cutting and folding to create three-dimensional objects from the two-dimensional templates presented on the pages. The monochrome palette accentuated Strand’s geometric forms, with the artist explaining ‘it helps boil the world down its essentials’.</p> \n<p>Virgil Abloh contributes our limited-edition cover to coincide with his collaboration with Mercedes-Benz. He was likewise drawn to the idea of cutting as activation, creating a dotted-line-with-scissors graphic to encourage readers to cut the magazine in half. It’s a bold gesture that celebrates the tactility and sheer actuality of print. Reinforcing engagement with the physical object, Abloh explained he wants people’s fingerprints to be left on the matte white surface. He will be personally cutting a special series of 100 copies, videoing the process (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/wallpapermag/?hl=en\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">@wallpapermag</a>) and selling these on <a href=\"http://canary---yellow.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">canary---yellow.com</a>, with all proceeds going to the Virgil AblohTM “Post Modern” Scholarship Fund to benefit Black students of academic promise.</p> \n<p>September Wallpaper* is our Style Special and reflects the seemingly effortless talent of our fashion director Jason Hughes. With ideas and vision aplenty, he has injected such a modern, fresh take on the season. He’s also mastered new ways of working in the era of social distancing, styling via Zoom and calmly taking challenges in his stride.</p> \n<p>Harriet Quick tackles this changing fashion landscape in her piece, ‘The Show Must Go On’, surveying the industry’s innovative solutions to limitations on travel and public gatherings. While producing this issue, we witnessed the birth of shows-in-a- box – notably with Loewe and its exquisite and collectable M/M Paris-designed cabinet of curiosities, and <a href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/tags/bottega-veneta\" title=\"Bottega Veneta\">Bottega Veneta</a>’s Tyrone Lebon film, which came in a green neon box with projector included. They’re finding ways to still be physical, to engage, to touch. We’re craving this now and brands are responding. But it’s the co-existence that is most exciting, how far we can push the digital experience and make the physical more desirable, more intimate.</p> \n<p>Elsewhere, we celebrate Armani Casa’s 20th anniversary with a peek into the home of a pair of imaginary clients; Tilly Macalister-Smith talks to <a href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/tags/david-adjaye\" title=\"David Adjaye\">David Adjaye</a> and Samuel Ross in a wide-ranging conversation touching on architecture, fashion, anti-racism and the future of the creative industries in a post-Covid world; artist Silvia Rosi delivers the season’s nest womenswear in a series of self-portraits; and Jaeger-LeCoultre peels back the curtain on the rare craft of guilloché.

Strong, light, economical, hypo-allergenic and non-magnetic, it was perfect for pilots, engineers and the military, but not a luxury material, not something to create dreams from. That is, until the 1970s, when watch designer and goldsmith Gérald Genta had a different vision. His early 1970s modernist steel watch designs, including the ‘Royal Oak’ for Audemars Piguet and the ‘Nautilus’ for Patek Philippe, integrated case and bracelet in a single fluid loop. His use of handbrushed and polished metalwork, typical jeweller techniques, created a new kind of luxury sports watch.</p> \n<div class=\"media-element-container media-wysiwyg\"> \n <div id=\"file-287260\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg\"> \n  <div class=\"content\"> \n   <img alt=\"Patek Philippe watch\" class=\"media-element file-wysiwyg\" data-delta=\"1\" src=\"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/steel-2.jpg?itok=7j-BJYgC\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1400\" />\n  </div> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div class=\"image-caption\">\n  ‘Nautilus’ ladies’ automatic watch in steel and diamonds,&nbsp;by Patek Philippe. \n <em>Fashion: Aylin Bayhan</em> \n</div> \n<p>It wasn’t long before women’s watches were just as vigorously proportioned – the new Patek Philippe ladies’ automatic ‘Nautilus’, which eschews the smaller delicacy of earlier models with its most generous dimensions yet, is a case in point. A dark grey opaline dial, when framed by a diamond bezel, becomes almost dainty. The grey steel hue of <a href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/tags/bulgari\" title=\"Bulgari\">Bulgari</a>’s ‘Octo Roma’ is made richer with rose-gold accents. Chopard’s ‘Alpine Eagle’, meanwhile, although crafted with heavy steel links, boasts a sleek, narrow silhouette, bestowing steel with the elegantly precious credentials it so richly deserves. §</p> \n<div class=\"media-element-container media-wysiwyg\"> \n <div id=\"file-287261\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg\"> \n  <div class=\"content\"> \n   <img alt=\"bulgari watch \" class=\"media-element file-wysiwyg\" data-delta=\"2\" src=\"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/steel-3.jpg?itok=Ge5_UNL6\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1400\" />\n  </div> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div class=\"image-caption\">\n  ‘Octo Roma’ watch in stainless steel and rose gold, by \n <a href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/tags/bulgari\" title=\"Bulgari\">Bulgari</a>.&nbsp;\n <em>Fashion: Aylin Bayhan</em> \n</div> \n<p>As originally featured in the May 2020 issue of Wallpaper* (W*254),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wallpaper.com/design/introducing-may-2020-issue-free-download\" target=\"_self\">available to download free here</a></p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~4/VsrVed3yhEE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Sat, 22 Aug 2020 10:00:00 +0000","feedId":9788,"bgimg":"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/wp_large/s3/2020/08/steel-feat-main.jpg","linkMd5":"db4cd5956817cbdd5bc57f989e48cc5f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn80@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-35-15-531_b835d17804dc2c04.webp","destWidth":484,"destHeight":565,"sourceBytes":17829,"destBytes":12538,"author":"","enclosureType":"image/jpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/wp_large/s3/2020/08/steel-feat-main.jpg","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/steel-2.jpg?itok=7j-BJYgC":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn47@2020_6/2020/08/25/00-35-17-451_50372176fd622b9b.webp","https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/steel-3.jpg?itok=Ge5_UNL6":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn35@2020_2/2020/08/25/00-35-16-605_18301fa6b1189071.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~4/VsrVed3yhEE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn76@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-35-17-262_69e18123c6efb9b0.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598315696877},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:34:56","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:34:56","title":"Jonathan Anderson on Loewe’s new home fragrances","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Wallpaperfeed/~3/gWSsAoNCJsc/jonathan-anderson-interview-loewe-new-home-fragrances","description":"<p>Bringing the fresh scents of the outdoors in, <a href=\"https://www.wallpaper.com/tags/loewe\" target=\"_self\">Loewe’s</a> new line of <a href=\"https://www.wallpaper.com/tags/fragrance\" target=\"_self\">home fragrances</a> is inspired by the vegetable garden at creative director <a href=\"https://www.wallpaper.com/tags/jonathan-anderson\" target=\"_self\">Jonathan Anderson’s</a> <a href=\"https://www.wallpaper.com/tags/london\" target=\"_self\">London</a> home.

I have always found the idea of senses being used as a stimulus to healing very interesting. There’s always been this thing with nature, that we draw on what we have around us, we associate smells to different things, it’s very personal.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><strong>How did you come up with the idea of vegetable and plant-inspired scents?</strong></p> \n<p>Smells trigger memories and for me the selection of smell is quite personal. I remember as a child we had a greenhouse and we grew vegetables in it, so there’s a few smells from the collection that remind me of being a child, others that remind me more of journey’s I’ve taken, a bit like olfactory sketches. Smells are quite grounding in a way. Part Victorian, botanical garden, part apothecary, the mix is both scientific and sentimental.</p> \n<p><strong>Can you speak more about the process of designing the <a href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/tags/ceramics\" title=\"Ceramics\">ceramics</a>? How did you take the inspiration of Greek drinking vessels and transform them into objects for a modern space?</strong></p> \n<p>Tactility is key for me, as Loewe’s ongoing engagement with the art of <a href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/tags/ceramics\" title=\"Ceramics\">ceramics</a> testifies. The ribbed terracotta pot that holds our candles is based on a 5th century BC Greek mug I bought at an auction several years ago. In the rhythmic purity of this incredibly old object, I find unquestionable modernity, and function: it offered the perfect template as a container for our candles, which come in three different sizes. A classic Louis XIV-era French ambeau informs the geometry of the other candle base: craft knows no historic border for me. Speaking of which, candles are made with wax derived purely from natural ingredients and embossed with the Loewe&nbsp;monogram and the message ‘Made in Spain’.</p> \n<div class=\"media-element-container media-wysiwyg\"> \n <div id=\"file-287631\" class=\"file file-image file-image-jpeg\"> \n  <div class=\"content\"> \n   <img alt=\"jonathan anderson black and white portrait \" title=\"jonathan anderson black and white portrait \" class=\"media-element file-wysiwyg\" data-delta=\"2\" src=\"https://cdn.wallpaper.com/main/styles/responsive_1460w_scale/s3/jwportrait_0.jpg?itok=k4bzUCwn\" width=\"1460\" height=\"1826\" />\n  </div> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div class=\"image-caption\">\n  Loewe’s creative director Jonathan Anderson. \n <em>Photography:&nbsp;Scott Trindle</em> \n</div> \n<p><strong>During your tenure at Loewe you’ve championed the power of craft to transform spaces, and I imagine the past few months of lockdown have seen you spend more time at home than you have before. Has spending so much time in one place taught you anything more about the role craft plays in making a home?</strong></p> \n<p>When we went into lockdown, on the first two weeks I was like ‘why do I have all this stuff.’ This is the longest I’ve ever been in this house because I am usually back and forth from <a href=\"https://www.wallpaper.com/tags/paris\" target=\"_self\">Paris</a> so that was the first time I had solid time in the house. I went through a complete rejection for all the pieces that I collect and then I asked myself why I am into this, why do I collect these pieces, this textile or <a href=\"https://www.wallpaper.com/tags/painting\" target=\"_self\">painting</a> or these <a href=\"https://www.wallpaper.com/tags/ceramics\" target=\"_self\">ceramics</a>, and it’s because of my obsession about people that make things, from start to finish. The people that make things with their hands are the people that inspire me.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><strong>In some ways, the slow-pace and often solitary act of gardening makes it so different from fashion design, yet both are creative pursuits. Has your practice of one informed the other in any way?</strong></p> \n<p>With the garden you have to look after it and the same with <a href=\"https://www.wallpaper.com/design\" target=\"_self\">design</a>. You have to look after it.&nbsp;In gardening also there is always something that stands from it, a colour, a structure versus a non-structure. §</p>\n<img
