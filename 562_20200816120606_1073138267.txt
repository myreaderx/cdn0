While these tips are especially helpful for those of you who use Chromebooks at work, you might find they help you get things done faster, regardless of whether you're at work or home.</p>\n  <p></p>\n  <h3>1. Dock browser windows.</h3>Digging into projects often requires opening more than one browser window—also called a “browser instance”—at a time. This can be an effective way to organize work. You can open one browser instance for dashboards, one for apps, another for Gmail, a third for Google Docs you’re working on, and, perhaps, one for music.\n  <p></p>\n  <p>If you find yourself going back and forth between two browser instances, it’s a good idea to “dock” your screens, or anchor them in place on your screen so they don’t move around. This way, you can access two screens side-by-side. Hit <b>Alt + ]</b> to dock one browser instance to the left and <b>Alt + [</b> to dock the other browser instance to the right.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \">\n    <img alt=\"ink-42-proposal-v3.png\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/ink-42-proposal-v3.1987117432861881.max-1000x1000.png\" />\n   </figure>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p></p>\n  <h3>2. Switch between browser instances or browser tabs.</h3>Docking browser instances is one way to work more efficiently when you’re juggling projects. Another strategy is to quickly switch between what you have open. Within each browser instance, it’s not uncommon to have multiple tabs open on your screen. People do this often when they’re searching the web or working in different apps, like Gmail or Drive. You can use keyboard shortcuts to switch between browser instances and between tabs.\n  <p></p>\n  <p>Click <b>Alt + tab</b> to switch between the two most recent browser instances. Continue to hold <b>Alt</b> after pressing <b>tab</b> and you’ll get a tiled view of all of your open browser instances. Click <b>Ctrl + tab</b> (no point and click necessary) to navigate between browser tabs.</p>\n  <p></p>\n  <h3>3. Recover closed tabs.</h3>If you accidentally close Chrome, there’s no need to worry. Simply hit \n  <b>Ctrl + Shift + T</b> and your most recently closed tab (or browser instance) comes right back. If you closed more than one, just hit that combination of keys again, and Chrome will keep restoring.&nbsp;\n  <p></p>\n  <p></p>\n  <h3>4. Use Caps Lock.</h3>One of the first things you might notice when you switch to Chrome OS is that there’s no Caps Lock key. But let’s face it, sometimes you need to shout your enthusiasm (COOKIES IN THE BREAKROOM!). In such instances, Caps Lock is just a keyboard shortcut away.\n  <p></p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-video\">\n <div class=\"h-c-page h-c-page--mobile-full-bleed\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <div class=\"h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col-l--12 \">\n    <div class=\"article-module article-video \">\n     <figure>\n      <a class=\"h-c-video h-c-video--marquee \" data-glue-modal-disabled-on-mobile=\"true\" data-glue-modal-trigger=\"uni-modal-L7K275WUpUI-\" href=\"https://youtube.com/watch?v=L7K275WUpUI\"><img alt=\"Editing Microsoft Office files on a Chromebook is the cat’s meow.

No matter the reason why they came to therapy, almost everyone I met seemed to benefit from engaging in the creative process.&nbsp;&nbsp;Art gives us the ability to point beyond spoken or written language, to unite us, delight, and satisfy. Done right, this process can be enhanced by technology—extending our ability and potential for play.</p>\n  <p>One of my first sessions as a therapist was with a middle school student on the autism spectrum. He had trouble communicating and socializing with his peers, but in our sessions together he drew, made elaborate scenes with clay, and made music.</p>\n  <p>Another key moment for me was when I met Chancey Fleet, a blind technology educator and accessibility advocate. I was learning how to program at the time, and together we built a tool to help her plan a dinner event. It was a visual and audio diagramming tool that paired with her screen reader technology. This collaboration got me excited about the potential of technology to make art and creativity more accessible, and it emphasized the importance of collaborative approaches to design.</p>\n  <p>This sentiment has carried over into the accessibility research and design work that I do at the <a href=\"http://ability.nyu.edu/\">NYU Ability Project</a>, a research space where we explore the intersection of disability and technology. Our projects bring together engineers, designers, educators, artists and therapists within and beyond the accessibility community. Like so many technological innovations that have begun as assistive and rehabilitative tech, we hope our work will eventually benefit everyone. That’s why when Google reached out to me with an opportunity to explore ideas around creativity and accessibility, I jumped at the chance.</p>\n  <p></p>\n  <p>Together, we made <a href=\"https://experiments.withgoogle.com/collection/creatability\">Creatability</a>, a set of experiments that explore how creative tools–drawing, music and more–can be made more accessible using web and AI technology. The project is a collaboration with creators and allies in the accessibility community, such as: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JAZDeafMusical\">Jay Alan Zimmerman</a>, a composer who is deaf; <a href=\"https://www.ski.org/users/joshua-miele\">Josh Miele</a>, a blind scientist, designer, and educator; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChanceyFleet?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Chancey Fleet</a>, a blind, accessibility advocate, and technology educator; as well as, Barry Farrimond and Doug Bott of <a href=\"http://openupmusic.org/\">Open Up Music</a>, a group focused on empowering young disabled musicians to build inclusive youth orchestras.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \">\n    <img alt=\"Creatability keyboard\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Irene_Keyboard.gif\" />\n   </figure>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>The experiments explore a diverse set of inputs--from a computer mouse and keystrokes to your body, wrist, nose, or voice.

This technology lets you control the experiments with your webcam, simply by moving your body. And it’s powered by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://js.tensorflow.org/\">Tensorflow.js</a>—a library that runs machine learning models on-device and in your browser, which means your images are never stored or sent to a server.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \">\n    <img alt=\"Creating sound\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Nicole_Sound_Canvas.gif\" />\n   </figure>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>We hope these experiments inspire others to unleash their inner artist regardless of ability.

(Another change announced in January, <a href=\"https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=990592\">Chromium issue #990592</a>, rolled out with Chrome 80 in February.)<br /></i></p>\n  <p>Chrome’s Incognito Mode is based on the principle that you should have the choice to browse the web privately. At the end of July, Chrome will remedy a loophole that has allowed sites to detect people who are browsing in Incognito Mode. This will affect some publishers who have used the loophole to deter metered paywall circumvention, so we’d like to explain the background and context of the change.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <h3>Private browsing principles</h3>\n  <p>People choose to browse the web privately for many reasons. Some wish to protect their privacy on shared or borrowed devices, or to exclude certain activities from their browsing histories. In situations such as political oppression or domestic abuse, people may have important safety reasons for concealing their web activity and their use of private browsing features.</p>\n  <p>We want you to be able to access the web privately, with the assurance that your choice to do so is private as well. These principles are consistent with emerging web standards for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://w3ctag.github.io/private-browsing-modes/#features-supporting-private-browsing\">private browsing modes</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <h3>Closing the FileSystem API loophole</h3>\n  <p>Today, some sites use an unintended loophole to detect when people are browsing in Incognito Mode. Chrome’s FileSystem API is disabled in Incognito Mode to avoid leaving traces of activity on someone’s device. Sites can check for the availability of the FileSystem API and, if they receive an error message, determine that a private session is occurring and give the user a different experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>With the release of Chrome 76 scheduled for July 30, the behavior of the FileSystem API will be modified to remedy this method of Incognito Mode detection. Chrome will likewise work to remedy any other current or future means of Incognito Mode detection.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <h3>Publisher impact and strategies</h3>\n  <p>The change will affect sites that use the FileSystem API to intercept Incognito Mode sessions and require people to log in or switch to normal browsing mode, on the assumption that these individuals are attempting to circumvent metered paywalls.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>Unlike hard paywalls or registration walls, which require people to log in to view any content, meters offer a number of free articles before you must log in. This model is inherently porous, as it relies on a site’s ability to track the number of free articles someone has viewed, typically using cookies. Private browsing modes are one of several tactics people use to manage their cookies and thereby \"reset\" the meter count.</p>\n  <p>Sites that wish to deter meter circumvention have options such as reducing the number of free articles someone can view before logging in, requiring free registration to view any content, or hardening their paywalls. Other sites offer more generous meters as a way to develop affinity among potential subscribers, recognizing some people will always look for workarounds.&nbsp; We suggest publishers monitor the effect of the FileSystem API change before taking reactive measures since any impact on user behavior may be different than expected and any change in meter strategy will impact all users, not just those using Incognito Mode.</p>\n  <p>Our News teams support sites with meter strategies and recognize the goal of reducing meter circumvention, however any approach based on private browsing detection&nbsp;undermines the principles of&nbsp;Incognito Mode. We remain open to exploring solutions that are consistent with user trust and private browsing principles.</p>\n </div>\n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 18 Jul 2019 17:00:00 +0000","feedId":562,"bgimg":"https://blog.google/static/blogv2/images/google-1000x1000.png","linkMd5":"d4627a64a0b25f774a155bc031fe02c5","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn7@2020_3/2020/08/16/12-04-31-217_6e554fa84199a90c.webp","metaImg":"https://blog.google/static/blogv2/images/google-1000x1000.png","destWidth":1000,"destHeight":1000,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/Egta/~4/fcREG_k1jtY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn95@2020_5/2020/08/16/12-04-35-800_773e151e43e0869b.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 20:03:56","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 20:03:56","title":"Building a more private web","link":"https://blog.google/products/chrome/building-a-more-private-web/","description":"<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>Privacy is paramount to us, in everything we do. So today, we are announcing a new initiative to develop a set of open standards to fundamentally enhance privacy on the web. We’re calling this a Privacy Sandbox.&nbsp;</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>Technology that publishers and advertisers use to make advertising even more relevant to people is now being used far beyond its original design intent - to a point where some data practices don’t match up to user expectations for privacy. Recently, some other browsers have attempted to address this problem, but without an agreed upon set of standards, attempts to improve user privacy are having unintended consequences.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>First, large scale blocking of cookies undermine people’s privacy by encouraging opaque techniques such as fingerprinting. With fingerprinting, developers have found ways to use tiny bits of information that vary between users, such as what device they have or what fonts they have installed to generate a unique identifier which can then be used to match a user across websites. Unlike cookies, users cannot clear their fingerprint, and therefore cannot control how their information is collected. We think this subverts user choice and is wrong.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>Second, blocking cookies without another way to deliver relevant ads significantly reduces publishers’ primary means of funding, which jeopardizes the future of the vibrant web. Many publishers have been able to continue to invest in freely accessible content because they can be confident that their advertising will fund their costs. If this funding is cut, we are concerned that we will see much less accessible content for everyone. Recent studies have shown that when advertising is made less relevant by removing cookies, funding for publishers falls by 52% on average<sup>1</sup>.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>So we are doing something different. We want to find a solution that both really protects user privacy and also helps content remain freely accessible on the web. At I/O, <a href=\"https://blog.chromium.org/2019/05/improving-privacy-and-security-on-web.html\">we announced a plan</a> to improve the classification of cookies, give clarity and visibility to cookie settings, as well as plans to more aggressively block fingerprinting. We are making progress on this, and today we are providing more details on our plans to restrict fingerprinting. Collectively we believe all these changes will improve transparency, choice, and control.&nbsp;</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>But, we can go further. Starting with today’s announcements, we will work with the web community to develop new standards that advance privacy, while continuing to support free access to content. Over the last couple of weeks, we’ve started sharing our preliminary ideas for a Privacy Sandbox - a secure environment for personalization that also protects user privacy. Some ideas include new approaches to ensure that ads continue to be relevant for users, but user data shared with websites and advertisers would be minimized by anonymously aggregating user information, and keeping much more user information on-device only. Our goal is to create a set of standards that is more consistent with users’ expectations of privacy.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>We are following the web standards process and seeking industry feedback on our initial ideas for the Privacy Sandbox. While Chrome can take action quickly in some areas (for instance, restrictions on fingerprinting) developing web standards is a complex process, and we know from experience that ecosystem changes of this scope take time. They require significant thought, debate, and input from many stakeholders, and generally take multiple years.&nbsp;</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>To move things forward as quickly as possible, we have documented the specific problems we are trying to solve together, and we are sharing a series of explainers with the web community. We have also summarized these ideas today on the <a href=\"https://blog.chromium.org/2019/08/potential-uses-for-privacy-sandbox.html\">Chromium blog</a>.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>We look forward to getting feedback on this approach from the web platform community, including other browsers, publishers, and their advertising partners. Thank you in advance for your help and input on this process - we believe that we must solve these problems together to ensure that the incredible benefits of the open, accessible web continue into the next generation of the internet.</p>\n  <p></p>\n  <p></p>\n  <p><sub>1 Google Ad Manager data; n=500 global publishers; Analysis based on an A/B experiment where cookies are disabled on a randomly selected fraction of each publisher's traffic; May-August 2019.

If you turn on Enhanced Safe Browsing, Chrome proactively checks whether pages and downloads are dangerous by sending information about them to Google Safe Browsing.&nbsp; If you’re signed in to Chrome, then Chrome and other Google apps you use (Gmail, Drive, etc.) will further protect you based on a holistic view of threats you encounter on the web and attacks against your Google Account.

Yes, indeed, Chrome got a fresh look for its <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/chrome/chromes-turning-10-heres-whats-new/\">10th birthday</a>, and today we sat down with Alex Ainslie, Chrome’s lead designer, to go behind the scenes of the biggest redesign since Chrome launched 10 years ago.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p><b>So first, what changed in Chrome? Why and why now?</b></p>\n  <br />\n  <p><b>Alex:</b> We’re introducing a major refresh on Chrome across all platforms, which aligns with Google’s <a href=\"https://material.io/design/\">new Material Theme</a>. This update involved changing our approaches to shape, color, iconography, and typography. And why right now? You only turn 10 once, so we thought it would be the ideal moment.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p><b>For most people (who are non-designers), the modern browser is a simple window to the internet. Is it really that simple?</b></p>\n  <br />\n  <p><b>Alex:&nbsp;</b>A major focus of our work is about finding ways to <a href=\"https://medium.com/@san_toki/unboxing-chrome-f6af7b8161a2\">simplify web browsing</a>. And we think about simplification not so much as a goal, but instead as a strategy for making Chrome more usable. The new, simplified tab strip, for example, makes it faster to find a specific tab when you have many open.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <figure class=\"article-image--full article-module \">\n  <img alt=\"tabs\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/00-tabs.max-1000x1000.png\" />\n  <figcaption class=\"article-image__caption h-c-page\">\n   <div class=\"rich-text\">\n    <p>Goodbye \"tablerone.\" Hello user-friendly icons.</p>\n   </div>\n  </figcaption>\n </figure>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>We’ve learned from user research around the world it can be hard to decipher URLs with too many words and characters.

This is an example of Chrome's values of simplicity and security reinforcing each other.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <figure class=\"article-image--full article-module \">\n  <img alt=\"security\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/02-security.max-1000x1000.png\" />\n </figure>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p><b>Your team spent the last year working on the new design. What challenges did you face?</b></p>\n  <p><b>Alex:</b>&nbsp;One of our key design challenges is to be a good citizen of all platforms. That means we work hard to ensure Chrome both looks comfortable and behaves in familiar ways on Windows, Mac, Linux, Chrome OS, Android, Daydream and iOS. For example, we respect platform conventions for window controls, button ordering, typography, and more. And we also take care to negotiate the relationship between these platform-specific elements and Google's new Material Theme because we want Chrome to feel at home on all of your devices and to feel recognizably Googley.</p>\n  <p>The design team is spread across several offices - Mountain View, San Francisco, Los Angeles, London, Munich, and Paris. So in addition to thinking about how to improve Chrome’s UI we also think about how to maintain a healthy design culture across offices and timezones.</p>\n  <p><b>Have your team’s design principles changed since Chrome launched 10 years ago?</b></p>\n  <p><b>Alex:&nbsp;</b>We still rely on the early Chrome team mantra, “Content, not chrome,” which is based on the idea of designing the browser UI to make the web content stand out. And our core values remain the same, though they’ve expanded. For example, in the case of speed, we think both about performance improvements to make pages load faster and about how Chrome can help people get things done more quickly. The improved Omnibox—which merges the search and address bar into one—is a great illustration of this.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <figure class=\"article-image--full article-module \">\n  <img alt=\"malibu\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/03-omnibox-suggestions.max-1000x1000.png\" />\n </figure>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p><b>What’s your proudest moment from the 8 years you’ve been on the team?</b></p>\n  <p><b>Alex:</b>&nbsp;I appreciate that the Chrome team takes on difficult, long-term projects. For example, helping to move the web to HTTPS has been a multi-year effort. From improving our <a href=\"https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub45366\">connection security indicators</a> to <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/chrome/milestone-chrome-security-marking-http-not-secure/\">marking HTTP sites as “Not secure,”</a> we have plenty of examples of how design can help keep people safe and contribute to change throughout the ecosystem. So it’s not any specific element in Chrome’s UI that I am most proud of, but instead the broader outcomes that impact people out in the world.</p>\n </div>\n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 12 Sep 2018 18:00:00 +0000","feedId":562,"bgimg":"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/00-tabs.max-1000x1000.png","linkMd5":"4ee6ed00efe518ced9f58e8b25bc9110","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn12@2020_2/2020/08/16/12-04-31-679_fdc72eab11def2ee.webp","destWidth":1000,"destHeight":556,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/00-tabs.max-1000x1000.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn20@2020_2/2020/08/16/12-04-33-846_fdc72eab11def2ee.webp","https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/01-omnibox.max-1000x1000.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn31@2020_5/2020/08/16/12-04-34-451_430abcb0b24500ea.webp","https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/02-security.max-1000x1000.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn68@2020_5/2020/08/16/12-04-35-001_35d4856ff6a4bba0.webp","https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/03-omnibox-suggestions.max-1000x1000.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn92@2020_4/2020/08/16/12-04-35-573_f9e2396611b3ca3e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/Egta/~4/BA5Ya4rbxCI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn60@2020_3/2020/08/16/12-04-34-763_b2bbf858d1313c6f.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 20:03:56","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 20:03:56","title":"Optimistic dissatisfaction with the status quo of security","link":"https://blog.google/perspectives/parisa-tabriz/optimistic-dissatisfaction-status-quo-security/","description":"<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p><i>This article is a condensed version of a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=py2qmGbyhlw\">keynote speech Parisa gave at Black Hat Conference</a>on July 8, 2018.</i></p>\n  <p>As I kid, I used to spend hours at the arcade playing whack-a-mole. With a toy mallet in hand, I’d smash as many plastic moles as possible. But the more moles I whacked, the faster they popped up out of their holes.</p>\n  <p>I haven’t played this arcade game in years, but there have been times when my career in computer security felt like a reality version of whack-a-mole. Computer security issues are emerging at a quickening pace, and everyone’s energy is spent knocking out the same problems over and over and over.</p>\n  <p>We have to stop taking a whack-a-mole approach to security. Instead, we need to focus our energy on tackling the root causes of bad security, strategically investing in long-arc defense projects, and building out our coalitions beyond security experts.</p>\n  <h2>Tackle the root cause</h2>\n  <p>As the world becomes more dependent on safe and reliable technology, we can no longer be satisfied with isolated security fixes. Instead, we need to identify and tackle the underlying causes of bad security—whether they’re structural, organizational or technical.</p>\n  <p><a href=\"https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2014/07/announcing-project-zero.html\">Project Zero</a>, a team that formed at Google in 2014, aims to advance the understanding of offensive security and improve defensive strategies. Over the past four years, <a href=\"https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/\">the team has reported</a> more than 1,400 vulnerabilities in a variety of targets, including operating systems, browsers, antivirus software, password managers, hardware and other popular software. But what's more impressive than that number is the impact we’re seeing across industry in terms of tackling the root causes of bad security.</p>\n  <p>In the case of Project Zero, the team recognized that vendor response times for fixing critical security reports varied hugely, and it often didn’t tip in favor of the people using the technology. Unfortunately, software vendors don’t always have incentives aligned that prioritize security. To address that underlying problem, <a href=\"https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2015/02/feedback-and-data-driven-updates-to.html\">Project Zero introduced a consistent 90-day disclosure policy</a> that removed the historical, time-consuming negotiation between security researchers and vendors.</p>\n  <p>Initially, this deadline-driven approach was controversial. It caused short-term pain for organizations that needed to make structural changes. But sticking to this approach resulted in &nbsp;vendors investing more in solving root problems that, for whatever reason, weren’t previously addressed. Since the introduction of the deadline-driven disclosure policy, one large vendor doubled the number of security updates released each year, and another vendor improved response time by 40 percent. When it came to the controversial deadline, 98 percent of the security issues Project Zero reported have been fixed within 90 days, up from 25 percent.</p>\n  <p>Through all of this, Project Zero worked in the open to advance the public’s understanding of exploitation techniques. Ultimately, the team recognized that one individual security researcher isn’t likely to change the behavior of a large vendor, but a larger public response can. The team sought out opportunities for collaboration with other vendors, and people came together, both inside and outside the walls of Google, to analyze and build defenses against exploits discovered in the wild.</p>\n  <p>Solving the root problems—especially in today’s distraction-driven environments—isn’t always the fastest or easiest route to take, but it builds a foundation for a more secure future.</p>\n  <h2>Celebrate milestones to make progress on strategic projects</h2>\n  <p>To make real security change, we need to commit to long-arc defense efforts, no matter how complex they may be or how long they take to complete. Maintaining momentum for these projects requires strategically picking milestones, communicating them repeatedly and celebrating progress along the way.</p>\n  <p>In 2014, the Chrome team set out on a mission to drive the adoption of HTTPS on the open web. We wanted the web to be secure by default, instead of opt-in secure. We also wanted to address confusion in our existing network security indicators; <a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/soups2016/soups2016-paper-porter-felt.pdf\">users weren’t perceiving the risk of HTTP connections given our lack of a warning</a>. We knew this project would take many years to complete because of the complexity of the web ecosystem and the associated risk of making big changes to browser security warnings.</p>\n  <p>It's important to remember that nobody owns the web. It’s an open ecosystem of multiple players, each with different incentives and constraints—so projects of this magnitude require wrangling a lot of moving parts. To avoid creating warning fatigue and confusion about the web, we set strategic milestones over a long period and <a href=\"https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/marking-http-as-non-secure\">share them publicly</a>.</p>\n  <p>My job as a manager was to make sure my team believed change was possible and that they stayed optimistic over the entire course of the project. We shared a comprehensive step-by-step strategy and published the plan on our developer wiki for feedback. Our milestone-based plan started out simple and increasingly upped the pressure over time. Internally, we found fun and inexpensive ways to keep team morale high. We kicked off a brainstorming day with a poetry slam—finger snapping included! We made celebratory HTTPS cakes, pies and cookies. We also had a team chat to share updates, challenges and a lot of GIFs.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \">\n    <img alt=\"https cake\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/cake-3.max-1000x1000.png\" />\n   </figure>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>Building momentum externally was equally important. When sites made the switch to the more secure HTTPS, we celebrated with the broader community—<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23MOARTLS&amp;src=typd\">usually via Twitter</a>. And <a href=\"https://transparencyreport.google.com/https/\">we published a transparency report</a> that shed light on top sites and their HTTPS status. Hooray for openness!</p>\n  <p>Since our official announcement of these changes, <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/chrome/milestone-chrome-security-marking-http-not-secure/\">HTTPS usage has made incredible progress</a>. The web is ultimately more secure today because of a loose coalition of people who were able to stay committed to seeing a long, ambitious project all the way through. Which brings me to my third point...</p>\n  <h2>Build a coalition</h2>\n  <p>As we proactively invest in ambitious defense projects where the benefits aren’t immediately clear, we need to build a strong coalition of champions and supporters.</p>\n  <p>In 2012, the Chrome team started its <a href=\"https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/site-isolation\">Site Isolation effort</a>, a project that mitigated the risk of cross-site data theft on the web. The project turned out to be the largest architecture change and code refactor in the history of Chrome! This was no small task considering Chrome is 10 years old, has more than 10 million lines of C++ code and has hundreds of engineers committing hundreds of changes each day from around the world. The core Site Isolation team was made up of only around 10 people, so building a strong coalition of support for the project outside of the team was critical for its success.</p>\n  <p>Originally, we thought this project would take a year to complete. Turns out we were off by more than a factor of five! Estimation mistakes like this tend to put a bullseye on a project’s back from upper management—and with good reason. Luckily, the team regularly articulated progress to me and the reasons why it was more work than first anticipated. They also demonstrated positive impact in terms of overall Chrome code health, which benefited other parts of Chrome. That gave me additional cover to defend the project and communicate its value to senior stakeholders over the years. <br /></p>\n  <p>Aside from management, the team needed allies from partner teams. If other Chrome team members weren’t motivated to help or didn’t respond quickly to questions, emails and code reviews, then this 10-person project could have dragged on forever. The team kept a positive attitude and went out of their way to help others, even if it didn't relate directly to their own project. Ultimately, they conducted themselves as good citizens to build a community of support—a good lesson for all of us. We might be able to find the problems and technical solutions on our own, but we rely on everyone working on technology to help clear the path to a safer future.<br /></p>\n  <p>We’ll keep finding complex problems to solve as technology evolves, but I’m optimistic that we can continue to keep people safe. It just requires a little bit of change. We need to take a different approach to computer security that doesn’t feel like playing whack-o-mole. So let’s band together—inside and outside of our organizations—and commit to ambitious projects that solve the root problems. And let’s not forget to celebrate our wins along the way! 🎉</p>\n </div>\n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 11 Sep 2018 15:00:00 +0000","feedId":562,"bgimg":"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/cake-3.max-1000x1000.png","linkMd5":"132ab15c6332d3754e66ebd6cc14e957","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn58@2020_1/2020/08/16/12-04-30-261_abfd6923f6399fec.webp","destWidth":1000,"destHeight":760,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/cake-3.max-1000x1000.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn96@2020_4/2020/08/16/12-04-33-779_abfd6923f6399fec.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/Egta/~4/R-IqYewy214":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn44@2020_1/2020/08/16/12-04-32-339_7723d26412e88348.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 20:03:56","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 20:03:56","title":"New malware protections for Advanced Protection users","link":"https://blog.google/products/android/new-malware-protections-advanced-protection-users/","description":"<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p><a href=\"https://landing.google.com/advancedprotection/\">Advanced Protection</a> safeguards the personal or business Google Accounts of anyone at risk of targeted attacks—like political campaign teams, journalists, activists and business leaders.

Many people who are blind or have low vision rely on screen readers to make the content of web pages accessible through spoken feedback or braille.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>For images and graphics, screen readers rely on descriptions created by developers and web authors, which are usually referred to as “alt text” or “alt attributes” in the code. However, there are millions of online images without any description, leading screen readers to say “image,” “unlabeled graphic,” or a lengthy, unhelpful reading of the image’s file name. When a page contains images without descriptions, people who are blind may not get all of the information conveyed, or even worse, it may make the site totally unusable for them. To improve that experience, we’ve built an automatic image description feature called <a href=\"https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/9311597?hl=en\">Get Image Descriptions from Google.</a> When a screen reader encounters an image or graphic without a description, Chrome will create one.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>Image descriptions automatically generated by a computer aren't as good as those written by a human who can include additional context, but they can be accurate and helpful. An image description might help a blind person read a restaurant menu, or better understand what their friends are posting on social media.</p>\n  <p>If someone using a screen reader chooses to opt in through Settings, an unlabeled image on Chrome is sent securely to a Google server running machine learning software. The technology aggregates data from multiple machine-learning models. Some models look for text in the image, including signs, labels, and handwritten words. Other models look for objects they've been trained to recognize—like a pencil, a tree, a person wearing a business suit, or a helicopter. The most sophisticated model can describe the main idea of an image using a complete sentence.</p>\n  <p>The description is evaluated for accuracy and valuable information: Does the annotation describe the image well? Is the description useful? Based on whether the annotation meets that criteria, the machine learning model determines what should be shown to the person, if anything. We’ll only provide a description if we have reasonable confidence it's correct. If any of our models indicate the results may be inaccurate or misleading, we err on the side of giving a simpler answer, or nothing at all.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>Here are a couple of examples of the actual descriptions generated by Chrome when used with a screen reader.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \">\n    <img alt=\"Pineapples, bananas and coconuts\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Pineapples_bananas_and_coconuts.max-1000x1000.jpg\" />\n    <figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \">\n     <div class=\"rich-text\">\n      <p>Machine-generated description for this image: \"Appears to be: Fruits and vegetables at the market.\"</p>\n     </div>\n    </figcaption>\n   </figure>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \">\n    <img alt=\"Man playing guitar on gray sofa\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Man_playing_guitar_on_gray_sofa.max-1000x1000.jpg\" />\n    <figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \">\n     <div class=\"rich-text\">\n      <p>Machine-generated description for this image: \"Appears to be: Person playing guitar on the sofa.\"&nbsp;</p>\n     </div>\n    </figcaption>\n   </figure>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>Over the past few months of testing, we’ve created more than 10 million descriptions with hundreds of thousands being added every day.

Jones on AI and art","link":"https://blog.google/technology/ai/bill-t-jones-dance-art/","description":"<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>In early 2019, the Google Creative Lab partnered with Bill T. Jones, a pioneering choreographer, two-time Tony Award Winner, MacArthur Fellow, National Medal of the Arts Honoree, and artistic director and co-founder of the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Company of <a href=\"https://newyorklivearts.org/\">New York Live Arts</a>. We teamed up to explore the creative possibilities of speech recognition and <a href=\"https://medium.com/tensorflow/real-time-human-pose-estimation-in-the-browser-with-tensorflow-js-7dd0bc881cd5\">PoseNet</a>, which is Google’s machine-learning model that estimates human poses in real time in the browser.</p>\n  <p>We sat down with Bill to hear his reflections on working at the intersection of art, technology, identity and the body—you can <a href=\"https://experiments.withgoogle.com/billtjonesai\">try out the experiments</a> and watch a short film about the collaboration.</p>\n  <p><b>Why did you collaborate with Google on AI experiments?</b></p>\n  <p>The idea of machine learning intrigues me. The theme of our company’s <a href=\"https://newyorklivearts.org/\">Live Ideas Fest</a> this year is artificial intelligence. AI is supposed to take us into the next century and important things are supposed to be happening with this technology, so I wanted to see if we could use it to stir real human emotion. Maybe it’s ego, but I want to be the one to know how to use PoseNet to make somebody cry. How do you get the technology to be weighted with meaning and import?</p>\n  <p><b>How have you experimented with technology over the course of your career?</b></p>\n  <p>Back in the ‘80s, Arnie Zane [Jones’s partner and company co-founder] and I decided we didn’t want to work with technology anymore because the pure art of sweat and bodies on stage should be enough. Technology just steals your thunder. Then a friend said, “Technology can suggest the beyond. Technology can project what is at stake when you die. When you see these figures, they’re no longer human, they’re something else.” So we started working with more state-of-the-art technologies. Later, I did a project called “Ghostcatching” with 3D motion capture. At that time, the team was saying, “we want to capture your movement so that in 50 years we could reconstitute your performance.” That’s how people were thinking years ago, and seems to still be a preoccupation now. They said they wanted to “decouple me from my personality.” Maybe I’m romantic, but I don't think that’s possible. So, my focus with this project was not on how to replace the performer, but complement them.</p>\n  <p><b>What was it like experimenting with AI?</b></p>\n  <p>I’ve never collaborated with a machine before. It's a whole other learning curve. We are taught in the art world that you don’t get many chances. This experience contrasted that notion. It was refreshing to co-create with the Google team whose approach was playful and iterative.</p>\n  <p><b>Were there moments you felt this technology was in the service of dance?</b>&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>In the <i>service</i> of dance? I say this with great respect: it's almost antithetical to everything I thought dance was. The webcam’s field of vision determines a lot about how we move. Dance for us is often times in an empty room that implies infinite space. But working with a webcam, there is a very prescribed space. Limitations are not bad in art making, but they were a new challenge. It was a shift creating something for the screen and not the stage.</p>\n  <p><b>What was it like shifting from creating for the stage to the screen?</b></p>\n  <p>I felt like I was being asked: Come out of the place that you as an artist come from, the avant-garde. Come and work with a medium that's available to millions of people. That's wonderful, but it's also a responsibility. The meaningful things people make with this are going to be very weird in a way, aren't they? Very kind of exciting. I'm appreciative of being part of the development of this.</p>\n  <p><b>Where do you see AI going? Will you work with it more in the future?</b>&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>I understand context is the next frontier in machine learning. This seems paramount for art making. I hope one day soon they make a machine I can dance with. I’d like to dance with a machine, just to see what that’s like.</p>\n </div>\n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 10 May 2019 16:00:00 +0000","feedId":562,"bgimg":"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Ourbodies_billTjones_YT_keyword_2120x888.max-1300x1300.png","linkMd5":"b7d25af887e332aa438b7af87fe46e0a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn16@2020_6/2020/08/16/12-04-31-987_0a510f008743abaf.webp","metaImg":"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Ourbodies_billTjones_YT_keyword_2120x888.max-1300x1300.png","destWidth":1300,"destHeight":545,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/Egta/~4/AHXd_jpGcq4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn72@2020_4/2020/08/16/12-04-32-836_3ab7154189aebcc5.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 20:03:56","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 20:03:56","title":"Data Privacy Day: seven ways we protect your privacy","link":"https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/data-privacy-day-seven-ways-we-protect-your-privacy/","description":"<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>Keeping you safe online is a top priority at Google, especially for the thousands of Googlers who work on privacy and security around the world.

When you turn off Incognito mode, you’ll return to a personalized Google Maps experience with restaurant recommendations, information about your commute, and other features tailored to you.</p>\n  <p><b>4. Try hands-free privacy controls with the Google Assistant</b></p>\n  <p></p>\n  <p>You can also manage your privacy settings with help from the Assistant. Just say, “Hey Google, delete everything I said to you last week” to delete Assistant activity from your Google Account, or “Hey Google, that wasn’t for you,” to tell the Assistant to forget what it heard if the Assistant responds to something that wasn’t actually a question or request. And to learn how Google keeps your data private and secure, just ask, “Hey Google, how do you keep my data safe?”&nbsp;</p>\n  <p><b>5. Browse the web safely with Chrome</b></p>\n  <p></p>\n  <p><a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/chrome/better-password-protections/\">Safe Browsing in Chrome</a> automatically protects you from malicious ads and warns you before you visit dangerous sites or download suspicious files. If you use Chrome, your password protections are automatically built-in. We’ll warn you if your username and password have been compromised in a known breach as you log into websites.</p>\n  <p><b>6. Check in on your privacy settings across your apps and devices</b></p>\n  <p></p>\n  <p>Data Privacy Day is a great time to check in on your privacy and security settings. Take a <a href=\"https://myaccount.google.com/privacycheckup?e=ReorderPrivacyCheckupSteps\">Privacy Checkup</a> and we’ll walk you through key privacy settings step-by-step. You can do things like choose what data—such as your location and search history—gets saved to your Google Account or control what ads you see. When you’re finished, head over to <a href=\"https://myaccount.google.com/security-checkup?hl=en&amp;e=ReorderPrivacyCheckupSteps\">Security Checkup</a> for personalized recommendations to help protect your data and devices, like managing which third-party apps have access to your account data.</p>\n  <p><b>7. Control what ads you see from Google</b></p>\n  <p><a href=\"https://safety.google/privacy/ads-and-data/\">We do not sell your personal information</a> to anyone and give you transparency, choice and control over how your information is used. If you’re curious about why you’re seeing an ad, you can click on <a href=\"https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1634057\">Why this ad</a> for more information. If you no longer find a specific ad relevant, you can choose to block that ad by using the <a href=\"https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922\">Mute this ad</a> control.

As a result, attackers are shifting their strategies to threaten Advanced Protection users outside of email with linked malware and “drive-by downloads” where users unknowingly download harmful software onto their devices.<br /></p>\n  <p>To protect our users proactively, attempts to download certain risky files will now show additional warnings, or in some cases even be blocked.

Through our own usage and early user research, we’ve found that some people like to group their Chrome tabs by topic. For instance, it helps if you're working on several projects, or looking through multiple shopping and review sites.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>Others have been grouping their tabs by how urgent they are-- “ASAP,” “this week” and “later.” Similarly, tab groups can help keep track of your progress on certain tasks: “haven’t started,” “in progress,” “need to follow up” and “completed.” My pro tip is that you can use an emoji as a group name such as ❤️ for inspiration or 📖 for articles to read. Tab groups are customizable so you can decide how to use them. And just like regular tabs, your groups are saved when you close and reopen Chrome.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \">\n    <img alt=\"Tab-Groups-Organization-Example_v1r1.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Tab-Groups-Organization-Example_v1r1.gif\" />\n    <figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \">\n     <div class=\"rich-text\">\n      <p>Group tabs by topic, urgency, progress, etc. It’s up to you how to group them.</p>\n     </div>\n    </figcaption>\n   </figure>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>Chrome’s stability and performance are important to us, so we’re releasing tab groups slowly in our upcoming version of Chrome, which begins rolling out next week.
