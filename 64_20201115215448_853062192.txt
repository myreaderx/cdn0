Meet the Samsung Galaxy Infinite Concept (at least that&#8217;s what I want to call it&#8230;), a phone with two wraparound displays that cover the front and back halves of the phone. I say halves because the phone has a minimal parting line running through it, because the Galaxy Infinite is, in fact, a slider phone!</p>\n<p>The sliding mechanism makes up for the fact that with a 100% screen-to-body ratio (on both the front AND the back), there&#8217;s really no space for cameras&#8230; so the Galaxy Infinite concept builds the cameras into the concealed surfaces that reveal themselves when the two halves slide apart. The phone comes with a single set of cameras that serve as both front and rear-facing shooters (because with a 100% display, the phone doesn&#8217;t really have a front or back). Slide the cameras out and you can either click rear-facing shots using the opposite screen as a viewfinder, or use the same-side screen for viewing your selfies as you click them.</p>\n<p>The 100% screen-to-body ratio results in a few obvious trade-offs. Sure, there&#8217;s no notch, or no hole-punch camera&#8230; but there&#8217;s also no volume or power button on the Galaxy Infinite, given that the screens cover the side edges of the phone too. The upper and lower edges seem to be spared, however, for critical components like earpieces, microphones, charging ports, and possibly a SIM tray. I assume the lack of buttons is replaced by a haptic-touch system found in phones like the Xiaomi Mi Mix Alpha, which lets you tap to have a volume widget show up on the side of the screen.</p>\n<p>So why would <a href=\"http://yankodesign.com/tag/Samsung\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Samsung</a> patent a smartphone with wraparound screens on the front and the back? Well, the answer is simply, because it&#8217;s possible. Xiaomi launched the Mi Mix Alpha for practically the same reason&#8230; as a flex, to show what they&#8217;re capable of producing. Similar to concept vehicles displayed by automotive companies at motor shows, I doubt these phones will really ever hit the shelves for consumers to buy (whether there&#8217;s actually demand for these phones is a completely different question). However, they&#8217;re a great indication of innovation, and also help companies really explore new avenues, while bringing the cost of expensive technologies down in the long run. I guess we can all agree that THAT&#8217;s definitely a good thing.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The brand new patent entitled ‘Electronic device’ was applied for by Samsung Electronics at the USPTO (United States

reward ideas, SHAPL is actually committed to developing them. One of the few design competitions that&#8217;s focused on the outcome rather than just the concept, the SHAPL Design Competition takes winning ideas and actually develops them into real-world products that people can buy, use, and be delighted by! The process is quite simple. Develop your design, upload it to SHAPL&#8217;s competition dashboard, and it gets judged not just by a jury, but also by consumers who would love to own the product. Consumers vote for products they like, bringing the human-centric element into the competition, allowing the market to choose the most market-ready, market-worthy product&#8230; while the jury panel also helps vet designs based on practicality, aesthetics, and overall appeal. Winners not only see their <strong>products turn into reality</strong>, but also get <strong>patents to their designs</strong>, and <strong>hefty cash prizes</strong> of up to $10,000. (With total cash prizes amounting to $100,000!)</p>\n<p>The SHAPL Design Contest is currently in its 3rd edition and entries are free for all, and open till the 17th of December 2020&#8230; that gives you a month&#8217;s worth of time to come up with a great idea for a product, design it, and tweak it till it&#8217;s a stellar concept! The contest offers a great opportunity to really test the waters with your product and actually gauge market response, thanks to the ability for the audience to choose the winners. There are no strict rules or regulations pertaining to what category of product you can submit, giving you the freedom to create anything from consumer electronics to home-decor, and from fashion and personal-care to even child-care! SHAPL oversees the production and prototyping of your concept, collaborating with you over choice of material, CMF, etc. If you&#8217;ve been published on Yanko Design, take it from us, your designs stand an even stronger chance of being one of the many winners of the SHAPL Design Contest! Go ahead and shoot your shot! (did we mention, it&#8217;s free?) Entries are open till the 17th of December 2020. Give your renders the limelight and opportunity they deserve, and your portfolio the street-cred it deserves!

Hairstyler Pro (Gold Winner)</h4>\n<p>The Hairstyler Pro is perhaps the best example to highlight how innovation-driven and consumer-focused the SHAPL Design Contest is. This U-shaped hairdryer radically re-imagines how hairdryers look, behave, and interact with the users. The Hairstyler Pro looks nothing like a hairdryer because it&#8217;s so much more than one. Designed to be a dryer that works in your hand as well as hands-free, and with an attachment that turns it into a curler, the Hairstyler Pro is the ultimate hairdressing appliance. The U-shaped profile bends and contorts to assume different shapes that give it its variety of functions. A curler attachment (which applies the same curling principles found in Dyson&#8217;s curler) uses spiral wind patterns to quickly and effectively curl your hair, and the hands-free mode lets you use both your hands to comb/style your hair while the dryer stands vertically on your dressing table, blowing air exactly where you want it to! Pretty innovative, huh!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3pFdEd4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-287254 alignnone\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/11/draft-shapl-design-contest-is-here-to-prototype-your-ideas-into-actual-products/shapl_2020_contest_2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></a></p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">02. Furia Bicycle by Francesco Manocchio (Bronze Winner)</h4>\n<p>If the Furia bicycles fearsome form looks familiar, that’s because you’ve definitely seen it before… only, not in a bicycle! It’s one of the first to utilize motorcycle-inspired hub-center steering. Rather than above the wheel, the pivot points are located in the wheel hub, allowing the steering, braking, and suspension functions to be separate. This results in a smoother more controlled ride, especially over bumps and road irregularities. Shocks are immediately absorbed by the suspension with minimal transfer to the rest of the bike. This also assists with rider endurance. Combining carbon fiber composite and 3D printing, it’s unmatched in lightness, strength and performance.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3pFdEd4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-287255 alignnone\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/11/draft-shapl-design-contest-is-here-to-prototype-your-ideas-into-actual-products/shapl_2020_contest_3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></a></p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">03. OAVE Microwave by Youngwoong Kim &#38; Jungbae Gong</h4>\n<p>Unlike conventional microwaves that exist as a box-shaped oven with a door and a rotating plate on the inside, OAVE takes on a much more ornamental approach to gadget’s design, giving it a cylindrical structure and a cloche-shaped lid you can take off to reveal the food inside. OAVE gives your microwave oven a much more aesthetic, table-friendly avatar. The two-part design comprises a rotating base, and a perforated metal and glass cover that sits over your food. Visible from all sides, the food rotates on its lazy-suzy base, illuminated by an overhead light. When you’re done, lift up the lid to reveal the fresh hot meal beneath!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3pFdEd4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-287256 alignnone\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/11/draft-shapl-design-contest-is-here-to-prototype-your-ideas-into-actual-products/shapl_2020_contest_4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></a></p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">04. Baek-Ja Fire Extinguisher by Ko Yuni</h4>\n<p>Modeled on the pottery style of the Joseon Dynasty, the Baek-Ja Fire Extinguisher looks less like a fire-safety device and more like an oriental vase you&#8217;d have no qualms about keeping in the center of your room! The faceted outer body simply acts as an external cover for the inner extinguisher vessel. The bulbous part of the vase protects it against impacts and shocks, while the concave part extends beyond the base of the inner vessel to keep it from coming in contact with the floor while in use. I&#8217;m not entirely sure if having a fire-extinguisher colored white is &#8216;up to code&#8217;, but this concept sure looks less utilitarian and more aesthetic than the other extinguishers out there!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3pFdEd4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-287257 alignnone\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/11/draft-shapl-design-contest-is-here-to-prototype-your-ideas-into-actual-products/shapl_2020_contest_5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"850\" /></a></p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">05. LITO Candle Holder by Mina Kasirifar</h4>\n<p>Designed to not just class up your cake but also prevent the wax from dripping onto the food below, the LITO Candle Holder quite literally makes your birthday-cake heavenly! The angelic candlestand can be push-fitted into the cake facing either inwards or outwards, and can hold all sorts of candles&#8230; even the numbered ones!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3pFdEd4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-287342 alignnone\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/11/draft-shapl-design-contest-is-here-to-prototype-your-ideas-into-actual-products/shapl_2020_contest_66.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></a></p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">06. Luft Flow by Luft (Gold Winner)</h4>\n<p>The Luft Flow explores a unique approach to air filtration. Divided into two parts, this purifier separates the appliance&#8217;s two core functions &#8211; purification and humidification. You can simply detach the small, portable purifier unit from its humidifier base and carry it around with you. The purifier works on an internal battery, filtering the air of whichever room it&#8217;s kept in, while the base of the Luft Flow works towards regulating temperature and humidity in the house!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3pFdEd4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-287343 alignnone\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/11/draft-shapl-design-contest-is-here-to-prototype-your-ideas-into-actual-products/shapl_2020_contest_77.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"743\" /></a></p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">07. Chess Pick by MEARI</h4>\n<p>They say chess is a great game to make your mind healthy, but what if it could make your body healthy too? These adorable chess-piece food-picks are an interesting cross-over, in part because they make your fruit-bowl look interesting, but also because they&#8217;re just intuitively designed to be gripped (as all chess pieces are). Don&#8217;t say we can&#8217;t play with our food now!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3pFdEd4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-287260 alignnone\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/11/draft-shapl-design-contest-is-here-to-prototype-your-ideas-into-actual-products/shapl_2020_contest_8.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"759\" /></a></p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">08. Model Y Router by Ninety Studio</h4>\n<p>Unlike the antiquated box/antenna form, Y’s triangular shape is at once minimalistic, sculptural and functional. Its internal parts have been reorganized in a more sensible way that keeps the antenna contained and protected. Better yet, one section of the triangle is dedicated to cable storage! You can actually tuck away any extra cord directly into the device. Until Mark Zuckerberg gets thats universal internet idea off the ground, I NEED this in my life!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3pFdEd4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-287344 alignnone\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/11/draft-shapl-design-contest-is-here-to-prototype-your-ideas-into-actual-products/shapl_2020_contest_99.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></a></p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">09. Unit Pen by Unit Pen</h4>\n<p>Think of the Unit Pen as an ultimate instance of fidget-stationery. Designed almost like beads strung around a necklace, the Unit Pen comes with multiple playful units strung together using the pen&#8217;s refill.

dog!","link":"https://www.yankodesign.com/?p=286833","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-286838\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/11/286833/03_Puro_TaeukHam_PetCareRobot.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p>\n<p>I trust that I’m not far off in assuming that many of us have considered adopting a pet at least once during the quarantine. But they can be a lot of work and sometimes we bite off more than we can chew. Some pet owners have busy schedules and work their pet’s needs around them, or others might seek out help from a professional dog sitter. Whatever the case may be, Taeuk Ham was awarded the Silver A&#8217;Design for his design, Puro, the pet care robot, in order to lighten the load.</p>\n<p>Puro is a multi-functional, autonomous robot that does&#8230;a lot. It implements three distinct modes: play, clean, and air purification. In ‘play’ mode, Puro tosses dog treats when your pet is left alone in order to help alleviate some of your dog’s anxiety. Once the treat is tossed and your pup is munching, Puro enters ‘clean’ mode and vacuums over any fallen crumbs. From there, Puro operates as an air purifier to neutralize odors and suck in loose hairs or strands of fur. One of the many features that come with Puro is the smart cleaning function. Similar to the smart robot vacuum, Puro meanders around your floor in order to collect dust, dirt, hairs, and fur, avoiding your pup and other household items along the way.</p>\n<p>Moreover, while you’re away, Puro extends its fully-integrated dog-feeding station and also tosses treats in your pup’s direction with help from an implanted camera that maps out the floor and a gyroscopic sensor that tracks angular velocity throughout any given room. This ensures that, even when you aren’t home, your pet’s eating schedule isn’t compromised. Another aspect that distinguishes this design from other smart robot vacuums is the embedded air-purifier that operates with an incorporated air filter located in the machine’s charging station. Once Puro has completed its cleaning of the living room and feeding your pet their lunch or dinner, the vacuum slinks its way into the main charging station to turn the air-purifying function on, which cools down the top, cushioned layer of Puro that doubles as a dog bed.</p>\n<p>While Puro certainly maintains an eating schedule for your animal friend and cleans up their space for you, you can still take your dog for nice, long walks come evening time and develop that special, close bond during the hours you&#8217;re home from work. Furthermore, if you live alone and find yourself cutting corners and speeding around the clock to keep your dog’s eating on schedule, then Puro certainly takes some of that pressure from your shoulders. Having a pet takes responsibility and while Puro, or any other robot, can’t replace that close kinship we feel towards animals, it can help preserve a certain degree of trust between you and your puppy.</p>\n<p>Designer: Taeuk Ham</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-286839\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/11/286833/04_Puro_TaeukHam_PetCareRobot.png\"

screen!","link":"https://www.yankodesign.com/?p=286826","description":"<p><iframe title=\"Infinity Game Table by Arcade1Up\" src=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/infinitygametable/infinity-game-table-by-arcade1up/widget/video.html\" height=\"590.625\" width=\"1050\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p>In a lot of ways, the Infinity Game Table is what the Microsoft Surface Table should have been. It seems more and more like Microsoft jumped at launching a product without a fully formed idea just because it seemed like the right marketing move, but hey the Surface Table didn&#8217;t really click. The Infinity Game Table, however, picks up where the Surface left off and uses the tabletop surface to reimagine gaming, entertainment, and recreation.</p>\n<p>Designed by Arcade1Up, the same group of people who brought back cabinet-style arcade games like Pac-Man, Frogger, Mortal Kombat, TMNT, Street Fighter, Galaga, and other iconic classics to life (seriously, you should check their website out), the Infinity Game Table is the ultimate piece of gaming furniture. Designed to be just like the coffee-table you&#8217;d play board games or assemble jigsaw-puzzles on, the Infinity Game Table comes with a touchscreen display built into its surface that lets you play a multitude of board games from Monopoly to Yahtzee, Scrabble, Trivial Pursuit, Candyland, Hungry Hippos, Tic Tac Toe, and a whole bunch of other games including indie titles (with new ones being added every day). The dynamic display even allows you to assemble jigsaw puzzles, and since everything is virtual (as opposed to physical board games), you can potentially save your progress and continue playing your game after a couple of days, starting where you left off!</p>\n<p>Each Infinity Game Table comes with Wi-Fi that allows you to access its seemingly infinite library of games, puzzles, and even comic books (yeah, you can read books too!), but here&#8217;s where it gets interesting&#8230; the Wi-Fi connectivity lets you partner with other Infinity Game Table users, playing across rooms or even in different parts of the world. This opens up the ability to play more complex games like Texas Hold&#8217;em or Battleships without allowing your opponent to see your hand or your layout. The table lets you pair up with up to 6 different players at the same time, playing games and bonding with each other while you&#8217;re socially distancing from your individual homes. If you&#8217;re playing with the family, the Infinity Game Table offers hours of entertainment and fun, allowing you to sit at home and play over 50 popular and indie games, thanks to partnerships with gaming giants like Hasbro among others. Families with younger players can opt for more age-appropriate activities like built-in coloring books too!</p>\n<p>The Infinity Game Table comes in two variants, offering a choice between a 24&#8243; and a 32&#8243; screen. Both units sport an HD display sitting under an impact-resistant and water-proof glass top (so you could potentially still use it as a table). Speakers underneath the table, along with tactile vibration motors make the gaming experience multi-sensorial, allowing you to immerse yourself while playing. The legs on the table are removable too, which means you could just as easily place the unit on your bed and have your family or friends sit around&#8230; and given that the entire experience is virtual, you&#8217;ll never have to worry about losing a card, dice, player pr puzzle piece ever again!</p>\n<p>Designer: Arcade1Up</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/infinitygametable/infinity-game-table-by-arcade1up?ref=cguawp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Click Here to Buy Now: $499</strong></a> <del datetime=\"2020-11-13T14:31:20+00:00\">$599</del> ($100 off).
