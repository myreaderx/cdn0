To evaluate the material gain in a broad range of injection\r\ncurrents (30–1200 A cm −2 per-layer) we studied edge-emitting lasers with various numbers of\r\nInGaAs/GaAs QWD layers in the active region and different waveguide designs. The dependence of the\r\nmaterial gain on the current is well fitted by an empirical exponential equation similar to the one\r\nused for quantum dots (QDs) in the whole range of injection current densities. The estimated QWD\r\ntransparency current-density-per-layer of 31 A cm −2 ranks between the values reported for quantum\r\nwells and QDs. The maximal QWD material gain as high as 1.1⋅10 4 cm −1 has been measured. The\r\nresults obtained confirm specific gain properties of InGaAs QWDs making them promising active media\r\nfor lasers, superluminescence diodes and optical amplifiers.","descriptionType":"text/plain","publishedDate":"Fri, 13 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000","feedId":22531,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"b8ea6eb4464e76c8ec84d77c03e578bc","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Nikita Yu Gordeev, Mikhail V Maximov, Alexey S Payusov, Artem A Serin, Yuri M Shernyakov, Sergey A Mintairov, Nikolay A Kalyuzhnyy, Alexey M Nadtochiy and Alexey E Zhukov","publishedOrCreatedDate":1605485826510}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-11-16 08:17:06","updatedTime":"2020-11-16 08:17:06","feedId":22531,"fetchDate":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 00:17:06 +0000","fetchMs":32052,"handleMs":8,"totalMs":32077,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"8af8d7c60d2471273bf75c4f16db12c0","hostName":"us-014*","requestId":"49f0cd4c30624f5baf8b60b0c498a5b1_22531","contentType":"application/xml;charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":0,"bgimgsTotal":0,"bgimgsGithubTotal":0,"articlesImgsTotal":0,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":0,"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 02:27:56","updatedTime":"2020-09-07 04:18:44","id":22531,"name":"Semiconductor Science and Technology - latest papers","url":"http://iopscience.iop.org/0268-1242/?rss=1","subscriber":147,"website":null,"icon":"http://iopscience.iop.org/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx64/cdn45@2020_2/2020/09/06/20-18-43-535_89e2c9662d839ba1.ico","description":"Latest articles for Semiconductor Science and Technology","weekly":null,"link":null},"noPictureArticleList":[],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1605485794434,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":32069,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":8,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":0,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"},{"spend":0,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"}]},"extra5":0,"extra6":0,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[],"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}}
