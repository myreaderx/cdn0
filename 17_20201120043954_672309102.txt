When a wealthy relative of the merchant with whom Edwards was apprenticing died, it was decided that the man&#8217;s colossal book collection was to be moved into the apartment where the young man was boarding. Inconvenienced as he was by the spatial assault of tomes, Edwards suddenly had access to the equivalent of a private university library &#8212; more knowledge than the vast majority of his peers could touch in a lifetime. Day after day, night after night, he found himself absorbed in these rapturous portals into poetry, astronomy, classical sculpture, and natural history. Suddenly, the life-path he had been set on &#8212; the pursuit of wealth through commerce &#8212; seemed so small and so impoverished of imagination. </p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_72000\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/yellow-breasted-toucan-by-george-edwards-1761-benefiting-the-nature-conservancy_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GeorgeEdwards_toucan2.jpg?resize=680%2C890&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"890\" class=\"size-full wp-image-72000\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GeorgeEdwards_toucan2.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GeorgeEdwards_toucan2.jpg?resize=240%2C314&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GeorgeEdwards_toucan2.jpg?resize=320%2C419&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GeorgeEdwards_toucan2.jpg?resize=768%2C1005&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GeorgeEdwards_toucan2.jpg?resize=600%2C785&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Yellow-breasted Toucan.

When he returned a month later, he wandered London for two years, young and unemployed and unemployable in his restive longing for something grander than mere money-work. He left again, not sure where to or what for, but as he wandered the fjords of Norway away from human habitation, watching the seabirds, watching the sky, watching the subtlest seasonal changes of the trees and flowers, something awoke in him, something was answered. </p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_71998\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/black-and-blue-titmouse-with-pomegranate-blossom-by-george-edwards-1761-benefiting-nature-charity_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GeorgeEdwards_titmouse.jpg?resize=680%2C837&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"837\" class=\"size-full wp-image-71998\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GeorgeEdwards_titmouse.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GeorgeEdwards_titmouse.jpg?resize=240%2C295&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GeorgeEdwards_titmouse.jpg?resize=320%2C394&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GeorgeEdwards_titmouse.jpg?resize=768%2C945&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GeorgeEdwards_titmouse.jpg?resize=600%2C739&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Black-and-blue Titmouse with Pomegranate Blossom.

He spent his limited means on the best bird paintings he could find, studied them closely with a savage admiration, then began making drawings of his own.

His was an era that saw science not as an instrument for magnifying our understanding of reality but as a mirror for affirming the perfection of a religion-invented creator god. In the final years of his life, Edwards composed a striking confession, framing his passion for natural history and science as a guilty vanity distracting him from his religious responsibility:</p>\n<blockquote><p>My petition to God (if petitions to God are not presumptuous) is, that he would remove from me all desire of pursuing Natural History, or any other study; and inspire me with as much knowledge of his divine nature as my imperfect state is capable of; that I may conduct myself, for the remainder of my days, in a manner most agreeable to his will, which will consequently be most happy to myself. What my condition may be in futurity is known only to the wife disposer of all things; yet my present desires are (perhaps vain and inconsistent with the nature of things!) that I may become an intelligent spirit, void of gross matter, gravity and levity, endowed with a voluntary motive power, either to pierce infinitely into boundless etherial space, or into solid bodies; to see and know, how the parts of the great Universe are connected with each other, and by what amazing mechanism they are put and kept in regular, and perpetual motion. But, oh vain and daring presumption of thought! I most humbly submit my future exigence to the supreme will of the one omnipotent!</p></blockquote>\n<p>Dwelling as I do in the lives and letters of long-gone visionaries, I have marveled again and again at how even the farthest seers are simply unable to bend their gaze beyond their era’s horizons of dogma and possibility. And yet the horizons shift with each incremental revolution as the human animal peers outward to take in nature, then turns inward to question its own givens. The most substantive leap our species has made in the epochs since Edwards is not any particular scientific discovery or invention, but our general unblinding to the nature of reality and the reality of nature, to reality as staggering enough in its own right and haloed enough with the holiness of its shimmering complexity not to necessitate the invention of gods, superstitions, and other nursery rhymes for the mind in order for life &#8212; this life, this improbable and only and absolutely glorious life we have &#8212; to feel like enough, to feel like the living miracle that it is.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_71999\"  class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://society6.com/product/scarlet-sparrow-and-yellow-swallow-tailed-butterfly-by-george-edwards-1761_print?curator=brainpicker\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GeorgeEdwards_scarletsparrow.jpg?resize=680%2C900&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"900\" class=\"size-full wp-image-71999\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GeorgeEdwards_scarletsparrow.jpg?w=1200&#38;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GeorgeEdwards_scarletsparrow.jpg?resize=240%2C318&#38;ssl=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GeorgeEdwards_scarletsparrow.jpg?resize=320%2C424&#38;ssl=1 320w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GeorgeEdwards_scarletsparrow.jpg?resize=768%2C1017&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GeorgeEdwards_scarletsparrow.jpg?resize=600%2C795&#38;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Scarlet Sparrow and Yellow Swallow-tailed Butterfly.
