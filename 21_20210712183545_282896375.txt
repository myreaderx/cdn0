However, <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/stranger-things-2-bob/\">unlike poor Bob</a> (<strong>Sean Astin</strong>), Hopper survived his apparent onscreen death, appearing in a post-credit sequence that teased his continued existence. While stars <strong>Finn Wolfhard </strong>and <strong>Joe Keery</strong> have <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/stranger-things-season-4-update/\">already hinted that season 4 will be the &#8220;darkest season yet&#8221;</a>, now we have some confirmation from Big Daddy Hopper himself.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-682780\"></span></p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-682797 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/elevencellar-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/elevencellar.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/elevencellar-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>Boxes in the Attic</h2>\n<p>In a recent interview with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04Rr0u0fj_E\">Entertainment Weekly</a>, <strong>David Harbour</strong>, who portrays Sheriff Hopper on the Netflix hit, said that this season will finally dig into his many secrets.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s some fun stuff that we&#8217;re doing this season, but it&#8217;s also the heaviest dramatic stuff I&#8217;ve ever had to do,&#8221; Harbour said.</p>\n<p>Season 3 Hooper had a lot on his plate. He was trying to handle his adopted teenage daughter&#8217;s first romance while still being a good dad, figure out what the Russians were doing beneath the mall, and also deal with the forces of evil coming into the town of Hawkins from the Upside Down. He survived all of that, and getting blown up, just to get taken captive by the Russians.</p>\n<p>&#8220;[He was] this guy who&#8217;s struggling with his teenage daughter and sort of trapped in this world of his own darkness, [&#8230;] he&#8217;s going to re-emerge as a different human being,&#8221; Harbour said. &#8220;In that way, he has this vulnerability to him, and also this brutality that he needs to survive Russia. We get to see this whole other side of him and it&#8217;s some of my favorite stuff.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Part of getting to see that other side of him is a reveal that has been building since season 1, Harbour hinted.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;We get to see a lot of Hopper at his most vulnerable, we&#8217;re gonna reveal a lot of backstory points that we&#8217;ve only hinted at in boxes in his attic. We&#8217;re gonna see a lot of these different threads, and also, we get to see a rebirth of him.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>The &#8220;boxes in the attic&#8221; Harbour refers to are from the season 2 episode &#8220;Will the Wise.&#8221; While cleaning out their shared cabin, his adoptive daughter Eleven (<strong>Millie Bobby Brown</strong>) discovers mysterious boxes labeled &#8220;Dad,&#8221; &#8220;New York,&#8221; &#8220;Vietnam,&#8221; and &#8220;Hawkins Lab&#8221; in a hidden cellar. (Attic, cellar, same difference right?) Eleven grabbed the Hawkins Lab box and gave us all a peek inside, but the contents of the other three boxes are still a mystery.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-448542 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Stranger-Things-Hopper-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Stranger Things 2 detail\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Stranger-Things-Hopper.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Stranger-Things-Hopper-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>A Long-Held Secret</h2>\n<p>In addition to whatever secrets are hinted at in those boxes, we&#8217;ll apparently also be getting a major reveal about Hopper&#8217;s history. Harbour and series creators <strong>the Duffer Brothers</strong> apparently have known since the very first season released in 2016, and he&#8217;s thrilled to get a chance to share it.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;There&#8217;s one thing in it that plays very big in this season that I&#8217;ve known since the first frame of the first season. Me and the Duffers would sit around and speculate, &#8216;Oh, wouldn&#8217;t this be cool?&#8217; the minute we started shooting. We never thought we&#8217;d even get a second season, and then we get to do it in this season. It&#8217;s so satisfying to have had an idea five years prior, and to go like, &#8216;Oh, this is a season when we&#8217;re gonna let out this secret that we were using just as a subtle thing to inform something.&#8217; We&#8217;re gonna lay it out finally, and it&#8217;s really cool.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>To find out Hopper&#8217;s big secret, you&#8217;ll have to watch season 4 of <em>Stranger Things. </em>Netflix has not announced a release date yet, but you can always watch seasons 1-3 again to try and figure out exactly what he&#8217;s going on about.

The movie is set to premiere at the Cannes Film Festival, and we now have a mysterious, intriguing trailer that&#8217;s bound to make this shoot up to the top of your &#8220;must-see&#8221; list (if it wasn&#8217;t already there to begin with). <em>Memoria</em> follows a woman (<strong>Tilda Swinton</strong>) who &#8220;begins experiencing a mysterious sensory syndrome.&#8221;</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-682790\"></span></p>\n<h2><strong>Memoria Trailer </strong></h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PDU6B93ltds?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>God damn, now <em>this</em> is how you cut a trailer. &#8220;It&#8217;s like&#8230;a rumble, from the core of the Earth,&#8221; Tilda Swinton says as this trailer begins. &#8220;And then it shrinks.&#8221; What&#8217;s she talking about? The trailer doesn&#8217;t give you any real answers, and that&#8217;s what makes it so effective. So many movie trailers these days give the entire movie away, and that can be frustrating. So when a trailer like this comes along – a trailer that has absolutely no answers and only gets more and more mystifying as it unfolds – I get excited.</p>\n<p>The official synopsis describes <em>Memoria</em> as &#8220;a bewildering drama about a Scottish woman, who, after hearing a loud ‘bang’ at daybreak, begins experiencing a mysterious sensory syndrome while traversing the jungles of Colombia.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In addition to Swinton, the cast includes <strong>Jeanne Balibar</strong>, <strong>Daniel Giménez Cacho</strong>, <strong>Juan Pablo Urrego</strong>, and <strong>Elkin Diaz</strong>. <em>Memoria</em> will have its world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival on <strong>July 15</strong>, and we&#8217;ll hopefully learn when the rest of us can see it soon after.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/memoria-poster.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-682816\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/memoria-poster-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/memoria-poster-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/memoria-poster-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/memoria-poster-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/memoria-poster.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<h2><strong>Expressions and Memories</strong></h2>\n<p>While all of this is very vague and mysterious, Apichatpong Weerasethakul&#8217;s director&#8217;s statement may shed some light on what&#8217;s going on here. Then again, it might not.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As a kid I was drawn to jungles, animals, and mountains,&#8221; the filmmaker said. &#8220;During the 70s, I grew up reading novels about hunters looking for treasures from lost civilizations. However, Thailand does not possess ancient empires full of gold, nor headhunter tribes, nor anacondas. Forty years later, I am still drawn to such landscapes but they are covered now with layers of other stories. I am attracted to the history of Latin America as if it was a missing part of my youth. I have come to Colombia to collect expressions and memories, not the Amazonian gold. I am deeply in debt to the individuals I have met in various cities, from psychologists, archaeologists, engineers, activists, to junk collectors.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The director then added:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Another important factor in the birth of this project is my own hallucination. While researching, I often heard a loud noise at dawn. It was internal and has occurred in many of the places I visited. This symptom is inseparable from my exposure to Colombia. It has formed the basis of a character whose audio experience synchronizes with the country’s memory. I imagine the mountains here as an expression of people’s remembrances through centuries. The massive sierras, with their creases and creeks, are like the folds of the brain, or the curves of sound waves. With the scores of acts of violence and trauma, the terrain inflates and trembles, to become a country with never-ending landslides and earthquakes. The film itself is also seeking for a balance in this active topography. Its skeletons, the images and sounds, are shaken out of place. Perhaps this is a &#8216;sweet spot&#8217; where I and this film can synchronize, a state where delusion is the norm.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/memoria-trailer/\">&#8216;Memoria&#8217; Trailer: Tilda Swinton Experiences a Mysterious Sensory Syndrome in the New Film From Apichatpong Weerasethakul</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=lnb180JwNN4:i7ly-4fYoBU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=lnb180JwNN4:i7ly-4fYoBU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=lnb180JwNN4:i7ly-4fYoBU:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=lnb180JwNN4:i7ly-4fYoBU:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=lnb180JwNN4:i7ly-4fYoBU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=lnb180JwNN4:i7ly-4fYoBU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/lnb180JwNN4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 12 Jul 2021 16:25:36 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Memoria-Trailer-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"56c270a11379d41580dc0e034c7c7847","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn3@2020_4/2021/07/12/18-35-25-435_202e10589d21a131.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":34507,"destBytes":21280,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Memoria-Trailer-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn3@2020_4/2021/07/12/18-35-25-435_202e10589d21a131.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/memoria-poster-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn18@2020_4/2021/07/12/18-35-38-809_b5f1370576192aa6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn75@2020_4/2021/07/12/18-35-39-281_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=lnb180JwNN4:i7ly-4fYoBU:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn89@2020_1/2021/07/12/18-35-38-802_e39afe54eb7f0f50.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn20@2020_1/2021/07/12/18-35-39-646_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=lnb180JwNN4:i7ly-4fYoBU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn75@2020_6/2021/07/12/18-35-38-807_23e27a6a92cc114f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/lnb180JwNN4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn92@2020_6/2021/07/12/18-35-38-818_5d86ece173cea1f5.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626114916157},{"createdTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:16","updatedTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:16","title":"‘Loki’ Episode 5 Featured a Secret Chris Hemsworth Cameo","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=682443","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-682768 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/thorragnarok-chrishemsworth-snakestory-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Thor Ragnarok - Chris Hemsworth\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/thorragnarok-chrishemsworth-snakestory.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/thorragnarok-chrishemsworth-snakestory-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Last week&#8217;s fifth episode of Marvel&#8217;s <strong><em>Loki</em></strong> series on Disney+ <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/loki-episode-5-easter-eggs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">featured a ton of Easter eggs</a>, comic references, and callbacks to both Marvel Comics and the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

More than likely Hemsworth was brought in to record lines back when the plan was for Frog Thor to have a bigger appearance in the show&#8217;s first episode.</p>\n<p>As we recently learned, Frog Thor was <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/loki-frog-thor-deleted-scene-details/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">originally intended to debut</a> in the Marvel Cinematic Universe during the Time Theater sequence from the show&#8217;s premiere. One of the clips played for Loki during his interrogation by Mobius would have seen Frog Thor beating up the God of Mischief as one of his more humiliating moments. That&#8217;s likely why Chris Hemsworth was brought in to record dialogue for the character, because having the actor brought in only to scream one time doesn&#8217;t seem like it&#8217;s worth the trouble.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re hoping that we&#8217;ll get to see that deleted scene sometime down the road. At the very least, maybe there will be footage of Chris Hemsworth recording this dialogue in the <em>Loki</em> edition of the making-of documentary series <em>Assembled</em>, which will likely be arriving next week after the show&#8217;s finale airs this Wednesday.</p>\n<p>Catch up with the first five episodes of <em>Loki</em> over on Disney+ right now.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/secret-chris-hemsworth-cameo-in-loki/\">&#8216;Loki&#8217; Episode 5 Featured a Secret Chris Hemsworth Cameo</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=uNYGWipnczo:1K2o9_VhGLM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=uNYGWipnczo:1K2o9_VhGLM:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=uNYGWipnczo:1K2o9_VhGLM:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=uNYGWipnczo:1K2o9_VhGLM:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=uNYGWipnczo:1K2o9_VhGLM:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=uNYGWipnczo:1K2o9_VhGLM:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/uNYGWipnczo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 12 Jul 2021 15:24:26 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/thorragnarok-chrishemsworth-snakestory-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"5dba87b9ed27f1fd625360a77ccf3536","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn59@2020_1/2021/07/12/18-35-32-447_2cc93c2a3a734e80.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":21414,"destBytes":12252,"author":"Ethan Anderton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/thorragnarok-chrishemsworth-snakestory-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn59@2020_1/2021/07/12/18-35-32-447_2cc93c2a3a734e80.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/loki-frogthor-jar-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn71@2020_6/2021/07/12/18-35-39-281_dfa147e85ae75b17.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn75@2020_4/2021/07/12/18-35-39-281_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=uNYGWipnczo:1K2o9_VhGLM:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn34@2020_1/2021/07/12/18-35-39-372_d14a713a0fc48168.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn20@2020_1/2021/07/12/18-35-39-646_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=uNYGWipnczo:1K2o9_VhGLM:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn91@2020_6/2021/07/12/18-35-39-331_4b99b32823f6e4f7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/uNYGWipnczo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn62@2020_2/2021/07/12/18-35-39-438_78f96a57fd32d7b7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626114916156},{"createdTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:16","updatedTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:16","title":"The Daily Stream: ‘Mona Lisa’ Features Another Killer Performance From Bob Hoskins","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=682212","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-682329 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Mona-Lisa-Bob-Hoskins-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Mona-Lisa-Bob-Hoskins.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Mona-Lisa-Bob-Hoskins-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><i data-stringify-type=\"italic\">(Welcome to </i><a href=\"https://slashfilm.com/tag/the-daily-stream\"><b data-stringify-type=\"bold\"><i data-stringify-type=\"italic\">T</i></b><b data-stringify-type=\"bold\"><i data-stringify-type=\"italic\">he Daily Stream</i></b></a><i data-stringify-type=\"italic\">, an ongoing series in which the /Film team shares what they&#8217;ve been watching, why it&#8217;s worth checking out, and where you can stream it.)</i></p>\n<p><strong>The Movie</strong>: <em>Mona Lisa<br />\n</em></p>\n<p><strong>Where You Can Stream It</strong>: HBO Max and The Criterion Channel</p>\n<p><strong>The Pitch: </strong>Bob Hoskins plays George, an uncouth ex-con who is given a job as a driver for a high-priced sex worker named Simone (Cathy Tyson). Though the two initially bicker as their personality styles clash, George finds himself slowly falling for Simone and pulled into London&#8217;s seedy underground on a quest to find one of her old friends who has gone missing.<strong><br />\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Why It&#8217;s Essential Viewing</strong>: Two words: Bob Hoskins. I grew up watching Hoskins as the bumbling pirate sidekick Smee in <em>Hook</em>, as Mario in <em>Super Mario Bros.</em>, and as the hardboiled detective Eddie Valiant in <em>Who Framed Roger Rabbit</em>. Throughout my childhood, those were the only three films I&#8217;d seen him in, and I was totally unaware that he had this whole other side to his career appearing in British crime movies. But now I&#8217;m making my way back through some of his filmography; he was terrific in <em>The Long Good Friday</em>, and I&#8217;m glad to have seen him in <em>Mona Lisa</em>, in which he earned an Academy Award nomination for his outstanding performance.<span id=\"more-682212\"></span></p>\n<p>Neil Jordan (<em>The Crying Game</em>, <em>Interview with a Vampire</em>) co-wrote and directed this neo-noir, which features some nice, contemplative, soulful moments from Hoskins and Tyson as they glide through the dirty, sleazy corners of the city and try to look respectable as Simone enters and exits fancy hotels to meet her clients. The camera is almost always at ground level, helping to ground us in George&#8217;s perspective as he tries to get to know his estranged daughter, gets embroiled in dangerous drama with his old boss (Michael Caine), and slowly falls harder and harder for Simone.</p>\n<p>It is a neo-noir, though, so it&#8217;s not all fun and games: people&#8217;s motivations and true feelings are eventually exposed, and the way Hoskins acts and reacts to these plot twists makes me wish I&#8217;d sought out his work in the gangster genre years ago.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-682316 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Plastic-Spaghetti-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Plastic-Spaghetti.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Plastic-Spaghetti-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>One of my favorite things about the movie is George&#8217;s friendship with his best pal Thomas, played by Robbie Coltrane. The two of them bring a sense of warm history to their relationship, but the best part is that the film devotes time to showing us Thomas&#8217;s off-the-wall job, which seems to be making bizarre pieces of art. At one point, the camera pans across Thomas&#8217;s warehouse apartment/work studio to reveal that he has made multiple plates of fake spaghetti. After being told that the spaghetti is &#8220;ornamental,&#8221; George asks Thomas where he got it. &#8220;Contacts, George,&#8221; Thomas replies. &#8220;Can&#8217;t find plastic spaghetti just anywhere.&#8221; That level of weird specificity is sorely lacking from many films that are made today, and I encourage filmmakers (and studios and people in power) to do more stuff like this that doesn&#8217;t contribute to pushing the plot forward.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-daily-stream-mona-lisa/\">The Daily Stream: &#8216;Mona Lisa&#8217; Features Another Killer Performance From Bob Hoskins</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=cx1MKZNLvzE:rv-jhr20gk4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=cx1MKZNLvzE:rv-jhr20gk4:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=cx1MKZNLvzE:rv-jhr20gk4:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=cx1MKZNLvzE:rv-jhr20gk4:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=cx1MKZNLvzE:rv-jhr20gk4:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=cx1MKZNLvzE:rv-jhr20gk4:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/cx1MKZNLvzE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 12 Jul 2021 15:00:46 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Mona-Lisa-Bob-Hoskins-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"33c405b538b315af63b7193e598bab81","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn21@2020_2/2021/07/12/18-35-26-408_c2c4f4b3352f48f9.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":31858,"destBytes":16924,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Mona-Lisa-Bob-Hoskins-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn21@2020_2/2021/07/12/18-35-26-408_c2c4f4b3352f48f9.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Plastic-Spaghetti-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn21@2020_6/2021/07/12/18-35-38-842_2c65da390a26611e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn75@2020_4/2021/07/12/18-35-39-281_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=cx1MKZNLvzE:rv-jhr20gk4:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn6@2020_6/2021/07/12/18-35-39-390_36435b9e2aeebed6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn20@2020_1/2021/07/12/18-35-39-646_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=cx1MKZNLvzE:rv-jhr20gk4:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn94@2020_1/2021/07/12/18-35-38-809_46f15bcc9e97bb3d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/cx1MKZNLvzE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn37@2020_3/2021/07/12/18-35-39-416_5e62106a3797b74f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626114916164},{"createdTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:16","updatedTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:16","title":"‘Black Widow’ Smashes Pandemic Box Office Records With the Biggest Opening Since ‘Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker’","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=682421","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-679128 size-medium\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/BBU-32704_R3-e1624823397940-700x299.jpg\" alt=\"black widow box office\" width=\"700\" height=\"299\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/BBU-32704_R3-e1624823397940-700x300.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/BBU-32704_R3-e1624823397940-360x154.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/BBU-32704_R3-e1624823397940-768x328.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/BBU-32704_R3-e1624823397940.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Consider <em><strong>Black Widow</strong></em> a win for the pandemic box office, movie theaters, and (possibly) some sort of studio transparency in the Wild West of this new streaming age. After countless delays and shifting release dates, the latest installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe finally swung into theaters this weekend and fully stuck the landing in that trademark Natasha Romanoff superhero pose.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-682421\"></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://variety.com/2021/film/box-office/marvel-black-widow-box-office-opening-weekend-1235016977/\">Variety</a> has the numbers to prove that nothing, not even a pandemic, is a match for the MCU. Director <strong>Cate Shortland&#8217;s</strong> <em>Black Widow</em>, starring <strong>Scarlett Johansson</strong> and <strong>Florence Pugh</strong>, hauled in $80 million this weekend, <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/f9-box-office-opening-weekend/\">supplanting last week&#8217;s <em><strong>F9</strong></em> performance</a> and vaulting Marvel&#8217;s action flick to the top of the charts in the second consecutive weekend featuring a movie setting a new pandemic record. It&#8217;s the largest domestic opening since Disney/Lucasfilm&#8217;s<em> Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</em> <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker-box-office-cats/\">opened in December 2019</a>.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re curious about a comparison to the Before Times, <em><strong>Spider-Man: Far From Home</strong></em> was the MCU&#8217;s previous theatrical release in 2019 and opened to a staggering $185 million debut. And also for comparison&#8217;s sake, <em><strong>Captain Marvel</strong></em> dropped that same year as well to the opening weekend tune of $153 million.</p>\n<p>Obviously, the pandemic has completely upended our expectations and standards for releases these days, so <em>Black Widow&#8217;s</em> $80 million domestic and $158 worldwide are hardly anything to dismiss.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-608842 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/disney-plus-india-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"disney plus india\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/disney-plus-india-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/disney-plus-india-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/disney-plus-india-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/disney-plus-india.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>The Disney+ Wrinkle</h2>\n<p>Of course, the pandemic has also forced studios to adapt with the times. At the behest of AT&#38;T, Warner Bros. (in)famously shook up the industry by announcing its plan to release its catalogue of films both in theaters and on streaming service HBO Max simultaneously. In a similarly unexpected change from the standard operating procedure thus far, Disney has finally released numbers for <em>Black Widow&#8217;s</em> Premier Access charge on Disney+ and combined them with the total weekend tally to paint a slightly more optimistic picture. In a notable deviation from box office numbers (which studios split with theaters), Disney gets to keep 100% of its Disney+ profits.</p>\n<p>Touting these numbers as &#8220;consumer spend globally&#8221;, a hilariously corporate term that just rolls off the tongue, <em>Black Widow</em> apparently gained an additional $60 million through Disney+ rentals which are currently set at $30 a pop. Many in the industry consider <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2021/07/11/black-widow-box-office-scarlett-johansson-florence-pugh-marvel-disney-plus/?utm_source=pocket_mylist&#38;sh=5760c4702d6c\">this number-pushing as gamesmanship</a>, allowing Disney to claim a larger piece of the box office pie for PR purposes while the rest of us are left to take the studio at their word. It&#8217;s worth noting that <em>Black Widow</em> likely would&#8217;ve made more without making Premier Access an option, which allows families of three or more to save considerable money that otherwise would&#8217;ve gone to ticket sales (and concessions, which tend to be the livelihood for theaters). It remains to be seen how Disney adjusts for their next theatrical release, <em><strong>Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings</strong></em>, and whether Premier Access will continue to be a part of their plan.</p>\n<p>As for the rest of the box office, <em>F9</em> came in at second place with a total of $10.8 million, a precipitous drop from its opening weekend numbers but good enough for a worldwide total of $541.8 million. Universal also claims the third and fourth-place spots with <em><strong>Boss Baby: Family Business</strong></em>, at $8.7 million, and <em><strong>The Forever Purge</strong></em> with an addition $6.7 million. <em><strong>A Quiet Place Part II</strong></em>, meanwhile, rounds out the top 5 with another $3 million.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/black-widow-box-office-pandemic-record/\">&#8216;Black Widow&#8217; Smashes Pandemic Box Office Records With the Biggest Opening Since &#8216;Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker&#8217;</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=iHBl-f1f_W8:Den958Ex-Rc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=iHBl-f1f_W8:Den958Ex-Rc:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=iHBl-f1f_W8:Den958Ex-Rc:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=iHBl-f1f_W8:Den958Ex-Rc:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=iHBl-f1f_W8:Den958Ex-Rc:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=iHBl-f1f_W8:Den958Ex-Rc:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/iHBl-f1f_W8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 12 Jul 2021 14:18:37 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/BBU-32704_R3-e1624823397940-700x299.jpg","linkMd5":"6be37d40a33eb99de186440cbcd754a4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn37@2020_1/2021/07/12/18-35-17-465_c028c31557924430.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":299,"sourceBytes":34108,"destBytes":21704,"author":"Jeremy Mathai","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/BBU-32704_R3-e1624823397940-700x299.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn37@2020_1/2021/07/12/18-35-17-465_c028c31557924430.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/disney-plus-india-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn3@2020_6/2021/07/12/18-35-39-680_56ee9d100d9ba4c6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn75@2020_4/2021/07/12/18-35-39-281_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=iHBl-f1f_W8:Den958Ex-Rc:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn18@2020_4/2021/07/12/18-35-39-374_0290f400cad6dba1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn20@2020_1/2021/07/12/18-35-39-646_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=iHBl-f1f_W8:Den958Ex-Rc:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/iHBl-f1f_W8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn46@2020_3/2021/07/12/18-35-39-396_5e4c7da9b9775159.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626114916154},{"createdTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:16","updatedTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:16","title":"Watch an Exclusive ‘Almost Famous’ Deleted Scene From the New 4K Blu-ray","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=682179","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/almost-famous-deleted-scene.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-682194\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/almost-famous-deleted-scene-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"almost famous deleted scene\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/almost-famous-deleted-scene-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/almost-famous-deleted-scene-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/almost-famous-deleted-scene-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/almost-famous-deleted-scene.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Cameron Crowe</strong>&#8216;s beloved <strong><em>Almost Famous</em> </strong>is headed to 4K Ultra HD and in a New Limited-Edition Blu-ray this month, featuring both the theatrical cut and &#8220;bootleg&#8221; director&#8217;s cut.

I think it&#8217;s safe to say this is Cameron Crowe&#8217;s most-loved movie (although I personally prefer <em>Vanilla Sky</em>), and the flick is coming to 4K on <strong>July 13, 2021</strong>. That coincides with the release of a limited-edition Uber Box set.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are extremely proud to revisit <em>Almost Famous </em>with a very special bounty of goodness,&#8221; said Cameron Crowe. &#8220;For the first time, we’ve created a Deluxe Soundtrack that features nearly every song from the film, along with Nancy Wilson&#8217;s wonderfully evocative score. We&#8217;re also thrilled to finally preserve both versions of the film, along with a collection of rare new bonus features, on these beautiful new 4K and Blu-ray releases as part of Paramount Presents. Long live physical media!&#8221;</p>\n<p>The 4K release has been remastered in 4K Ultra HD with Dolby Vision and HDR-10 for ultra-vivid picture quality. The limited-edition 4K Ultra HD Steelbook includes both the original theatrical cut (plus access to a digital copy) and the Bootleg cut, along with new bonus content &#8220;offering a backstage pass into the creative process through a new interview with Crowe, extended scenes, rock-school sessions, a look at the casting and costumes, and more.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>Almost Famous</em> is the &#8220;semi-autobiographical odyssey of 15-year-old William Miller (<strong>Patrick Fugit</strong>), whose writing talent and earnest passion for rock music earns him an assignment for Rolling Stone, interviewing and touring with Stillwater (<strong>Billy Crudup</strong>, <strong>Jason Lee</strong>). Penny Lane (<strong>Kate Hudson</strong>) is the young groupie who guides him through the wild world of rock heroes, all-night parties, and the most dangerous experience of all—love.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/almost-famous-musical.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-552042\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/almost-famous-musical-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"almost famous musical premiere\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/almost-famous-musical-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/almost-famous-musical-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/almost-famous-musical-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/almost-famous-musical.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<h2><strong>4K Special Features</strong></h2>\n<p>Here&#8217;s all the neat stuff that comes with the new release, with some special features ported over from previous editions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Filmmaker Focus—Cameron Crowe on </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Almost Famous</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><b><i>NEW! </i></b></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Casting &#38; Costumes—</span><b><i>NEW!</i></b></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rock School—</span><b><i>NEW!</i></b></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Extended Scenes—</span><b><i>NEW!</i></b></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Odds &#38; Sods—</span><b><i>NEW!</i></b></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Audio Commentary with Cameron Crowe and Friends (Bootleg cut)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Intro by Cameron Crowe</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Making of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Almost Famous</span></i></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interview with Lester Bangs (optional audio intro by Cameron Crowe)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cameron Crowe’s Top Albums of 1973</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Fever Dog” music video </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Loves Comes and Goes” (optional audio intro by Cameron Crowe)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rolling Stone Articles (optional audio intro by Cameron Crowe)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">B-Sides (optional audio intro by Cameron Crowe)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cleveland Concert (optional audio intro by Cameron Crowe)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Small Time Blues”</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stairway (optional audio intro by Cameron Crowe)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Script</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Theatrical Trailer</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hidden Talent (Unhidden Easter Eggs)</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/almostfamous-bluray-cover.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-441365\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/almostfamous-bluray-cover-700x311.jpg\" alt=\"Almost Famous Alternate Titles\" width=\"700\" height=\"311\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/almostfamous-bluray-cover-700x311.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/almostfamous-bluray-cover-360x160.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/almostfamous-bluray-cover.jpg 1420w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<h2><strong>Uber Box Set</strong></h2>\n<p>In addition to the 4K, there&#8217;s also a big box set that compiles the various versions of the film&#8217;s soundtracks.

Along with the thirteen-disc Uber Deluxe box, Universal is issuing two six-LP editions—one on black vinyl, the other with colored vinyl discs; a five-CD Super Deluxe set including 102 tracks, 36 of them previously unreleased songs; a separate 12-inch vinyl EP with all 6 of Stillwater’s songs; a Record Store Day exclusive with the 7 original demos of the Stillwater songs, five performed by Wilson the other two by Frampton; a two-LP vinyl version of the original soundtrack album;

It was originally due out last December, but the pandemic got in the way. Appropriately enough, delaying the release by one year will have this <em>West Side Story</em> arriving to coincide with the 60th anniversary of the release of the original 1961 film. As of now, <em>West Side Story</em> will be exclusive to theaters.</p>\n<h2><strong>What is West Side Story</strong><strong>?</strong></h2>\n<p><em>West Side Story</em> is an adaptation of the 1957 Broadway musical with a book by Arthur Laurents, music by Leonard Bernstein, and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim, loosely inspired by <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>. The musical was previously adapted to film in 1961. That adaptation remains widely acclaimed, and was nominated for 11 Academy Awards and won 10, including Best Picture – which means it&#8217;s a tough act for Steven Spielberg to follow. But since he&#8217;s one of our best living directors, he&#8217;ll probably be fine. One key difference between this adaptation and the 1961 film is that Spielberg pushed to make sure performers with Hispanic backgrounds played Hispanic characters, and, per <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2020/03/a-first-look-at-steven-spielbergs-west-side-story\">Vanity Fair</a>, the filmmaker &#8220;estimates that 20 of the 33 Puerto Rican characters are specifically Puerto Rican or of Puerto Rican descent.&#8221;</p>\n<p>“They brought themselves, and everything they believe and everything about them—they brought that to the work,&#8221; Spielberg said. &#8220;And there was so much interaction between the cast wanting to be able to commit to the Puerto Rican experience. They all represent, I think, a diversity, both within the Puerto Rican, Nuyorican community as well as the broader Latinx community. And they took that seriously.&#8221;</p>\n<h2><strong>West Side Story Synopsis</strong></h2>\n<p><em>West Side Story</em> &#8220;tells the classic tale of fierce rivalries and young love in 1957 New York City.&#8221; The young lovers are Tony and Maria, who fall for each other despite having connections to feuding street gangs The Jets and The Sharks. Maria <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2020/03/a-first-look-at-steven-spielbergs-west-side-story\">is</a> &#8220;part of the wave of Puerto Rican migrants who traded one island for another when they came to New York seeking a new life in the post–World War II economic boom. Her streetwise Casanova is Tony&#8230;who once led a gang of local toughs known as the Jets, but has since outgrown them. Tony’s old friends are engaged in an escalating battle for control of the neighborhood against Puerto Rican rivals who call themselves the Sharks, led by Maria’s brother Bernardo.&#8221;</p>\n<h2><strong>West Side Story Director, Crew, and More</strong></h2>\n<p><em>West Side Story</em> is directed by a young up-and-comer named <strong>Steven Spielberg</strong>. That kid&#8217;s going places, let me tell you. <strong>Tony Kushner</strong>, who has worked with Spielberg on <em>Munich</em> and <em>Lincoln</em>, wrote the script. Kushner is also an executive producer. <strong>Justin Peck </strong>choreographed the musical numbers in the film while Los Angeles Philharmonic conductor <strong>Gustavo Dudamel</strong> handled the recording of the score, which was arranged by composer and conductor <strong>David Newman</strong>. <strong>Jeanine Tesori</strong> supervised the cast on vocals while <strong>Matt Sullivan</strong> served as executive music producer for the film. Spielberg produces along with <strong>Kristie Macosko Krieger</strong> and<strong> Kevin McCollum</strong>.</p>\n<h2><strong>West Side Story Cast</strong></h2>\n<p><em>West Side Story</em> stars <strong>Ansel Elgort</strong>* as Tony; <strong>Rachel Zegler</strong> as Maria; <strong>Ariana DeBose</strong> as Anita; <strong>David Alvarez</strong> as Bernardo;<strong> Mike Faist</strong> as Riff; <strong>Josh Andrés Rivera</strong> as Chino; <strong>Ana Isabelle</strong> as Rosalía; <strong>Corey Stoll</strong> as Lieutenant Schrank; <strong>Brian d&#8217;Arcy Jame</strong>s as Officer Krupke; and <strong>Rita Moreno</strong>, who won an Oscar for playing Anita in the 1961 movie, as Valentina, who owns the corner store in which Tony works.</p>\n<p>*It&#8217;s worth noting that in 2020, a woman accused Elgort of sexual misconduct in 2014 when she was 17 and he was 20. Elgort <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/ansel-elgort-says-relationship-accuser-was-consensual-not-assault-1512368\">denied</a> the allegation and said the relationship was brief and consensual. Since then there&#8217;s been next to no coverage of the story, but that might change the closer the film gets to release.</p>\n<h2><strong>West Side Story Trailer</strong></h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CbUM27qw6a8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/west-side-story-release-date/\">West Side Story: Release Date, Cast and More</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=3WIEgMH42GM:nA-F1_7RjAU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=3WIEgMH42GM:nA-F1_7RjAU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=3WIEgMH42GM:nA-F1_7RjAU:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=3WIEgMH42GM:nA-F1_7RjAU:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=3WIEgMH42GM:nA-F1_7RjAU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=3WIEgMH42GM:nA-F1_7RjAU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/3WIEgMH42GM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 12 Jul 2021 18:02:01 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/west-side-story-release-date-and-more-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"5bf154dc86f1a10538926f5787408b12","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn19@2020_4/2021/07/12/18-35-16-433_d46b68146da89bf3.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":67972,"destBytes":52858,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/west-side-story-release-date-and-more-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn19@2020_4/2021/07/12/18-35-16-433_d46b68146da89bf3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn75@2020_4/2021/07/12/18-35-39-281_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=3WIEgMH42GM:nA-F1_7RjAU:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn42@2020_5/2021/07/12/18-35-39-425_5f28063d2f01259d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn20@2020_1/2021/07/12/18-35-39-646_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=3WIEgMH42GM:nA-F1_7RjAU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn14@2020_4/2021/07/12/18-35-39-379_bc11b8369e15de6a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/3WIEgMH42GM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn86@2020_1/2021/07/12/18-35-38-705_8eb14adcabe99d06.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626114916157},{"createdTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:16","updatedTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:16","title":"‘Escape Room: Tournament of Champions’ Clip: Escape Rooms Are Making A Deadly Comeback – Again","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=682796","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-679952 size-medium\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Escape-Room-Tournament-of-Champions-Release-Date-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"Escape Room Tournament of Champions clip\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Escape-Room-Tournament-of-Champions-Release-Date-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Escape-Room-Tournament-of-Champions-Release-Date-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Escape-Room-Tournament-of-Champions-Release-Date-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Escape-Room-Tournament-of-Champions-Release-Date.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Escape rooms are making a comeback— and they&#8217;re even more life-threatening than you remember!</p>\n<p>A sequel to 2019’s <em><strong>Escape Room</strong></em> is coming to theaters later this month, once again gathering a group of strangers and forcing them to work their way through a series of deadly puzzles. The first movie was especially lethal, leaving only two survivors in its wake, but <em><strong>Escape Room: Tournament of Champions</strong></em> is going for the gold. Based on the latest clip, the rooms have become even more dangerous and complex.</p>\n<p>Check out the newest clip from <em>Escape Room: Tournament of Champions </em>below.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-682796\"></span></p>\n<h2>Escape Room Tournament of Champions Clip</h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UFpNXcsMK1E?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>You might have noticed that <em>Escape Room: Tournament of Champions</em> features a couple of familiar faces. Returners Zoey Davis (<strong>Taylor Russell</strong>) and Ben Miller (<strong>Logan Mille</strong>r) managed to survive each of the puzzles from <em>Escape Room</em> and have the misfortunate of being caught up once again. Luckily, they aren&#8217;t alone, and their newest companions are already familiar with the deadly puzzle rooms. The villainous corporation Minos Escape Rooms has found a way to gather its survivors in an intense tournament of past champions.</p>\n<p>As we see in the clip, these puzzles promise to be much more difficult than the first. This time around, they weren&#8217;t designed for amateurs but for the very best of the deadly escape room niche. But even if all of these people have survived Minos once before, who&#8217;s to say if they can do it again?</p>\n<p>At the very least, they’re much better suited than the last movies group: they begin the bank room by springing into action, pairing off, and searching for clues. We can expect less of their initial panic since they&#8217;re already so familiar with what&#8217;s at stake. The champions remember these <em><strong>Saw</strong></em>-like circumstances like the back of their hands because they’ve already lived them once before.</p>\n<p>Wasting no time, they each talk through the riddle, connecting the blank bills to the words repeated over the loudspeaker. In a matter of seconds, they realize the bills must be soaked in blood – and just as things start coming together, the Game Master ramps up the stakes. Lasers erupt from all angles of the room and both Zoey and a newcomer fall back into them. But it looks like we won’t be getting answers on who survives until the movie&#8217;s debut in theaters.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-515260\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/escape-room-700x291.jpg\" alt=\"escape room trailer\" width=\"700\" height=\"291\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/escape-room-700x291.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/escape-room-360x150.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/escape-room-768x319.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/escape-room.jpg 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>A Promising Follow-Up</h2>\n<p>The first <em>Escape Room</em> was a delightful surprise. It was nothing like we haven&#8217;t seen before, a wild amalgamation of <em>Saw</em>, <em>Final Destination</em>, and the much more PG <em>Maze Runner</em>. <strong>Adam Robitel</strong>&#8216;s <em>Escape Room</em> movies are fun with puzzles that are largely life-threatening and occasionally traumatizing. They promise everything from giant ovens and upside-down billiards to hospital rooms filling with poisonous gas and yes, a bank safe filled with lasers.</p>\n<p>The first <em>Escape Room</em> <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/escape-room-review/\">didn&#8217;t come together perfectly</a>, but it was still plenty of fun all the way through. Perhaps <em>Escape Room: Tournament of Champion</em>s has figured out how to marry 90 minutes of fun intrigue with its overly complicated ending concept. Either way, it looks like we can hope for more of the same, dialed up a few hundred notches.</p>\n<p><em>Escape Room: Tournament of Champions</em> releases in theaters on <strong>July 16, 2021</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/escape-room-tournament-of-champions-clip/\">&#8216;Escape Room: Tournament of Champions&#8217; Clip: Escape Rooms Are Making A Deadly Comeback – Again</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=FwikmOsfCn8:UN35XsFX_E0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=FwikmOsfCn8:UN35XsFX_E0:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=FwikmOsfCn8:UN35XsFX_E0:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=FwikmOsfCn8:UN35XsFX_E0:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=FwikmOsfCn8:UN35XsFX_E0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=FwikmOsfCn8:UN35XsFX_E0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/FwikmOsfCn8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 12 Jul 2021 17:00:27 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Escape-Room-Tournament-of-Champions-Release-Date-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"fe4ba2b5dd8c9dd0766c4050ee202f5d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn63@2020_5/2021/07/12/18-35-16-429_a00eabdb5dd038f2.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":40262,"destBytes":27062,"author":"Shania Russell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Escape-Room-Tournament-of-Champions-Release-Date-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn63@2020_5/2021/07/12/18-35-16-429_a00eabdb5dd038f2.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/escape-room-700x291.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn95@2020_1/2021/07/12/18-35-38-878_b3337fca49fd4d1a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn75@2020_4/2021/07/12/18-35-39-281_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=FwikmOsfCn8:UN35XsFX_E0:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn33@2020_1/2021/07/12/18-35-38-840_41bc37f40fcbb43e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn20@2020_1/2021/07/12/18-35-39-646_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=FwikmOsfCn8:UN35XsFX_E0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/FwikmOsfCn8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn80@2020_1/2021/07/12/18-35-38-816_98e488a1ed99baa9.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626114916155},{"createdTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:16","updatedTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:16","title":"Margot Robbie Doesn’t Know When She’ll Play Harley Quinn Again","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=682431","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/More-Harley-Quinn-Movies.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-682774\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/More-Harley-Quinn-Movies-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"More Harley Quinn Movies\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/More-Harley-Quinn-Movies-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/More-Harley-Quinn-Movies-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/More-Harley-Quinn-Movies-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/More-Harley-Quinn-Movies.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Margot Robbie</strong> reprises the role of Harley Quinn in the upcoming <strong><em>The Suicide Squad</em></strong>, but what happens after that? According to Robbie herself, she doesn&#8217;t know. For now, the actress says she needs a break from Harley. In a recent interview, Robbie revealed that she&#8217;s unsure of when we&#8217;ll see Harley again. On top of that, Robbie had no idea about her character&#8217;s fate mentioned in the needless epilogue from <strong><em>Zack Snyder&#8217;s Justice League</em></strong>.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-682431\"></span></p>\n<p>After playing Harley Quinn three times on the big screen in <em>Suicide Squad</em>, <em>Birds of Prey</em>, and the upcoming <em>The Suicide Squad</em>, Margot Robbie needs a break. Speaking with <a href=\"https://ew.com/movies/margot-robbie-harley-quinn-the-suicide-squad/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Entertainment Weekly</a>, Robbie revealed her plans to take some time off from the DC character. &#8220;It was kind of back-to-back filming <em>Birds&#8230;</em> and filming this, so I was kind of like, oof, I need a break from Harley because she&#8217;s exhausting,&#8221; Robbie told EW. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know when we&#8217;re next going to see her. I&#8217;m just as intrigued as everyone else is.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Originally created by Paul Dini and Bruce Timm for <em>Batman: The Animated Series</em>, Harley Quinn quickly became something of a fan favorite, crossing over from the animated TV series into the DC comics. Robbie wasn&#8217;t the first actress to play the character in live-action – Mia Sara played the character in the short-lived live-action <em>Birds of Prey</em> TV series in 2002. But Robbie was the first to play Harley on the big screen, and the role suits her nicely. That said, fans of the character don&#8217;t have to worry about Harley up and vanishing. While Robbie may be taking a break after <em>The Suicide Squad</em>, Harley will live on in the <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/harley-quinn-review-dc-universes-new-animated-series-is-funny-violent-and-very-r-rated/\">excellent <strong><em>Harley Quinn</em></strong> animated series</a>, where the character is voiced by <strong>Kaley Cuoco</strong>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/justice-league-we-live-in-a-society-scene.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-665268\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/justice-league-we-live-in-a-society-scene-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"justice league we live in a society scene\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/justice-league-we-live-in-a-society-scene-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/justice-league-we-live-in-a-society-scene-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/justice-league-we-live-in-a-society-scene-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/justice-league-we-live-in-a-society-scene.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<h2><strong>We Live In a Society Where Margot Robbie Hasn&#8217;t Seen The Snyder Cut</strong></h2>\n<p><em>Zack Snyder&#8217;s Justice League</em>, AKA The Snyder Cut, ended up <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/zack-snyders-justice-league-review/\">being much better</a> than I would&#8217;ve ever suspected. Don&#8217;t get me wrong – the film has its problems, but I appreciate the overall vision Snyder was going for – up to a point. That point is an utterly baffling epilogue where Batman has a nightmare set in a piss-colored future where Darkseid has taken over Earth and Superman is evil. In this seemingly endless scene, Batman and Joker get into an argument that truly underscores the awfulness of Jared Leto&#8217;s portrayal of the Clown Prince of Crime. And during this moment it&#8217;s revealed that Harley Quinn is dead – in fact, she died in Batman&#8217;s arms.</p>\n<p>But Margot Robbie doesn&#8217;t know anything about that. In the same EW interview, Robbie was made aware of this epilogue and Harley&#8217;s fate, to which she replied: &#8220;Whaaat? I didn&#8217;t know that. Thank you for telling me!&#8221; Robbie went on to add:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;The film version of the DC universe, I actually think they&#8217;re a lot like the comics. You pick up one comic and something&#8217;s happening and then you pick up the next comic and maybe that character&#8217;s not alive, maybe that character&#8217;s not with that person, maybe that character looks completely different. Each movie is its own sort of thing, and I think that works in the comic book world, and I think that works in the DC film world as well. It&#8217;s not like Marvel where everything is more obviously linked in a more linear way. It feels like there&#8217;s so many adjacent stories, worlds, and films happening at the same time, just like there are in the comics. So, yeah, I didn&#8217;t know that, but it doesn&#8217;t necessarily change what other people are able to do with this universe, I don&#8217;t think.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>To be fair, the <em>Justice League</em> epilogue is all a dream, and Snyder&#8217;s continuity isn&#8217;t the continuity that the DCEU is following, so there&#8217;s no real worry about Harley being dead in the movies. But Robbie has certainly earned a break from the character, and it&#8217;ll be interesting to see when (and if) she returns to the role.</p>\n<p><em>The Suicide Squad</em> opens on <strong>August 6, 2021</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/more-harley-quinn-movies/\">Margot Robbie Doesn&#8217;t Know When She&#8217;ll Play Harley Quinn Again</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=v4xpuz5LQsk:kLPIWP6NWt0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=v4xpuz5LQsk:kLPIWP6NWt0:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=v4xpuz5LQsk:kLPIWP6NWt0:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=v4xpuz5LQsk:kLPIWP6NWt0:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=v4xpuz5LQsk:kLPIWP6NWt0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=v4xpuz5LQsk:kLPIWP6NWt0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/v4xpuz5LQsk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 12 Jul 2021 15:09:20 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/More-Harley-Quinn-Movies-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"1bb48dd25af87477ecf3f92725cd38a5","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn56@2020_4/2021/07/12/18-35-37-380_7c9129e2e2772b8a.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":28159,"destBytes":16348,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/More-Harley-Quinn-Movies-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn56@2020_4/2021/07/12/18-35-37-380_7c9129e2e2772b8a.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/justice-league-we-live-in-a-society-scene-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn73@2020_6/2021/07/12/18-35-39-471_20cfd76cb3213123.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn75@2020_4/2021/07/12/18-35-39-281_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=v4xpuz5LQsk:kLPIWP6NWt0:V_sGLiPBpWU":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn20@2020_1/2021/07/12/18-35-39-646_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=v4xpuz5LQsk:kLPIWP6NWt0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn9@2020_4/2021/07/12/18-35-39-539_13a93cfdefbfd086.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/v4xpuz5LQsk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn51@2020_1/2021/07/12/18-35-39-134_d9421223fe7a6c0e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626114916164},{"createdTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:16","updatedTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:16","title":"‘The French Dispatch’ Review: Wes Anderson’s Whimsical New Masterwork is a Symphony of Excess [Cannes]","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=682899","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-682904\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-french-dispatch-e1626113681478-700x299.jpeg\" alt=\"the french dispatch review\" width=\"700\" height=\"299\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-french-dispatch-e1626113681478-700x300.jpeg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-french-dispatch-e1626113681478-360x154.jpeg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-french-dispatch-e1626113681478-768x328.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Watching <strong>Wes Anderson</strong>’s <strong><em>The French Dispatch </em></strong>is a delirious experience. It’s akin to being a guest at some amazing meal, with each course more stunning than the last, and just as you wish to take in a moment to admire each dish, the crumbs are whisked away for a new treat to be delivered by nimble servers. It’s a film that weaponizes whimsy in ways that will dazzle die-hard fans of the director. As long as your heart is open, your ears attuned to the pace of the proceedings and eyes accustomed to this mode of staging, you’ll have a quite remarkable experience gorging on this gorgeous film.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-682899\"></span></p>\n<p>Told through three primary storylines presented as articles ripped from the fictional literary magazine that gives the film its name, we meet many of the regular troupe that have made much of Anderson’s oeuvre such a wonderful ride over the last few decades. <strong>Bill Murray</strong>, <strong>Owen Wilson,</strong> <strong>Jason Schwartzman</strong>, <strong>Edward Norton</strong>, and <strong>Willem Dafoe</strong> are joined by likes of <strong>Liev Schreiber</strong>, <strong>Saoirse Ronan</strong>, <strong>Timothée Chalamet</strong>, <strong>Matheiu Amalric</strong>, <strong>Stephen Park</strong>, <strong>Lyna Khoudri</strong>, and <strong>Frances McDormand</strong>. Simply reveling in this cast list is enough to excite, and each perfectly inhabits their place within the cacophonous world of Ennui-sur-Blasé, a small town that wakes up quickly in the morning, and is the home to a magazine setup by a Kansas-based publisher as a kind of foreign outpost to bring stories of the continent back to local readers.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most charming is the story of a prisoner artist, his muse, and the agent responsible for bringing to the world his work. <strong>Benicio Del Toro</strong>&#8216;s roaring, murderous self is wonderful, as is a twitchy turn by <strong>Adrien Brody</strong> as the art dealer and <strong>Tilda Swinton</strong> as a buyer. But it’s the absolute radiant, intoxicating turn by <strong>Léa Seydoux</strong> playing both muse and gardienne that’s truly glorious. She brings a fierce, Fraco sullenness that’s particularly intoxicating, lending a kind of local credence with her role to Anderson’s entire folly.</p>\n<p>The rapidity of shots, intricately designed and staged, gave rise to immediate desire to rewatch. Even the inclusion of neo-Ya Ya French &#8217;60s pop, voiced by <strong>Jarvis Cocker</strong> of Pulp, made one crave sitting down in a café, or jitterbugging to tunes on an aubergine-colored portable record player. Seen in a theatrical palace on the Mediterranean, the film exudes what it feels in one’s mind’s eye to be in a mystical France at its most romantic and surreal, a land where while even the undertakers have gone on strike the garishly painted obese streetwalkers feel the stuff of some master’s oil painting.</p>\n<p>As each storyline is drawn out – the prison artist, the 1968 student rebellion, the gangster kidnapping and food fantasy, along with tales of the magazine itself – we are treated to manifold sides of everything that one dreams about in such a landscape. Unapologetically literary, Anderson’s credits thank a pantheon of longform writers, from Mavis Gallant to James Baldwin, immediately providing a bibliography to delve into to elicit some of the more subtle real-world references.</p>\n<p>With sublime lensing by <strong>Robert Yeoman</strong> that switches aspect and palate throughout, a perfectly twee soundtrack by <strong>Alexandre Desplat</strong> augmenting the baroque pop and symphonic trifles, and<strong> Adam Stockhausen</strong>’s mindbendingly exceptional production design, this is simply heaven for anyone that wants their films to be very serious about having fun. Once again many of the animated elements that Anderson brought to life with <em>Isle of Dogs</em> and <em>Fantastic</em> <em>Mr. Fox</em> shows that his overtly manipulated visual style is a welcome mix of the intricately prepared and the wickedly haphazard. Add in a killer car chase that quite literally takes a pause where we return to where we left off and you’ve got a million different pieces to fall in love with.</p>\n<p>Yet above all, it’s the remarkable way in which Anderson’s tale is able to hold this much narrative, this much pomp and fury and fantasy and silliness, constrained somehow with the pages of his own dispatch. The different chapters are unique yet speak to one another, the timbre shifts but the tune remains the same, ever inviting a closer read yet never feeling above the audience. This is a world you’re invited in to explore, as he has done throughout his career, but with an effect that’s perhaps nowhere near as calibrated as with his latest.</p>\n<p>A symphony of excess, <em>The French Dispatch</em> is a <em>lot</em>, and I watched it mouth agape simply trying to hold on and let the images and words and performances enter my mind as if I was drinking from a fire hose. It’s a wild ride, to be sure, and given how rare it is to have an artist with such a commitment to such a loud, triumphant aesthetic it’s almost uncanny when pared against other, more commonly austere works, even those that pass off as blockbusters.</p>\n<p><em>The French Dispatch</em> is a rocket ship ride to your cinematic soul, meshing word, action and vision in one glorious bon-bon that’s both sweet and savory. It’s a film I cannot wait to visit over and over, and it’s a film that reminds that, yes, stories truly can take one to places that they never knew they wanted to be, yet are forever changed by the journey that we’re led on.</p>\n<p><strong>/Film Rating: 10 out of 10</strong></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-french-dispatch-review-cannes/\">&#8216;The French Dispatch&#8217; Review: Wes Anderson&#8217;s Whimsical New Masterwork is a Symphony of Excess [Cannes]</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=i6Nn46hq9Ck:LkVtnyQWXng:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=i6Nn46hq9Ck:LkVtnyQWXng:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=i6Nn46hq9Ck:LkVtnyQWXng:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=i6Nn46hq9Ck:LkVtnyQWXng:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=i6Nn46hq9Ck:LkVtnyQWXng:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=i6Nn46hq9Ck:LkVtnyQWXng:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/i6Nn46hq9Ck\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 12 Jul 2021 18:23:30 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-french-dispatch-e1626113681478-700x299.jpeg","linkMd5":"d14894bb82c8d14ec8490752515d446e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn10@2020_4/2021/07/12/18-35-28-684_34115e3639210bcd.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":299,"sourceBytes":36257,"destBytes":22986,"author":"Jason Gorber","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-french-dispatch-e1626113681478-700x299.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn10@2020_4/2021/07/12/18-35-28-684_34115e3639210bcd.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn75@2020_4/2021/07/12/18-35-39-281_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=i6Nn46hq9Ck:LkVtnyQWXng:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn67@2020_3/2021/07/12/18-35-39-259_15ac9b797bd2d474.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn20@2020_1/2021/07/12/18-35-39-646_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=i6Nn46hq9Ck:LkVtnyQWXng:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn45@2020_6/2021/07/12/18-35-38-819_705e3218060cb59f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/i6Nn46hq9Ck":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn6@2020_4/2021/07/12/18-35-38-818_8542ec76376bc771.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626114916157},{"createdTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:16","updatedTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:16","title":"‘Jackass Forever’ First Look Photos Get the Gang Back Together for Total Mayhem Before the First Trailer Next Week","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=682426","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-682433 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/jackass-forever-poopblow-frontpage-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Jackass Forever First Look Photos\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/jackass-forever-poopblow-frontpage.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/jackass-forever-poopblow-frontpage-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>What&#8217;s the best way to celebrate getting back together with friends after a year being away from them?

That&#8217;s him above being launched out of a cannon while wearing some kind of winged suit. The <em>Jackass</em> franchise has never been shy about pulling off circus-esque stunts, and this is one of the oldest in the book. Though this one might seem familiar, they&#8217;ve never actually done this before.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-682434 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/jackass-forever-bull-knoxville-700x467.jpg\" alt=\"Jackass Forever First Look Photos\" width=\"700\" height=\"467\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/jackass-forever-bull-knoxville-700x467.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/jackass-forever-bull-knoxville-360x240.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/jackass-forever-bull-knoxville-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/jackass-forever-bull-knoxville.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>However, there will be at least one old stunt that&#8217;s pulled from the previous <em>Jackass</em> movies, and that&#8217;s putting Johnny Knoxville in front of an angry bull. This time he&#8217;s dressed like a magician though, so there must be some kind of silly spin on the terrifying challenge that clearly went south. This kind of result is exactly why <em>Jackass Forever</em> <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/jackass-final-movie-johnny-knoxville/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">will be Knoxville&#8217;s final film in the franchise</a>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-682436 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/jackass-forever-mimesnake-700x467.jpg\" alt=\"Jackass Forever First Look Photos\" width=\"700\" height=\"467\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/jackass-forever-mimesnake.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/jackass-forever-mimesnake-360x240.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><em>Jackass Forever</em> will also see some new faces joining the old gang.

She&#8217;s also joined by fellow newcomer <strong>Sean “Poopies” McInerney</strong>, who is facing down a presumably angry snake sitting on a barrel. For good measure, they&#8217;re dressed as mimes along with Steve-O, probably just trying to give the snake a good show.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-682435 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/jackass-forever-poopblow-700x467.jpg\" alt=\"Jackass Forever First Look Photos\" width=\"700\" height=\"467\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/jackass-forever-poopblow-700x467.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/jackass-forever-poopblow-360x240.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/jackass-forever-poopblow-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/jackass-forever-poopblow.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Then there&#8217;s this potentially dangerous stunt that puts <span class=\"m_52413673630920623spelle\">Ehren</span> <span class=\"m_52413673630920623spelle\">McGhehey (now known as <strong>Danger Ehren</strong> for some reason) in a glass contraption with <em>Loiter Squad</em> cast member <strong>Dark Shark</strong>.

That chair also has straps on the legs, which is stress-inducing, but we&#8217;re honestly not sure what&#8217;s happening hear. Knoxville is dressed as a sailor, so maybe this is some kind of naval recruitment challenge?</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re wondering where <strong>Bam Margera</strong> is in all this, to make a long story short, he was fired from the movie after his struggles with addiction and mental health creating a rift with his family and the <em>Jackass</em> crew. Margera has long struggled with substance abuse, but the death of <em>Jackass</em> crew member Ryan Dunn sent him into an even worse spiral, and it has resulted in him being unfit to appear in the franchise anymore.

Unfortunately, we&#8217;ll have to wait a few months after that to see all the stunts since the movie doesn&#8217;t arrive in theaters until <strong>October 22, 2021</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/jackass-forever-first-look-photos/\">&#8216;Jackass Forever&#8217; First Look Photos Get the Gang Back Together for Total Mayhem Before the First Trailer Next Week</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=2GfJClc7vyM:PySIYn79kf8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=2GfJClc7vyM:PySIYn79kf8:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=2GfJClc7vyM:PySIYn79kf8:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=2GfJClc7vyM:PySIYn79kf8:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=2GfJClc7vyM:PySIYn79kf8:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=2GfJClc7vyM:PySIYn79kf8:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/2GfJClc7vyM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 12 Jul 2021 14:37:49 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/jackass-forever-poopblow-frontpage-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"8638814d5fad6702cb67dcfb4ce16606","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn35@2020_2/2021/07/12/18-35-16-454_e75958ddb8389012.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":63088,"destBytes":47932,"author":"Ethan Anderton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/jackass-forever-poopblow-frontpage-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn35@2020_2/2021/07/12/18-35-16-454_e75958ddb8389012.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/jackass-forever-knoxville-cannon-700x949.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn86@2020_6/2021/07/12/18-35-38-869_0e1eb33fc2f1bf76.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/jackass-forever-bull-knoxville-700x467.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn55@2020_2/2021/07/12/18-35-39-147_e576fef7d5e4ec67.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/jackass-forever-mimesnake-700x467.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn84@2020_3/2021/07/12/18-35-39-313_7df6308dce157b3c.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/jackass-forever-poopblow-700x467.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn84@2020_3/2021/07/12/18-35-38-800_28f60de718b9e8fd.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/jackass-forever-watertankstunt-700x467.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn65@2020_4/2021/07/12/18-35-39-469_566adb12b5692a31.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn75@2020_4/2021/07/12/18-35-39-281_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=2GfJClc7vyM:PySIYn79kf8:V_sGLiPBpWU":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn20@2020_1/2021/07/12/18-35-39-646_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=2GfJClc7vyM:PySIYn79kf8:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn96@2020_4/2021/07/12/18-35-38-877_4274e97540662fbb.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/2GfJClc7vyM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn12@2020_5/2021/07/12/18-35-39-350_dfb0b32206dec2b3.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626114916164},{"createdTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:16","updatedTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:16","title":"The Original Theme-Park Jungle Cruise is Changing at Disneyland This Week","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=682404","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-655453 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Jungle-Cruise-ride-updates-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Jungle Cruise ride updates\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Jungle-Cruise-ride-updates.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Jungle-Cruise-ride-updates-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>As <strong>Disneyland</strong> gears up for its 66th anniversary on July 17, and with the arrival of the new live-action blockbuster <strong><em>Jungle Cruise</em></strong> at the end of the month, the original attraction on which the film is based is getting its moment in the spotlight with a redesign going live at the Anaheim park on July 16. Some of the changes seem intriguing, while others&#8230;.well, others are definitely changes, for better or worse.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-682404\"></span></p>\n<p>A few days ago, the Disney Parks YouTube account posted this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWpgLnwB_WI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">video</a>, offering yet another glimpse at the overhaul that the <strong>Jungle Cruise</strong> is receiving, both in Orlando and in Anaheim. The video implies an interesting challenge for Disney&#8217;s Imagineers, who want to keep the ride as classic as it ever was, but also make it more relevant and inclusive, two terms that come up often in the 150-second video. (It&#8217;s a notable challenge because, unfortunately, many of the elements which have kept the Jungle Cruise &#8220;classic&#8221; are also those that make it feel dated and/or racist.)</p>\n<p>Perhaps more interesting were comments from Kim Irvine <a href=\"https://twitter.com/laughing_place/status/1413503861671690243\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">captured</a> on Twitter by the Laughing Place blog, where she mentioned that the iconic &#8220;lost team up the pole&#8221; gag — in which we see a group of explorers dangling from a pole with a rhinoceros attempting to jab at them with its pointed horn — was limited because &#8220;we didn&#8217;t relate to them&#8230;each one of them is so carefully costumed to help us understand their stories.&#8221;</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-655288\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/jungle-cruise-ride-updates-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"jungle cruise ride updates\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/jungle-cruise-ride-updates-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/jungle-cruise-ride-updates-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/jungle-cruise-ride-updates-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/jungle-cruise-ride-updates.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>Change Comes for Us All</h2>\n<p>The Jungle Cruise is an attraction that has hung around the Disney Parks for more than six decades for a reason. It&#8217;s a quintessential blend of adventure and humor, of old and new technologies. But there&#8217;s no doubt that the ride has been antiquated and offensive in some respects for a long time. Change needed to come. But the balance of adding backstories where none existed, in an attraction that often lives or dies on the charm and personality of your boat&#8217;s specific skipper, with staying classic to that attraction&#8217;s roots feels like a task that Irvine and the team may not be up for.</p>\n<p>The addition of backstory may well be so easy to ignore as to be invisible. And that&#8217;s fine. If the majority of guests will simply notice that, hey, the Jungle Cruise isn&#8217;t quite so backwards-thinking anymore, that&#8217;s a good thing. Hopefully the added elements are more carefully weaved in — plenty of fans are willing to see the Jungle Cruise change without unnecessary story shoehorned in.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/disneyland-original-jungle-cruise-ride-changes/\">The Original Theme-Park Jungle Cruise is Changing at Disneyland This Week</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=NkyvxBEUbrs:iSxJYsTk73Q:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=NkyvxBEUbrs:iSxJYsTk73Q:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=NkyvxBEUbrs:iSxJYsTk73Q:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=NkyvxBEUbrs:iSxJYsTk73Q:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=NkyvxBEUbrs:iSxJYsTk73Q:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=NkyvxBEUbrs:iSxJYsTk73Q:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/NkyvxBEUbrs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 12 Jul 2021 12:25:20 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Jungle-Cruise-ride-updates-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"1c70c0ffca9619afee8d863844ca67ce","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn79@2020_4/2021/07/12/18-35-32-754_f99f9b981bcc3219.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":68591,"destBytes":54796,"author":"Josh Spiegel","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Jungle-Cruise-ride-updates-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn79@2020_4/2021/07/12/18-35-32-754_f99f9b981bcc3219.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/jungle-cruise-ride-updates-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn13@2020_3/2021/07/12/18-35-38-816_576bccf40c3c08bc.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn75@2020_4/2021/07/12/18-35-39-281_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=NkyvxBEUbrs:iSxJYsTk73Q:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn28@2020_1/2021/07/12/18-35-39-793_00bc9b82bd3bb236.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn20@2020_1/2021/07/12/18-35-39-646_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=NkyvxBEUbrs:iSxJYsTk73Q:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/NkyvxBEUbrs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn83@2020_2/2021/07/12/18-35-38-826_eed9afe4c709e001.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626114916157},{"createdTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:16","updatedTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:16","title":"‘The Matrix 4’: Release Date, Cast and More","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=681128","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-617566 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-matrix-5-e1589461630807-700x337.jpg\" alt=\"the matrix 4 production\" width=\"700\" height=\"337\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-matrix-5-e1589461630807-700x337.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-matrix-5-e1589461630807-360x174.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-matrix-5-e1589461630807-768x370.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-matrix-5-e1589461630807.jpg 780w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><em>(Welcome to <a href=\"https://slashfilm.com/tag/and-more\"><strong>…And More</strong></a>, our no-frills, zero B.S. guide to when and where you can watch upcoming movies and shows, and everything else you could possibly stand to know.)</em></p>\n<p><strong>Lilly</strong> and <strong>Lana Wachowski</strong>&#8216;s 1999 science-fiction action blockbuster <em><strong>The Matrix</strong></em> is possibly the most famous cyberpunk property in existence. Now, 22 years and two sequels later, we&#8217;re ready to take the red pill once more and return to cyberspace in <em><strong>The Matrix 4</strong></em>. Here&#8217;s everything we know about <em>The Matrix 4</em>.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-681128\"></span></p>\n<h2><strong>The Matrix 4 Release Date and Where You Can Watch It</strong></h2>\n<p><em>The Matrix 4 </em>has gone through its share of COVID-related delays, much like any other film from the past year and a half. The original release date was May 21, 2021, though that <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-matrix-4-release-date-delay/\">got pushed because of the pandemic</a>.</p>\n<p>While <em>The Matrix 4</em> is probably the kind of action thrill-ride that merits a trip to the theater, fans will be able to enjoy it at home on the same day as well. As part of the HBOMax same day release schedule, <em>The Matrix 4</em> slides into theaters and HBOMax on <strong>December 22, 2021</strong>. Fans who want to bullet-dodge with Neo and co. from the comfort of their couch will have to act fast, however, as <em>The Matrix 4</em> will only stream on the service for 31 days.</p>\n<h2>What is The Matrix 4?</h2>\n<p><em>The Matrix 4</em> is the fourth installment in the <em>Matrix</em> series, which started with <em>The Matrix </em>in 1999 and was summarily followed by <em><strong>The Matrix: Reloaded</strong></em><strong> </strong>and <em><strong>The Matrix: Revolutions </strong></em>in 2003. The first film told the story of Neo (<strong>Keanu Reeves</strong>), a hacker who turns out to be the prophesied hero of mankind. Following a war between humanity and the machines they built, the machines put everyone in tubes and connected them to the matrix, a kind of virtual reality that people believe is reality. Neo must fight the computer program Agent Smith<em><strong> </strong></em>(<strong>Hugo Weaving</strong>) with the help of his mentor, Morpheus (<strong>Laurence Fishburne</strong>) and his new romantic interest, Trinity (<strong>Carrie-Anne Moss</strong>). After defeating the machines and gaining some superhuman powers at the end of the first film, Neo must go up against bigger adversaries in the second and third installments.</p>\n<p>The sequels were not particularly well-received by critics or audiences, though there has been a reappraisal of them in recent years. <em>The Matrix: Revolutions</em> ended with Neo sacrificing himself to connect the machines to himself, hopefully to create lasting peace. Details on the plot of <em>The Matrix 4</em> have been kept extremely secret, leaving us to guess at how they might bring back the machine-ending messiah.</p>\n<h2>The Matrix 4 Director, Crew, and More</h2>\n<p>Writer and director <strong>Lana Wachowski</strong> will return to direct <em>The Matrix 4</em>. She co-wrote the script with novelists <strong>Aleksandar Hemon</strong> and <strong>David Mitchell</strong>, whom she previously worked with on the Netflix series <strong><em>Sense8</em></strong>. (She also made a movie of Mitchell&#8217;s <strong><em>Cloud Atlas</em></strong>, a novel once deemed unfilmable.) <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-matrix-4-cinematographer-john-toll/\">Oscar-winning cinematographer </a><strong>John Toll </strong>(<em><strong>Braveheart</strong></em>) will take over for  Bill Pope as director of photography. Concept artists for the <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-matrix-concept-artists-the-matrix-4/\">original films <strong>Geof Darrow</strong> and <strong>Steve Skroce</strong> will return</a>, which means <em>The Matrix 4</em> will have their signature cybernetic visual designs.</p>\n<h2>The Matrix 4 Cast</h2>\n<p>Quite a few members of the cast from the original trilogy are returning.

We would humbly propose that <strong><em>Thor: Love and Thunder</em> </strong>director <strong>Taika Waititi</strong>, on the other hand, tends to say exactly what he means and mean exactly what he says. In his own endearing way, at least.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-682429\"></span></p>\n<h2>The World According To Taika</h2>\n<p>In an interview with <a href=\"https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/thor-love-thunder-shouldnt-make-sense-taika-waititi-exclusive/\">Empire</a> (<a href=\"https://collider.com/taika-waititi-thor-love-and-thunder-comments/\">via Collider</a>), the popular and eccentric director of <em><strong>Boy</strong></em>, <strong><em>Hunt for the Wilderpeople</em></strong>, and <em><strong>Thor: Ragnarok</strong></em> has provided a fresh tease for what he has in store for us with <em><strong>Thor: Love and Thunder</strong></em>. Based on his quotes, he has lost none of his usual penchant for bravado and childlike excitement:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Well, just between (me and) you and the readers, I’ve done some crazy shit in my life. I’ve lived, like, 10 lifetimes. But it’s the craziest film I’ve ever done. If you wrote down all the elements of this film, it shouldn’t make sense. It’s almost like it shouldn’t be made. If you walked into a room and said, ‘I want this and this and this.’ Who’s in it? These people. What are you going to call it? Love And Thunder. I mean, you’d never work again. Maybe I won’t after this.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Honestly, this sounds like a filmmaker who simply can&#8217;t believe he&#8217;s found himself in a position to put his distinctive touch on a big-budget blockbuster on the scale of a Marvel movie&#8230; and not just once, but <em>twice</em>. Given his indie New Zealand roots that started with an exploration into his childhood love for Michael Jackson songs and then moved on to a farcical &#8220;documentary&#8221; of the local vampire/werewolf scene (seriously, we implore you to watch <em>Boy</em> and <em><strong>What We Do In The Shadows</strong></em> if you haven&#8217;t yet), Waititi goes on to assure viewers that this <em>Thor</em> sequel will stand apart from <em>Ragnarok:</em></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;It’s very different from Ragnarok. It’s crazier. I’ll tell you what’s different. There’ll be far more emotion in this film. And a lot more love. And a lot more thunder. And a lot more Thor, if you’ve seen the photos.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-464204 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/thorragnarok-taikawaititi-thor-onset-700x326.jpg\" alt=\"Thor Ragnarok Intro Video - Taika Waititi\" width=\"700\" height=\"326\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/thorragnarok-taikawaititi-thor-onset-700x326.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/thorragnarok-taikawaititi-thor-onset-360x168.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/thorragnarok-taikawaititi-thor-onset-768x358.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/thorragnarok-taikawaititi-thor-onset.jpg 1380w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>What to Expect in Thor: Love and Thunder</h2>\n<p>After using <em>Ragnarok</em> to unleash <strong>Tessa Thompson&#8217;s</strong> fan-favorite Valkyrie, goth <strong>Cate Blanchett</strong>, and a face-painted <strong>Jeff Goldblum</strong> who might as well have wandered onto the set entirely by accident one day and remained in the film anyway, needless to say we can&#8217;t wait to see how Waititi outdoes himself for the upcoming 2022 movie. It&#8217;s hard not to feel energized by his own infectious excitement and, honestly, it&#8217;s just nice to see a filmmaker remain enthused to provide entertainment to the masses.</p>\n<p><em>Thor: Love and Thunder</em> will feature returning stars <strong>Chris Hemsworth</strong>, Tessa Thompson, Jeff Goldblum, and even a Mjolnir-wielding <strong>Natalie Portman</strong> as Jane Foster. They&#8217;ll be joined by <strong>Chris Pratt</strong> and many of the Guardians of the Galaxy, not to mention a villainous turn by <strong>Christian Bale</strong> (of all people!) as Gorr The God Butcher.

The story focuses on a teenage boy named Amuro Ray whose father helps create a new mobile suit called (you guessed it) Gundam to fight Zeon&#8217;s mobile suits. Amuro inadvertently becomes the sole pilot of the titular suit and gets sucked into the war with a group of child soldiers aboard a giant spaceship. Char Aznable, a brooding flying ace also known as the Red Comet, becomes Amuro&#8217;s rival while keeping a secret mission to reclaim his honor. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you want to experience the entire 43-episode show or watch the condensed seven-hour movie trilogy, let&#8217;s get in the robot and explore the show that changed the mecha genre forever. </span></p>\n<h2><b>What Makes It Great</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From the start, you get the feeling that you’re watching a small chapter in a much larger epic saga. Contrary to the grand operatic battles, the command center intrigue, and the throne room machinations akin to </span><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/legend-of-the-galactic-heroes/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Legend of the Galactic Heroes</span></i></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, creator Yoshiyuki Tomino decides to focus the action primarily on the contained story of the spaceship White Base and its crew. We occasionally glimpse what command has in store and only get rare wide shots of the space battle, giving us a child soldier&#8217;s perspective of events they have no control over.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And when I say child, I mean it. The crew of White Base is composed entirely of teenagers, young adults, and a few kids, as they were the only survivors of an attack in their home colony. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gundam </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">was very clearly created by people who grew up in a post-WWII Japan, having seen countless adults go out to fight and never return, leaving the young generation to pick up the pieces. We see how they try their best to distract themselves from the horrors that surround them, and how they are forced to grow up because of it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Watching </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gundam </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">today, you can see how the characters influenced countless archetypes in young adult fiction, with Amuro serving as a clear template for </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Neon Genesis Evangelion</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8216;s Shinji Ikari; both are teenagers tasked with manning an incredible weapon and charging into war. Meanwhile, Char&#8217;s backstory and pseudo-face-turn bring to mind </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Avatar: The Last Airbender </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and Zuko&#8217;s redemption arc.</span></p>\n<h2><b>What It Adds to the Conversation</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arguably </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gundam</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8216;s greatest contribution to the mecha genre is its treatment of war and its human cost. No matter how cool the Gundam fights are — if watching Jedi fights in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Star Wars </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is cool, try giving a lightsaber to a giant robot — the show always makes sure to cut away to the devastating losses that surround the cool moments. None of the main characters make it to the other side unscathed as the death and violence start taking a heavy toll on our incredibly young ensemble. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is why the show&#8217;s focus on a small group of common soldiers rather than commanders and leaders is so effective: it shows us that the ones doing the fighting and the dying are just regular people. That this was done on a kids’ show back in the 70s at a time when anime (like American cartoons during the &#8217;80s) was mostly made to sell toys is still an impressive achievement.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gundam</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8216;s</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">anti-war message is also delivered through the show&#8217;s weirdest and most sci-fi concept — </span><a href=\"https://gundam.fandom.com/wiki/Newtype\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the Newtypes</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, humans who have evolved to adapt to life in space with heightened senses. Though this first series doesn&#8217;t do much with the concept, the few explanations we get hints at Tomino&#8217;s ideas that humanity will eventually evolve to be capable of understanding one another, therefore avoiding conflict. It&#8217;s not entirely unlike </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Evangelion</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8216;s Human Instrumentality, and it complements </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gundam</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8216;s anti-war themes nicely as the Newtypes are mostly used as weapons of war by people in charge with older and more limited ways of thinking.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Why Non-Anime Fans Should Check It Out</b></h2>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mobile Suit Gundam</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the quintessential anime franchise and this first series is the original </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecha_anime_and_manga#Real_robot\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">real robot</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> show.

Jake (<strong>Colin Farrell</strong>) greets a patron who has walked down the stairs, seeking out “tea crystals” for instant pleasure. Explaining that the local supermarket may carry such convenient goods, and that instead he’s got preparations that may require more effort but may be more rewarding, she leaves frustrated, wondering how someone can survive by not giving the customer what they already want.</p>\n<p>This interaction in many ways echoes the slow, methodical, yet absolutely stellar cinema of the mononymic <strong>Kogonada</strong>, the Korean-American video essayist and Criterion supplement master whose <em>Columbus</em> was one of the triumphs of Sundance 2017. His latest, <em>After Yang</em>, is a near-future tale of a remarkable family, with Jake joined by his wife of African descent Kyra (Jodie Turner-Smith), raising their adopted daughter Mika (<strong>Malea Emma Tjandrawidjaja</strong>). They buy a second-hand “technosapien,” essentially a life-like android or replicant, that’s named Yang (<strong>Justin H. Min</strong>) to instill in their daughter knowledge of her Chinese heritage.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-682416\"></span></p>\n<p>Told through a series of quiet conversations, either in simply staged rooms or while traveling in driverless vehicles, there’s little in the way of kinetic flourish to either storytelling or the performances. Yet Kogonada&#8217;s precision, akin to the blend we witness the master tea maker assembling, prodding gently with a wooden utensil to craft a perfect mix of ingredients, results in a heady brew that’s both intoxicating and delicious.</p>\n<p>Farrell has often been drawn to offbeat dramas like this, as evidenced by his work with another Cannes favorite Yorgos Lanthimos. Here he brings more of his trademark subtlety of performance, managing in often elegant ways to be paradoxically comforting and surprising at the same time. Turner-Smith is both formidable and nurturing, and Min’s role as the aloof android would easily appear to be rote, but here it’s injected with the humanity of the character dialed in perfectly. Tjandrawidjaja is the precocious heart of the narrative, and here too Kogonada manages to elicit a performance perfectly attuned to the story’s requirements. <strong>Haley Lu Richardson</strong> plays Ada, whose storyline becomes entwined with the family, and the ever welcome <strong>Clifton Collins Jr.</strong> plays George, their gormless but well meaning neighbor.</p>\n<p>Written by short-story author <strong>Alexander Weinstein</strong> and based on his own novel, the script delights every moment that genre expectations are undercut. Each moment where you’d expect some emotional explosion, dire conspiracy sidebar, or even expected violence, you’re instead treated to something that feels very real and very earned, making the near-future setting’s fantastic technologies feel all the more quotidian. This is a film whose absences drive much of its pleasure, from the memories of characters and times now gone, to the lack of these story beats that a lesser script (or a more twitchy studio) would add to spice things up.</p>\n<p>Instead, we have a film whose pace may be quieted by, nonetheless is driven forward in both an entertaining and intellectually stimulating fashion. This is no small magic trick, and just as with <em>Columbus,</em> it’s clear that Kogonada is gifted at doing contemplative without compromising audience engagement. At a festival full of meanderings in place of genuine plot, all to occupy time rather than drive a story forward in a cinematically compelling way, it’s certainly worthy of celebration with a master filmmaker can lead us along in a gentle but guided fashion.</p>\n<p>Like the tea, this is a film to be sipped and savored, to appreciate the ritual of watching, and to be wowed by the quiet yet eloquent execution. It’s a film that borrows liberally from the genre, yet does so not in a winking fashion, but more like putting on a comfortable garment, something to drape over oneself in a way both warming and familiar. Yet <em>After Yang</em> still feels extremely fresh and present, further cementing Kogonada as a true talent to cherish, and presenting a storyline that may be slightly bitter to some craving the more conventional crystals, but for those with a taste for such a blend they will find the experience nothing short of thrilling.</p>\n<p><strong>/Film Rating: 9 out of 10</strong></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/after-yang-review-cannes/\">&#8216;After Yang&#8217; Review: Kogonada&#8217;s Second Film is a Quiet Sci-Fi Stunner to Be Savored [Cannes]</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=dG1T3qHunjM:zJ_I9uWrsgQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=dG1T3qHunjM:zJ_I9uWrsgQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=dG1T3qHunjM:zJ_I9uWrsgQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=dG1T3qHunjM:zJ_I9uWrsgQ:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=dG1T3qHunjM:zJ_I9uWrsgQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=dG1T3qHunjM:zJ_I9uWrsgQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/dG1T3qHunjM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 12 Jul 2021 13:00:13 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/after-yang-e1626093424162-700x299.jpeg","linkMd5":"49b1c4e1059c3d01ae191559b787d010","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn52@2020_1/2021/07/12/18-35-30-730_623600361d18f56c.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":299,"sourceBytes":18422,"destBytes":6720,"author":"Jason Gorber","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/after-yang-e1626093424162-700x299.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn52@2020_1/2021/07/12/18-35-30-730_623600361d18f56c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn75@2020_4/2021/07/12/18-35-39-281_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=dG1T3qHunjM:zJ_I9uWrsgQ:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn12@2020_1/2021/07/12/18-35-44-749_0d56cf6793189076.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn20@2020_1/2021/07/12/18-35-39-646_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=dG1T3qHunjM:zJ_I9uWrsgQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn77@2020_6/2021/07/12/18-35-39-525_e6f72ee60758416f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/dG1T3qHunjM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn97@2020_1/2021/07/12/18-35-39-334_b54750967d6414ac.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626114916164},{"createdTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:16","updatedTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:16","title":"‘Looney Tunes Cartoon’ Season 2 Gives Elmer Fudd His Gun Back","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=682813","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-682853 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/looneytunescartoons-season2-elmerfudd-gun-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Looney Tunes Cartoons Guns Back\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/looneytunescartoons-season2-elmerfudd-gun.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/looneytunescartoons-season2-elmerfudd-gun-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>When HBO Max debuted their new series of <strong><em>Looney Tunes Cartoons</em></strong> featuring revamped versions of the classic Warner Bros. Pictures characters, there was one key element missing from two of Bugs Bunny&#8217;s most famous enemies. Elmer Fudd and Yosemite Sam <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/hbo-max-looney-tunes-cartoons-avoid-guns/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">weren&#8217;t seen using guns</a> despite always blasting away at the wascally wabbit/lily-livered, bow-legged varmint in the classic cartoons. However, <em>Looney Tunes Cartoons</em> season 2 has pulled back on that a bit by giving Elmer Fudd his trusty rifle back.<span id=\"more-682813\"></span></p>\n<p>The lack of guns in the first season of <em>Looney Tunes Cartoons</em> was confirmed by executive producer <strong>Peter Browngardt</strong> not long after the first wave of animated shorts was released by HBO Max. Though he didn&#8217;t cite any specific motivation about the exclusion of guns for Elmer Fudd and Yosemite Sam, it was assumed that the social climate surrounding gun violence was likely an influence. As Browngardt said, &#8220;We’re not doing guns. But we can do cartoony violence — TNT, the Acme stuff. All that was kind of grandfathered in.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It appears that Browngardt had a change of heart, because <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/hbo-max-looney-tunes-cartoons-season-2-elmer-fudd-guns/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Comic Book Resources</a> points out that the sixth episode of the second season, entitled &#8220;Rotund Rabbit,&#8221; features Bugs Bunny squaring off with Elmer Fudd again, but this time he&#8217;s carrying his trusty hunting rifle. In the cartoon, Elmer Fudd tries to blast Bugs Bunny, but the rabbit is so fast that the cartoon bullet stops in the middle of its trajectory, sprouts a mouth and arms, and exasperatedly announces that he&#8217;s quitting the chase. The bullet then tosses on a hat and grabs a suitcase and leaves.</p>\n<p>Browngardt pointed out the change when a user on Twitter noticed the backtracking on keeping guns out of <em>Looney Tunes</em>, including the aforementioned clip in question:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">New Looney Tunes Cartoons out today! Now with guns! <a href=\"https://t.co/YG2dJU1AaT\">https://t.co/YG2dJU1AaT</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Pete Browngardt (@peebgardt) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/peebgardt/status/1413145069364805640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 8, 2021</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<h2>Elmer Get Your Gun</h2>\n<p>Though there was a lot of backlash from certain <em>Looney Tunes</em> fans after it was pointed out that guns wouldn&#8217;t appear in the first season of <em>Looney Tunes Cartoons</em>, the inclusion of Elmer Fudd&#8217;s gun again may not be a reaction intended to appease that side of the crowd. Cartoons take a long time to make, and one of the segments included in the recently released second season, entitled &#8220;Mummy Dummy,&#8221; actually debuted at the Annecy International Animation Film Festival in 2019. So perhaps bringing <em>Looney Tunes Cartoons</em> guns back was always something that would happen eventually.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, it&#8217;s not as if those behind the <em>Looney Tunes</em> had actively abandoned the use of cartoon guns in the hands of Elmer Fudd and Yosemite Sam altogether. <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/tag/space-jam-a-new-legacy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><em>Space Jam: A New Legacy</em></strong></a> marketing materials have clearly shown both of the characters wielding guns again, so there&#8217;s not an overarching mandate to keep them out of these shorts. As prominent of a problem gun violence might be, keeping them out of cartoons that have had them for decades isn&#8217;t going to fix the problem.

The connection between the two makes Taskmaster more than just a generic villain — she is not only an embodiment of the red on Natasha’s ledger, but a revelation that truly surprised the Avenger.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-663577\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Black-Widow-Disney-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Black Widow Disney+\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Black-Widow-Disney.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Black-Widow-Disney-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2><strong>A Secret From Natasha’s Past</strong></h2>\n<p>&#8220;One of the great fears for Natasha Romanoff is, ‘Oh, I thought something that wasn&#8217;t right,’&#8221; Pearson told /Film in an <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/black-widow-eric-pearson-interview/\">interview</a>. &#8220;She knows everything. She&#8217;s in control. She’s very meticulous that way. It&#8217;s how she wants to live her life. The idea that there&#8217;s a secret is a problem. The idea that there&#8217;s a secret from her past is a bigger problem. The idea that there&#8217;s a secret from her past that is hidden and reaching out with a Terminator-like aggression.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Natasha and Taskmaster having this connection wasn’t Marvel’s initial plan for the character, Pearson explained.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;We always talked about Taskmaster being this straightforward physical villain. And then the idea of looping it into the greatest shame of [Natasha’s] past, that&#8217;s how I constructed it — I wanted Taskmaster to matter the most to [Natasha] as a character and fit our story that way.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>That connection causes Natasha to do everything she can to save Antonia/Taskmaster, even though Dreykov has programmed her to do nothing but try to kill her. Natasha succeeds in the end, and Antonia ends the film free from her father and in the care of the other Black Widows. Natasha was able to clear at least some of the red on her ledger, which makes for a bittersweet ending, knowing her sacrifice in <em>Endgame.</em></p>\n<p><em>Black Widow </em>is currently in theaters and available on Disney+ via Premier Access.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/black-widow-taskmaster-twist/\">How the &#8216;Black Widow&#8217; Screenwriter Created That Surprise Twist With Taskmaster</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=J4T5uKFedHM:XcDxufvt4DM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=J4T5uKFedHM:XcDxufvt4DM:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=J4T5uKFedHM:XcDxufvt4DM:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=J4T5uKFedHM:XcDxufvt4DM:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=J4T5uKFedHM:XcDxufvt4DM:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=J4T5uKFedHM:XcDxufvt4DM:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/J4T5uKFedHM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 12 Jul 2021 17:13:50 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/black-widow-featurette-action-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"159b2c9aaa5198a8843c93cea835233b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn68@2020_1/2021/07/12/18-35-25-438_7a78d6118f55a912.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":36453,"destBytes":23508,"author":"Vanessa Armstrong","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/black-widow-featurette-action-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn68@2020_1/2021/07/12/18-35-25-438_7a78d6118f55a912.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Black-Widow-Disney-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn63@2020_1/2021/07/12/18-35-39-233_88561f444d3cfca5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn75@2020_4/2021/07/12/18-35-39-281_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=J4T5uKFedHM:XcDxufvt4DM:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn69@2020_5/2021/07/12/18-35-39-516_66085e591d755e2d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn20@2020_1/2021/07/12/18-35-39-646_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=J4T5uKFedHM:XcDxufvt4DM:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn15@2020_1/2021/07/12/18-35-39-761_7cf870adcca2a8c9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/J4T5uKFedHM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn64@2020_4/2021/07/12/18-35-38-813_973bee78f486befb.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626114916163},{"createdTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:16","updatedTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:16","title":"Groovy! ‘The Evil Dead’ Coming Back to Theaters for 40th Anniversary Event","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=682828","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-673397 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/evil-dead-rise-hbo-max-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"evil dead rise hbo max\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/evil-dead-rise-hbo-max-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/evil-dead-rise-hbo-max-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/evil-dead-rise-hbo-max-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/evil-dead-rise-hbo-max.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Get out your denim and your chainsaws, because <em><strong>The Evil Dead </strong></em>is coming to theaters for one night only.</p>\n<p>Fathom Events and Grindhouse Releasing will bring writer/director <strong>Sam Raimi</strong>&#8216;s 1981 indie horror classic back to theaters nationwide for its 40th anniversary.

And with <em>Evil Dead</em>, it was about two or three years difference, because we filmed it in 1979, so we&#8217;re coming up on 42-odd years later. But it&#8217;s fun to celebrate it!&#8221;</p>\n<p>He also shared that his introduction is being shot at a drive-in theater, and that he&#8217;s thankful for the longevity of the film&#8217;s success.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s a good opportunity to look back and be grateful that it hung around this long. People still seem to want to watch it, they still seem to enjoy it. It&#8217;s on to the next generation now. It&#8217;s not even the original fans. Their children have been introduced to it now. So it&#8217;s my job just to keep perpetuating it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Campbell also took a moment to warn fans of the sequels or television series that the first film is a completely different beast.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you have not seen it, not much will prepare you for it! It is an unrated movie, so you have to be prepared for that. There are elements that some people would find very disturbing. So I would say it&#8217;s not for the faint of heart, but those people who like it, really like it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Each movie of the three is weirdly different. The first <em>Evil Dead</em> is kind of a melodrama, a lot of laughs come out of the excessive effects and hokey dialogue, and bad acting.&#8221;</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-51935\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/zz6ea6e627.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"1014\" /></p>\n<h2>The Groovy Details</h2>\n<p><em>The Evil Dead</em> spawned a whole franchise, including its sequels, <em><strong>Evil Dead </strong></em><em><strong>II </strong></em>and <em><strong>Army of Darkness</strong></em>, a 2013 remake/reboot, several video games, and the <strong><em>Ash vs. Evil Dead </em></strong>television series.

But most importantly, he spoke about whether Geralt&#8217;s dialogue will expand beyond the occasional &#8220;hmph.&#8221;</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-682806\"></span></p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-651585 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-witcher-5-e1608670185110-700x318.jpg\" alt=\"the witcher bloopers\" width=\"700\" height=\"318\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-witcher-5-e1608670185110-700x318.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-witcher-5-e1608670185110-360x164.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-witcher-5-e1608670185110-768x349.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-witcher-5-e1608670185110.jpg 1218w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>Not Just a Grumpy Snowman</h2>\n<p><em><strong>The Witcher</strong></em>&#8216;s Geralt is a man of few words in season one. He&#8217;s a stoic, gruff kind of hero that just doesn&#8217;t seem to have much important to say. In an interview with Horowitz for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joFSMgR-OEk&#38;feature=emb_title\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WitcherCon</a>, Cavill said he thought it was important for him to speak less, since he was a fish out of water.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I played season 1 deliberately like that which was him in the wilds without the opportunity for vast wades of dialogue. I thought it best he speaks less because it looks like he thinks more. That was the intention then,&#8221; Cavill said.</p>\n<p>However, with Geralt returning to his home turf at Kaer Morhen, Cavill figured it was time for him to open up a bit.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;But in the season 2 scenario, he is in Kaer Morhen, his home space, amongst the people he knows, and, in my opinion, I was to be verbose and be intellectual because that is what he is. He’s not a brute. For me, it was very important to bring Geralt as close to the books as the vision and plot would allow. And I wanted him to be more verbose and more intellectual and more representative of a man who has lived seventy years and has a philosophical lean. He can be mopey at times, but he is also wise. He has been around. He is a nice guy despite having moments of unpleasantness, and capable of extraordinary violence, but his intentions are pure. I wanted to reflect on that as much as possible.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Geralt is a man who has lived through quite a bit and has decades of experience to share, but sometimes he came across as a bit of an ice cube in the first season.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is very easy to fall down the line of him being the grumpy snowman and there is a comedy aspect to that, and I wanted to lean away from it in Season 2,&#8221; Cavill elaborated.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-682287 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/witcher3-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/witcher3.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/witcher3-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>Some Complicated Relationships</h2>\n<p>Cavill also spoke at length about his character&#8217;s relationships, primarily with his foster daughter, Ciri, and his former flame, Yennefer. He felt it was important to make Geralt a good, caring figure while also highlighting that he&#8217;s a little out of his element with parenthood.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I wanted him to be warm. If not a father figure, then definitely an older brother figure and have this kind of caring nature to it. He is not going to be super soft because he has himself had a very hard life and she’s about to lead a very hard life. She is no longer a princess and so he is not going to be softening her up any further, but he is going straight down the line,&#8221; Cavill explained. &#8220;That was very important to me that Geralt has this sense of humor while also being tough and intellectual and wise and I tried to lean on it as much as possible when it came to the relationship with Cirilla.”</p>\n<p>While Cavill dodged questions about the nature of Geralt&#8217;s relationship with the sorceress Yennefer (<strong>Anya Chalotra</strong>), he did note how their split would effect Geralt in the coming season.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For me, it is important to draw from the source material and I wanted to keep it as close as possible to that. The loss of Yennefer is a great blow for Geralt, and it is something he buries deep, but he is a man of action, a wise man and his focus is Cirilla. He has lost plenty of people in his life, but he has a job to do and is focused more on being there for Cirilla.&#8221;</p>\n<p>You can watch the entire interview yourself below and hear it from the man himself. Season 2 of <em>The Witcher<strong> </strong></em>debuts on Netflix on <strong>December 17, 2021</strong>.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/joFSMgR-OEk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;
