Try various aperture settings</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Have you noticed that in some photos sun flares look&#160;soft and diffused, while&#160;in others they look bold and defined? That has a lot to do with which <a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"aperture setting (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">aperture setting</a> was used.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you use a fairly wide aperture, like f/5.6, you&#8217;ll get soft flares. But if you use a small aperture, like f/22, you&#8217;ll get stronger, more defined flares.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"536\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sun-flare-tips-wide-narrow-aperture.jpg?resize=1500%2C536&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"photographing sun flares aperture comparison\" class=\"wp-image-97706\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sun-flare-tips-wide-narrow-aperture.jpg?w=1500&#38;ssl=1 1500w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sun-flare-tips-wide-narrow-aperture.jpg?resize=300%2C107&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sun-flare-tips-wide-narrow-aperture.jpg?resize=768%2C274&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sun-flare-tips-wide-narrow-aperture.jpg?resize=600%2C214&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sun-flare-tips-wide-narrow-aperture.jpg?resize=717%2C256&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In the split image above, the f/5.6 shot is a softer-looking flare, and&#160;the f/22 shot is more defined. The points of the flare are created by the blades of the aperture inside your lens. When the blades come&#160;closer together (as with narrow apertures like f/22), you get&#160;more defined points in your flares.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using&#160;different apertures will give you a variety of looks to choose from when you&#8217;re editing. You&#8217;ll also learn which type of sun flare you prefer, depending on the&#160;setting and feel you want in your photo.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. Use Aperture Priority mode</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The easiest way to control the aperture (as discussed above) is to put your camera in <a aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture-and-shutter-priority-modes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Aperture Priority mode</a> (indicated with an &#8220;AV&#8221; on a Canon camera, and an &#8220;A&#8221; on a Nikon camera). That way, you&#8217;ll be able to easily adjust the aperture setting. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with your camera set to <a aria-label=\"Auto ISO (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-auto-iso/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Auto ISO</a>, it will automatically choose the&#160;ISO and shutter speed settings for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now&#160;you&#8217;ll be able to quickly switch apertures and see the difference it makes to your sun flares.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3. Partially hide the sun</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Use an object (such as a fence post, building, or tree, etc.) to partially hide the sun. This will allow you to capture&#160;flare while adding an artistic touch to the object you&#8217;re shooting.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"536\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sun-flare-tips-for-beginners.jpg?resize=536%2C750&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"photographing sun flares\" class=\"wp-image-97711\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sun-flare-tips-for-beginners.jpg?w=536&#38;ssl=1 536w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sun-flare-tips-for-beginners.jpg?resize=214%2C300&#38;ssl=1 214w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sun-flare-tips-for-beginners.jpg?resize=429%2C600&#38;ssl=1 429w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 536px) 100vw, 536px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Move&#160;around the object and let the sun peek out at different locations as you keep&#160;taking photos. I love doing this, and I always come away with something unique.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>4. Move around and take lots of pictures</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When shooting sun flares, it really helps to move around &#8211; a lot.&#160;If you are partially hiding the sun (as mentioned in the previous tip), a slight movement to the right or left will&#160;cause a big change in the flare. Your photo could&#160;be flooded with too much light, or you might miss the flare altogether.&#160;But moving could also&#160;reveal&#160;the flare in just the right spot to create&#160;the look you want.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"750\" height=\"536\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sun-flare-tips-move-around.jpg?resize=750%2C536&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"sun flares through leaves\" class=\"wp-image-97728\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sun-flare-tips-move-around.jpg?w=750&#38;ssl=1 750w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sun-flare-tips-move-around.jpg?resize=300%2C214&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sun-flare-tips-move-around.jpg?resize=600%2C429&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sun-flare-tips-move-around.jpg?resize=717%2C512&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s important to take lots of pictures.&#160;You&#8217;ll eventually learn&#160;how much sun to include in relation to the amount of flare you want.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"536\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sun-flares-creative-photography-tips.jpg?resize=536%2C750&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"sun flare in forest\" class=\"wp-image-97713\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sun-flares-creative-photography-tips.jpg?w=536&#38;ssl=1 536w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sun-flares-creative-photography-tips.jpg?resize=214%2C300&#38;ssl=1 214w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sun-flares-creative-photography-tips.jpg?resize=429%2C600&#38;ssl=1 429w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 536px) 100vw, 536px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Sun flares can be unpredictable; that&#8217;s part of what makes them fun to work with.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5. Try using some filters</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When photographing sun flares, filters can be helpful. I recommend considering either of the following options:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong><a aria-label=\"Polarizing filter (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/you-must-have-a-polarizer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Polarizing filter</a>:</strong>&#160;You&#8217;ll get different effects as you rotate this filter. It can help increase color saturation and decrease reflections. If you have a polarizer, play around with it and see how it affects the&#160;flares.</li><li><strong><a aria-label=\"Graduated neutral density filter (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/using-graduated-neutral-density-filters-for-landscape-photography/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Graduated neutral density filter</a>:</strong>&#160;This filter is darker at the top and becomes lighter near the bottom. It can prevent part of the image from looking&#160;blown-out when shooting into the sun.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"536\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sun-flare-tip-graduated-neutral-density-filter.jpg?resize=1500%2C536&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"graduated neutral density filter\" class=\"wp-image-97715\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sun-flare-tip-graduated-neutral-density-filter.jpg?w=1500&#38;ssl=1 1500w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sun-flare-tip-graduated-neutral-density-filter.jpg?resize=300%2C107&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sun-flare-tip-graduated-neutral-density-filter.jpg?resize=768%2C274&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sun-flare-tip-graduated-neutral-density-filter.jpg?resize=600%2C214&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sun-flare-tip-graduated-neutral-density-filter.jpg?resize=717%2C256&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I used&#160;a graduated neutral density filter for the photo on the right. It helped control the light, which kept the colors richer.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>6. Shoot during different times of day</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Around sunrise and sunset, the sunlight comes in at a unique angle. This&#160;creates&#160;a <a aria-label=\"warmer, golden color (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/how-photograph-golden-hour/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">warmer, golden color</a>, whereas during midday, there is&#160;a cooler (bluish) or more neutral light.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the&#160;following image, two&#160;of the photos were&#160;taken&#160;around sunset, and the other two were taken a few hours after sunrise. Can you guess when each photo was taken?</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"536\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sun-flare-tips.jpg?resize=536%2C750&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"images shot at different times of day\" class=\"wp-image-97719\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sun-flare-tips.jpg?w=536&#38;ssl=1 536w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sun-flare-tips.jpg?resize=214%2C300&#38;ssl=1 214w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sun-flare-tips.jpg?resize=429%2C600&#38;ssl=1 429w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 536px) 100vw, 536px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I bet you got it right &#8211; the images on the left&#160;were taken near sunset. They have a warmer feel, don&#8217;t they?&#160;Whereas the images on the right&#160;have a cooler feel.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>7.&#160;Divide&#160;the sun with your camera</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can get a softer, more diffused look by <a aria-label=\"composing your photo (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/5-elements-of-composition-in-photography/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">composing your photo</a> so that the sun is&#160;not fully in the frame. Try cutting the sun in half, or only including its&#160;bottom third.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"750\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sun-flare-tips-for-beginners-2.jpg?resize=750%2C500&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"sun flare cut off at the topic of the frame\" class=\"wp-image-97723\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sun-flare-tips-for-beginners-2.jpg?w=750&#38;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sun-flare-tips-for-beginners-2.jpg?resize=300%2C200&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sun-flare-tips-for-beginners-2.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sun-flare-tips-for-beginners-2.jpg?resize=90%2C60&#38;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sun-flare-tips-for-beginners-2.jpg?resize=717%2C478&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Play with it. Create different effects and&#160;see which you prefer.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>8. Use a tripod and a remote shutter release</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As I mentioned earlier, a smaller&#160;aperture setting (higher f-number) will give you a sharper, more defined flare.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But using a small&#160;aperture also means that your camera will require more time to take the photo. The longer the image takes, the more chance there is for camera shake to cause blur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are handholding your camera, this could be a problem. When your camera is on a <a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/tripod-buying-guide/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"tripod (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">tripod</a>, there is much less chance of camera shake.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"536\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sun-flare-tips-use-a-tripod.jpg?resize=536%2C750&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"photographing with a tripod\" class=\"wp-image-97724\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sun-flare-tips-use-a-tripod.jpg?w=536&#38;ssl=1 536w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sun-flare-tips-use-a-tripod.jpg?resize=214%2C300&#38;ssl=1 214w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sun-flare-tips-use-a-tripod.jpg?resize=429%2C600&#38;ssl=1 429w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 536px) 100vw, 536px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Using a tripod will help keep your photos looking sharp&#160;and your sun flares looking crisp.&#160;By using a <a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/remote-shutter-vs-delayed-shutter/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"remote shutter release (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">remote shutter release</a> (or your camera&#8217;s self-timer), you&#8217;ll reduce&#160;camera shake even more.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>9. Keep the sun at your model&#8217;s back</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>By keeping the sun at your model&#8217;s back, you&#8217;ll allow&#160;the light of the flare to spill out around them in interesting ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"750\" height=\"536\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/photographing-sun-flares-tips-2.jpg?resize=750%2C536&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"sun flare portrait\" class=\"wp-image-97726\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/photographing-sun-flares-tips-2.jpg?w=750&#38;ssl=1 750w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/photographing-sun-flares-tips-2.jpg?resize=300%2C214&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/photographing-sun-flares-tips-2.jpg?resize=600%2C429&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/photographing-sun-flares-tips-2.jpg?resize=717%2C512&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on the time of day, you might need to lie down, and have your model sit or lie down, too. The image above was taken around 3:00 PM in the afternoon, and I was lying on the ground.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The higher the sun is, the lower&#160;you&#8217;ll need to be in order to&#160;place the flare at your model&#8217;s head or at your model&#8217;s shoulders. Having your model sit down will make&#160;it easier for you. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when the sun is lower in the sky, positioning&#160;becomes easier for both of you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>10. Use a reflector</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A <a aria-label=\"reflector (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/using-reflectors-to-light-your-subject/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">reflector</a> is designed to reflect the&#160;light back onto your subject. Reflectors are&#160;usually made of fabric (white, silver, or gold)&#160;and can be handheld, hung from a freestanding base, or placed on the ground.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using a reflector can be helpful if your model is in the shade. It helps to <a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/6-ways-of-using-reflector-to-take-better-portraits/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">brighten the face</a>, making the photo look more pleasing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>11. Cover the sun with your hand to focus</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It can be hard to focus when shooting sun flares. There is so much light that your camera may struggle to lock focus on the right spot.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When this happens, hold up your hand to cover the sun, compose your photo, and press your shutter release halfway. Once your camera focuses, take your hand down and press the shutter the rest of the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may have to try this&#160;a number of times until you get exactly what you want.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>12. Place the sun out of the frame</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To get a really soft flare effect without a bright point, try placing the sun out of your frame.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"750\" height=\"536\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sun-flare-tips-3.jpg?resize=750%2C536&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"the sun in the upper right corner\" class=\"wp-image-97730\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sun-flare-tips-3.jpg?w=750&#38;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sun-flare-tips-3.jpg?resize=300%2C214&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sun-flare-tips-3.jpg?resize=600%2C429&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/sun-flare-tips-3.jpg?resize=717%2C512&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I love how this adds soft light (as shown in the photo above), and how the eye is drawn up to the source of light.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>13. Use spot metering</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/metering-modes-and-how-your-camera-meter-works/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Spot metering</a> handles bright light really well, so if you&#8217;ve got a choice, go with this metering mode. All but one of the photos in this article were taken using spot metering.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your camera does not have spot metering, then partial metering is the next best choice.&#160;Note that I use&#160;autofocus with the&#160;focus point set to the center (as the focus point is where your metering mode will be active).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>14. Have fun!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This last tip is probably the most important:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When photographing sun flares, experiment and have fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t be afraid to take tons of pictures, try different aperture settings, and move around.&#160;Sun flares are wild and unpredictable.&#160;Be creative and use different objects to block (or diffuse) the light.&#160;You&#8217;re bound to get lots of overexposed and underexposed photos, but you&#8217;ll get a lot of gorgeous results, as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Photographing sun flares: Now it&#8217;s your turn</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I would love to see your sun flare photos and hear your tips!
