After discovering David Bowie, he turned a corner, incorporating rock ’n’ roll into his repertoire. In his tiny apartment, Lars and his brother built their own studio and began experimenting, making beats and loops, cutting and sampling, learning the basic recording skills that way. Around this time, Lars crossed paths with Mette Lindberg, who he dubbed “the coolest singer in Copenhagen.” From there The Asteroids Galaxy Tour was born. In 2008, the band reached instant global exposure when their song “Around The Bend” was featured in an Apple iPod Touch advertisement. Their music has also appeared in Gossip Girl, Vampire Diaries and CSI Miami. “Around The Bend” was also one of the key tracks to the R.J. Cuttler documentary \"The September Issue\", based on Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour.<br /><a href=\"http://www.girlieaction.com/music/the_asteroids_galaxy_tour/downloads/The_Golden_Age-Elecoustic_Version.mp3\"><br />TAGT - The Golden Age (elecoustic version)</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/theasteroidsgalaxytour\">TAGT@MySpace</a><br /><br />--<br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">SONG OF THE DAY:</span> <a href=\"http://filtermagazine.com/index.php/media/entry/mp3_mates_of_state_bring_you_maracas_filter_premiere\">Mates Of State - Maracas</a><br />(from <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Mountaintops</span>, out September 13th on <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Barsuk Records</span>)<br /><br />--<br /><br />Check Comments for Bonus!","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 14 Jul 2011 10:59:00 +0000","feedId":48830,"bgimg":"http://media.oregonlive.com/events_impact/photo/typhoon-band-79a12a9a87841f56_large.jpg","linkMd5":"a85d9198bfcc8c4e94d369fd1ced3bd1","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn67@2020_2/2020/10/13/15-07-37-488_087754e9f749b592.webp","destWidth":432,"destHeight":292,"sourceBytes":36668,"destBytes":23344,"author":"Ziggy","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://media.oregonlive.com/events_impact/photo/typhoon-band-79a12a9a87841f56_large.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn67@2020_2/2020/10/13/15-07-37-488_087754e9f749b592.webp","http://beatcrave.frsucrave.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/asteroid-galaxy-tour-via-myspace11.jpg":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602601657357}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-10-13 23:07:37","updatedTime":"2020-10-13 23:07:37","feedId":48830,"fetchDate":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 15:07:37 +0000","fetchMs":68,"handleMs":41,"totalMs":123115,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":25,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"d30ce248a5f8ef1e93fb032827363e30","hostName":"us-037*","requestId":"70037e98367d4c7191a939f00a3b6b1a_48830","contentType":"application/atom+xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":23344,"bgimgsTotal":1,"bgimgsGithubTotal":1,"articlesImgsTotal":2,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":1,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx32":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 03:50:32","updatedTime":"2020-09-07 06:08:49","id":48830,"name":"Indie Surfer Blog","url":"http://indiesurfer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default","subscriber":65,"website":null,"icon":"http://indiesurfer.blogspot.com/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx65/cdn47@2020_5/2020/09/06/22-08-48-417_e9ac6a146173dae2.ico","description":"Alternative & Independent Music Informer","weekly":null,"link":null},"noPictureArticleList":[{"createdTime":"2020-10-13 23:09:40","updatedTime":"2020-10-13 23:09:40","id":null,"feedId":48830,"linkMd5":"a85d9198bfcc8c4e94d369fd1ced3bd1"}],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":23344,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1602601657238,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":78,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":41,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":0,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"},{"spend":122008,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"}]},"extra5":2,"extra6":1,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[null,null],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{"http://europe65.herokuapp.com/":{"failCount":1,"successCount":0,"resultList":[null]},"http://us-034.herokuapp.com/":{"failCount":1,"successCount":0,"resultList":[null]}},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[{"code":1,"isDone":false,"source":"http://media.oregonlive.com/events_impact/photo/typhoon-band-79a12a9a87841f56_large.jpg","sourceStatusCode":200,"destWidth":432,"destHeight":292,"fixedGithubDest":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn67@2020_2/2020/10/13/15-07-37-488_087754e9f749b592.webp","sourceBytes":36668,"destBytes":23344,"targetWebpQuality":75,"feedId":48830,"totalSpendMs":967,"convertSpendMs":13,"createdTime":"2020-10-13 23:07:37","host":"us-002*","referer":"http://indiesurfer.blogspot.com/2011/07/typhoon-asteroids-galaxy-tour.html","linkMd5ListStr":"a85d9198bfcc8c4e94d369fd1ced3bd1,a85d9198bfcc8c4e94d369fd1ced3bd1","githubUser":"myreaderx32","githubHttpCode":201,"extra22GetBytesInfo":"1、没有Referer字段","extra23historyStatusCode":[200],"sourceSize":"35.8 KB","destSize":"22.8 KB","compressRate":"63.7%"}],"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx32":1},"failGithubMap":{}}
