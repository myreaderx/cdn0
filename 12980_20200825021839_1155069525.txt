With the continuous escalation of network attack and defense, the threat of fileless attack technology has been increasing in the past few years. According to CrowdStrike&#8217;s &#8220;2020 Global Threat Situation Report&#8221; data, in 2019, hackers used modern methods to conduct fileless attacks worldwide. The number exceeds traditional malware attacks.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://static.ts.360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FA1.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-26160\" src=\"https://static.ts.360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FA1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"783\" height=\"131\" srcset=\"https://static.ts.360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FA1.png 783w, https://static.ts.360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FA1-300x50.png 300w, https://static.ts.360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FA1-768x128.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 783px) 100vw, 783px\" /></a></p>\n<p>However, Users don&#8217;t need to worry too much. Fileless attacks cannot bypass 360 Total Security&#8217;s advanced detection based on behavioral monitoring and other technologies. Through continuous attention and analysis of the latest malicious attack methods, close attention to information on Trojan organization activities, and a large amount of threat intelligence information, 360 Total Security has a complete fileless attack protection solution.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://static.ts.360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FA2.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-26164\" src=\"https://static.ts.360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FA2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"902\" height=\"587\" srcset=\"https://static.ts.360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FA2.png 902w, https://static.ts.360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FA2-300x195.png 300w, https://static.ts.360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FA2-768x500.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 902px) 100vw, 902px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>2</strong><strong>．Common fileless attack methods</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>1 Fileless attacks based on malicious scripts</li>\n</ol>\n<p>By default, JavaScript, VBScript and PowerShell scripting languages are available on the Windows platform, and the corresponding native applications are: mshta.exe, cscript.exe and powershell.exe.</p>\n<p>For attackers, the advantage of scripts is that they are text files (not binary executable files) and run in the context of an interpreter, which is a trusted component.</p>\n<h3>① JavaScript</h3>\n<p>In 2019, the SideWinder APT organization launched an attack against China. The APT organization used JavaScript memory to execute malicious DLL files compiled by .net. The attacker first uses the Office remote code execution vulnerability (cve-2017-11882) to decrypt and execute the JavaScript script, and then executes the Trojan load through the JavaScript script memory. The main attack chain is shown in the following figure:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://static.ts.360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FA3.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-26232\" src=\"https://static.ts.360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FA3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"681\" height=\"189\" srcset=\"https://static.ts.360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FA3.png 681w, https://static.ts.360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FA3-300x83.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 681px) 100vw, 681px\" /></a></p>\n<h3>② VBScript and Powershell</h3>\n<p>njRAT, also known as Bladabindi or Njw0rm, is a remote access trojan (RAT, remote access trojan), which can control the infected system and provide a series of remote control functions for remote attackers. With the upgrading of offensive and defensive technology, njRAT remote control also began to join fileless attack technology. In an attack event captured by 360 Security Center where njRAT was spread by a download site, the attacker used VBScript plus a powershell script to achieve a fileless attack. The main attack chain is shown in the following figure:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://static.ts.360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FA4.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-26244\" src=\"https://static.ts.360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FA4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"869\" height=\"157\" srcset=\"https://static.ts.360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FA4.png 869w, https://static.ts.360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FA4-300x54.png 300w, https://static.ts.360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FA4-768x139.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px\" /></a></p>\n<p>A malicious script named system32.vbs will call powershell to access malicious files hosted on Microsooft Onedrive, and copy itself to the startup directory to achieve local persistence:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://static.ts.360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FA5.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-26176\" src=\"https://static.ts.360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FA5.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"636\" height=\"192\" srcset=\"https://static.ts.360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FA5.png 636w, https://static.ts.360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FA5-300x91.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 636px) 100vw, 636px\" /></a></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The powershell parameters after Base64 decryption are as follows, and the function is to download and run the obfuscated njRat:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://static.ts.360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FA00.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-26248\" src=\"https://static.ts.360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FA00.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"784\" height=\"61\" srcset=\"https://static.ts.360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FA00.png 784w, https://static.ts.360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FA00-300x23.png 300w, https://static.ts.360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FA00-768x60.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 784px) 100vw, 784px\" /></a></p>\n<p>1.2 Fileless attacks based on malicious documents</p>\n<p>In fileless attacks based on malicious documents, attackers often deliver malicious text documents in the form of email attachments, and use social engineering to induce target users to execute the shellcode or macro script in the document.</p>\n<p>First of all, the diversity of Microsoft office document functions not only provides convenience to users, but also presents more possibilities for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities. Attackers usually use vulnerabilities to execute embedded malicious shellcode commands, and use the shellcode as a springboard to achieve further attacks. For example, the SideWinder APT organization mentioned above uses the Office remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2017-11882).</p>\n<p>Secondly, the VBA macros supported by Microsoft office documents also provide an opportunity for attackers. Attackers will use traditional security software to distinguish the malicious weakness of macro instructions, and perform actions such as downloading malicious code by running office macros.</p>\n<p>Finally, using the defects of loading additional templates for Word documents in Microsoft Office to launch malicious request template injection attacks is also a common fileless attack based on malicious documents.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>① MICROSOFT OFFICE macro</p>\n<p>The Ursnif banking Trojan has used fileless attacks based on office macros. Ursnif is a frequently active banking Trojan, also known as the Gozi banking Trojan. It is a variant of the Gozi-ISFB banking Trojan. Since the source code of the Trojan was leaked in 2014, attackers have been upgrading Ursnif features. In the Ursnif banking Trojan&#8217;s attack on Italy in early 2019, a fileless attack based on office macros was used. The main attack chain is shown in the following figure:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://static.ts.360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FA111.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-26252\" src=\"https://static.ts.360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FA111.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"237\" srcset=\"https://static.ts.360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FA111.png 748w, https://static.ts.360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FA111-300x95.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px\" /></a></p>\n<p>The Excel file with malicious macro will display &#8220;error&#8221; when it is opened, so as to induce the user to enable the macro.

Gamaredon is an APT organization that first appeared in 2013, mainly for cyber espionage against Ukraine. In 2017, the organization was exposed to attacks against Ukraine and was named the Gamaredon group for the first time.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of 2020, Gamaredon carried out an attack based on word template injection with Covid-19 related emails. The attack delivers a word document file as an email attachment. When the document is opened, the attacker will use template injection to download a document template containing malicious macro code from the Internet. The macro will further request a payload from the C&#38;C server. By the way, from the perspective of the function of the vbs script, this attack by the Gamaredon organization will eventually lead to the landing of the payload, but this does not prevent us from studying what word template injection technology can do in fileless attacks. effect. The main attack chain of Gamaredon&#8217;s attack is shown below:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://static.ts.360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FA222.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-26256\" src=\"https://static.ts.360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FA222.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"898\" height=\"117\" srcset=\"https://static.ts.360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FA222.png 898w, https://static.ts.360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FA222-300x39.png 300w, https://static.ts.360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FA222-768x100.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 898px) 100vw, 898px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Code for downloading document templates with malicious macros:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://static.ts.360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FA11.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-26196\" src=\"https://static.ts.360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FA11.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"665\" height=\"83\" srcset=\"https://static.ts.360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FA11.png 665w, https://static.ts.360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FA11-300x37.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 665px) 100vw, 665px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Malicious macro in template document:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://static.ts.360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FA12.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-26200\" src=\"https://static.ts.360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FA12.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"598\" height=\"157\" srcset=\"https://static.ts.360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FA12.png 598w, https://static.ts.360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FA12-300x79.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 598px) 100vw, 598px\" /></a></p>\n<p>The VBS script is responsible for requesting and executing the final load from the server:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://static.ts.360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FA13.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-26204\" src=\"https://static.ts.360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FA13.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"613\" height=\"764\" srcset=\"https://static.ts.360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FA13.png 613w, https://static.ts.360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FA13-241x300.png 241w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 613px) 100vw, 613px\" /></a></p>\n<h2>1.3 LOLBins</h2>\n<p>The term &#8220;Living off the land&#8221; (LOL) was first proposed by Christopher Campbell and Matt Graeber at the DerbyCon hacker conference in 2013 to summarize the use of credible, pre-installed system tools to spread malware. Finally, Philip Goh The concept of LOLBins (&#8220;Living Off the Land Binaries&#8221;) is further put forward to represent the Windows binary files used in this technology, such as regsvr32.exe, rundll32.exe, certutil.exe, schtasks.exe, wmic.exe, etc. System native tools fall into this category.</p>\n<p>Astaroth Trojan is a kind of information stealing Trojan. It steals various sensitive information and sends it back to the Trojan C&#38;C server. A new variant of the Astaroth Trojan revealed in 2019, its attack chain includes the abuse of LOLBins.</p>\n<p>The Trojan first delivers a phishing email containing a malicious link. If the user clicks on the link in the email, it will download a ZIP file with anLNK file. When the LNK file with the inductive name is clicked, the LNK file will run the bat script, and the bat script will call wmic.exe to download the XLS file with the obfuscated JavaScript script. The JavaScript script will use Bitsadmin.exe to download the disguise After passing the payload, use Certutil.exe to decrypt the payload, and use Regsvr32 combined with process injection technology to run the real payload.

access tool njRAT is active. Compared with the early infection of the njRAT Trojan&#8217;s executable program landing method, the Trojan uses scripts such as powershell to implement executable program memory execution to complete data theft and other malicious behaviors. , Added more complicated code obfuscation and anti-analysis methods. And through the analysis of the related files of the njRAT Trojan C&#38;C server, it can be found that the njRAT load adopts a variety of different delivery methods.</p>\n<p>njRAT, also known as Bladabindi or Njw0rm, is a remote access trojan (RAT, remote access trojan), which can control the infected system and provide a series of remote control functions for remote attackers.</p>\n<p>The Trojan is mainly spread through download sites, and uses a variety of different njRAT payload delivery methods.</p>\n<p>First, package the Trojan horse script and normal software and place them on some websites such as irregular download sites. When users download and run the installation package, while the normal software is installed, the njRAT also gets the first opportunity to invade the victim&#8217;s machine. . At the same time, through the analysis of the files associated with the Trojan C&#38;C server address 95.211.239.201, it can also be found that the njRAT payload has adopted various delivery methods as described below to infect the victim&#8217;s machine.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://static.ts.360.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1-5.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-25960\"

More and more attackers are beginning to use PowerShell to take advantage, download malicious files through powershell, or execute malicious code in memory to achieve intangible file attacks, etc., so as to avoid some anti-virus detection and bring serious problems to enterprises and individuals. Security threats.</p>\n<p>Secondly, in this example attack, the Trojan horse author used a code obfuscation and anti-analysis project that was open sourced on github at the beginning of this year. This shows that the Trojan horse author has continued to pay attention to malicious tools and code utilization, and has become more frequent. Malicious open source projects are exploited. At the same time, it is worth noting that cloud-based storage platforms have long been abused by attackers, from hosting malicious files to delivering malicious software, and even using them as part of a command and control (C&#38;C) architecture. In this case, the Trojan author used Microsoft OneDrive to host his malicious powershell script.</p>\n<p>At the same time, we noticed that, as one of the poisonous installation packages of njRAT&#8217;s original carrier, its symbolic path name is: C:\\Users\\chirats\\Desktop\\news\\دمج شغال\\sS\\sS\\obj\\Debug\\sS.pdb, Based on the Arabic &#8220;دمج شغال&#8221; in the path, we speculate that the Trojan horse author may come from a country in the Middle East or North Africa.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Security Advice:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to http://www.360totalsecurity.com/ to download and install 360 Total Security which can effectively protect against similar virus threats;</li>\n<li>Improve personal network security awareness.

computer resources, 360 Security Center provides the following security suggestions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Download and install 360 Total Security to effectively intercept such mining Trojan threats;</li>\n<li>Turn on 360 Total Security&#8217;s &#8221; Internet protection- Malicious Website Blocking&#8221;, identify various types of false fraudulent webpages, and block phishing websites and dangerous links.</li>\n<li>If it is found that the system resource consumption is abnormally high, it is necessary to consider the possibility of the operation of the mining Trojan, and use 360 Total Security to conduct a physical examination scan in time to check and kill the virus Trojan;</li>\n<li>Set the access rights of related servers/workstations to avoid the horizontal spread of Trojans;</li>\n<li>To enhance security awareness, it is recommended to download the software from official channels.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a
