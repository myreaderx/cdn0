First, it's not a traditional single- or two-stage blower. It's more of a hybrid.</p><p>It has a single helical auger that moves 10 times faster than your usual two-stage blower. This sends the snow up to 40 feet away. The Personal Pace self-propel system moves the snow blower at your walking speed. And, a joystick allows you to adjust the chute direction and angle. The clearing width is 24 inches and the snow cut depth is 16 inches.</p><p>Toro sent me this snow blower to test in late 2018. The blower was delivered on a pallet by a semi-truck. The instructions for setting it up are pretty simple, and I had it up and running within half an hour of cutting into the box.&#160;</p><p>With this SnowMaster, I found the chore of removing snow to be enjoyable. It self-propels to match my gait, the joystick works smoothly for discharging the chute, and it could handle my gravel driveway and city sidewalks.</p><p>Like many things these days, there's a companion smartphone app. The MyToro app is a good concept but it needs improvement. The coolest function is it can automatically track how many hours you've used your Toro equipment and let you know when to perform maintenance. But for this function to work, you need to purchase the optional Portable Usage Calculator (PUC). I think Toro should have thrown this accessory in for free, but you can easily do this manually with pen and paper.</p><p>I've still been using this SnowMaster it has held up well after sitting in storage over summers. <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/toro-snowmaster-snow-blower-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more in my full review</a>.</p><p>Customers found the equipment to be easy to use and have a good size and weight.

So, if you have a long driveway, this may not be a reasonable solution. But, for small jobs, it can be great with its 18-inch clearing width and 13.5-amp engine that is supposed to clear 490 pounds of snow per minute. The thrower only weighs about 39 pounds and is backed by a two-year warranty.</p><p>The WEN can handle even snow piles with ease, and that's it's quieter than a gas model. It's compact enough to store in a small garage or shed, and it's effective at clearing deep snow in one pass. If the snow is too wet or heavy, however, this machine tends to struggle, and the chute can get clogged. One annoying feature may be the safety switch that requires resetting when it turns off.</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Affordable, lightweight, no need for gas, easy to assemble</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Clogs if the snow is too wet, have to mind the cord (not included)</p>\n\tThe best single-stage snow blower\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5bfd757801b12d19d175f7a8?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Toro_Power_snow_blower\" height=\"750\" width=\"1000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Toro</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3>The <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=35871X943606&#38;xs=1&#38;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.acehardware.com%2Fdepartments%2Flawn-and-garden%2Fsnow-removal-and-equipment%2Fsnow-blowers%2F7002861\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Toro Power Clear 721 E Gas Snow Blower</a> is lightweight, self-propelled, and has a \"guaranteed to start\" warranty for the first two years.</h3><p>At 87 pounds, the <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=35871X943606&#38;xs=1&#38;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.acehardware.com%2Fdepartments%2Flawn-and-garden%2Fsnow-removal-and-equipment%2Fsnow-blowers%2F7002861\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Toro Power Clear 721 E Gas Snow Blower</a> is incredibly light for a gas-powered snow blower.

If not, the company will fix it for free. The hard-plastic body has a 21-inch width, and the tough plastic auger makes constant contact with the surface for efficient clearing.</p><p>Though this model may have trouble with larger quantities of snow, it's maneuverability makes it great for tight driveways and regular maintenance. It also won't get clogged or bogged down by heavy wet snow thanks to its tough auger. Be mindful, however, if you have any gravel paths or rocky terrain as single-stage snow blowers can throw rocks and other small objects that may get pulled in.</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Compact, lightweight, easy to maneuver, self-propelled, two-year full \"Guaranteed to Start\" warranty</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Not meant for heavy snowfalls, manual chute adjustment</p>\n\tThe best cordless electric snow blower\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5bfd76d201b12d19d175f7b6?format=jpeg\" alt=\"EGO_snow_blower\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">EGO</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3>If you don't want to bother with gas and snow in your area is measured in inches instead of feet, then the <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=35871X943606&#38;xs=1&#38;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.acehardware.com%2Fdepartments%2Flawn-and-garden%2Fsnow-removal-and-equipment%2Fsnow-blowers%2F7804842\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored\">EGO Cordless Electric Snow Blower</a>&#160;is your best bet.</h3><p>For a battery-powered snow blower, the <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=35871X943606&#38;xs=1&#38;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.acehardware.com%2Fdepartments%2Flawn-and-garden%2Fsnow-removal-and-equipment%2Fsnow-blowers%2F7804842\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">EGO SNT2102 Cordless Electric Snow Blower</a> can do a lot.

The SNT2102 comes with two 5.0 Ah batteries. The batteries last up to 45 minutes, and the charger takes 45 minutes to charge each battery. So, you may want to consider picking up extra batteries if you have a lot of area to clear.</p><p>Because it's battery-powered, it's much quieter than its gas counterparts. You also won't have to deal with fumes or refilling the tank. The push-button start is also quite the luxury for those accustomed to yanking pull cords to no avail season after season.</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Runs quiet, no need for gas, features headlights, easy to assemble and store, lightweight</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Not self-propelled, only runs for about 30-45 minutes at a time (but charges quickly)</p>\n\tWhat to consider when buying a snow blower\n\t\n\t<p>When buying a snow blower, you should first consider where you want the power to come from.

They also typically need more maintenance than the other two options.</li><li><strong style=\"color: #222222;\">Corded electric </strong>blowers are generally the least expensive and don't pollute, but just like a corded lawnmower, you have to mind the cord as you work, and it's not recommended for longer driveways due to the inherent cord-length limitations.</li><li><strong>Battery power</strong> avoids the cord problem, but batteries only last for so long before they need to be recharged. You can buy extra batteries so that you have enough to complete your job, but they are usually quite expensive.</li></ul><p>Snow blowers are either single-stage, two-stage, or three-stage.</p><ul><li>A <strong>single-stage snow blower</strong> (also referred to as a snow thrower) has an auger that moves very fast and sends the snow flying out of the chute in one step.</li><li><strong>Two-stage blowers</strong> have augers that feed the snow into the chute where a propeller throws the snow.</li><li><strong>Three-stage devices</strong> have augers that feed the snow into the center where it is chopped up and fed into the propeller</li></ul><p>Snow blowers with multiple stages tend to cost more, but they can also handle heavier-duty jobs and throw the snow farther.</p>\n\tCheck out our related home and gardening guides\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f5248e7e6ff30001d4e7136?format=jpeg\" alt=\"dmos snow shovel\" height=\"993\" width=\"1325\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Amazon</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-snow-shovel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The best snow shovels</a></h3><p>Shoveling snow might not be much fun, but it need not be a loathsome burden, either.

States that have a single criminal group dominating the landscape are usually safer than states where groups clash. Three things have happened to make Sonora a battleground.</p><p>After the arrest and extradition of El Chapo, the Sinaloa Cartel has seen its own top-down command and control diminish. It is increasingly reliant on small franchise groups that it does not totally control. This isn't a cartel civil war. The group is still relatively cohesive and does not have factions regularly shooting at each other. But that loss of unified command structure has increased the levels of violence.</p><p>The Sinaloa Cartel has aggressively pushed into Chihuahua to take on areas that have long been controlled by the Juarez Cartel. The Juarez cartel, in turn, has pushed in Sonora. That feud (with some CJNG prodding), has increased the violence in both states.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://boz.substack.com/p/tijuana-security-crisis-caused-by\">three-way battle</a> of Sinaloa vs CJNG/CTNG vs Tijuana Cartel remnants continues to cause high levels of violence in Baja California Norte. That fight has bled over into the western edge of Sonora, with the CJNG making a play for several coastal towns in the state.</p><p><strong>Zacatecas</strong> — If you want to move illicit goods including fentanyl from Guerrero, Michoacan, Colima or Jalisco to the northern border, the <a href=\"https://www.insightcrime.org/news/brief/fentanyl-trade-central-mexico/\">most viable routes run through Zacatecas</a>. Geographically, the state is uncomfortably in between the territories of the largest criminal groups in Mexico, making it a battleground.</p><p>The CJNG has pushed into Zacatecas in the past 12 months, making <a href=\"https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/cartel-puts-on-a-show-of-force-with-25-vehicle-convoy/\">public shows of force</a> in areas that were previously considered Sinaloa or Zetas territory. Adding to the tensions and violence, the prison situation in the state is more complicated because prisoners from so many rival groups are held in the same locations.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5ec55950f34d054e3b49bac9?format=jpeg\" alt=\"FILE PHOTO: Soldiers talks to a man at a crime scene after unknown assailants attacked a workshop leaving several casualties, according to local media, in Celaya, in Guanajuato state, Mexico March 31, 2020. REUTERS/Sergio Maldonado/File Photo\" height=\"3366\" width=\"5048\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Mexican soldiers talk to a man at a crime scene after unknown assailants attacked a workshop in Celaya, in Guanajuato, March 31, 2020.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Reuters</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p><strong>Guanajuato</strong> — I've covered Guanajuato's violence several times over the past two years. Oil theft, extortion and drug trafficking led to a violent battle between the CSRL and CJNG. The AMLO administration has recently claimed that violence is going down due to the <a href=\"https://boz.substack.com/p/mexico-the-capture-of-el-marro-august\">capture of El Marro</a>, the leader of the CSRL.</p><p>Lopez Obrador's often grabs on to short term (one or two week) trends to promote successes on security policies. Unfortunately, over the past 10 years, the removal of top criminal leaders led to greater violence more often than it led to less violence. It has been more violent in 2020, and AMLO shouldn't declare victory until he sees several consecutive months of reduced violence.</p><p><strong>Michoacan</strong> — This was the first state where President Calderon sent the military in 2006, an action that many regard as the start of the current era of conflict. While other states have seen ebbs and flows of conflict over the past 15 years, Michoacan has seen an almost steady worsening as a variety of groups (including La Familia, Knights Templar, Los Viagras and the CJNG) have fought for dominance.</p><p>In 2020, the CJNG continues to battle against a diverse set of local groups. The Lopez Obrador government's failure to respond forcefully to CJNG ambushes of government security forces in late 2019 was a demonstration of the government's inability to set a red line for criminal violence. The CJNG is emboldened to push forward and eliminate their rivals.</p><h2>The CJNG expansion and the Lopez Obrador government's failure to respond are the problem</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f524aa8e6ff30001d4e714b?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador AMLO\" height=\"533\" width=\"800\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador at his daily news conference in Mexico City, February 14, 2020.\n<p class=\"copyright\">REUTERS/Carlos Jasso</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>In Zacatecas, Guanajuato and Michoacan, the key driver of violence is the CJNG expansion. That is also true to a lesser extent in Sonora. The Lopez Obrador government has been slow to counter the CJNG and has arguably been more focused on the group's rivals in each of those states.</p><p>Looking at that maps above, two additional states — San Luis Potosi and Hidalgo — have also seen an increase that is of concern. While both of these states remain safer than the five states I wrote about above, their notable homicide increase this year should be a red flag for Mexican authorities and companies operating in Mexico. In both cases, the CJNG has moved in and fought against local groups including remnants of the Gulf Cartel and Zetas.</p><p>The Lopez Obrador government's failure to respond to the worst cases of rising violence is the unifying factor in all the states listed above. From the <a href=\"https://boz.substack.com/p/mexico-security-update-7-november\">massacre</a> of the LaBaron family in Sonora to the ambushes of police patrols in Guanajuato and Michoacan, AMLO has failed to detain, prosecute and convict those responsible. The National Guard has been spread thin across nearly every state and diverted to blocking and detaining Central America migrants instead of providing focused security to the highest risk areas.</p><h2>Thanks for reading. One more note</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f524ab2e6ff30001d4e714d?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador AMLO baseball softball\" height=\"1747\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Lopez Obrador bats in an exhibition softball game in Muna, Yucatán State, September 21, 2019.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Presidential Press Office/Handout via REUTERS</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p><strong>Yucatan</strong> — It's the safest state in the country. I wanted to stress that as I know someone is going to see that map above and wonder why Yucatan is dark red in terms of the increase in homicides. It sometimes happens when dealing with small numbers. The state saw 26 homicides in the first seven months of this year vs. 16 over the same time period in 2019.</p><p>It's a large increase in terms of percentages, but not a strategically important issue. Yucatan is also the state where homicides are most likely to be investigated and prosecuted, a fact that is not coincidental to its security.

election are being distributed in North Carolina today, kicking off the final sprint to the last day of in-person voting on Nov. 3.</p><p>North Carolina allows any registered voter to vote by mail, without them needing an excuse. Sixty days before Election Day, it is the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/when-will-i-get-november-absentee-mail-ballot-state-guide-2020-8\">first state in the nation</a> to start sending mail ballots to those who have already requested them, <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/vopp-table-7-when-states-mail-out-absentee-ballots.aspx\">according to the National Council of State Legislatures.&#160;</a></p><p>A total of 643,000 voters have requested ballots for the presidential election as of Friday, based on University of Florida professor Michael McDonald's <a href=\"https://electproject.github.io/Early-Vote-2020G/NC.html\">analysis of state data</a>. Already that figure represents a nearly four-fold increase over the total of 168,351 North Carolinians who voted by mail in the 2016 presidential election.</p><p>Mail ballot request rates already substantially outpace 2016 levels of mail voting, the election scholar found. So far, over 9% of North Carolina's approximately 7 million registered voters have requested a ballot. In 2016, 3.5% of North Carolinians who voted in the presidential election cast their ballots by mail, according to US Census data.&#160;</p><p>As of Sept. 3, the number of requests is 16 times higher than the approximately 37,000 North Carolinians who requested mail ballots by the same date in 2016, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OldNorthStPol/status/1301483635237888003\">according to analysis</a> from Catawba College political science professor Michael Bitzer, who has been tracking North Carolina's ballot request data <a href=\"http://www.oldnorthstatepolitics.com/\">throughout the summer.</a></p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet blockquote\" data-lang=\"en\" data-cards=\"\" data-conversation=\"\">&#8212;Michael McDonald  (@ElectProject) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mims/statuses/1301860604794286081?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 4, 2020</a></blockquote><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><p>There's also a stark partisan divide in the makeup of those who have requested their ballots so far. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OldNorthStPol/status/1301485369083527170/photo/2\">Per McDonald's analysis</a>, 52% of the requests received as of Thursday came from registered Democrats, 31% from unaffiliated voters, and 16% from registered Republicans. At the same time in 2016, 37% of requests came from Democrats, 28% from unaffiliated voters, and 35% from Republicans.&#160;</p><p>This year, North Carolina, which accounts for 15 electoral college votes, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/north-carolina-crucial-battleground-state-2020/story?id=72544898\">is a hotly-contested battleground in the presidential race</a> between President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden.</p><p>There's also <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/thom-tillis-vs-cal-cunningham-north-carolina-election-polls-fundraising-2020-7\">a highly competitive US Senate race</a> between first-term Republican Thom Tillis and Democrat Cal Cunningham, rated as a tossup by most major election forecasters; <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/nc-governors-race-sets-pace-democrats-south-72771623\">a gubernatorial election</a> between incumbent Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper and Lt. Gov Dan Forest; US House elections <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/12/03/north-carolinas-new-congressional-map-shifts-two-seats-toward-democrats/?arc404=true\">under the state's newly-drawn congressional map</a>; and several key legislative races that could decide control of both houses of the state legislature.&#160;</p><p>September 4 also marks the first day that voters in all 50 states will be able to request their mail ballot. Mississippi, the latest state to begin taking absentee ballot requests, <a href=\"https://www.sos.ms.gov/content/documents/elections/Step-by-Step%20Guide%20to%20Absentee%20Voting_forweb.pdf\">will also start accepting applications.</a></p><p>Several other states will follow North Carolina and begin sending out ballots starting<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/when-will-i-get-november-absentee-mail-ballot-state-guide-2020-8\">&#160;in mid-September</a> to those who have requested them. And some, including Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/when-is-early-voting-in-each-state-2020-8\">will start early in-person voting</a> as early as the week of Sept. 18. The first three hold a form of early voting called \"in-person absentee\" voting where a voter can cast a paper ballot at their local election office instead of at a traditional polling place.&#160;</p><p>Forty-five days before the election, or September 19 this year, marks the deadline for states to send absentee ballots to overseas and military voters covered under the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act.</p><p>At a Wednesday event in North Carolina, Trump, who has spent the last several months <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/03/politics/election-threat-trump-mail-in-voting-claims-invs/index.html\">spreading misinformation</a> that mail voting is inherently fraudulent, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/trump-encourages-north-carolina-residents-vote-twice-test-mail-system-n1239140\">suggested that voters should attempt to vote twice</a>, by mail and then in-person on Election Day to test whether the state's voting system can detect voter fraud.&#160;</p><p>It is a federal crime <a href=\"https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:52%20section:10307%20edition:prelim)\">to vote twice in a federal election</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/double-voting.aspx\">most state laws also ban voting twice in state elections.</a></p><p>As the North Carolina State Board of Elections <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NCSBE/status/1301527393799213056\">pointed out in a Thursday statement</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/double-voting.aspx\">it is a Class I felony under North Carolina law</a> to vote twice in the same election, and state election officials employ a number of processes to prevent that type of fraud.&#160;</p><p>\"Electronic pollbooks with information about who has already voted are used at every early voting site. If a voter tries to check in who has already voted, they will be prevented from voting a regular ballot,\" Executive Director Karen Binson Bell said. \"A voter will be offered a provisional ballot if they insist on voting, and this ballot will be researched after Election Day to determine whether it should be counted.\"</p><p>In addition to pollbook systems used within states, election officials also share voter records with other states through programs like the Electronic Registration Information Center <a href=\"https://ericstates.org/\">(ERIC)</a> to maintain accurate and up-to-date voter rolls and identify potential instances of fraud, including people voting in multiple states in the same election.&#160;&#160;</p><p>The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think thank that maintains a <a href=\"https://www.heritage.org/voterfraud/search?combine=&state=All&year=&case_type=All&fraud_type=24503&page=0ype=24503&#38;page=0\">database of voter fraud cases</a>, has identified 118 criminal convictions or other official findings of duplicate voting between 2004 and 2020.&#160;</p><p>Brinson Bell emphasized that the Board of Elections \"strongly discourages\" voters from contributing to long lines at in-person polling locations by going to check in-person whether their mail-in vote has been counted. She instead encouraged voters to instead use North Carolina's online ballot tracking system, which is launching in the next few days, to verify that their ballot has been received.&#160;</p><bi-shortcode id=\"expanded-coverage\" class=\"mceNonEditable\" data-source=\"insider-voter-guide\" data-show-header=\"false\">Expanded Coverage Module: insider-voter-guide</bi-shortcode><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/2020-election-voting-begins-september-4-north-carolina-mails-ballots-2020-9'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=j7tHeT7yVLQ:3Vpf33yalPw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=j7tHeT7yVLQ:3Vpf33yalPw:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=j7tHeT7yVLQ:3Vpf33yalPw:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=j7tHeT7yVLQ:3Vpf33yalPw:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=j7tHeT7yVLQ:3Vpf33yalPw:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=j7tHeT7yVLQ:3Vpf33yalPw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=j7tHeT7yVLQ:3Vpf33yalPw:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=j7tHeT7yVLQ:3Vpf33yalPw:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/j7tHeT7yVLQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 04 Sep 2020 13:49:39 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f5128067ed0ee001e25d4e1?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"aa1a20025c9effb3dfaf993efadf5280","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn47@2020_3/2020/09/04/16-37-54-546_5c1db881812f9fbe.webp","destWidth":1778,"destHeight":1333,"sourceBytes":154332,"destBytes":154332,"author":"gpanetta@businessinsider.com (Grace Panetta)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5f5158d27ed0ee001e25d64c?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn12@2020_4/2020/09/04/16-37-57-384_e2547ce3d99582e0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn3@2020_1/2020/09/04/16-38-03-978_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=j7tHeT7yVLQ:3Vpf33yalPw:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn91@2020_4/2020/09/04/16-38-07-084_e02a09054178969f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=j7tHeT7yVLQ:3Vpf33yalPw:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn43@2020_3/2020/09/04/16-38-02-580_558478de4a36a214.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn24@2020_6/2020/09/04/16-37-59-085_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=j7tHeT7yVLQ:3Vpf33yalPw:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn92@2020_6/2020/09/04/16-37-58-071_0eab5f3fe84869ca.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/j7tHeT7yVLQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn59@2020_3/2020/09/04/16-38-03-368_a5cc0a8838933dfd.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599237433651},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 00:37:13","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 00:37:13","title":"Insider Retail: Inside McDonald's whirlwind week of lawsuits and a collaboration, plus a look at how brands are using TikTok to win over customers","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-mcdonalds-whirlwind-week-and-how-brands-are-using-tiktok-2020-9","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f4e6d0c7ed0ee001e25cb87?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Pumpkin spice donuts 5\" height=\"1666\" width=\"2222\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Irene compared Dunkin&#39; and Krispy Kreme&#39;s pumpkin spice donuts.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Irene Jiang/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Hello and happy Friday!</p><p>Welcome to another week of Insider Retail, Business Insider's weekly round-up of everything that's happening in restaurants and retail.

Not only will the rule save you from a lot of stress, but it will also better protect our economy.</p><h2>The 30/30/3 homebuying rule</h2><p>Here are the three homebuying rules to follow. The goal is to follow all three homebuying rules. If you can't, you must follow at least one.</p><h2><strong>Rule No. 1: Spend no more than 30% of your gross income on a monthly mortgage payment</strong></h2><p>Traditionally, the industry says to spend no more than<strong>&#160;</strong>30% of your gross income on your monthly mortgage payment. However, as mortgage rates continue to decline, more people are tempted to increase the percentage.</p><p>When&#160;mortgage rates are lower, you can already buy more home if you keep your spending as a percentage of gross income fixed. The danger emerges when you break this home buying rule percentage to buy an even more expensive home.</p><p>The people most at risk of breaking the first rule of home buying are middle income to lower income people.</p><p>Spending 40% of your monthly $50,000 gross income on a mortgage still leaves you with $30,000 in gross income. However, spending 40% of your monthly $5,000 gross income leaves you with a much smaller cushion.</p><p>You must be able to take care of your basic needs with the remaining money. Therefore, it is safer to spend less of your monthly gross income on a mortgage the more income challenged you are.&#160;</p><h2><strong>Rule No. 2: Have at least 30% of the home value saved up in cash or semi-liquid assets</strong></h2><p>Before buying a home, you should have at least 30% of the value of the home saved in cash.&#160;20% is for the down payment to avoid PMI insurance and get the lowest mortgage rate. The other 10% is for a healthy cash buffer just in case you run into financial trouble.</p><p>I realize that there are programs that allow you to put down a smaller down payment. However, during times of maximum uncertainty, it's better to have a larger financial cushion.</p><p>The homeowners who got blown out the quickest during the previous recession had minimal down payments. With minimal equity, the temptation to walk away from a mortgage is much greater. The thousands who did between 2008 and 2012 missed out on one of the largest real estate recoveries ever.</p><p>If you are planning on buying a home within the next six months, keep at least the 20% down payment in cash. It is unwise to&#160;<a href=\"https://www.financialsamurai.com/how-to-invest-your-down-payment-if-youre-planning-to-buy-a-house/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\">invest your down-payment</a>&#160;in stocks and other risk assets if your home buying time horizon is so short.</p><p>If you don't have at least 30% of the value of the home saved up, it's time to curtail your desires. Eat ramen noodles for the next six months to save money. Start a side hustle to boost your income.</p><p>Borrowing the down-payment from the Bank of Mom is pretty common nowadays. However, before you do, you need to ensure that you aren't putting your parents at financial risk.</p><h2><strong>Rule No. 3: Limit the value of your target home to no more than three times your annual household gross income</strong></h2><p>Home affordability based on cash flow is a function of the price you pay for the home. If you are able to meet the first two home buying rules, then you can tie it all together with the final home buying rule.</p><p>Rule No. 3 is a quick way for homebuyers to screen for homes in an affordable price range. The rule also takes into consideration down payment percentages and prevents one from stretching too much, even with a high down payment.</p><p>If you earn $100,000 a year, you can comfortably afford up to a $300,000 home. Or maybe you are lucky enough to earn&#160;a top 1% income of $500,000 a year. If so, then you can comfortably afford up to a $1,500,000 home.</p><p>Again, with mortgage rates collapsing, housing affordability has gone up. Therefore, you could stretch the third home buying rule and<strong> extend the home value up to five times</strong>&#160;your annual household income.</p><p>Just know that five times a larger salary not only means more absolute debt, but also higher property taxes, maintenance expenses, and so forth. Make sure you run all the numbers before you make any home purchase.</p><h2>Homebuying examples of<strong> following or closely following the 30/30/3 homebuying rule</strong></h2><p>You make $100,000 a year and have $120,000 in cash saved. You desire to buy a $300,000 home. After putting 20% down, you have a $240,000 mortgage. The monthly payment is $1,012 or just 12% of your monthly gross income. With a $60,000 cash buffer left, you have almost five years of mortgage expense covered.</p><p>With the same income and cash savings, you decide to live it up a little and buy a $400,000 home instead. After putting 20% down, you have a $320,000 mortgage and still have a good $40,000 cash buffer. Your monthly payment is $1,349/month at a 3% mortgage rate. The payment is still only 16% of your monthly gross income of $8,333. This is good compared to the 30% maximum recommendation.</p><p>Thanks to low mortgage rates, you can see how stretching to buy a house worth four times or even five times your annual income is possible. However, I do recommended sticking to a three times multiple if you want that wonderful feeling of financial security.</p><p>If America was filled with homebuyers like this, then the 2008-2009 housing crisis would not have been nearly as bad. Unfortunately, too many homebuyers didn't follow the 30/30/3 homebuying rule. Most of us suffered as a result due to foreclosures and short-sales that brought our property values down.</p><h2><strong>An example of someone not following the 30/30/3 homebuying rule</strong></h2><p>You make $120,000 a year and have $100,000 in cash saved at 32 years old. Not bad. However, you're also salivating for an $850,000 home, which equates to seven times your annual income.</p><p>You can't put 20% down so you only put 10% down. This leaves you with only a $15,000 cash buffer and a $765,000 mortgage.</p><header></header><p>Due to a lower down payment, the best mortgage rate you can get is 3.75%. This is still low by historical standards. However, your monthly payment of $3,543 is 35.4% of your $10,000 gross income. It's probably closer to 40% due to PMI. You have now violated all three of my homebuying rules.</p><p>If you lose your job, you will run out of cash in four months. You may get lucky holding on with enhanced government unemployment benefits and a couple stimulus checks. However, think about how stressed you will be during this time period.</p><p>Instead of buying this home now, first save up another $155,000 to get to $255,000 in cash and semi-liquid investments. With 30% of the home price saved, you can put down 20% and have a nice $85,000 cash cushion.</p><p>Further, your mortgage will decline to $680,000. At a 3.25% mortgage rate, your mortgage payment would be $2,959 or 29.6% of your monthly gross income. If your income increases while you are patiently saving for a larger downpayment, even better.&#160;Shop around for a better rate.</p><h2><strong>An example of a terrible violation of the 30/30/3 rule</strong></h2><p>Rule No. 3 helps prevent a homebuyer from going off the deep end. Sometimes, people confuse their own true buying power with reality. Receiving a windfall can play tricks on some people.</p><p>Let's say you make $70,000 and have a $500,000 down payment due to an inheritance. You feel rich! As a result, you may be tempted to buy a $1 million home since you can put $500,000 down.</p><p>If you do, your $2,316 monthly mortgage payment equals 40% of your monthly gross income. But then you get furloughed shortly after purchase with no pay. Three months into furlough, your boss says they won't ever be hiring you back. You are screwed because you have no cash buffer. You thought the $500,000 windfall would be a regular thing. But people only die once.</p><p>You end up going into foreclosure. Your credit and finances are ruined. The property values on your block all take a hit thanks to you. Your financial life is over for several years.</p><p>Or in one man's case after foreclosing on his home, he went on to get a job at The New York Times as&#160;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/09/business/how-a-financial-pro-lost-his-house.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\">a finance columnist</a>. That's right, even after deciding not pay back his mortgage, he still got a job giving financial advice. Anything is possible folks.</p><h2>Ways to get around the 30/30/3 homebuying rule</h2><p>Although the 30/30/3 homebuying rule may seem stringent in such a low interest rate environment, just know plenty of people pay all-cash for their homes too. This idea of taking on lots of debt to buy property hasn't always been the norm.</p><p>If you want to violate the 30/30/3 homebuying rule, then at least consider the following:</p><ul><li>Rent out a room or a portion of your house</li><li>Create a business&#160;on the side to have a legitimate way to deduct a home office and other expenses like internet</li><li>Be in line for a raise or secure a new job with a raise and promotion</li><li>Build&#160;new passive income streams&#160;to help pay for your homeownership expenses</li><li>Be really good to your parents and rich relatives</li></ul><h2>Have discipline when buying a home</h2><p>I get your desire to own a nice home. I've been a real estate fanatic since I was in college. We want to live life to the fullest now! What's the point in working so hard if we're just going to hoard our cash right?</p><p>A home can be a solid investment. It not only provides shelter, but it can also be rented out. Your home could even appreciate handsomely in value over time. Due to home price appreciation, many people I know have effectively lived for free over the decades.</p><p>Further, if your kid graduates with no employment prospects after four years of college and $200,000 in tuition expense, he can live in one of your investment properties. There would be no need for your adult child to live with you. This option may be worth a lot to some investors.</p><p>Despite all these benefits of investing in real estate, just don't overextend your finances when buying a home. The stress is not worth it.</p><p>For those of you who are looking to achieve financial independence sooner, follow the&#160;<a href=\"https://www.financialsamurai.com/housing-expense-guideline-for-financial-independence/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\">FI home buying rule</a>. This rule recommends you keep your home expense to no more than 10% of your monthly gross income. If you follow this homebuying rule, your path to financial independence will be much swifter. You may even start feeling as light as a bird.</p><p>At the very least, please follow my 30/30/3 homebuying rule before making one of the biggest purchases of your life.

The company delayed the phone's launch by several months after some reviewers reported that their device had broken after just two days of use.&#160;</p><p>Now, Samsung is on its third foldable device, the Galaxy Z Fold 2, a successor to the original Fold that also inherits some qualities of the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-new-foldable-smartphone-photos-hands-on-2020-2\">Galaxy Z Flip</a> it launched earlier this year. But it'll put quite a strain on your wallet when it launches on September 18. The Galaxy Z Fold 2 costs $2,000, making it slightly more expensive than its predecessor and the $1,450 Galaxy Z Flip.</p><p>Even with its improved, more durable design, the Galaxy Z Fold 2 isn't for everyone — the price alone is enough to make anyone question whether it's a worthwhile decision. And there's certainly a learning curve that comes with using a phone with such an irregular design compared too your typical smartphone.</p><p>At this stage, foldable phones are still best-suited for early adopters that don't mind spending a lot of money up front and taking the risks that come with buying a product that might be a little ahead of its time. Foldable phones are still in their awkward teen phase so to speak: phone makers still need some time to work out the growing pains.&#160;&#160;</p><p>But even after just a day with it, the Galaxy Z Fold 2 gives me confidence that things will progress quickly. It addresses some of the original Fold's biggest setbacks, particularly when it comes to the size of its cover screen and durability. Samsung claims the new sweeper hinge will keep dust and debris from damaging the device, as was the case with the first Galaxy Fold.&#160;</p><p>Here's a look at some of the aspects about the Galaxy Z Fold 2 that immediately stood out to me.&#160;</p>\n<div id=\"slideshow\">\n\tThe Galaxy Z Fold 2 has an improved design with bigger cover screen.\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f524cf07ed0ee001e25d805?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 Cover Screen\" height=\"3024\" width=\"4032\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Lisa Eadicicco/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>Compared to the original Galaxy Fold, there are several improvements when it comes to design.</p><p>Among the biggest is the significantly larger cover screen on the front of the device. The Galaxy Z Fold 2's front screen measures 6.2 inches, making it roughly the same size as the display on the Galaxy S20 (although the Z Fold 2's screen is noticeably narrower).</p><p>That's a major upgrade compared to the 4.6-inch cover display on the original Galaxy Fold, which felt too cramped and tiny to actually be useful.</p><p>I've actually been using the front screen on the Galaxy Z Fold 2 to quickly check Slack messages and send text messages &#8212; basic tasks that were difficult or impossible on the older Fold's tiny front screen.&#160;</p>\n\tThe crease is also much less noticeable.\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f524d157ed0ee001e25d808?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 Open Apps\" height=\"3024\" width=\"4032\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Lisa Eadicicco/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>The other aspect of the Galaxy Z Fold 2's design that stood out to me was how subtle the crease in the middle of the display seemed compared with last year's version.</p><p>When I reviewed the Galaxy Fold in April 2019, I wrote that the crease was noticeable when performing everyday tasks like reading a news article, checking social media, and sifting through my email inbox. The crease may seem apparent in the image above, and it's not completely invisible, but it's still much less intrusive in everyday use compared to last year's model.</p><p>That's important because the whole appeal of a foldable device like the Galaxy Z Fold is its larger, tablet-sized screen. A less noticeable crease makes the Galaxy Z Flip all the more useful in this mode when unfolded.&#160;</p>\n\tBut it's still heavier than your average phone — and very thick.\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f524d757ed0ee001e25d80a?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 Thickness\" height=\"3024\" width=\"4032\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The iPhone 11 Pro beneath the Galaxy Z Fold 2.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Lisa Eadicicco/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>The Galaxy Z Fold 2 isn't for those who frequently stuff their phone into a tight jeans pocket or a small purse. When folded, the Galaxy Z Fold 2 is essentially as thick as two phones stacked on top of one another, making it difficult to fit in tight spaces.</p><p>The device's thickness also generally takes some getting used to when holding the device while closed in one hand. Its larger size also means its heavier than your average smartphone; the Galaxy Z Fold 2 weighs 282 grams, while the Galaxy S20 weighs 163 grams. The iPhone 11 Pro, which is pictured underneath the Galaxy Z Fold 2 above, only weighs 188 grams by comparison.</p>\n\tFlex Mode makes the Galaxy Z Fold 2 more useful as a camera.\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f524dd87ed0ee001e25d80e?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 Camera\" height=\"3024\" width=\"4032\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Lisa Eadicicco/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>When I tried the Galaxy Z Flip earlier this year, one of my favorite things about it was its ability to stay propped open halfway, with the bottom half of the phone propping it up like a tripod.</p><p>Thankfully, the Galaxy Z Fold 2 has inherited this feature. Launching the camera and opening the phone horizontally will prompt the device to display the camera viewfinder on the top half of the screen. The bottom half houses camera controls like the shutter button and the most recent photo from your camera roll.&#160;</p><p>If you've ever scrambled to prop your phone up on a nearby surface when trying to take a group photo with friends or family, I imagine you'll appreciate the Galaxy Z Fold's ability to keep its camera upright on its own.</p>\n\tIts speakers are louder than I've heard on any phone.\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f524e9ae6ff30001d4e717c?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 Speakers\" height=\"3024\" width=\"4032\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Lisa Eadicicco/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>The Galaxy Z Fold 2's stereo speakers are plenty loud and boisterous &#8212; a must for a large-screened device like this that was likely designed with entertainment in mind.</p><p>The phone's speakers sounded impressively crisp with the volume cranked all the way up, pumping out tunes that sounded much clearer and more powerful compared to the iPhone 11 Pro Max's. Apple's high-end iPhone sounded shallower in comparison, and wasn't quite as loud.&#160;</p>\n\tOverall, the Galaxy Z Fold 2 feels like exactly what Samsung wanted the original Fold to be.\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f524e3ee6ff30001d4e717a?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 back\" height=\"3024\" width=\"4032\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Lisa Eadicicco/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>Samsung didn't need to rush out the original Galaxy Fold in 2019 to beat its rivals. The Galaxy Z Fold 2 is still one of only a few foldable phones on the market, and it feels much more like a finished product that's ready for consumers, unlike the original Fold.</p><p>The debacle that occurred with Samsung's first foldable phone also means it's already learned from its mistakes and has been able to iterate at a time when other major players like Google and Apple have yet to announce plans to launch a foldable phone.</p><p>But at $2,000, the Galaxy Z Fold 2 is likely going to be a tough sell for most people, especially coming at a time when the coronavirus pandemic has hammered the economy and put many people out of work.&#160;</p><p>The Galaxy Z Fold 2 is evidence that tech giants like Samsung are continuing to think about the evolution of the modern smartphone. It will be quite some time before foldable phones replace the sleek rectangles we carry around today &#8212; if they every do at all &#8212; but the Z Fold 2 is certainly another step in that direction.</p>\n</div><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-best-features-new-foldable-phone-2020-9'>Business

cyberattack that crashed the Miami-Dade County Public Schools' online learning platform during the first week of classes, the school district <a href=\"http://news.dadeschools.net/cmnc/new/30657\">said</a> Thursday.</p><p>The district began its first day of online classes on Monday, with all students signing on remotely. But almost immediately, classes were disrupted when students encountered glitches that made it difficult to log on to the district's remote learning platform. Those issues stretched on for days, according to the Miami Palmetto Senior High <a href=\"https://www.thepalmettopanther.com/mdcps-virtual-reopening-hit-by-cyber-attacks/\">school paper</a>.</p><p>By Thursday, one student was arrested and admitted to orchestrating eight distributed denial-of-service, or DDoS, attacks that flooded the district networks and blocked students from logging in, the district said in a statement. The attacks ceased after the 16-year-old student was arrested, <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/education/article245461020.html\">The Miami Herald</a> reported.</p><p>But Miami-Dade Schools Police said they believe other culprits committed separate cyberattacks against the district as well.</p><p>\"We believe, based upon our investigation, that other attackers are out there. We will not rest until every one of them is caught and brought to justice. ... Our message to anyone thinking of attempting a criminal act like this is to think twice. We will find you,\" MDSPD Chief Edwin Lopez said in a <a href=\"http://news.dadeschools.net/cmnc/new/30657\">statement</a>.</p><p>The episode illustrates one of the many unexpected challenges that schools are facing as they start fully-remote learning for the first time.</p><p>Districts typically rely on a single platform for their online learning, and when those platforms are compromised, classes are thrown into chaos. Schools across the US faced similar roadblocks last week, when both Zoom and the online-learning platform Canvas <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/canvas-down-instructure-outage-remote-learning-schools-2020-8\">crashed</a> amid a surge in users logging on for their first day of school.</p><p>The cyberattacks in Miami targeted <a href=\"https://www.k12.com/\">K12</a>, an online learning product that the school uses for remote classes. K12's data was not compromised in the attack, but the school district is now weighing whether to maintain its $15 million contract with K12, a spokesperson told <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/education/article245434515.html\">The New York Times</a>.</p><p>DDoS attacks against school districts have spiked in the past year, according to a <a href=\"https://securelist.com/digital-education-the-cyberrisks-of-the-online-classroom/98380/\">report</a> published by cybersecurity firm Kaspersky on Friday. The firm noted a 350% increase in DDoS attacks against online educational resources between January and June compared to the same period last year, affecting more than than 168,000 users in 2020.&#160;</p><p><em><strong>Are you attending online classes or working remotely for the first time?

$30 fee to watch. \"Mulan\" will become available to all Disney Plus subscribers on December 4.</p><p>The latest trailer for the film showcases significant departures from the animated \"Mulan\" released in 1998, including a new witch character named Xian Lang and choreographed action scenes that exceed the imagination of the original film.</p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bJbAZh3fv0g\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>While 1998's \"Mulan\" was a family comedy with musical numbers and comedic characters, like the talking dragon Mushu voiced by Eddie Murphy, the new film is rated PG-13 and strikes a more serious tone. Also, unlike Disney's recent live-action remakes of \"Aladdin\" and \"The Lion King,\" the new \"Mulan\" doesn't feature any musical performances from the cast.</p><p>The new film doesn't adopt the songs and musical stylings of the original, but the soundtrack does feature a new version of the song \"Reflection\" updated by the original artist, Christina Aguilera. \"Reflection\" was one of the first singles of Aguilera's career, and she's produced another song called \"Loyal Brave True\" for the new film's soundtrack as well.</p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qo8gX1Evay8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>\"Mulan\" was originally intended for a theatrical release and even had a Hollywood premiere event in March before the coronavirus pandemic forced theaters around the world to close. Now, the film led by Liu Yifei, Donnie Yen and Jet Li will be available online via <a href=\"https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/196318/564546/9358?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Disney Plus</a>, while countries where theaters have re-opened will still have the option for a theatrical release.</p><p>\"Mulan\" isn't the first Disney movie to find its way to Disney Plus after COVID-19 caused theaters across the United States to close, but it's the first to require an additional payment beyond the subscription fee. <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/pixar-movies-on-disney-plus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pixar's \"Onward\"</a> was also fast-tracked to Disney Plus in March after its theater run was cut short by the coronavirus. <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-watch-artemis-fowl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\"Artemis Fowl\"</a> was scheduled to hit theaters in May but premiered on Disney Plus in June with disappointing reviews.</p><p>Marvel's \"Black Widow\" was due out in May but Disney has yet to reveal its plans for Scarlett Johansson's superhero film.&#160;<a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/disney-plus-60-5-million-paid-subscribers-1234725409/\">According to Variety,</a> Disney CEO Bob Chapek said the release of \"Mulan\" on Disney Plus is a special situation, rather than the company adopting a new business model.&#160;</p><p><em>Updated on 9/4/2020 by Kevin Webb: The language in this article has been updated to coincide with the release of \"Mulan\" on Disney Plus.</em></p><h2>How to watch 'Mulan' on Disney Plus</h2><p>\"Mulan\" is available now on Disney Plus. To watch, you'll need a monthly or annual <a href=\"https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/196318/564546/9358?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Disney Plus subscription</a>&#160;and you'll have to pay the $29.99 \"Premier Access\" fee. With that said, \"Mulan\" is <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/mulan-purchase-on-disney-wont-be-one-time-rental-2020-8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">not a one-time rental</a>. Instead, once purchased, Disney Plus members will continue to have access to \"Mulan\" for as long as they remain a subscriber.</p><p>The Premier Access purchase option will be available through November 2. \"Mulan\" will then be available to stream for all Disney Plus subscribers without an extra fee starting December 4. Streaming via <a href=\"https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/196318/564546/9358?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Disney Plus</a> will be the only way to watch \"Mulan\" since it wont be released in theaters in the United States and it's not yet available on Blu-ray.&#160;&#160;</p><p>If you're interested in watching Disney's earlier interpretation of the Mulan story, the animated version of \"Mulan\" is already available on Disney Plus for all subscribers.</p><h2><strong>What is Disney Plus and how does it work?</strong></h2><p><a href=\"https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/196318/564546/9358?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Disney Plus</a> is a subscription streaming platform with on-demand access to Disney's iconic library of movies and TV shows. Along with \"Mulan,\" \"Toy Story 4,\" \"Frozen 2\"&#160; and Disney's other latest theater releases, you'll find classic franchises like <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/star-wars-disney-plus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\"Star Wars,\"</a> \"The Simpsons\" and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/marvel-disney-plus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Marvel's \"Avengers.\"</a></p><p>A monthly subscription costs $6.99 per month while an annual subscription gives a small discount at $69.99 per year. Those looking for additional streaming content can sign up for a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/disney-plus-bundle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bundle with Disney Plus, ESPN+ and Hulu</a>. The bundle costs $12.99 per month, which is about $5 less per month than it would cost to subscribe to each service separately.</p><p><a href=\"https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/196318/564546/9358?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Disney Plus</a> is available to stream on Apple, PC, iOS, and Android devices, Xbox One and PlayStation 4, and streaming devices from Amazon, Roku, and Chromecast. Disney Plus is also supported on smart TVs, including those from Samsung, LG, Sony, and Vizio. An internet connection is necessary to stream, but Disney Plus does provide an option to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/disney-plus-app\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">download movies</a> and shows for offline viewing</p><p>All Disney Plus subscriptions include ad-free streaming and unlimited downloads for a growing library of films and TV series. Disney Plus supports up to 4K resolution video on select titles, as well as <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-hdr-tv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dolby Vision HDR</a> and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-dolby-atmos\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dolby Atmos audio</a> with applicable devices.&#160;</p><h2>What other brand-new movies can I rent at home?</h2><p>Disney isn't the only movie studio to make its planned theatrical releases available on streaming services. Universal Studios debuted <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=35871X943606&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vudu.com%2Fcontent%2Fmovies%2Fdetails%2FTrolls-World-Tour%2F1398601&xcust=1596724177206au1caup87|xid:fr1596724181289iej81289iej\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">\"Trolls World Tour\"</a> as premium rental on multiple services for $20. Following the film's success, Universal announced a new deal to bring future theatrical releases to streaming services less than a month after they reach theaters.</p><p>At $29.99, \"Mulan\" will cost $10 more than \"Trolls World Tour\" before including the cost of a Disney Plus subscription. During the company's most recent earnings report Disney announced that Disney Plus now has more than 60 million subscribers worldwide. However, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/disney-plus-60-million-subscribers-arpu-lagging-netflix-hulu-2020-8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Disney Plus isn't earning nearly as much money per subscriber as Netflix,</a> its top competitor, and the company has suffered <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-impact-on-disney-parks-finances-balance-sheet-florida-2020-7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">heavy losses in its live entertainment and theme park business due to the pandemic.</a></p><p>Other studios, like Sony, Lionsgate, Paramount, and Warner Brothers, have also been offering streaming rental or purchase options for select titles that were originally planned for theaters. \"In-theater\" digital rentals or purchases can be made through a variety of services, including <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/storefront/?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=biipf_042420_how-to-rent-streaming-movies-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=2ab9e4b66c33435d32d1bea75f73264f&camp=1789&creative=9325p=1789&#38;creative=9325\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"40\" data-amzn-asin=\"storefront\" data-ml-dynamic=\"true\" data-ml-dynamic-type=\"sl\" data-orig-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/storefront/?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=biipf_042420_how-to-rent-streaming-movies-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=2ab9e4b66c33435d32d1bea75f73264f&camp=1789&creative=9325p=1789&#38;creative=9325\" data-ml-id=\"19\" data-ml=\"true\" data-xid=\"fr1596723821964aii\" data-skimlinks-tracking=\"xid:fr1596723821964aii\">Amazon Prime Video</a>,&#160;<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=35871X943606&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fapple-tv-app%2F&xcust=1596723818464a0vui448s|xid:fr1596723821964ccf21964ccf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"40\" data-orig-url=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=35871X943606&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fapple-tv-app%2F&xcust=1596723818464a0vui448s0vui448s\" data-ml-id=\"20\" data-ml=\"true\" data-xid=\"fr1596723821964ccf\">Apple TV</a>,&#160;<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=35871X943606&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vudu.com%2Fcontent%2Fmovies%2Fuxrow%2FTheater-At-Home-Premium-Early-%2F5558&xcust=1596723818464avxaxpd2n|xid:fr1596723821964fhe21964fhe\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"40\" data-orig-url=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=35871X943606&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vudu.com%2Fcontent%2Fmovies%2Fuxrow%2FTheater-At-Home-Premium-Early-%2F5558&xcust=1596723818464avxaxpd2nvxaxpd2n\" data-ml-id=\"21\" data-ml=\"true\" data-xid=\"fr1596723821964fhe\">Vudu</a>,&#160;<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=35871X943606&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fandangonow.com%2Flist%2Fmore-movies-direct-from-theaters&xcust=1596723818464af9hl27ny|xid:fr1596723821964abf21964abf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"40\" data-orig-url=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=35871X943606&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fandangonow.com%2Flist%2Fmore-movies-direct-from-theaters&xcust=1596723818464af9hl27nyf9hl27ny\" data-ml-id=\"22\" data-ml=\"true\" data-xid=\"fr1596723821964abf\">FandangoNow</a>, and&#160;<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/movies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"40\">Google Play</a>.

target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">iPhone 7 Plus</a>, it was the first smartphone to mimic the effect of taking a portrait with shallow depth of field, like you can with a professional SLR camera.&#160;</p><p>Now, many iPhone models let you take portraits with this feature. Your iPhone needs at least two camera lenses since it's taking two separate photos (one of the subject and another of the background) and combining them using artificial intelligence.&#160;</p><h2><strong>Which iPhones can use Portrait mode</strong></h2><p>You can find Portrait mode in the Camera app on many iPhones. Here is the list of compatible devices right now:</p><ul><li>iPhone 7 Plus</li><li>iPhone 8 Plus</li><li>iPhone X, iPhone XR, iPhone XS, and iPhone XS Max</li><li>iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max</li><li>iPhone SE (2nd generation, 2020)</li></ul><p>If you have an iPhone X or later, you can also use Portrait mode to take a selfie.&#160;</p><h2><strong>How to use Portrait mode on iPhone</strong></h2><p><strong>1.</strong> Start the Camera app and then tap or swipe in the menu at the bottom of the screen to choose \"Portrait.\"</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Wait until the lighting mode turns yellow to indicate it's ready for you to take the shot. The default lighting mode is Natural Light, though you can swipe through the other options. No matter which one you choose, wait for it to turn yellow.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f512fae7ed0ee001e25d50c?format=jpeg\" alt=\"ios13 iphone11 pro camera portrait lighting 1\" height=\"1602\" width=\"800\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Select the lighting mode you want to use in your portrait and wait for it to turn yellow before taking the photo.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Apple</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p><strong>3.</strong> If you have an iPhone X or later, you can switch to the front camera to take a selfie.&#160;</p><p><strong>4.</strong> Tap the circular Shutter button to take the picture.&#160;</p><p>If you don't have enough light, or there isn't enough contrast between the subject and background, the Camera app might display a message at the top of the screen with advice on how to change your composition.&#160;</p><h2><strong>How to adjust the depth of field in a Portrait photo</strong></h2><p>The magic ingredient in a Portrait mode photo is the ability to have an out-of-focus background with a razor-sharp subject. With an SLR camera, you'd get this effect by using an aperture with a small f-number, like f2 or f4. The iPhone lets you adjust the aperture after the fact.&#160;</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Start the Photos app and find the Portrait mode photo you want to edit.&#160;</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Tap \"Edit\" in the upper right corner of the screen.&#160;</p><p><strong>3.</strong> At the top left of the screen you should see the f-number associated with the photo. Tap it.&#160;</p><p><strong>4.</strong> At the bottom of the photo, you should see a slider with all the available f-numbers for the photo. Swipe to the left or right and watch how the background changes. Smaller f-numbers will make the background blurrier, while larger numbers make it sharper.&#160;</p><p><strong>5.</strong> When you're satisfied, tap \"Done.\" You can return to this screen and change the depth of field at any time.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f513096e6ff30001d4e6ea1?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Apple iphone portrait mode edit\" height=\"1600\" width=\"800\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>You can &#34;dial in&#34; the photo&#39;s depth of field after it&#39;s taken.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Apple</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h2><strong>How to turn off Portrait mode in a photo</strong></h2><p>It's easy to remove the portrait effect from a photo. In fact, you can toggle it on and off at any time.&#160;</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Start the Photos app and find the Portrait mode photo you want to edit.&#160;</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Tap \"Edit\" in the upper right corner of the screen.&#160;</p><p><strong>3.</strong> At the top of the screen you should see the label \"Portrait.\" To turn off Portrait mode, tap it, and it will turn into white text on a black background.

And it's not because America's small corporations are sitting tight and riding out the storm (the plaque thing again). In the electric and autonomous vehicle space alone, six companies have gone public or announced plans to do so in the past few months. They've just taken a new route to the public market.</p><p>Electrified-vehicle makers Nikola, Fisker, Lordstown Motors, and Canoo are all going public via a reverse merger with a special-purpose acquisition company. Those entities, better known as SPACs, raise money, go public, and buy another company, which then becomes publicly traded as well.&#160;</p><p>It's not just upstart automakers giving this a go. The CEO of lidar company Luminar, Austin Russell, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/luminar-ceo-changed-mind-ipo-pandemic-nikola-fisker-2020-8\">opted for a reverse merger</a> after watching Nikola do it — and sold his business in <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/25-year-old-sells-startup-founded-high-school-34-billion-2020-8\">a $3.4 billion deal</a>. Solid-state battery venture Quantumscape, which is backed by Volkswagen, <a href=\"https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1129497_vw-backed-solid-state-battery-firm-quantumscape-is-going-public\">declared</a> it's following suit on Thursday.</p><p>Russell hesitated to take this route with Luminar — reverse mergers have long been derided as \"second-rate deals,\" <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/luminar-ceo-changed-mind-ipo-pandemic-nikola-fisker-2020-8\">he told us</a>. But as the trend picked up adherents, he took another look and bought into the idea that <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/nikola-fisker-canoo-rejecting-method-tesla-uber-ipo-2020-9\">going with a SPAC isn't just faster and more convenient</a> than a traditional IPO —&#160;it's a great way to accrue some credibility to a company that has just barely started to pull in revenue.&#160;</p><p>Read on below for our investigation of the SPAC craze, and for plenty of other news from the world of transportation.

much of our time on the job. And amid the coronavirus pandemic, when millions of workers are working from home and corresponding by email, it's probably taking up even up more time than usual.&#160;</p><p>Since more Americans began working from home amid the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-long-burn-not-seasonal-waves-2020-7\">coronavirus pandemic</a>, workers are sending out more emails and spending more time at work, per the <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w27612.pdf?utm_source=morning_brew\">National Bureau of Economic Research</a>.</p><p>Despite the fact that we're sending so many emails, <a href=\"http://www.pachter.com/\">career coach Barbara Pachter</a> said plenty of professionals still don't know how to write them properly.</p><p>Because of the sheer volume of messages we're reading and writing, we may be more prone to making embarrassing errors, and those mistakes can have serious consequences.</p><p>Pachter outlines the basics of modern email etiquette in her book \"<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/The-Essentials-Business-Etiquette-Success/dp/0071811265\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Essentials of Business Etiquette</a>.\" We pulled out the most essential rules you need to know.</p><p><em>Jacquelyn Smith, Caroline Hroncich, Vivian Giang, and Rachel Sugar contributed to earlier versions of this article.</em></p>\n<div id=\"slideshow\">\n\tInclude a clear, direct subject line.\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5dfd448a855cc240c338171b?format=jpeg\" alt=\"laptop working finances\" height=\"999\" width=\"1332\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>People decide if they want to read your email just based on the subject line.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Maskot/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>Examples of a good subject line include \"Meeting date changed,\" \"Quick question about your presentation,\" or \"Suggestions for the proposal.\"</p><p>\"People often decide whether to open an email based on the subject line,\" Pachter said. \"Choose one that lets readers know you are addressing their concerns or business issues.\"</p>\n\tUse a professional email address.\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5d8b8d832e22af33af79dff8?format=jpeg\" alt=\"person working on computer\" height=\"5269\" width=\"7026\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Never use email addresses that are not appropriate for use in the workplace.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of eclipse_images/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>If you work for a company, you should use your company email address. But if you use a personal email account &#8212; whether you are self-employed or just like using it occasionally for work-related correspondences &#8212; you should be careful when choosing that address, Pachter said.</p><p>You should always have an email address that conveys your name so that the recipient knows exactly who is sending the email. Never use email addresses (perhaps remnants of your grade-school days) that are not appropriate for use in the workplace, such as \"babygirl@...\" or \"beerlover@...\" &#8212; no matter how much you love a cold brew.</p>\n\tThink twice before hitting 'reply all.'\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/54073c8169bedd893e5326f0?format=jpeg\" alt=\"laptops\" height=\"1990\" width=\"2654\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Refrain from hitting reply all.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Reuters/Lucas Jackson</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>No one wants to read emails from 20 people that have nothing to do with them. Ignoring the emails can be difficult, with many workers getting notifications of new messages on their smartphones or distracting pop-up messages on their computer screens. Refrain from hitting \"reply all\" unless you really think everyone on the list needs to receive the email, Pachter said.</p>\n\tInclude a signature block.\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/56af93d5c08a80880e8be12c?format=jpeg\" alt=\"email\" height=\"611\" width=\"815\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Provide the reader with helpful information about you.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Jacquelyn Smith/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>Provide<strong>&#160;</strong>your reader with some information about you, Pachter suggested. \"Generally, this would state your full name, title, the company name, and your contact information, including a phone number. You also can add a little publicity for yourself, but don't go overboard with any sayings or artwork.\"</p><p>Use the same font, type size, and color as the rest of the email, she said.</p><p>&#160;</p>\n\tUse professional salutations.\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5cc20937b14bf46766013136?format=jpeg\" alt=\"high five\" height=\"3414\" width=\"4552\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Don&#39;t use laid back expressions.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Caiaimage/Paul Bradbury / Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>Don't use laid-back, colloquial expressions like, \"Hey you guys,\" \"Yo,\" or \"Hi folks.\"</p><p>\"The relaxed nature of our writings should not affect the salutation in an email,\" she said. \"<em>Hey</em> is a very informal salutation and generally it should not be used in the workplace. And <em>Yo</em> is not OK either. Use <em>Hi</em> or <em>Hello</em> instead.\"</p><p>She also advises against shortening anyone's name. Say \"Hi Michael,\" unless you're certain he prefers to be called \"Mike.\"</p>\n\tUse exclamation points sparingly.\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5a6a0dfecf84101c008b46fa?format=jpeg\" alt=\"woman computer laptop working\" height=\"667\" width=\"889\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Don&#39;t use more than one exclamation point.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Lazarenko Svetlana/Shutterstock</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>If you choose to use an exclamation point, use only one to convey excitement, Pachter said.</p><p>\"People sometimes get carried away and put a number of exclamation points at the end of their sentences. The result can appear too emotional or immature,\" she wrote. \"Exclamation points should be used sparingly in writing.\"&#160;</p>\n\tBe cautious with humor.\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5d5d2aaccd978412d40162a2?format=jpeg\" alt=\"laughing at work\" height=\"766\" width=\"1021\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Try to avoid humor in professional emails.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Getty</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>Humor can easily get lost in translation without the right tone or facial expressions. In a professional exchange, it's better to leave humor out of emails unless you know the recipient well. Also, something that you think is funny might not be funny to someone else.</p><p>Pachter said: \"Something perceived as funny when spoken may come across very differently when written. When in doubt, leave it out.\"</p>\n\tKnow that people from different cultures speak and write differently.\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/56af8eaa58c3231a008b6dbc?format=jpeg\" alt=\"globe world earth\" height=\"1498\" width=\"1997\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Miscommunication may occur because of cultural differences.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Kieran Doherty/Reuters</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>Miscommunication can easily occur because of <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/etiquette-differences-between-japan-and-us-2018-6\">cultural differences</a>, especially in the writing form when we can't see one another's body language. Tailor your message to the receiver's cultural background or how well you know them.</p><p>A good rule to keep in mind, Pachter said, is that high-context cultures (Japanese, Arab, or Chinese) want to get to know you before doing business with you. Therefore, it may be common for business associates from these countries to be more personal in their writings. On the other hand, people from low-context cultures (German, American, or Scandinavia) prefer to get to the point very quickly.</p>\n\tReply to your emails — even if the email wasn't intended for you.\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/540738e66bb3f75c29fded30?format=jpeg\" alt=\"laptop guy working\" height=\"1779\" width=\"2372\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Try to respond to all of the emails you receive.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Adam Berry/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>It's difficult to reply to every email message ever sent to you, but you should try to, Pachter said. This includes when the email was accidentally sent to you, especially if the sender is expecting a reply. A reply isn't necessary but serves as good email etiquette, especially if this person works in the same company or industry as you.</p><p>Here's an example reply: \"I know you're very&#160;busy, but I don't think you meant to send this email to me. And I&#160;wanted to let you know so you can send it to the correct person.\"</p>\n\tProofread every message.\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5a14a5233dbef4cf008b79c6?format=jpeg\" alt=\"woman looking at computer screen\" height=\"3115\" width=\"4153\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Don&#39;t just rely on spell check.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Francois Mori/AP</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>Your mistakes won't go unnoticed by the recipients of your email. \"And, depending upon the recipient, you may be judged for making them,\" Pachter said.</p><p>Don't rely on spell-check. Read and reread your email a few times, preferably aloud, before sending it off.</p><p>\"One supervisor intended to write 'Sorry for the inconvenience,'\" Pachter said. \"But he relied on his spell-check and ended up writing 'Sorry for the incontinence.'\"</p>\n\tAdd the email address last.\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5c9e3819c6cc502b272d6613?format=jpeg\" alt=\"meaningful work woman looking at computer\" height=\"1414\" width=\"1885\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>This can help avoid accidentally sending an email before you have finished writing.\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/concentrated-african-american-woman-brainstorming-royalty-free-image/956379138\" target=\"_blank\">skynesher/Getty Images</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>\"You don't want to send an email accidentally before you have finished writing and proofing the message,\" Pachter said. \"Even when you are replying to a message, it's a good precaution to delete the recipient's address and insert it only when you are sure the message is ready to be sent.\"</p>\n\tDouble-check that you've selected the correct recipient.\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5e138aa9855cc274721affa2?format=jpeg\" alt=\"embarrassed\" height=\"800\" width=\"1067\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Pay close attention to who your emailing.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Giulio_Fornasar/Shutterstock</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>Pachter said to pay careful attention when typing a name from your address book on the email's \"To\" line. \"It's easy to select the wrong name, which can be embarrassing to you and to the person who receives the email by mistake.\"</p>\n\tKeep your fonts classic.\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5d49e3a3100a2415d5584b23?format=jpeg\" alt=\"frustrated man computer not working\" height=\"2000\" width=\"2667\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Make sure your email is easy to read.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Shutterstock</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>Purple Comic Sans has a time and a place (maybe?) but for business correspondence, keep your fonts, colors, and sizes classic.</p><p>The cardinal rule: Your emails should be easy for other people to read.</p><p>\"Generally, it is best to use 10- or 12-point type and an easy-to-read font such as Arial, Calibri, or Times New Roman,\" Pachter advised. As for color, black is the safest choice.</p>\n\tKeep tabs on your tone.\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5aea2a3519ee8624008b47db?format=jpeg\" alt=\"typing at computer woman laptop working\" height=\"1335\" width=\"1780\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Say please and thank you.\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/g/daxiao\" target=\"_blank\">Daxiao Productions/Shutterstock</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>Just as jokes get lost in translation, tone is easy to misconstrue without the context you'd get from vocal cues and facial expressions. Accordingly, it's easy to come off as more abrupt that you might have intended. You meant \"straightforward\"; they read \"angry and curt.\"</p><p>To avoid misunderstandings, Pachter recommended you read your message out loud before hitting send. \"If it sounds harsh to you, it will sound harsh to the reader,\" she said.</p><p>For best results, avoid using unequivocally negative words (\"failure,\" \"wrong,\" or \"neglected\"), and always say \"please\" and \"thank you.\"</p>\n\tNothing is confidential — so write accordingly.\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/58adbbf401fe580f018b5fac?format=jpeg\" alt=\"eyestrain stressed tired computer working\" height=\"1602\" width=\"2136\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Assume others will see what you write.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Dean Drobot/Shutterstock</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>Always remember what former former CIA Director David Petraeus apparently forgot, warns Pachter: <em>Every</em> electronic message leaves a trail.</p><p>\"A basic guideline is to assume that others will see what you write,\" she said. \"So don't write anything you wouldn't want everyone to see.\" A more liberal interpretation: Don't write anything that would be ruinous to you or hurtful to others. After all, email is dangerously easy to forward, and it's better to be safe than sorry.</p>\n</div><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

after the Covid-19 pandemic kept millions of office workers, commuters and other customers at home.&#160;&#160;</p><p>For £20 ($26.60) a month, customers can get up to five drinks a day from Pret's&#160;YourPret Barista service that launches next Tuesday.</p><p>This will be the first such drink subscription model on UK high streets, according to the company, and marks an important step in Pret's digital transformation as it adapts to a changing customer landscape.</p><p>Pret, whose dark-red fronted stores are ubiquitous in financial districts, town and city centers, as well as around train and subway stations, is introducing the service to drive demand after sales collapsed during the pandemic.</p><p>The subscription service marks a shift in focus for Pret, which is owned by German conglomerate JAB Holdings, whose brands include Krispi Kreme doughnuts, soft-drink labels Dr Pepper and Schweppes and Kenco coffee.</p><p>The outlet is a lunchtime favorite among office workers, but CEO Pano Christou said that coffee sales have risen more quickly than food sales since stores reopened in May.</p><p>The service will operate via either Apple or Google digital wallets or QR codes, which are emailed to subscribers, and will be free in its first month.</p><p>The subscription will include all barista-made coffees, teas, hot chocolates, smoothies, and frappe drinks. Customers have to wait 30 minutes between each order using the service to prevent people buying drinks wastefully or for friends without subscriptions.</p><p>Pret described the service as a \"flagship offering\" in the company's plan to turn around its finances that have been hit hard by the pandemic. The chain said last week it <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/pret-a-manger-job-cuts-third-uk-workforce-sales-slump-2020-8\">will cut around 2,800 jobs</a> in its UK stores, after weekly sales dropped to 2010 levels – when the chain had half as many branches.</p><p>Pret had previously announced that <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/pret-a-manger-cuts-1000-jobs-closes-30-locations-2020-7\">30 of its 440 UK stores would close</a> by 2021, after sales fell by 74% in the period from March to late June this year, compared to 2019.</p><p>However, sales have grown by an average of 7% each week since July, helped by the UK government's <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/eat-out-to-help-out-costs-uk-567-million-2020-9\">Eat Out to Help Out scheme</a> which offered diners half-price meals in August.</p><div

Peloton CEO John Foley first hinted at a forthcoming <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/peloton-considers-cheaper-version-of-bike-to-grow-customer-base-2020-5\">cheaper bike option in May</a> as part of an effort to democratize its high-tech fitness products and reach new consumers.&#160;</p><p>\"We want to make our products even more affordable than they are today,\" Foley said in an <a href=\"https://time.com/5839552/peloton-ceo-john-foley/\">interview with Time</a>. \"If we can get those monthly payments down, we can really open it up. And we want everyone in every socioeconomic class to be able to afford Peloton. That's a big focus for us in the coming years,\" he said.&#160;</p><p>Bloomberg's sources divulged that both Bike+ and the less expensive Tread will feature more adjustable tablet screens than previous models. The flexibility of the screens will allow for users to also do mat and strength training workouts near the machine, as the company prepares to add additional streaming workout classes, the sources said.&#160;</p><p>In response to Business Insider's request to comment, Peloton said \"we can't comment on rumors and have nothing to announce.\" However, Bloomberg anticipates the company may announce the products next week, in advance of its quarterly earnings call on September 10.</p><p>Peloton has experienced a significant uptick in demand during the pandemic as Americans seek out at-home fitness options like stationary bikes. The company's sales in the first quarter of 2020 <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/peloton-customers-complain-delays-cancellations-during-lockdown-2020-6\">increased by 66%</a> and subscribers to the Peloton app jumped by 94%.</p><p>Though Peloton announced in June that it was increasing production to meet overwhelming demand that prompted significant delays and last-minute cancellations, its bikes still remain on weeks-long backorder.&#160;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/peloton-is-reportedly-launching-cheaper-treadmill-and-a-premium-bike-2020-9'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=8xfcrXGSFvg:S3PFj-ZsPF4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=8xfcrXGSFvg:S3PFj-ZsPF4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=8xfcrXGSFvg:S3PFj-ZsPF4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=8xfcrXGSFvg:S3PFj-ZsPF4:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=8xfcrXGSFvg:S3PFj-ZsPF4:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=8xfcrXGSFvg:S3PFj-ZsPF4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=8xfcrXGSFvg:S3PFj-ZsPF4:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=8xfcrXGSFvg:S3PFj-ZsPF4:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/8xfcrXGSFvg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 04 Sep 2020 15:41:11 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f524a93e6ff30001d4e714a?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"0d5851ddee99421e02aab6fb5173f2c3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn35@2020_2/2020/09/04/16-37-13-983_42972eb24cad80bd.webp","destWidth":1468,"destHeight":1101,"sourceBytes":76040,"destBytes":76040,"author":"insider@insider.com (Bethany Biron)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5f524a93e6ff30001d4e714a?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn35@2020_2/2020/09/04/16-37-13-983_42972eb24cad80bd.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn3@2020_1/2020/09/04/16-38-03-978_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=8xfcrXGSFvg:S3PFj-ZsPF4:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn27@2020_3/2020/09/04/16-37-34-170_fc7101ffde211267.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=8xfcrXGSFvg:S3PFj-ZsPF4:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn15@2020_1/2020/09/04/16-38-04-900_0a955c5e233e6ac1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn24@2020_6/2020/09/04/16-37-59-085_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=8xfcrXGSFvg:S3PFj-ZsPF4:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn79@2020_6/2020/09/04/16-37-35-895_7efceee5a38a66bc.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/8xfcrXGSFvg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn15@2020_5/2020/09/04/16-38-01-025_97e892f53a8ab8d8.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599237433603},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 00:37:13","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 00:37:13","title":"8 roles parents should play if they want their kids to be successful, according to Harvard research","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/successful-children-have-parents-who-play-8-roles-harvard-researcher-2019-4","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5e4457543ac0c9698254a679?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Child and parent\" height=\"1414\" width=\"1885\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The &#39;early learning partner&#39;

The 'early learning partner'\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5cf7c6be11e2050d5d6e1d68?format=jpeg\" alt=\"parent child gift\" height=\"644\" width=\"859\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Get kids interested in learning before they start school.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Shutterstock</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>This role has parents getting their child interested in learning at a young age, before they start school. Ferguson calls the early learning partner the most important role of the eight. The most successful kids can&#160;read basic words by kindergarten, and experience what Ferguson calls \"the early lead effect,\" where the child responds positively to a teacher's excitement that they can&#160;already read.</p>\n\t2. The 'flight engineer'\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5d04124f6fc920128d67cdd3?format=jpeg\" alt=\"father son parent child\" height=\"1998\" width=\"2664\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>There&#39;s a difference between this and a helicopter parent.\n<p class=\"copyright\">KieferPix / Shutterstock.com</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>This is the parent monitoring the child's growth environment, making sure they're getting what they need and intervening when they're not.</p><p>This isn't the same as being a helicopter parent, who Ferguson says \"are so involved in their children's lives they don't create space for them to develop independent relationships, learn how to negotiate for themselves, or identify their own interests.\" My wife and I started playing this role when we encountered a teacher that wasn't giving our daughter a fair shake.</p>\n\t3. The 'fixer'\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5d3ed9628d66424e595ed2b4?format=jpeg\" alt=\"parent child high five\" height=\"627\" width=\"836\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>They don&#39;t let a lack of resource get in their way.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Rawpixel.com/Shutterstock</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>In this role, the parent ensures no key opportunity for their child's betterment is lost &#8212; and they don't let a lack of resources slow them down.</p><p>As Ferguson says, \"The parents might be living in poverty, but if they see an opportunity they judge to be essential for their child's success in school or life, they'll walk through walls to get it.\"</p>\n\t4. The 'revealer'\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/59286cb4b74af449018b4a8f?format=jpeg\" alt=\"mother child sweden parent\" height=\"750\" width=\"1000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>They help their child discover the world.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Shutterstock.com</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>Revealer parents help their child discover the world by going to museums, libraries, exhibits, etc. &#8212; anything to expand their worldview. Again, this happens even with a lack of resources; revealer parents get creative in how to accommodate such outings. My wife and I have given this one extra focus, since we're fans of experiences over things.</p>\n\t5. The 'philosopher'\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5a21c74e3dbef4ae078b992d?format=jpeg\" alt=\"dad daughter parent kid child\" height=\"667\" width=\"889\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>This role helps kids find purpose.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Dina Uretski/Shutterstock.com</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>Ferguson says this is the second most important role, because it helps children find purpose. Here, the parents ask and answer deep life questions, never underestimating a child's capacity to understand life and grasp the idea of meaning. I've been astonished at how early my daughter grasped these big ideas.</p>\n\t6. The 'model'\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5baa687227ca74a05c8b4567?format=jpeg\" alt=\"parent mother daughter child teen parenting communication\" height=\"1914\" width=\"2552\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>They embody the values that are important to them.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Monkey Business Images/Shutterstock</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>This is classic role-modeling. Parents who do this well are clear about which values are important to them and work hard to pass those values on to their children, who then aspire to emulate them. My wife and I try to live our core values each day &#8212; but that doesn't mean it comes easy, or that we always succeed.</p>\n\t7. The 'negotiator'\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5cb64be0d2ce785ca6712667?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Mom son child talking to kid\" height=\"664\" width=\"885\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>This teaches kids to stand up for themselves — respectfully.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Ivan Marjanovic/Shutterstock</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>This role teaches the child to be respectful while standing up for themselves and what they believe in (especially in the face of those with power and authority).</p>\n\t8. The 'GPS navigational voice'\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5c98f7ef2cc74048ea0763c8?format=jpeg\" alt=\"adult child with parent\" height=\"1141\" width=\"1522\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>This is the parents&#39; voice staying in the child&#39;s head, even when they&#39;ve left home.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Betsie Van Der Meer/Getty</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>Ferguson described this as, \"The parents' voice in the child's head after the child has left home, coaching the young adult through new situations in life.\" I can only hope our daughter's GPS never says \"recalculating,\" given the work we've done to try and keep it on course.</p><p>Reassuringly, the Harvard researcher said that the most important quality for parents to exhibit as they wear these different hats is simply the determination to be a great parent. He calls this motivation \"the burn,\" and says it often comes out of things in the parents' histories:</p><blockquote><p><em>It could be something that went wrong in their own childhoods that they didn't want repeated for their own children. It could be a family legacy of excellence in some domain that they felt a responsibility to pass on to their offspring. Or some commitment that the family had, for example, to civil rights, that they wanted their children to honor. But each of these parents had a vision of the kind of person they wanted their children to become. That vision, along with the burn, guided and inspired their parenting.</em></p></blockquote><p>So whatever your \"burn\" is, use it to play these eight roles well. None of the roles are always easy, but all of them are important for giving your child every chance to succeed.</p><p><em>This Inc. story was originally published on Business Insider April 30,

Today, the site boasts over two million private homes in over 190 countries.</p><p>While <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/https://www.homeaway.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">HomeAway</a>&#160;and <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/https://www.vrbo.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Vbro</a> used to be separately branded sites that shared the same listings and were both run by Expedia Group, as of July 2020 <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/airbnb-vrbo-homeaway\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HomeAway has been entirely folded into Vrbo</a>. Users familiar with HomeAway will find a very similar feel and style on Vrbo and the listings are the same as those previously offered on HomeAway.&#160;</p><p>For those more familiar with <a href=\"https://airbnb.pvxt.net/c/196318/264339/4273?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.airbnb.com%2Frooms%2F31024214%3Fsource_impression_id%3Dp3_1592944059_Wn5dMzPtWKXzifSI%26guests%3D1%26adults%3D1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Airbnb</a>, <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/https://www.vrbo.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Vrbo</a> has many similarities, but there are a few key differences when it comes down to the booking experience, service fees, and the health and safety precautions being taken to protect travelers from the novel coronavirus.</p><p>The main distinction between the two websites is that homeowners on Vrbo only rent out the whole property, which means you won't find anyone else sharing the space with you. This is unlike Airbnb where you may also book a room in a shared house. Normally, sharing a space with housemates wouldn't be a big issue if the price is right, but in the age of coronavirus, having the place to yourself is a big point for Vrbo.</p><p>This is especially true since <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/which-is-safer-airbnb-hotels-coronavirus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">experts have said that private home vacation rentals are actually safer than hotels</a> right now since there are far fewer interactions with other people.&#160;</p><h3>Read on to learn how Vrbo works.</h3><bi-shortcode id=\"table-of-contents\" class=\"mceNonEditable\" data-type=\"h2\">Table of Contents</bi-shortcode><h2>How booking on Vrbo works</h2><p>The booking experience of <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/https://www.vrbo.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Vrbo</a> is very similar to what you'd find on Airbnb and other booking platforms. You may filter by the number of bedrooms, property type, house rules, and amenities.</p><p>But, it gets a little finicky when it comes to pricing. Prices won't populate on the page unless you specifically filter by price, and unlike Airbnb, you won't know the total price of your stay until you click through to the main listing page where you can then see a breakdown of the total price and fees.&#160;</p><p>Each property is given an overall rating out of five stars and you'll be able to read reviews at the bottom of the page. If you like a place but aren't ready to commit, you can save it to a \"Trip Board\" and come back to it later.</p><p>Once you book and the homeowner accepts your booking, you'll be able to communicate directly with them about the property's details and check-in process.</p><p>Vrbo also offers a <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/https://www.vrbo.com/legal/book-with-confidence\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Book With Confidence Guarantee,</a> which provides every traveler with payment protection against fraudulent listings and access to a team of re-booking specialists. If the owner cancels at the last minute or you can't get into the house for some reason, the re-booking specialist can help you find somewhere else to stay. Bear in mind that this is not trip insurance and if you decide to cancel your trip on your own accord, you won't be refunded unless you purchase additional trip insurance.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f0376042618b90d282cb1c6?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Vrbo in Gatlinburg TN\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Vrbo</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h2>How is Vrbo different from Airbnb?</h2><p>In many ways, the experience of sorting through properties on Vrbo is exactly like Airbnb. The main distinction between the two platforms is that Vrbo is strictly for entire home rentals and you will always have the entire home to yourself. Airbnb, on the other hand, tends to emphasize hospitality and market the value of a good host, while Vrbo is strictly about the property.</p><p>In fact, hosts and travelers do not have their own profile pages like they do on Airbnb. This means you can't click through to a reviewer's profile to see whether or not they leave overly negative or positive reviews, nor can you click through to a host's profile to see the other properties they have and read the reviews on those.</p><p>However, Vrbo does have its own version of Airbnb's Superhosts, which they call Premier Partners. These are owners with a low rate of cancellations and an average guest rating above 4.5.</p><p>However, even these qualifications are not quite as strict as Airbnb where Superhosts must average a 4.8 rating to earn Superhost status. Additionally, it's more difficult to compare prices on Vrbo than on Airbnb. For many Vrbo listings, you must click through to the final listing page to see the full breakdown of costs, while Airbnb is more upfront about this information on its listings.</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/airbnb-vrbo-homeaway\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Read a full breakdown of the differences between Vrbo and Airbnb here.</a></h3><h2>What is pricing on Vrbo like?</h2><p>The pricing is very reasonable on Vrbo when you compare similar properties in the same area across rental sites.</p><p>In some cities, you can find apartments for as little as $79 per night, like this <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/https://www.vrbo.com/3633840ha?adultsCount=2&arrival=2020-09-23&departure=2020-09-2520-09-25\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">tiny house in Austin, Texas</a> or you might splurge on a unique property like a <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/https://www.vrbo.com/246204?adultsCount=2&arrival=2020-09-23&departure=2020-09-2520-09-25\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">home built by a famous architect</a> or a <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/https://www.vrbo.com/1279904?adultsCount=2&noDates=truetrue\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow nofollow noopener sponsored sponsored\">actual castle</a>.</p><p>Nightly rates will vary depending on where you're searching and the time of year, but prices are rarely lower than $50 per night or higher than $500 per night, unless it is an exceptionally large or unique home, or located in a coveted area in peak season.</p><p>A good way to judge whether or not the rate is competitive for the area is to compare the rate to nearby hotels. For example, in New York City, even shoebox-sized hotel rooms typically start at $100 per night, but on Vrbo, you can <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/https://www.vrbo.com/search/keywords:new-york-new-york-united-states-of-america?petIncluded=false\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">find some apartments for less than that</a> in all five boroughs.&#160;</p><p>Generally, the nightly cost for standard-quality listings is competitive with other listing sites like Airbnb and often cheaper than hotels. However, keep in mind that like Airbnb, the base listed price on Vbro doesn't include fees. Those fees can add up, so be sure to take that into consideration when browsing listings with a budget in mind.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f0375293ad86167fc78c948?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Luxury Castle in Arlington WA\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Vrbo</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h2>How much is the service fee on Vrbo and what does it cover?</h2><p>When you're comparing properties in the list view, you'll only see the cost per night. But when you click through the listing, Vrbo will show you the total cost of your trip based on the dates plugged in and the applicable fee and taxes.</p><p>Beneath the price, you may click \"View details\" to see how this total cost is broken down. Owners can charge varying fees for cleaning, taxes, and even pets, but the service fee will be applied by Vrbo for every booking. The owner has no control over how much the fee is and does not have the power to waive it.</p><p>According to the Vrbo, the service fee goes towards providing \"a safer and more secure booking experience coupled with 24/7 customer support throughout your trip.\" The fee is based on a sliding scale, although it is unclear how exactly they are calculated.</p><p>On some listings, it can be as low as 5% of the total rental amount, and on others, it may be as high as 12%. There's no way to avoid paying the fee on Vrbo, but if you really fall in love with a place, you may be able to find it for a lower price on another booking platform. However, you won't get the benefit of Vrbo's Book With Confidence Guarantee.</p><h2>Is Vrbo safe to book right now?</h2><p>In light of the coronavirus pandemic, Vrbo has refunded traveler fees for bookings made before March 13, 2020, but has not yet released a new cleaning policy to ensure traveler safety going forward. However, they have released <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/https://www.vrbo.com/discoveryhub/tips-and-resources/improve-performance/clean-disinfect-guidelines\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow nofollow noopener sponsored sponsored\">guidelines</a> for homeowners that encourages:</p><ul><li>Having a proactive plan to manage and minimize risks.</li><li>Implementing enhanced cleaning and disinfecting between stays.</li><li>Providing sufficient hand sanitizer and soap for guests, as well as cleaning and disinfecting products.</li></ul><p>Among listing resources to health authorities and outlining the proper way to clean the property, the information is pretty thorough — but they're just guidelines. While Vrbo encourages its owners to communicate their cleaning measures in the listing itself and with their guests, there's not much they can do to enforce or guarantee that the guidelines will be followed by hosts.</p><p>You might compare this approach to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/airbnb-new-cleaning-protocol\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Airbnb's Enhanced Cleaning Initiative</a>, which requires hosts to go through a certification program in order to be flagged as an \"enhanced\" property on the site. Additionally, Airbnb is also enforcing a 24-hour buffer period between stays for these properties, or a 72 hour buffer for homes that don't want to comply with such stringent cleaning guidelines, but still want to be promoted as safe options for guests.</p><p>Vrbo has no such badge system in place, so it's up to the travelers to look into each listing's sanitation measures before they book.</p><p>Neither booking platform can guarantee safety, but Vrbo's guidelines do mean that you must have good communication with the homeowner to properly ensure that the property will be clean and safe for your arrival. If the host does not outline their cleaning regimen in the description of the home, try to contact them directly before you pull the trigger and book.</p><p>\"When booking any type of lodging, consider how many people you'll be surrounded by, when was the last time someone stayed in that accommodation, and how is the state or city doing in regards to flattening the curve,\" said Dr. Neil Brown,&#160;<a href=\"https://www.khealth.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"40\" data-uri=\"b9fda93f12fd84caca806364ce873cdb\">K Health</a>'s chief diagnosis officer.&#160;</p><h2>What is Vrbo's cancellation policy?</h2><p>Due to the novel coronavirus, future travel plans are up in the air and many travelers are looking for flexibility when it comes to planning vacations.</p><p>While Vrbo did implement a <a href=\"https://help.vrbo.com/articles/What-can-I-do-if-my-reservation-is-affected-by-the-Coronavirus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cancellation policy in response to COVID-19</a>, the policy initially only covered bookings made before March 13, 2020, with stay dates between March 13 and June 30, 2020 that were cancelled because of governmental restrictions to travel or stays in vacation homes for leisure.&#160;</p><p>However, they have not extended the policy beyond the end of June so all new bookings are not covered by the COVID-19 cancellation policy. Instead, you'll need to check individual listings' policies, which include the following options <a href=\"https://help.vrbo.com/articles/What-are-the-cancellation-policy-options\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">according to Vrbo</a>:</p><ul><li><strong>No Refund</strong> - This is the strictest policy and means no refund is offered at all for any reason.</li><li><strong>Strict&#160;</strong>- Bookings must be canceled at least 60 days before the start of the stay to receive a full refund.</li><li><strong>Firm&#160;</strong>- Bookings canceled 60 days or more before the start of the stay will receive a full refund.

speaking is often rated the number one thing people are afraid of?</p><p>But while getting up on a stage in front of an audience can definitely be nerve wracking, many people find striking up a conversation one-on-one just as intimidating.</p><p>Maybe it's the CEO of your company, a new colleague, the guy in the mail room, the girl from IT, or a stranger in the street.</p><p>Whomever you want to talk to, there's a way to strike up a conversation. And the best news is that it gets easier with practice.</p><p>Try these conversation starters to talk to absolutely anybody:</p>\n<div id=\"slideshow\">\n\t1. Skip the small talk\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5ba251430ce5f51d008b640e?format=jpeg\" alt=\"coworkers small talk talking\" height=\"1181\" width=\"1574\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Avoid the tired topics.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Rawpixel.com/Shutterstock.com</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>\"What's up with this weather?\" and \"How 'bout them [insert local sports team]?\" are as bad as cheesy pick-up lines when it comes to starting a conversation. Avoid tired topics. Every situation is unique, so you should be able to find a unique conversation starter.</p>\n\t2. Ask for their opinion\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5d8a3f162e22af07b36dc0d2?format=jpeg\" alt=\"networking event\" height=\"4480\" width=\"5973\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Start with light topics.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of Hero Images/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>Everyone has one! For someone you don't know well, start with light subjects like the food, the music, the atmosphere, etc. \"Do you like your margaritas with salt or without? Do you watch horror movies? Do you like this song?\" It's probably best to stay away from <em>really</em> sticky subjects like politics unless you already know the person very well.</p>\n\t3. Ask for their advice or recommendations\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5dc1df507eece51a06253dc7?format=jpeg\" alt=\"friends talking eating\" height=\"1328\" width=\"1771\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Bundle it with a compliment.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Taiyou Nomachi/Digital Vision/Getty</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>This works very well when commenting on someone's outfit or accessories, as in \"What a great tie! Where did you get it?\" or on the food, as in, \"Everything looks good. What are you having?\"</p>\n\t4. Ask them a question — that's easy to answer\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5d02b3f86fc920084158c3c7?format=jpeg\" alt=\"coworkers office\" height=\"1300\" width=\"1733\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Start with an easy question.\n<p class=\"copyright\">fizkes/Shutterstock</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>This is great when you know or find out that a person has expertise in a particular field. If you're talking to your company's IT guy, for example, you could ask him whether he's the guy who installs hardware or software. But avoid asking anyone to explain something super complex or involved; if that's where the conversation leads, great, but asking a really complicated question up front can feel demanding.</p>\n\t5. Comment on the environment\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5a1353023dbef4cf008b74d0?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Thanksgiving dinner friendsgiving food party\" height=\"754\" width=\"1005\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>There&#39;s always something to comment on.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Pressmaster/Shutterstock</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>No matter where you are, there are things to comment on: the music, the food, the lights, the guests, and so on. Even if you are stuck in an elevator with someone, you can comment on the music, the speed, the crowdedness, etc.</p>\n\t6. Ask for an update\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5b8707548905f2ff1e8b4ada?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Conversation\" height=\"800\" width=\"1067\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>If you know something about then, ask them about it.\n<p class=\"copyright\">SFIO CRACHO/Shutterstock</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>If you know someone a little or know them by reputation, ask for an update on something you know they've been doing, for example, \"Oh, Mary mentioned you were taking swing dance classes. How's that going?\"</p>\n\t7. Ask open-ended questions whenever possible\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5dfd3ba3855cc2384142b138?format=jpeg\" alt=\"coffee with coworker\" height=\"4480\" width=\"5973\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Always have a follow-up question ready.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Pressmaster/Shutterstock</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>If your question can be answered with a simple yes or no, don't be surprised if that's what you get. Having follow-up questions ready can also help the conversation flow. If you are asking what kind of food they're having, for example, you might follow up with, \"That sounds good. Do you know what kind of wine would go well with that?\" Almost everything can be followed up with, \"Why?\" (Just don't ask it too many times and end up sounding like a three-year-old!)</p>\n\t8. Ask a hypothetical question\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5dfd37a3855cc233a54d65d2?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Coworkers talking\" height=\"3933\" width=\"5244\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Tie it into something that&#39;s happening in current events.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Fizkes/Shutterstock</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>These can be great conversation starters, but try to tie them into something happening at the event or in current events to avoid seeming too random. You might say something like, \"I just saw this movie where all the laws were revoked for one day. What would you do if there were no laws for a day?\"</p>\n\t9. Ask about their kids, pets, or hobbies\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5df2c4f3fd9db26df73a5342?format=jpeg\" alt=\"new parent dad father baby\" height=\"1414\" width=\"1885\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Ask them about the things that are important to them.\n<p class=\"copyright\">JGI/Tom Grill/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>People love to talk about the things that are important to them. If you know that your boss loves to sail, asking him about his latest trip is a surefire way to get him talking.</p><h2>More from Bernard Marr:</h2><p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">&#8226;&#160;<a

over 190 million voters will either receive ballots in the mail or be able to vote by mail without an excuse beyond fear of contracting COVID-19.&#160;</p><p>If you're a registered voter in <strong>California, Colorado, Hawaii, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon, Utah, Vermont, Washington, the District of Columbia, </strong>or some counties in <strong>Montana </strong>you'll most likely be receiving a ballot in the mail from your local election officials and won't need to take further action.&#160;</p><p>Some more states <a

mail ballots in every US state. </strong><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/deadlines-for-absentee-and-mail-ballot-in-every-state-2020-7\">You can find specific deadlines to request and return your mail ballot here.&#160;</a></p><p>Here's when states starting sending out November general election ballots to all voters or those who have affirmatively requested them, according to <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/vopp-table-7-when-states-mail-out-absentee-ballots.aspx\">the National Council of State Legislatures.</a></p><div

timing varies between states and counties, in general, <strong>the earlier you request your ballot, the sooner you'll get it.&#160;</strong></p><p>And importantly, the US Postal Service has told election officials they cannot guarantee that election mail <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/voters-should-request-mail-ballots-15-days-before-election-usps-2020-7\">will be delivered inbound to voters or outbound back to election offices by any specific date</a>. The Postal Service recommends that voters plan for their ballot <strong><a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-19-vote-by-mail-ballot-counted-election/\">to take at least a 14-day round trip</a></strong> to get to them and back, and advises voters sending their ballots back through the mail do so <strong>at least seven days</strong> before the election, but ideally sooner.&#160;</p><p><strong>North Carolina</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/2020-election-voting-begins-september-4-north-carolina-mails-ballots-2020-9\">became the first state to start sending out ballots to voters on September 4, 2020,</a>60 days before the election. Most states begin sending out ballots three-to-six weeks out.&#160;</p><p>The DC Board of Elections told Insider they haven't nailed down a specific date for when they plan to start sending ballots, but hope to do so starting in mid-October.&#160;</p><p>It's also important to note that because election administration in the United States is decentralized down to the county level, the timeline for when states start sending out ballots <strong>can vary somewhat from county to county</strong> within states and may be changed due to the pandemic. When in doubt, <a href=\"https://www.nass.org/can-i-vote\">check with your state and local election officials</a> for more specific information.&#160;</p><p>Above all, experts and election officials <strong><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/easy-things-you-can-do-to-make-november-election-a-success-2020-7\">are urging Americans to request and return their mail ballots as soon as possible</a></strong> and not wait until right before the election, where local election offices are likely to be slammed with an influx of last-minute ballot requests.&#160;</p><p>By now, Americans are all-too-familiar with the concept of flattening the curve of the COVID-19 pandemic by keeping the rate of infections down to avoid overwhelming the capacity while extending the outbreak.</p><p>Experts have applied the same analogy to mail voting, telling Insider that in order to avoid overwhelming the capacity of their local elections offices, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alysoun/status/1285901577975468033\">voters must flatten the curve of mail ballot requests</a> by requesting theirs as soon as possible, ideally months or weeks in advance, and return their ballot as soon as possible.&#160;</p><p>The sooner you request your ballot, the sooner you'll receive it, which means you'll be able to send it back early and have the peace of mind knowing that your ballot arrived at your election office in plenty of time.

But after about five years on the market, it's getting a little old.&#160;</p><p>Thus, the fourth-generation Tucson is coming, and this is your first peek at it.&#160;</p><p>On Wednesday, Hyundai published three teaser photos of the new car. They're shadowy images, which Business Insider brightened up for your viewing pleasure, and show what appears to be a completely redesigned front and rear. It's a complete departure from the styling of the current car, which can be seen below.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f514732e6ff30001d4e6f54?format=jpeg\" alt=\"2021 Hyundai Tucson\" height=\"1667\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>2021 Hyundai Tucson.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Hyundai</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>A style overhaul on the Tucson is a big deal for Hyundai. It was the automaker's top-selling SUV in 2019, with more than 137,000 models sold. The only vehicle in Hyundai's lineup that beat the Tucson was the smaller Elantra, which logged more than 175,000 sales last year.</p><p>The Tucson's new front fascia wears what <a href=\"https://www.hyundainews.com/en-us/releases/3121\">Hyundai calls</a> \"Parametric Hidden Lights\" that are composed of daytime running lights integrated into the \"jewel-like\" grille. Hyundai said they are only revealed when turned on.&#160;</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the new Tucson will be bigger and wider than the outgoing model, likely to please a market that constantly craves bigger and wider cars. Inside, the automaker likens the new Tucson to the feeling of a \"modern boutique hotel.\" Judging from the photo, we can expect an integrated touchscreen as the center display console, as well as another screen to display driver information.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f5137407ed0ee001e25d53d?format=jpeg\" alt=\"2021 Hyundai Tucson_3\" height=\"1453\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The all-new Hyundai Tucson.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Hyundai</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Hyundai also said the new Tucson will be the first compact SUV in its class to offer two different wheelbases, depending on which market it needs to satisfy. There will be short- and long-wheelbase versions of the Tucson — not unlike how there's a regular Audi A8 sedan and also an A8 L extended wheelbase sedan for extra cabin room.</p><p>Hyundai didn't offer any stats, pricing, or availability information at this time, but notes that the new Tucson's official press reveal will take place on September 15.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img

It spent about $35 billion to build the position between 2016 and 2018, meaning it has still more than tripled the value of its investment.

Doctors use corticosteroids to tamp down on overactive immune systems and reduce inflammation, which can help with a variety of conditions including asthma and skin disorders.</p><p>The coronavirus can trigger overactive immune responses, which can be deadly: When too many white blood cells <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200513081810.htm\">flood the bloodstream</a>, some attack healthy tissue in addition to the virus. Steroids, then, can help suppress that kind of dangerous immune response among COVID-19 patients.&#160;</p><p>Scientists at Oxford University found in June that dexamethasone, specifically, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/dexamethasone-steroid-touted-as-coronavirus-breakthrough-drug-risky-mild-cases-2020-6\">improves patients' survival rates</a>, but at that time, experts and international organizations wanted more evidence before making recommendations.

In May, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-treatment-gilead-says-positive-data-remdesivir-from-niaid-study-2020-4\">a study found</a> that remdesivir shortened recovery times for those patients. However, a recent study also found that patients on a 10-day course of remdesivir <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/remdesivir-may-not-significantly-improve-covid-19-outcomes-study-2020-8\">died at about the same rates</a> as people given other treatments.</p><p>Corticosteroids, then, might offer more promise.</p><p>\"I had a big smile on my face when I saw the results,\" Dr. Derek C. Angus, chair of the department of critical care medicine at the University of Pittsburgh and a co-author of one of the trials, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/02/health/coronavirus-steroids.html\">told the Times</a>.&#160;</p><p>The National Institutes of Health also now <a href=\"https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/immune-based-therapy/immunomodulators/corticosteroids/\">recommends corticosteroids</a>, particularly dexamethasone, for COVID-19 patients who need ventilators or supplemental oxygen.&#160;</p><p>An added benefit of corticosteroids is that they're cheap.

Friday.&#160;</li>\n<li>The report narrowly beat economist expectations, showing that the labor market recovery from the coronavirus pandemic is moving forward. Still, economists worry that the pace of recovery has stalled.&#160;</li>\n<li>Here's what four economists had to say about the report.&#160;</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>Even though the August jobs report beat expectations, economists warned that it also showed that the labor market recovery from the coronavirus pandemic recession has stalled, and that there's underlying damage to the US economy that could leave lasting scars.&#160;</p><p>The US economy added back <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/august-jobs-report-nonfarm-payrolls-unemployment-rate-us-economy-recovery-2020-9\">1.37 million jobs in August</a> and the unemployment rate ticked down to 8.4%, beating economist estimates for gains and notching the first single-digit unemployment rate of the pandemic recession. The most jobs were gained in sectors hit hardest by the pandemic, including leisure and hospitality, education and health, and retail.&#160;</p><p>\"This was an impressive report and once again shows the economy remains quite resilient,\" said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial, in a note. \"But 8% unemployment is still 8% unemployment, so let's not get too excited.\"</p><p>Economists also noted that there are underlying signs of trouble in the report. Even though the jobs report showed payrolls were added and came in above consensus, it's less than the 1.8 million jobs added in the previous month. And jobs added back in top sectors were also far fewer than in previous reports.&#160;</p><p>This signals that the pace of the labor market recovery is still slowing from the record gains seen in May and June. The more the recovery slows, the longer it will take to recoup the 11.5 million jobs needed to reach pre-pandemic February levels.&#160;</p><p>Here's what else four economists had to say about the August jobs report.&#160;</p><p><strong>1. Navy Federal Credit Union: \"The easier jobs gains are over\"</strong></p><p>\"The hiring of Census workers significantly added to jobs, but there were other key gains in the hard-hit retailing sector,\" said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union.</p><p>\"Unfortunately, the easier jobs gains are over, and now we'll be battling permanent layoffs once thought to be temporary, bankruptcies, secondary layoffs and maybe major layoffs in the airline industry,\" he said. \"Expect that starting this month we'll struggle to drop the unemployment rate as much, and possibly see break-even jobs months and even backsliding.\"</p><p><strong>2. Euler Hermes: \"We've had such a tremendous scar in the labor market\"&#160;</strong></p><p>\"Those people who are on furlough dropped by 3 million this month. So, you know, you could argue in some sense that all of the gains where those people going back to work at jobs that were already there,\" Dan North, chief economist for North America at Euler Hermes, told Business Insider.&#160;</p><p>\"It's an awfully good thing to get people off of furlough, but tt doesn't indicate that we're doing it because of economic growth,\" he said.&#160; \"We've had such a tremendous scar in the labor market.

He's worked with her for years and he's been dancing his entire life.</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> I remember dancing in my grandmother's living room. And then when I was 16, I started my own dance group with my best friend in Atlanta. So that was kinda the first serious step towards choreography and creative direction.</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> At just 18, JaQuel landed a gig choreographing one of the best videos of all time, \"Single Ladies.\" Years later, JaQuel reveals what it takes to be a backup dancer for Beyoncé.</p><p><strong>Knight:</strong> To work for B as a dancer, it takes everything, you know. She's a southern girl, you know, who's worked very hard to get where she is. So she wants people to do the same. She wanna know that you want it really bad. She wanna see your heart, your passion, your drive. And then, you know, you gotta be able to jam. How greasy can you get? How can you hit it hard? Then there's also the side of her that's looking for the technical element. You know, are you trained? Do you have any ballet training? Do you have any jazz training? How are your lines? You know, so there's a few things that go into the process.</p><p>And once we start to audition things, you know, we look for everything. We teach them hip-hop number, we teach them a super difficult technical number, we teach them the classic Beyoncé number, you know. And then besides that, you know, you gotta be able to carry the stage, you know, with her. You gotta be able to stand next to her and be just as good, you know. And sometimes people are ready, sometimes they're not. You can be a great dancer, but it may not come through when you get on stage. You may kind of pull into a shell, don't know who to look at. So she's looking for stars. Star dancers, who have magic. That can bring it, you know, and pull other people in, always.</p><p>Working with B during the rehearsal process is like, it's kind of an out of body experience, ya know. People don't understand the amount of effort her work ethic is out of this world. And it's never just one thing. When we're creating choreography, it's okay, boom. Where's the wardrobe at? You know, bring them in so they can see what the choreography is. Okay boom. Where are we on this stage? You know, let's make sure lighting knows how to light this, boom. Where are the cameras? Okay, let's look at this camera and then do this.</p><p>You know, we're always thinking of every single piece of the puzzle. But you know, at the end of the day, we send her pictures, we send her videos. She's watching people in rehearsal like who's that? Okay, that's so and so that we talked about. She's like okay, she's good. You know, she's looking at everything at every moment, you know. So she's like heavily involved.</p><p><em>EDITOR'S NOTE: This video was originally published in July 2018.</em></p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/heres-what-it-takes-to-dance-for-beyonce-backup-dancers-show-choreography-2018-6'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=RZ-uXjmT0Kk:NjD-DRx9BWg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=RZ-uXjmT0Kk:NjD-DRx9BWg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=RZ-uXjmT0Kk:NjD-DRx9BWg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=RZ-uXjmT0Kk:NjD-DRx9BWg:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=RZ-uXjmT0Kk:NjD-DRx9BWg:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=RZ-uXjmT0Kk:NjD-DRx9BWg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=RZ-uXjmT0Kk:NjD-DRx9BWg:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=RZ-uXjmT0Kk:NjD-DRx9BWg:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/RZ-uXjmT0Kk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 04 Sep 2020 14:30:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5b32ae4a1ae66239008b48c3?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"7f62cc1bc24ae17a65123d82627e39de","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn4@2020_3/2020/09/04/16-37-34-360_cb421daf87855be3.webp","destWidth":3770,"destHeight":2827,"sourceBytes":433892,"destBytes":433892,"author":"eocbazghi@businessinsider.com (Emmanuel Ocbazghi)","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn3@2020_1/2020/09/04/16-38-03-978_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=RZ-uXjmT0Kk:NjD-DRx9BWg:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn9@2020_5/2020/09/04/16-38-05-562_0916fa9b9c233d26.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=RZ-uXjmT0Kk:NjD-DRx9BWg:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn8@2020_3/2020/09/04/16-37-50-048_3e366bc5d99766e8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn24@2020_6/2020/09/04/16-37-59-085_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=RZ-uXjmT0Kk:NjD-DRx9BWg:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn36@2020_3/2020/09/04/16-37-50-832_7eec940a177f362f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/RZ-uXjmT0Kk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn43@2020_5/2020/09/04/16-37-52-716_f682688d2c0b405a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599237433625},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 00:37:13","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 00:37:13","title":"The private jet industry is bracing for fall without its biggest money maker: business travelers.

Relying more on private planes, travel plans were shaped around quarantine rules and airlines were largely avoided for those who could afford it.</p><p>A fast rebounding leisure segment over the summer gave firms an early indicator of how the sector's slump earlier in 2020 might be short-lived.</p><p>Now, with new safety protocols in place and a positive industry outlook, private aircraft firms are changing their playbooks. They're moving to capture as many new clients as they can this fall to counter the expected loss of business travel, which typically comes this time of year as summer leisure travel peters out.</p><h2><strong>The road to recovery</strong></h2><p><strong><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f49456e7ffa48002894ce6d?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Gulfstream G550\" height=\"1316\" width=\"1755\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>This summer saw a drop in private jet charter traffic by an average of around 20% for July and August.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Andrew Harker/Shutterstock.com</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></strong></p><p>Private aviation saw an active summer with traffic rising so close to last year's levels that executives are expecting a quick return to normal, the opposite of what the mainline airline industry is currently experiencing.</p><p>\"June was our biggest month ever, by far,\" Jason Middleton, chief executive officer of Silver Air, told Business Insider. His company's June had surpassed its year-on-year numbers by nearly 40 percent, with July and August also nearing last year's levels.</p><p>Firms that couldn't meet 2019 numbers were still coming close as Jet Linx CEO Jamie Walker told Business Insider that his company's June was only 15% off from the year prior. Traffic then increased in July and August to 10% down from last year.&#160;</p><p>Walker's experience is closer to the industry average, according to data from the aviation auditor Argus. It showed that year-on-year traffic was only down 19.6% for July and is slated to be down around 20% for August, according to Travis Kuhn, Argus' vice president for market intelligence.</p><p>Health and safety concerns drove the wealthy to book private aircraft for their leisure travel versus flying the airlines, executives say, with a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/flying-private-new-socially-conscious-choice-2020-5\">recent McKinsey &#38; Company study</a> revealing a massive untapped market of non-private flying high-net-worth individuals ripe for firms to capture.&#160;</p><p>As industry leaders are questioning whether business travel will meaningfully return this fall, executives hope the new leisure market will carry them until the holiday travel season. Currently, the outlook for the fall is quite strong.</p><p>September traffic is slated to be down only 16%, dropping to 13% in October, Kuhn predicts, with help from the new flyers.</p><p>\"The increase in private or personal travel that we're seeing is offsetting the vast majority of the business travel that we've seen erode this year,\" Patrick Gallagher, president, sales, marketing, and service at NetJets, told Business Insider, noting that the rise of personal flights \"is like nothing that we've ever experienced before.\"</p><h2><strong>Investing in new planes and pilots</strong></h2><p><strong><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f4946997ffa48002894ce79?format=jpeg\" alt=\"XOJET Aviation Cessna Citation X\" height=\"1666\" width=\"2222\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Executives are looking towards expansion to help capture the next generation of private flyers.\n<p class=\"copyright\">XOJET Aviation</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></strong></p><p>Some firms are focused on expansion as there's <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/private-jet-firms-buying-new-planes-hiring-pilots-during-downturn-2020-8\">greater availability of planes and experienced former airline pilots</a> that can be used to scale up to take advantage of the new opportunity.</p><p>XOJET Aviation is eyeing 10 to 20 additional planes for its fleet of 40-strong by 2023. All current aircraft are also getting an interior cabin upgrade and new paint jobs.</p><p>\"Our plan is a long-term plan and the opportunity in a soft market is to add to the fleet in a cost-effective and intelligent manner, makes sense for us to do it right now,\" Thomas said.</p><p>In July, Jet Linx acquired Meridian Air Charter and 23 managed aircraft, establishing it as the country's second-largest aircraft management firm. Walker navigated Jet Linx through the 2008 economic recession and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/private-jet-firm-jet-linx-acquires-meridian-ceo-interview-2020-7\">is applying the same guiding principle this time around</a> — expansion.</p><p>Despite a near-90% traffic loss in March and April, Jet Linx doubled sales for jet cards – prepaid commitments where flyers lock in favorable rates – sales this summer with first-timers accounting for 90% of new sales from March to July, Walker said.</p><h2>The rise of the flexible, premium operator</h2><p><strong><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f4947687ffa48002894ce80?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Bombardier Global Express\" height=\"1053\" width=\"1404\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Executives believe that traditional on-demand charter will fall prey to flexible, floating fleet operators that use dynamic pricing and have advanced scheduling systems.\n<p class=\"copyright\">FXAIR</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></strong></p><p>The new paradigm shift will require more technologically-savvy operators in order to keep up with fast-changing travel trends, executives predict. Firms that can offer dynamic pricing backed by a large fleet of nomadic aircraft constantly moving around the country will be better off.</p><p>Travelers aren't just going away for the weekend anymore, they're going for entire seasons. Those flyers require one-way flights, something traditional operators cannot typically offer without charging for costly repositioning legs to get aircraft back to home base.</p><p>\"The leisure flying that we have this summer is not the normal leisure flying that we had last summer,\" Ronald Silverman, chief business officer of XOJET Aviation's sister company, XO, told Business Insider. \"And while the numbers exceed last summer, it's a new kind of passenger, it's a new kind of flying.\"</p><p>The floating fleet model relies on advanced scheduling and pricing technology to maximize efficiency. It also benefits business travelers who may not want to stay overnight when traveling since multiple aircraft can be used on the outbound and return legs, eliminating flight crew duty day concerns.</p><p>Directional Aviation is also aiming to combine that technology with a premium charter offering, called FXAIR. The organization's new on-demand charter wing will use second-hand Flexjet aircraft to provide key tenets that its leadership says is missing from the current charter experience – \"safety, stability, and consistency.\"</p><p>\"In us launching FXAIR, we have changed the narrative from charter to what we call premium charter,\" Gregg Slow, FXAIR's president, told Business Insider.&#160;</p><p>Directional Aviation initially wanted to launch FXAIR later in 2020 or 2021 but the new market opportunity couldn't be passed up, according to FXAIR's leaders. Its fleet of Nextant 400XT, Challenger 300, and Global Express aircraft will float around the country, utilizing similar scheduling and pricing technology to connect aircraft with passengers.</p><p>\"You're going to see dynamic pricing attributes that are going to be really important and the technology that drives them,\" FXAIR CEO Andrew Collins told Business Insider, noting that \"smart routing\" will be equally important to effectively drive revenue.&#160;</p><h2><strong>Changing the sales formula</strong></h2><p><strong><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f4947af7ffa48002894ce82?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Private jet COVID-19\" height=\"1665\" width=\"2221\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Private aircraft operators are investing in new safety protocols to sell peace of mind to clients.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Silver Air</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></strong></p><p>The private aviation conversation has moved away from solely the price of the service.</p><p>\"Today, it's more health and safety,\" Michael Silvestro, chief executive officer of Flexjet, told Business Insider. \"No doubt.\"</p><p>When facing a hefty private charter bill, customers want to know that the investment they're making in their health is justified. It's not enough for private aviation to rest on its laurels and the inherent perks of convenience and exclusivity, firms still have to earn new business.</p><p>\"We're seeing a little bit of a flight to quality,\" Gallagher said.&#160;</p><p>The downtime from March to May proved useful for some firms that used it to craft new strategies for bringing in next-generation clients to help lessen the impact of a slow fall for business travel.</p><p>\"We were very bullish going in April and we basically built an entire direct-to-consumer sales team and strategy during our downtime and COVID,\" Middleton said. \"And we came out of it with this amazing sales team and our revenue has ramped up quite a bit.\"</p><p>Silver's strategy aims to cut out aircraft brokers and have clients come directly to them. Education is at the heart of the strategy, extolling the benefits of private charter over flying commercial beyond just the additional material luxuries.</p><h2>Bridging the final gap</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f495f9e60bf1f00280794da?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Gulfstream G550 private jet\" height=\"1666\" width=\"2223\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>It took over a decade for private aviation to get back to normal following the 2008 economic crisis.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Media_works/Shutterstock.com</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Analysts and executives are still uncertain about when the industry will fully recover as it's unclear when business travel will. Following the 2008 economic crisis, it took the industry 11 years to bounce back, Kuhn said.</p><p>Firms are confident that it will come back sooner and are already preparing for that eventuality. Jet Linx, for example, just introduced a new jet card program for business travelers to help ease that all-important segment back into flying.</p><p>Argus is predicting that the industry will remain around 10% shy of normal levels as the pandemic continues, the threat of a recession at the end lingers, and international travel restrictions remain active as all three hinder business
