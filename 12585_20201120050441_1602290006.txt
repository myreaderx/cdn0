The coronavirus had yet to make landfall in the US but the anxiety was building. After the segment aired, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/10/movies/contagion-movie-coronavirus.html\"><em>New York Times</em> critic Wesley Morris</a> told us that after he heard the part where Garrett described her role as a consultant on the movie,<em> </em>\"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sYSyuuLk5g\" target=\"_blank\">Contagion</a>\" he felt compelled to rewatch the 2011 thriller. In the film, competency — specifically, within federal government agencies — is the solution to a destructive crisis. This is comforting to watch, like a sort of public health \"West Wing.\" It is also unnerving, and heavy, to watch the thrilling procedural un-spool as people, on- and off-screen, die. Brooke spoke to Morris in March about how for him, it was the pandemic film that most perfectly fit with the current moment — down to Kate Winslet, playing a dogged pathogenic detective, reminding her colleague to stop touching his face. </p>\n<p> </p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 18 Nov 2020 17:00:00 +0000","feedId":12585,"bgimg":"https://media.wnyc.org/i/130/130/c/80/2020/03/gwen_contagion.png","linkMd5":"dbb23a6b9405454a807681f87a5ae48e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn46@2020_1/2020/11/20/05-04-40-611_256eea7cacdfc9a2.webp","destWidth":130,"destHeight":130,"sourceBytes":11332,"destBytes":3718,"author":"wnycdigital@gmail.com (WNYC Studios)","enclosureType":"audio/mpeg","enclosureUrl":"https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/audio.wnyc.org/otm/otm111820_podextra.mp3","publishedOrCreatedDate":1605848656215}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-11-20 13:04:16","updatedTime":"2020-11-20 13:04:16","feedId":12585,"fetchDate":"Fri, 20 Nov 2020 05:04:16 +0000","fetchMs":1399,"handleMs":91,"totalMs":26850,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":120,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"ae93f9d1175534295e982219dea73fae","hostName":"us-018*","requestId":"f7c66719ef5948bf9f1a908c4d5befc8_12585","contentType":"text/xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":3718,"bgimgsTotal":1,"bgimgsGithubTotal":1,"articlesImgsTotal":0,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":0,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx22":1,"myreaderx":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 04:37:46","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:37:36","id":12585,"name":"On the Media","url":"http://feeds.wnyc.org/onthemedia","subscriber":246,"website":null,"icon":"https://media2.wnyc.org/i/1400/1400/80/1/OnTheMedia_WNYCStudios_1400.png","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx61/cdn1@2020_6/2020/09/05/08-37-34-716_ec73e7e04b857d5c.png","description":"The Peabody Award-winning On the Media podcast is your guide to examining how the media sausage is made.
