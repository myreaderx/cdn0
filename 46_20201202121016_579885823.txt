Sam, an ex journalist, has returned to the sleepy town of Basswood to attend his friend&#8217;s funeral, and he latches onto the possibility that his mate may have been murdered. The game centres around uncovering the truth. If you&#8217;ve played the likes of <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game/life-is-strange/\">Life Is Strange</a>, it&#8217;s a similar narrative-heavy, click-a-bit, watch-lots-of-cutscenes experience.</p>\n<p>From the outset it is made clear that Sam struggles with his mental health &#8211; he takes some pills to keep himself in check on the way to the wake, which is a sure fire visual shorthand for said struggles. This is a topic that has not always been handled well in games (like how every game adapting a Lovecraft property <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/08/27/lovecraftian-preview-top-trumps-the-sinking-city-vs-call-of-cthulhu/\">has to have some kind of sanity metric</a>). But because of Life Is Strange, Dontnod have a reputation for approaching difficult topics with some nuance. I thought that maybe they&#8217;d be able to whip together a thrilling story that tackled mental health with tact. But nah. My hopes were dashed pretty quickly.</p>\n<p> <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2020/12/01/i-couldnt-stop-laughing-at-twin-mirrors-mind-palace/#more-919701\" class=\"more-link\"><span aria-label=\"Continue reading I couldn&#8217;t stop laughing at Twin Mirror&#8217;s Mind Palace\">(more&#8230;)</span></a></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?a=SMiVip0xo80:yu0W2jjcyqM:nQ_hWtDbxek\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=nQ_hWtDbxek\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?a=SMiVip0xo80:yu0W2jjcyqM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RockPaperShotgun/~4/SMiVip0xo80\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 01 Dec 2020 17:00:04 +0000","feedId":46,"bgimg":"https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2020/11/twin-mirror-header.jpg","linkMd5":"178572a9fa8a961ea5c1eee47d00b741","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn9@2020_4/2020/12/02/12-09-57-807_475694ac81c6c655.webp","destWidth":1920,"destHeight":1080,"sourceBytes":843718,"destBytes":60838,"author":"Ed Thorn","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2020/11/twin-mirror-header.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn9@2020_4/2020/12/02/12-09-57-807_475694ac81c6c655.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=nQ_hWtDbxek":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn61@2020_2/2020/12/02/12-10-15-258_4c56023a3ecf3679.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn60@2020_4/2020/12/02/12-10-15-261_8be694f2d9c61abe.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RockPaperShotgun/~4/SMiVip0xo80":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn79@2020_3/2020/12/02/12-10-15-325_873f73dc3115edcf.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1606910987115},{"createdTime":"2020-12-02 20:09:47","updatedTime":"2020-12-02 20:09:47","title":"Dead Cells takes a Fatal Fall into another DLC expansion next year","link":"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/?p=920295","description":"<p><a href=\"https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2020/12/dead-cells-fatal-fall-1212x682.jpg\"><img src=\"https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2020/12/dead-cells-fatal-fall-1212x682.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1212\" height=\"682\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-920305\" title=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>Run &#8216;n&#8217; dash &#8216;n&#8217; slash &#8217;em up roguelike <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game/dead-cells/\">Dead Cells</a> is about to stumble straight into another piece of paid DLC.
