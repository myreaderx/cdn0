(\"soft toy\", if you're English)</p><p>And not just a flat, two-pieces-of-cloth plushie. No: you want <em>three D's.</em></p><p>To do that, you first need to transform a 3D surface into 2D pieces, to cut into fabric &#38; sew together. The two most common methods are: 1) be a wizard and do this in your head, or 2) use a 3D modelling software, i.e., be a wizard.</p><p>I ain't got time for that, and neither do you!</p><p>But recently, I was inspired by <a href=\"http://laurenvenell.com/epic-how-to-make-a-3-d-plush-pattern-from-a-2-d-drawing/\">this designer's tutorial</a>, where she wraps fabric around carved foam. I wanted cheaper/easier materials, so I made a variant where you wrap paper towel pieces around Play-Doh.</p><p>Let's start!</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.ncase.me/content/images/2020/03/materials.JPG\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Make Plushie Patterns with Play-Doh & Paper Towels\"></figure><h2 id=\"what-you-ll-need\">What You'll Need</h2><ul><li><strong>Modeling clay</strong> (not necessarily Play-Doh, it just made the title alliterate)</li><li><strong>Paper Towel</strong></li><li><strong>Scissors </strong>(preferably small, to cut tight curves)</li><li><strong>Pen</strong></li><li>Optional: tape</li><li>Optional: straight pins</li></ul><h3 id=\"step-1-mold-your-3d-form\">Step 1: Mold your 3D form</h3><p>Come on, you did this as a kid.
