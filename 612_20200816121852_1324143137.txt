Our infrastructure exists both in colocated data centers and in the cloud, and you&#8217;ll be working alongside our existing team of Blake, Eron, John, Matt, Matthew, Nathan, and Troy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you might gather from the names, our operations team today is not nearly as diverse as we&#8217;d like it to be, or as the rest of the company. We therefore strongly encourage candidates of all different backgrounds to apply. Basecamp is committed to building an inclusive, supportive place for you to do the best and most rewarding work of your career. We are an equal-opportunity employer and are committed to building a company that embraces and celebrates diversity and inclusion.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-12829\"></span>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About the work</strong><br>The job of operating fast and reliable systems is mainly about making life as boring as possible by considering and mitigating all the things that&#160;<em>could</em>&#160;go wrong before they do. Operations shine the brightest when there&#8217;s nothing to see – systems just run. But getting there is both difficult to accomplish, and hard to sustain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s also impossible to get perfect all the time. So part of the work includes being available for on-call duty, which may include getting woken up in the middle of the night, when it&#8217;s your turn to be first responder. We rotate that responsibility on a regular schedule.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our standard stack includes MySQL (both Aurora on AWS and on-prem installations), Redis, ElasticSearch, S3, Ruby on Rails, postfix, Kubernetes, and local installations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some things we’ve worked on recently that might give you a better sense of what you’ll be doing day to day:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Integrate and optimize rspamd for inbound and outbound mail pipelines</li><li>Modify and extend Terraform configurations for managing AWS resources</li><li>Practice incident response procedures including service failovers</li><li>Provision and load test both on-premise and cloud-based infrastructure</li><li>Manage database schema changes using pt-online-schema-change</li><li>Upgrade production Kubernetes clusters to a new release</li><li>Migrate workloads from cloud to onprem or vice-versa</li><li>Deploy and operate database clusters built with Vitess and MySQL</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll be working hand-in-hand with a team that is happy to answer questions and share their collective wisdom at each step of the way. And your experience and background will join ours! We have worlds to learn and we’re eager to do it together. You can expect to teach us, coach us, and expect the same in return.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About you</strong><br>We’re looking for experienced candidates only for this role. You should have been doing this work before in a professional setting, but you also won’t know how all our systems work on day one, and we don’t expect you to.&#160;<a href=\"https://m.signalvnoise.com/nobody-hits-the-ground-running/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Nobody hits the ground running</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should be familiar with our standard stack, completely comfortable with the Unix toolchain, basic networking concepts, and be at least a passable programmer, capable of writing or amending existing systems in Go or Ruby.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have experience with email services in particular, that&#8217;s a plus. We&#8217;re new to operating a full-scale email service with HEY, so if you can bring experience and fresh ideas, we&#8217;re eager to learn. But this is not a requirement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might have a CS or engineering degree. You might not. That’s not what we’re looking for. We care about what you can do and how you do it, not about how you got here. A strong track record of conscientious, thoughtful work speaks volumes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We value&#160;<a href=\"https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1430-hire-managers-of-one\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Managers of One</a>. We appreciate people who can take a stand yet commit even when they disagree. We subject ideas to rigorous consideration and challenge each other, but all remember that we’re here for the same purpose: to do good work together. That comes with direct feedback, openness to each others’ experience, and willingness to show up for each other as well as for the technical work at hand. We’re in this for the long term.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can expect a mindful onboarding process with ramp-up and time to learn. You can expect a team that listens, and to be heard. You can expect to give and provide direct feedback. You can expect to be counted on. You can expect to do your best work and build a career here. We build our apps, our teams, and our company for the long haul, with a strong eye to other teams’ effectiveness &#38; happiness, from design to support and operations. A healthy, resilient app starts with a healthy, resilient organization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a remote job. You’re free to work where you work best: home office, co-working space, coffeeshops. We don&#8217;t even have an office at the moment! However, given our on-call responsibilities, we&#8217;re specifically looking for someone to complement our existing timezone coverage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We will therefore not be looking for additional team members in the central or eastern timezones of the US. We&#8217;ll consider mountain time, would be happy with pacific time, and would be thrilled with candidates in Hawaii or Europe. But we also need a reasonable overlap during a normal workday with the central timezone, so we are not considering candidates from, say, India for this role.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Applicants from outside of the US will be offered a contractor role on comparable terms and equal pay with our domestic employees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pay and benefits</strong><br>Basecamp pays in the top 10% of the industry based on San Francisco rates. Same position, same pay, no matter where you live. The salary for this position is $134,257 (for&#160;<a href=\"https://basecamp.com/handbook/appendix-04-titles-for-ops#systems-admin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Systems Admin</a>) or $167,962 (for&#160;<a href=\"https://basecamp.com/handbook/appendix-04-titles-for-ops#senior-systems-admin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Senior Systems Admin</a>). We assess seniority relative to the team at Basecamp during the interviewing process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Benefits at Basecamp are all about helping you lead a healthy life outside of work. That starts with working no more than 40 hours a week on a regular basis and getting 8+ hours of sleep a night. Our workplace and our benefits are designed to support a sustainable, healthy relationship with your work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We offer fully-paid parental leave. We work 4-day weeks through the summer (Northern Hemisphere) and take a one-month sabbatical every three years. We subsidize co-working, home offices, and continuing education, whether professional or hobbyist. We match your charitable contributions. All on a foundation of top-shelf health insurance and a retirement plan with a generous match.&#160;<a href=\"https://basecamp.com/handbook/08-benefits-and-perks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">See the full list</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How to apply</strong><br>Please&#160;<a href=\"https://apply.workable.com/basecamp/j/EAC5FC2F45/apply/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">send an application</a>&#160;that speaks directly to this position. Show us your role in Basecamp’s future and Basecamp’s role in yours. Address some of the work we do. Introduce yourself as a colleague. Give it a deep think and take this at your speed. We’re giving you our full attention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re accepting applications until&#160;<strong>Sunday, August 2, 2020, at 7PM US-Central time</strong>. There’s no benefit to filing early or writing a novel. Keep it sharp, short, and get across what matters to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next: We expect to take a few weeks to review all applications. You’ll hear from us by Friday, August 21, about advancement to a take-home technical exercise. This test is offered to no more than 20 candidates out of the usually hundreds (or in some cases, more than a thousand!) people who apply. You should expect to spend upwards of a full day (but no more) completing this test. Please consider whether you&#8217;d be willing to set aside time for that before applying.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the written test, the top candidates will proceed to an interview. Our interviews are one hour, all remote, with your future colleagues, on your schedule. We&#8217;ll talk through your background, your approach to work, and dive into your technical knowledge. No gotchas, brainteasers, or whiteboards.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We aim to make an offer by the end of September with a start date in October.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note: We’re unable to offer feedback during most of the screening process. We tend to see over 1000 applications for our technical roles. We don’t have the bandwidth to offer personalized feedback to candidates that do not proceed to the interview round.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a demanding application process, and significant career move to consider. We appreciate the generosity and courage that go into giving us that consideration. Our conversation starts with this post. We look forward to hearing from you!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://apply.workable.com/basecamp/j/EAC5FC2F45/apply/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Apply here</a></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?a=u3fuTgT7d3U:J84RaoRjkiE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?a=u3fuTgT7d3U:J84RaoRjkiE:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/37signals/beMH/~4/u3fuTgT7d3U\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 17 Jul 2020 16:12:19 +0000","feedId":612,"bgimg":"https://i1.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/cropped-svn-icon.gif?fit=512%2C512&ssl=1","linkMd5":"e7864b6990429af18a613f3b860da13f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn16@2020_4/2020/08/16/12-18-49-684_b28b911cc848b4e0.webp","destWidth":512,"destHeight":512,"author":"Andrea LaRowe","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn52@2020_4/2020/08/16/12-18-49-123_c6a3f44dc9395323.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn23@2020_5/2020/08/16/12-18-49-706_c650b065e3836c8d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/37signals/beMH/~4/u3fuTgT7d3U":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn67@2020_1/2020/08/16/12-18-50-110_6816221218a7be9c.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 20:18:28","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 20:18:28","title":"We’re hiring Rails programmers","link":"https://m.signalvnoise.com/?p=12872","description":"\n<p>We have&#160;<strong>two</strong>&#160;rare openings on our&#160;<a href=\"https://basecamp.com/about/team\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Core Product team</a>&#160;for Rails programmers.

This is an opportunity for us to bring in a different perspective and we’re eager to further diversify our company.

It’s on us to reverse course as quickly as possible to stay below the <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">tipping point of 1.5℃</a> global warming. Without action, the future is beyond bleak.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>At Basecamp, we’re committing to becoming carbon negative for our cumulative history and moving forward.<br><br></strong>The first step of that commitment is understanding the size of our carbon footprint. We’ve just completed our first carbon footprinting exercise as a company and are publishing our results. By sharing our approach, we hope to make it easier for other companies to also join the collective mission to carbon negativity. </p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-12784\"></span>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>In 2019, Basecamp’s estimated carbon footprint was ~820 t</strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/apr/27/co2e-global-warming-potential\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>CO2e</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Here’s how that breaks down:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>🏘  <strong>Remote offices: ~5 tCO2e</strong><br>Basecamp is a remote company which means even in the pre-COVID era, we mostly <a href=\"https://m.signalvnoise.com/remote-working-the-home-office-desks-of-basecamp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">work from home</a>. The power drawn to run our work computers and monitors are attributable to Basecamp. We roughly estimated power drawn for 50 Basecampers whose homes are not powered by renewable energy, a laptop + monitor/person for 40 hours/week/Basecamper, 47 work weeks/year, and a CO2e/kWH emissions factor from the US electricity supply average.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>🛌  <strong>Event lodging and meals: ~20 tCO2e<br></strong>As a company, we typically hold two in-person gatherings a year. We also occasionally travel to attend conferences for professional development or train new team members. The majority of the non-transportation emissions from these gatherings are tied to hotel stays, using emission factors from the <a href=\"https://www.hotelfootprints.org/footprinting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Cornell Hotel Sustainability Benchmarking Index</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>💻  <strong>Hardware manufacturing + end-of-life: ~25 tCO2e<br></strong>There are emissions associated with the production and disposal of each laptop, monitor, on-prem server, etc. we use as a company. Those emissions can be prorated by the hardware’s expected lifespan for each year. Several manufacturers helpfully publish their own carbon footprint estimates for their devices so we used those specs to calculate the emissions associated with 56 laptops and monitors and 55 on-prem databases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>✈️  <strong>Transportation: ~75 tCO2e<br></strong>Basecampers flew nearly 400k miles (644k km) and traveled roughly 35k miles (56k km) over ground combined in 2019 for meetups, conferences, and trainings. Those travels translate into roughly 63 tCO2e for flights and 12 tCO2e for ground transport based on <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2020-01/documents/egrid2018_summary_tables.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">EPA emissions data</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>🗄 On-prem hosting: ~80 tCO2e<br></strong>We run several of our applications in on-prem data centers. It takes energy to host the apps, to the tune of roughly 330,000 kWH in 2019. One of our on-prem data centers is powered via an emission-free energy supply contract. After excluding the power from that data center, we translated the power consumption from our remaining on-prem data servers using emissions factors from the <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/electricity/state/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">US Energy Information Administration</a> and global warming potentials from the <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">US Environmental Protection Agency</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>🏢 <strong> Company office: ~120 tCO2e<br></strong>For the last ten years, Basecamp has <a href=\"https://basecamp.com/about/office\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">had a headquarters office</a> in Chicago. It’s a beautiful space that was the gathering grounds for our company meetups. Turns out, that office is also heated by electricity and we used a whopping 261,130 kWH in 2019. In Illinois, 60% of power is generated from fossil fuels so that consumption translates into more emissions than all of our company transportation in 2019. This realization was one of the most shocking findings from our carbon footprint. We’re <a href=\"https://rework.fm/office-space/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">saying goodbye to the office in July</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>📚  <strong>Printed books: ~135 tCO2e<br></strong>Basecamp’s founders have written several <a href=\"https://basecamp.com/books\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">books</a> including <em>REMOTE</em>, <em>REWORK</em>, and <em>It Doesn’t Have to be Crazy at Work</em>. Approximately 45k copies sold in 2019 combined. Using a <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1530-9290.2011.00414.x\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">benchmark</a> of 3 kg CO2e/book puts the footprint of these books in the same ballpark as the company office emissions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>☁️  Cloud hosting (including data transfers and storage): ~285 tCO2e<br></strong>We also use Amazon Web Services to run our apps, with a few supporting infrastructure on Google Cloud Platform. Cloud data centers use a lot of electricity, though there are efficiencies gained by scale. However, not all cloud services are equal from a climate change perspective. Since 2017, GCP has <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/sustainability/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">added enough additional renewable energy</a>sources to the grids its data centers are on to be considered carbon neutral. AWS <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/sustainability/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">can’t say the same thing</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s tough to estimate the carbon footprint of AWS service usage as they do not share power consumption as a metric. So to estimate, we broke down data we do have — server hours used, GB data transferred, and GB stored — and converted to energy consumed and carbon emissions from there. We assumed a 30% discount in power usage for AWS’ servers, based on their own&#160;<a href=\"https://d39w7f4ix9f5s9.cloudfront.net/e3/79/42bf75c94c279c67d777f002051f/carbon-reduction-opportunity-of-moving-to-aws.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">commissioned report</a>&#160;on how much savings typically comes from facility efficiency and renewable energy usage. We then used an extrapolated&#160;<a href=\"https://3.basecamp.com/2914079/buckets/13688293/uploads/2691570270\">research estimate</a>&#160;of kWh/GB used to transfer data over the Internet. Overall, this method led to an estimated 580,000 kWH for cloud compute, 633,000 kWH for data transfer, and 140,000 kWH for data storage in regions that aren’t fully carbon offset in 2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a lot of uncertainty in this estimate, in both directions:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>On one hand, AWS could merit a higher discount on emissions. Their current stated goal is to get to 100% energy offset by 2030 and a significant portion of the renewable energy projects they have invested in appear to be going into the grids that power our apps. We just don’t know for sure and so erred on the environmentally conservative side.</li><li>On the other hand, the extrapolated energy intensity we used for data transfer emissions could have been too generous. If there are any informed experts on the carbon footprint of data transfer out there, we’d love to learn from your work.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>🐛  Wiggle room: 75 tCO2e<br></strong>Since this is our first time doing a carbon footprinting, we assume we’ve missed something decently substantial. For instance, we have not gone through to footprint the upstream indirect emissions from other software vendors, many of which are also hosted on AWS. In an attempt to account for these unknowns, this wiggle room category is an additional 10% of associated emissions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>So in total, this puts us at ~820 tCO2e for 2019. </strong>We’ve also projected a footprint of ~770 tCO2e for 2020 and estimated a very rough historical cumulative carbon footprint of 6,000 tCO2e for 1999-2018.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there’s one more unaccounted for unknown worth mentioning:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>💰  <strong>Banking: ??? tCO2e<br></strong>Money makes the world run and we’re cognizant that our banking partner could easily be the largest source of indirect emissions. In the course of our research, we found a <a href=\"https://www.ran.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/financing_global_warming_(1).pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">2008 report from the Rainforest Action Network</a> that was very eye-opening on the potential footprint. We’re looking for more recent research or data that could help us factor in the indirect emissions from our deposit accounts.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>In the next few weeks, Basecamp will purchase enough certified carbon credits to offset our estimated cumulative carbon footprint and make us carbon neutral. To get to carbon negative, we further invest at least a further $100,000 each year starting this year (2020) to sponsor new carbon offsetting projects. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We will also place even more emphasis internally on the&#160;<em>reduction&#160;</em>of our own emissions: through our choice of vendors, our company events, and our software design. The environmental benefit of not emitting is more certain and immediate than the eventual carbon sequestration from reforestation projects and emerging technologies. We can emit less and we’re going to do the work to do so.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?a=9hW4pzdI7i0:nj48FVBDrWY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?a=9hW4pzdI7i0:nj48FVBDrWY:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/37signals/beMH/~4/9hW4pzdI7i0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 30 Jun 2020 14:12:33 +0000","feedId":612,"bgimg":"https://i1.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/cropped-svn-icon.gif?fit=512%2C512&ssl=1","linkMd5":"dc7b08137d3e525576f9009078538046","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn16@2020_4/2020/08/16/12-18-49-684_b28b911cc848b4e0.webp","destWidth":512,"destHeight":512,"author":"Jane Yang","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn52@2020_4/2020/08/16/12-18-49-123_c6a3f44dc9395323.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn23@2020_5/2020/08/16/12-18-49-706_c650b065e3836c8d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/37signals/beMH/~4/9hW4pzdI7i0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn87@2020_2/2020/08/16/12-18-49-452_89a23bed3ca8af55.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 20:18:28","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 20:18:28","title":"Running spot instances effectively with Amazon EKS","link":"https://m.signalvnoise.com/?p=12742","description":"\n<p>Since we started working on HEY, one of the things that I&#8217;ve been a big proponent of was keeping as much of the app-side compute infrastructure on <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/\">spot instances</a> as possible (front-end and async job processing; excluding the database, Redis, and Elasticsearch). Coming out of our first two weeks running the app with a real production traffic load, we&#8217;re sitting at ~90% of our compute running on spot instances.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Especially around the launch of a new product, you typically don&#8217;t know what traffic and load levels are going to look like, making purchases of <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/reserved-instances/\">reserved instances</a> or <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/savingsplans/\">savings plans</a> a risky proposition. Spot instances give us the ability to get the compute we need at an even deeper discount than a 1-year RI or savings plan rate would, without the same commitment. Combine the price with seamless integration with auto-scaling groups and it makes them a no-brainer for most of our workloads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>The big catch with spot instances? AWS can take them back from you with a two-minute notice.</strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-12742\"></span>\n\n\n\n<h3>Spot-appropriate workloads</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Opting to run the bulk of your workloads on spot only works well if those workloads can handle being torn down and recreated with ease (in our case, via Kubernetes pods). What does &#8220;with ease&#8221; mean though? For us it means without causing exceptions (either customer-facing or internally) or job failures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For HEY, we are able to get away with running the entire front-end stack (<a href=\"https://openresty.org/en/\">OpenResty</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/puma/puma\">Puma</a>) and the bulk of our async background jobs (<a href=\"https://github.com/resque/resque\">Resque</a>) on spot.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Enduring workloads</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What doesn&#8217;t fit well on spot instances? For HEY, we&#8217;ve found three main categories: long-running jobs, Redis instances for <a href=\"https://m.signalvnoise.com/seamless-branch-deploys-with-kubernetes/\">branch deploys</a>, and anything requiring a <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/\">persistent volume</a> (like certain pieces of the mail pipeline). We put these special cases on what we refer to as the &#8220;enduring&#8221; nodegroup that uses regular, on-demand instances (and probably RIs or savings plans in the future).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at each:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Jobs that have the possibility of running for more than a minute-and-a-half to two-minutes are an automatic push over to the enduring node-group. Currently for HEY this is just <a href=\"https://hey.com/faqs/#if-i-don-t-like-hey-can-i-export-my-email-and-contacts\">account exports</a>.</li><li>Redis is a primary infrastructure component for HEY. We use it for a bunch of things &#8212; view caching, Resque, inbound mail pipeline info storage, etc. HEY has a dynamic branch deploy system that deploys any branch in GitHub to a unique hostname, with each of those branch deploys needing their own Redis instances so that they don&#8217;t step on each other (using the Redis databases feature doesn&#8217;t quite work here). For a while we tried running these Redis instances on spot, but ugh, the monitoring noise and random breakage from Redis pods coming and going and then the app connecting to the read-only pod and throwing exceptions&#8230;. it was too much. The fix: get them off of spot instances. <em>[this only affects beta/staging &#8212; those environments use a vendored Redis Helm chart that we run in the cluster, production uses Elasticache]</em></li><li>We&#8217;ve successfully run lots of things that require PVCs in Kubernetes. Heck, for several months we ran the entire Elasticsearch clusters for Basecamp 2 and 3 on Kubernetes without any major issues. <em>But</em> that doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;d recommend it, and I especially do not recommend it when using spot instances. One recurring issue we saw was that a node with a pod using a PVC would get reclaimed and that pod would not have a node to launch on in the same AZ as the existing PVC. Kubernetes <s>absolutely loves this</s> shows this via a volume affinity error and it frequently required manual clean-up to get the pods launching again. Rolling the dice on having to intervene whenever a spot reclamation happens it not worth it to our team.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Getting it right</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>node-termination-handler</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Arguably the most important piece of the spot-with-Kubernetes puzzle is <a href=\"https://github.com/aws/aws-node-termination-handler\">aws-node-termination-handler</a>. It runs as a DaemonSet and continuously watches the EC2 metadata service to see if the current node has been issued any spot termination notifications (or scheduled maintenance notifications). If one is found, it&#8217;ll (attempt to) gracefully remove the running pods so that Kubernetes can schedule them elsewhere with no user impact.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3> cluster-autoscaler</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/cluster-autoscaler\">cluster-autoscaler</a> doesn&#8217;t need many changes to run with a spot auto-scaling group. Since we&#8217;re talking about ensuring that instance termination behaviors are handled appropriately though, you should know about the pain we went through to get ASG rebalancing handled properly. When rebalancing, we&#8217;d see nodes that just died and the ALB would continue to send traffic to them via kube-proxy because there was no warning to kubelet that they were about to go away. aws-node-termination-handler <a href=\"https://github.com/aws/aws-node-termination-handler/issues/95\">cannot handle rebalancing</a> currently, but I believe that <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managed-node-groups.html\">EKS managed nodegroups</a> do &#8212; at the expense of not supporting spot instances. A project called <a href=\"https://github.com/keikoproj/lifecycle-manager\">lifecycle-manager</a> proved to be critical for us in handling rebalancing with ease (even though we ended up just disabling rebalancing all together 😬).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Instance types and sizes</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s wise to do your own testing and determine how your workloads consume CPU and memory resources and choose your EC2 instance types and sizes accordingly. Spot ASGs are most valuable when the ASG scheduler can pick from many different instance types and sizes to fill your spot requests. Without spreading that load across many types (or sizes), you run the risk of being impacted by capacity events where AWS cannot fulfill your spot request. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, we had this happen to us earlier in the year when spot demand skyrocketed. We ran into issues with the ASG telling us there was no spot capacity to fulfill our request, and when things were fulfilled, it wasn&#8217;t uncommon for those instances to be reclaimed just a few minutes later. The churn was untenable at that rate. The fix for us was to run with other instance types and sizes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our workloads perform best with C-series instances, we know this, so that&#8217;s what we use. However, if you can get away with using M or T-series instances, do it (they have comparable CPU/memory requests across the size range and you easily pull from m5, m5d, m5n, etc. to add more variability to your spot requests).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>A gotcha:</em> cluster-autoscaler really does not like mixed-instance ASGs where the CPU and memory requests are not the same across the available node types. It can leave you in a position where it thinks the ASG has 8c/16g nodes while the ASG actually fulfilled a request using a 4c/8g node &#8212; now cluster-autoscaler&#8217;s math on how many instances it needs for the set of unschedulable pods is incorrect.

If you&#8217;re scheduling only in us1-az2, you&#8217;re paying an 18% premium over us1-az1. If your ASG is setup to span AZs, this is automatically taken into account when fulfilling spot requests and AWS will try to place your instances in cheaper AZs if possible (unless you&#8217;ve changed the scheduling priority option).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s not just availability zones where there are real price disparities. Among different regions, the price differences can be even stronger. Take us-east-1 and us-east-2 &#8212; two regions where the prices of compute are typically the same for on-demand reservations. In us-east-2, spot requests for c5.2xlarge instances are currently going for between 40-50% cheaper than the same thing in us-east-1:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"12746\" data-permalink=\"https://m.signalvnoise.com/running-spot-instances-effectively-with-amazon-eks/image-4-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-4.png?fit=1564%2C1008&#38;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1564,1008\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&#34;aperture&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;credit&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;camera&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;caption&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;created_timestamp&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;copyright&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;focal_length&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;iso&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;shutter_speed&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;orientation&#34;:&#34;0&#34;}\" data-image-title=\"image-4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-4.png?fit=600%2C387&#38;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i1.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-4.png?fit=640%2C412&#38;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-4.png?w=640&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-12746\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-4.png?w=1564&#38;ssl=1 1564w, https://i1.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-4.png?resize=600%2C387&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-4.png?resize=768%2C495&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-4.png?resize=1536%2C990&#38;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-4.png?w=1280&#38;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>c5.2xlarge, us-east-2 &#8212; courtesy of spotcost.com</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a significant savings at scale. Of course there are other obligations for running in other regions &#8212; are all of the services you use supported, can you reach other infrastructure you may have, etc. (and it&#8217;s also possible that moving to another region for price alone just doesn&#8217;t make sense for you, that&#8217;s totally fine!).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Leveling up</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Merely running compute on spot isn&#8217;t the end-goal though, and there are several paths that we can take to continue to level-up our compute infrastructure to place resources optimally, both from a cost standpoint and for keeping things close to the end user.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>[shorter term] <strong>Using the <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/\">Horizontal Pod Autoscaler</a> to automatically scale <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/\">deployment</a> replica counts as traffic to the platform regularly ebbs and flows.</strong> When combined with cluster-autoscaler, Kubernetes (with a lot of trust from your ops team&#8230;..) can take care of scaling your infrastructure automatically based on CPU utilization, request latency, request count, etc. HEY is already starting to show a standard traffic pattern where usage is highest during the US work hours and then drops greatly overnight and on the weekends. These are perfect times to scale the app down to a smaller deployment size. Front-end compute isn&#8217;t the biggest cost driver for HEY (that falls to persistent data storage infrastructure like Aurora and Elasticache), but scaling <em>something</em> down when you can is better than not scaling anything at all.</li><li>[long term] <strong>Shunting compute between regions and AZs based on spot pricing.</strong> This is likely to not be something that a company the size of Basecamp ever needs to think about, but being able to shunt traffic around to different regions and AZs based on compute cost and availability is a dream stretch goal. This is tricky because we also need to take into account where our data backends live. Maybe you&#8217;re already running an active/active/active setup with three regions around the world and can gradually shift your scaling operations around the different regions as different parts of the world start to wake-up and use your app. Maybe you&#8217;re just using a simpler active/active setup, but compute prices or availability in region A start to show signs of trouble, you can easily move over to region B.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Spot instances can be a great tool for managing spend while getting the compute resources you need, but they come with additional challenges that you must remain aware of. Going down this path isn&#8217;t a one-time decision &#8212; especially with an app that is seeing active development, you have to be mindful of changing resource utilization and workflows to ensure that spot terminations don&#8217;t cause harm to your workloads and customers, and that changes in core spot features (like pricing and availability) don&#8217;t impact you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news is that if spot does turn out to be a negative for you, moving to on-demand is a single change to your auto-scaling group config and then gradually relaunching your existing instances.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p><em>If you&#8217;re interested in HEY, checkout <a href=\"https://hey.com\">hey.com</a> and learn about our take on email. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Blake is Senior System Administrator on Basecamp’s Operations team who spends most of his time working with Kubernetes, and AWS, in some capacity.

It’s been about 16 years since people were last excited about getting a new email address – Gmail was introduced in 2004 – and frankly, it shows. These legacy services have been virtually devoid of innovation for over a decade.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And why wouldn’t they be! They’ve already captured the market. Between Gmail, owned by Google, Hotmail/Outlook, owned by Microsoft, and AOL Mail/Yahoo Mail, owned by Verizon, you have about 85% of the US email market captured by three players. And out of that, Gmail alone is about 55 percentage points.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But! Despite this near-total capture by big tech, the underlying protocol of email is still just barely free and open. You don’t have to ask anyone’s permission to make a new email service. (Or so we thought.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fast forward millions of dollars in investment to June 15, 2020, which was the day we opened the doors to <a href=\"https://hey.com\">our new email service</a>, and were met by every entrepreneur’s dream: amazing reviews and customers tripping over themselves to signup and pay for our product.</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-12833\"></span>\n\n\n\n<p>But the celebration didn’t last long. That same day, we also received a rejection letter from Apple’s App Store, saying that the HEY application they had just approved a few days earlier, was actually not in compliance with their rules after all, and unless we started using their payment processing system, along with the 30% cut of revenue it would entail, they’d kick us out of the store.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first reaction was simply disbelief. We’ve been in Apple’s App Store with <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/basecamp-3/id1015603248\">our Basecamp application</a>, which also sells service subscriptions on the web, and simply has an iOS application that allows someone to access that subscription, since around 2012. This was not our first time at the rodeo!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We had studied Apple’s written rules, the precedents they’ve set, and were well-aware of all their unwritten rules too. Gmail, for example, also sells subscription email services and has <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gmail-email-by-google/id422689480\">the #1 Productivity app</a> in the App Store. But they do not pay Apple 30% of revenues nor offer in-app payment. So we thought this was simply a mistake, and tried to appeal through all the backchannels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>None of that worked. Apple doubled down the very next day on us either paying them 30% or face eviction from the App Store. So here we are, on day two of a massively successful product launch, which was supposed to be about fighting THE OTHER big tech monopolist in our orbit, Google, and we’re suddenly in a battle for our very existence over Apple’s threat to kick us out of the App Store.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After exhausting all our modes of appeal, <a href=\"https://hey.com/apple/\">I went bananas on twitter in a thread that went viral</a>, and which prompted dozens of dozens of other developers to reach out to me in private with similar tales, the press to take a keen interest, and customers to be outraged at Apple’s shakedown tactics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let’s pause for a moment here in this story. Why is what Apple’s doing a problem? Couldn’t we just take our service somewhere else?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a word, no. Apple is unlike any other platform when it comes to the North American market for premium services like HEY. As of today, 90% of everyone who pays for our service uses at least one Apple device. 3/4 of all paying customers have the iOS HEY app that Apple was threatening to evict installed on their phone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple isn’t just a dominant player in this market, they are the market. Without access to the iPhone, we’re dead. And even customers who’d ALREADY signed up for our new service told us as much: Unless we could guarantee that our app would be available and be updated, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MSliwinski/status/1273902019020050432\">they just couldn’t commit to becoming or staying customers</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So those are the stakes: Apple controls who can and cannot compete in virtually all sectors of the digital economy through the monopoly power they wield capriciously with the App Store. It is simply not possible to even get the chance to take on the likes of Google, Microsoft, and Verizon with a new email service without begging Apple for permission to do so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We were sitting on a rocket ship of a successful new service, eager to hire more people (we counted that we’d need to hire 12 more people to deal with the new business!), but were at the same time essentially paralyzed from making any investments, because what if Apple wouldn’t give us the permission to exist?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s worth noting here that we are already paying Apple for the privilege of having access to the App Store. All developers must pay $99/year for a <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/programs/whats-included/\">developer license</a>. Apple <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/ios/app-store/principles-practices/\">brags of having millions of developers</a>, so they’re in essence already making hundreds of millions of dollars, just in licensing fees. Nobody is asking for a free ride here! If it costs Apple more than hundreds of millions of dollars to run the App Store, they can raise their prices. We’d gladly pay $199/year for a developer license.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what Apple is asking for is a cut of revenues, at <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21295778/apple-app-store-hey-email-fees-policies-antitrust-wwdc-2020\">“highway robbery rates”</a>, and it’s simply absurd. Imagine if the telcos demanded a cut of company revenues, since they provide the phone line that connects customers, in the heyday of their monopoly? Imagine if the railroads demanded a cut of company revenues from the goods shipped in the heyday of their monopoly?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s customers have already paid Apple upwards of $1400 to buy their iPhone. This is why Apple is a 1.67T company as of today! They are the most profitable technology company the world has ever seen. They already charge developers licensing fees that amount to hundreds of millions of dollars in order to reach these iPhone users. But now they also want to force the entire digital economy to hand over 30% of revenues? Absurd is one word you could use, illegal should be another.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, back to our tale of woe. After a two-week campaign, fighting on twitter, in the media, and seeing customers support our cause in the thousands, Apple backed off. But only by an inch. We escaped the 30% cut, but they <a href=\"https://hey.com/apple/path/\">forced us to come up with a new free, temporary email service</a>, such that the app would “do something” when you download it. That solution came from a new, unwritten rule that Phil Schiller, the Apple VP responsible for the App Store, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/interview-apples-schiller-says-position-on-hey-app-is-unchanged-and-no-rules-changes-are-imminent/\">made up on the fly</a> in interview with the press.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Never mind the fact that there are scores of apps that follow the path we had originally taken, where you can’t use the app unless you login with an existing subscription bought elsewhere. Including Netflix, most banks, and one of Apple’s own apps. Someone compiled an inventory of examples at <a href=\"https://youdownloadtheappanditdoesntwork.com\">https://youdownloadtheappanditdoesntwork.com</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So Apple, who otherwise purports to being this champion of privacy, is telling a new privacy-focused, for-pay email service that we must offer a free tier to be allowed in the App Store. I’m sure this committee is well aware of how companies have been monetizing free services on the internet. It’s usually with invasive ads, sale of data, or other privacy-intrusive tactics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A company like Facebook, that makes tens of billions of dollars every year from their iOS app, simply has to pay Apple the $99/year developer license. But our HEY service would have to pay Apple $300,000/year, if we made but a million dollars? It doesn’t take a degree in formal logic to spot the contradiction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple should not be able to restrict software innovation in the US. They should not be allowed to tell a service like HEY whether we can run a paid service or have to offer a free tier. Even our story with HEY, despite that we won some relief in the court of public opinion, has become a cautionary tale. What other small software company is going to invest years of effort and millions of dollars in a new service, if Apple might kill them dead on their birthday. This is how you stifle entrepreneurship, depress innovation, and prevent the next generation of makers from ever having a chance to compete.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve focused on Apple in this example, because that’s the surprise adversary we faced. But the story could just as well had been about Google, if our app had been of a different sort or in a different market. Google’s Play Store policies are essentially the same as Apple’s, although they’ve wielded them slightly less aggressively so far. But make no mistake, if Apple gets off scot-free, Google is surely coming for their 30% cut of the entire digital economy as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this is really the essence of this investigation, isn’t it. In everything from software to advertising to books and beyond, the big four tech companies have captured insufferable monopolies that they’re using to distort and shakedown markets, prevent new companies from succeeding, and ensure they never actually have to compete on the merits of innovation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s indeed insufferable. And congress must act.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Specifically for Apple, our plea is simple: Force Apple to give us the choice of payment processing, and the freedom to tell customers. If Apple faced competition for their 30% cut, it would not be 30% for very long. Customers would win by seeing lower prices, be able to purchase subscriptions directly from companies, and Apple’s competitors would not be unfairly disadvantaged.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the essence of the two EU investigations that, as irony would have it, were announced the very same week that Apple threatened to kill our new business. It won’t solve everything, but would go a very long way to restoring basic competition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>See also <a href=\"https://m.signalvnoise.com/testimony-before-the-house-antitrust-subcommittee/\">my past testimony in front of the House Antitrust Subcommittee</a></em>, <em>which was delivered before HEY had even launched, and addresses the same issues around the App Store.</em></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?a=EwDJ8lf1X50:UnkQMsTyQFg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?a=EwDJ8lf1X50:UnkQMsTyQFg:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/37signals/beMH/~4/EwDJ8lf1X50\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 17 Jul 2020 17:27:38 +0000","feedId":612,"bgimg":"https://i1.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/cropped-svn-icon.gif?fit=512%2C512&ssl=1","linkMd5":"a7f70a7fb3e4858c0dd8a846cb85419e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn16@2020_4/2020/08/16/12-18-49-684_b28b911cc848b4e0.webp","destWidth":512,"destHeight":512,"author":"DHH","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn52@2020_4/2020/08/16/12-18-49-123_c6a3f44dc9395323.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn23@2020_5/2020/08/16/12-18-49-706_c650b065e3836c8d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/37signals/beMH/~4/EwDJ8lf1X50":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn7@2020_1/2020/08/16/12-18-49-535_e38d21243804a827.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 20:18:28","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 20:18:28","title":"How we achieve “simple design” for Basecamp and HEY","link":"https://m.signalvnoise.com/?p=12822","description":"\n<p>Yesterday I got an email asking how we achieve simple designs for Basecamp and HEY, so I hastily tweeted <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://twitter.com/jonasdowney/status/1280620028774305792?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a screenshot of my answer</a>, and a lot of people responded to it. A few folks pointed out that my screenshot was illegible for blind users, so I&#8217;m reposting it here in full text, with a bit of additional commentary below. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>At a high level it boils down to a handful of foundational principles that affect the decisions we make:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Always choosing clarity over being slick or fancy. Internally we call this &#8220;Fisher Price&#8221; design. We aim to make the UI totally obvious and self explanatory, by keeping individual screens simple, showing only one focused thing at a time, and so on. Good product design eliminates the need for an instruction manual!</li><li>Preferring good copywriting, and taking the time and space to explain things with words, instead of making minimalist UIs with lots of unlabeled buttons, etc. (Although we&#8217;re still guilty of having a few of those.)</li><li>Prioritizing respectful interfaces that don&#8217;t overwhelm or try to nag the user into certain behaviors. We intentionally don&#8217;t include things like notification counts/badges, 3-column designs, and such unless we absolutely can&#8217;t avoid them. We don&#8217;t like the idea of having &#8220;sticky&#8221; interfaces—we want our customers to use our products to get the job done, and then go do something else. That makes the whole design approach more peaceful in general.</li><li>Having a strong editorial sensibility, and knowing when to split complex concepts into simpler individual parts. This one is more of an art than a science, but we have a good instinct for breaking down problems until they can be easily understood in simple UI flows.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s one other thing that&#8217;s important for simple design. It&#8217;s not merely a matter of having clear or basic-looking interfaces. (It&#8217;s easy to make a simple UI that doesn&#8217;t really do much.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The magic combo is having simple interfaces paired with powerful capabilities below the surface. HEY looks simple, and it&#8217;s straightforward to use, but it&#8217;s backed by some deeply considered opinions, logic, and machinery that empowers people who use it to be <em>better at email</em> than they were before—and with less effort! The interface itself is simple, but the thinking and the system behind it is extremely complex. The product is valuable because it saves people time and anxiety dealing with the terrible email mess that they had just learned to live with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more on this line of thinking, we highly recommend Kathy Sierra&#8217;s <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/books/badass-making-users-awesome/9781491919019\">Badass: Making Users Awesome</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(P.S. many thanks to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/waynedixon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">@waynedixon</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/redcrew\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">@redcrew</a> for calling me out on the inaccessible screenshot tweet.

Text on a page, maybe a masthead graphic of some sort. Nothing sophisticated. It often looked like traditional letterhead, or a printed newsletter, but now on the screen. Interactions were few, if any, but perhaps a couple links tied a nascent site together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there was the other extreme. Highly stylized, lots of textures, 3D-style buttons, page curls, aggressive shadows, monolithic graphics cut up with image maps to allow you to click on different parts of a single graphic, etc. This style was aped from interactive CD/DVD interfaces that came before it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both of these styles — the masthead with text, and the heavily graphical  — were <em>ports</em>. Not adaptations, but ports. Designs ported from one medium to another. No one knew what to make of the web at that time, so we pulled over things we were familiar with and sunk them in place. At that time, Web design wasn&#8217;t web design &#8211; it was print design, multimedia/interactive design, and graphic design. It took years for native web design to come into its own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The web became great when designers started designing <em>for</em> the web, not bringing other designs <em>to</em> the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Porting things between platforms is common, especially when the new thing is truly brand new (or trying to gain traction). As the Mac gained steam in the late 80s and early 90s, and Windows 3 came out in 1990, a large numbers of Windows/PC developers began to port their software to the Mac. They didn&#8217;t write Mac software, they ported Windows software. And you could tell &#8211; it was pretty shit. It was nice to have at a time when the Mac wasn&#8217;t widely developed, but, it was clearly ported.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When something&#8217;s ported, it&#8217;s obvious.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stuff that&#8217;s ported lacks the native sensibilities of the receiving platform. It doesn&#8217;t celebrate the advantages, it only meets the lowest possible bar. Everyone knows it. Sometimes we&#8217;re simply glad to have it because it&#8217;s either that or nothing, but there&#8217;s rarely a ringing endorsement of something that&#8217;s so obviously moved from A to B without consideration for what makes B, B.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What we&#8217;re seeing today is history repeat itself. This time we&#8217;re not talking about porting software or technology, we&#8217;re talking about porting a way to work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In-person office work is a platform. It has its own advantages and disadvantages. Some things are easier in person (meetings, if you&#8217;re into those), and some things are harder (getting a few hours to yourself so you can focus, if you&#8217;re into that).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remote work is another platform. It has its own unique flavor, advantages, and disadvantages. Its own efficiencies, its own quirks, its own interface. Upsides, downsides, insides, and outsides. It&#8217;s as different from in-office work as the Mac is from Windows. Yes, they&#8217;re both operating systems, and methods of computing, but they&#8217;re miles apart where it matters. The same is true for the difference between in-office work and remote work. Yup, it&#8217;s all still the same work, but it&#8217;s a different <em>way</em> to work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In-office and remote work are different <em>platforms of work</em>. And right now, what we&#8217;re seeing a lot of companies attempt to port local work methods to working remotely. Normally have four meetings a day in person? Then let&#8217;s have those same four meetings, with those same participants, over Zoom instead. It&#8217;s a way, but it&#8217;s the wrong way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simulating in-person office work remotely does both approaches a disservice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is often what happens when change is abrupt. We bring what we know from one to the other. We apply what we&#8217;re familiar with to the unfamiliar. But, in time, we recognize that doesn&#8217;t work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The enlightened companies coming out of this pandemic will be the ones that figured out <a href=\"https://basecamp.com/books/remote\">the right way to work remotely</a>. They&#8217;ll have stopped trying to make remote look like local. They&#8217;ll have discovered that remote work means more autonomy, more trust, more uninterrupted stretches of time, smaller teams, more independent, concurrent work (and less dependent, sequenced work).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They won&#8217;t be the ones that just have their waste-of-time meetings online, they&#8217;ll be the ones that lay waste to the meetings. They won&#8217;t be the ones that depend on checking in on people constantly throughout the day, they&#8217;ll be the ones that give their employees time and space to do their best work. They won&#8217;t be the ones that can&#8217;t wait to pull everyone back to the office, they&#8217;ll be the ones that spot the advantages of optionality, and recognize a wonderful resilience in being able to work from anywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they&#8217;ll be the ones that finally realize that there&#8217;s nothing magical about the office. It&#8217;s just a space where work <em>can</em> happen, but not where it <em>must</em> happen. Anytime a myth is busted is a good time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Work remotely, don&#8217;t port the office.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?a=pqFWQbHjtMQ:yK2bd7UACr8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?a=pqFWQbHjtMQ:yK2bd7UACr8:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/37signals/beMH/~4/pqFWQbHjtMQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 24 Jul 2020 19:49:50 +0000","feedId":612,"bgimg":"https://i1.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/cropped-svn-icon.gif?fit=512%2C512&ssl=1","linkMd5":"e51185f47cfd713f24f7762aa1f5a12c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn16@2020_4/2020/08/16/12-18-49-684_b28b911cc848b4e0.webp","destWidth":512,"destHeight":512,"author":"Jason Fried","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn52@2020_4/2020/08/16/12-18-49-123_c6a3f44dc9395323.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn23@2020_5/2020/08/16/12-18-49-706_c650b065e3836c8d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/37signals/beMH/~4/pqFWQbHjtMQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx20/cdn51@2020_5/2020/08/16/12-18-49-960_ccb47072653a90b0.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 20:18:28","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 20:18:28","title":"The evolution of HEY: from humble beginnings to a multi-platform email service","link":"https://m.signalvnoise.com/?p=12736","description":"\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"12768\" data-permalink=\"https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-evolution-of-hey/screen-shot-2020-06-29-at-3-28-05-pm/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-29-at-3.28.05-PM.png?fit=2884%2C1228&#38;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2884,1228\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&#34;aperture&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;credit&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;camera&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;caption&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;created_timestamp&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;copyright&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;focal_length&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;iso&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;shutter_speed&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;orientation&#34;:&#34;0&#34;}\" data-image-title=\"HEY\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-29-at-3.28.05-PM.png?fit=600%2C255&#38;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-29-at-3.28.05-PM.png?fit=640%2C272&#38;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-29-at-3.28.05-PM.png?fit=640%2C272&#38;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-12768\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-29-at-3.28.05-PM.png?w=2884&#38;ssl=1 2884w, https://i0.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-29-at-3.28.05-PM.png?resize=600%2C255&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-29-at-3.28.05-PM.png?resize=1800%2C766&#38;ssl=1 1800w, https://i0.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-29-at-3.28.05-PM.png?resize=768%2C327&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-29-at-3.28.05-PM.png?resize=1536%2C654&#38;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-29-at-3.28.05-PM.png?resize=2048%2C872&#38;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-29-at-3.28.05-PM.png?w=1280&#38;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-29-at-3.28.05-PM.png?w=1920&#38;ssl=1 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Two weeks ago we released <a href=\"https://hey.com\">HEY</a> into the world, the culmination of 2+ years of explorations and intensely focused work.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It goes without saying, but I’ll say it anyway: inventing a new product from scratch is one hell of a challenge. It’s the toughest thing you’ll ever do as a product team. There are a million reasons why it won’t work, and zero guarantees that it will, so the whole project is a massive gamble. You just have to buckle up and trust that you’ll figure things out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since HEY made a big splash on arrival, I thought it’d be fun to share the backstory of how we ended up reinventing email. Because we certainly didn’t <em>start</em> by wanting to reinvent email. (That sounds hard and intractable!)</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-12736\"></span>\n\n\n\n<p>For the past several years, even pre-dating the work on HEY, we noticed some ongoing communications problems at our company. They all revolved around external email: things like going back and forth with lawyers, working with benefits providers, dealing with press outlets, accountants, and stuff like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was too hard to keep the right people in the loop, because we’d have lots of email threads scattered around with different participants, and none of them had the complete story. It was too hard to get caught up on a project that someone else was working on with a vendor. And too hard to hand work off when someone went on vacation or parental leave. At best, you&#8217;d end up with a steaming hot pile of forwarded emails, and it was all a chaotic mess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was in total contrast to our well-tended internal communications, which all lives tidily in <a href=\"https://basecamp.com\">Basecamp</a> (the app), and suffers none of those problems. But Basecamp is mainly a company tool, and it’s not so reasonable to ask our miscellaneous vendors to join Basecamp just to communicate with us. So what’s the equivalent of Basecamp for the outside world?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, it didn&#8217;t exist! So we began thinking about how we might solve these problems with a new product. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At first, we were considering making a successor to our older CRM product, <a class=\"yoast-seo-link\" href=\"https://highrisehq.com\">Highrise</a>. Highrise was our first take on the external communications world, but it doesn&#8217;t do nearly enough to cover all the scenarios we wanted to solve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>And thus, HEY started its life as a prototype for a possible Highrise 2.</strong> It was originally focused around work problems—not personal email problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>In May of 2018, <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://twitter.com/jasonfried\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Jason</a> and I kicked off the first work on a prototype, built in <a href=\"https://jekyllrb.com\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Jekyll</a>, which was code-named <strong>Haystack</strong>. We were intent on addressing real-life situations right away, so I asked our Head of People Ops, <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://twitter.com/alarowe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Andrea</a>, to find the gnarliest vendor email threads she’d been involved with recently. She forwarded all the emails to me, along with any internal chats she had <em>about</em> those emails. Using that source material, I painstakingly reconstructed all the conversations into seed data for our prototype. That way we’d have some real stuff to judge our ideas against.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We started by designing how these internal/external threads might look and work, then gradually worked our way out to the Inbox view, and finally filled in various supplemental ideas around the edges. We focused specifically on email pain points, and discarded any notion of how email &#8220;usually works&#8221; in favor of the way we would ideally want it to work, while also considering what we could realistically foresee building.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a few months of prototyping, it looked like this.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-3 is-cropped\"><ul

Prototype</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Having explored lots of different examples and core ideas (including the nascent version of <a href=\"https://hey.com/features/the-screener/\">The Screener</a>, the <a href=\"https://hey.com/features/all-files/\">All Files view</a>, and contact pages), we felt like we had something promising. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>None of it really worked, there were still a million unknowns, and loads of features we hadn&#8217;t figured out yet, but there was one thing we were sure about—it had evolved far beyond just a better Highrise. If we were going to build it, it needed to become a complete email service. And if it was going to be an email service, it needed to have a personal version, of course!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Phase 2: Building it</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>By early 2019 we started the process of making HEY real. At first we used the prototype&#8217;s general skeleton as a foundation to start wiring things up, but we continued to hone the app&#8217;s visual design. Our brilliant marketing designer <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://twitter.com/AdamStddrd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Adam</a> joined up, and he helped us shed all the experimental cruft from the original design, paring things back and making the whole thing more minimal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam also developed the original color palettes and menu

minimalism</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Phase 3: Tightening up, adding features, and doing all the hard work</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Designing with a team where everyone has autonomy is a bit like playing in a band. Someone seeds an idea, and then someone else builds on it and takes it somewhere else, then those changes get promoted into little systems, and over time the best ideas persist through all the changes. Harmonies prevail. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can see that taking place in the screenshots above, but it really picked up steam from mid-2019 on, when the whole the company started working in earnest. For a while there was a lot of tug-of-war design and development between the web and mobile teams, where all of us bent and stretched the system for what we needed on our respective platforms. Since HEY is a hybrid web app, we ended up building a ton of new tech to optimize for UI patterns that would work equally well on a phone or a laptop (we&#8217;ll be sharing a lot more about that soon.) <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://twitter.com/conormuirhead\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Conor</a> led the way on a lot of those efforts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By early 2020 we had worked out most of the fundamentals. We had Reply Later and Set Aside, and we had The Feed, which at that time was called &#8220;Slowbox&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-3 is-cropped\"><ul

Creating a reliable, robust, functional email service is no joke. We obviously had big ideas, and wanted to do something new and inventive, but we also had to do something old and unsexy: <strong>make the thing actually work as well as products like Gmail.</strong> Those platforms have been around for 15 years and have massive amounts of engineering talent backing them up—and we&#8217;re just a handful of people working our tails off to make the best thing we could. It took the full force of <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://basecamp.com/about/team\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">every single person at Basecamp</a> to make this happen, especially our R&#38;D, Ops, and Security teams, who had to invent loads of new systems for us.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>We pulled it off 😅, but we&#8217;re still just barely getting started.

pushers might go down the rabbit hole of escalation once we gave HEY users <a href=\"https://hey.com/spy-trackers/\">the power to defend themselves</a>. Just like virus and malware makers are constantly trying to defeat anti-virus and other security protections. But I guess we didn’t realize just how quickly it would happen!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter GMass, a plugin for Gmail that adds spy-pixel tracking, amongst a grab bag of other stuff. They hadn’t been on our original list of 50+ services we name’n’shame, but thanks to a new blog post where they <a href=\"https://www.gmass.co/blog/tracking-pixel-blockers/\">brag about defeating protections</a> that recipients might take to defend themselves, they came onto our radar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This lead to an in-depth investigation into how their latest techniques work, and we spent the whole day coming up with a new process of detecting GMass&#8217; spy pixels. It just shipped! And now HEY will name&#8217;n&#8217;shame GMass, just like we do the other fifty-odd pushers of this kind of surveillance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, like those virus and malware makers, GMass may try to defeat our protections again. And we&#8217;ll then have to adapt once more, and so we will. Internet security is a constantly moving target. But we can hope that Google will soon stop being a conduit for this kind of privacy abuse on the Gmail platform. Just like they don&#8217;t tolerate being used for spamming or phishing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the mean time, we&#8217;ll continue to do the work both on a general level to protect against all forms of privacy attacks against HEY users, but also specifically to identity bad actors, and to call out the users who employ their software for spying.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have a surveillance-free Friday!</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/37signals/beMH?a=ZTPUe_-smbc:WViCRqBCOek:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img
