It's been a pretty draining and emotional time over the last few months. I love the team and expect them all to go on to great things.</p>\n\n<h3>Part 2</h3>\n\n<p>Part 2 of the experiment was really well received. Links from well respected blogs drove a lot of traffic:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Marco Arment - <a href=\"http://www.marco.org/2013/08/16/an-app-store-experiment\">Stuart Hall’s App Store Experiment</a></li>\n<li>Mac Stories - <a href=\"http://www.macstories.net/linked/stuart-halls-app-store-experiment/\">Stuart Hall’s App Store Experiment</a></li>\n<li>iOS Dev Weekly - <a href=\"http://iosdevweekly.com/issues/107\">An App Store Experiment</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h3>Downloads</h3>\n\n<p>For the rest of 2013 the downloads didn't achieve the levels of the early days:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/stuartkhall.com/An+App+Experiment+Part+3/3+-+Downloads.png\" alt=\"Downloads\" /></p>\n\n<p>But if we look past the early craziness, downloads are still strong and flat, in the vicinity of 2,500 per day.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/stuartkhall.com/An+App+Experiment+Part+3/4+-+Downloads+Zoomed.png\" alt=\"Downloads Zoomed\" /></p>\n\n<p>Note, that all these downloads were achieved by either App Store discovery or word of mouth. I didn't do any other promotion.</p>\n\n<h3>Sales</h3>\n\n<p>So with steady downloads I'd expect steady sales numbers, right?</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/stuartkhall.com/An+App+Experiment+Part+3/1+-+Sales.png\" alt=\"Sales\" /></p>\n\n<p>Sales were in steady decline over 2013, which can be seen even more easily with a cumulative graph.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/stuartkhall.com/An+App+Experiment+Part+3/2+-+Cumulative.png\" alt=\"Sales Cumulated\" /></p>\n\n<p>Almost 70% of the profit was from the US.</p>\n\n<h3>In App Purchase Price</h3>\n\n<p>Here is the one place I did a little bit of work, I experimented with the in app purchase at 99c, $1.99 and $2.99. I ran each of them for one week and as you can see from the profit charts above it was very flat. Any increase (or decrease) in price was offset be the number of purchases.</p>\n\n<h3>Australian Feature</h3>\n\n<p>Apple were kind enough to feature the app on the front page in Australia, which isn't the biggest store but this still had a very positive impact on sales and downloads. The app even reach number two overall on the free charts, just behind Apple's 12 Days of Gifts.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/stuartkhall.com/An+App+Experiment+Part+3/feature.PNG\" alt=\"feature\" />\n<img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/stuartkhall.com/An+App+Experiment+Part+3/number+2.PNG\" alt=\"number 2\" />\n<img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/stuartkhall.com/An+App+Experiment+Part+3/feature+downloads.png\" alt=\"feature downloads\" />\n<img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/stuartkhall.com/An+App+Experiment+Part+3/feature+sales.png\" alt=\"feature sales\" /></p>\n\n<h3>Christmas and New Year - Resolutions</h3>\n\n<p>Christmas saw the millionth download and some significant spikes in both sales and downloads. The new year took it to a new level. Profits were steady through most of November and December at $50 a day. During the first half of January that figure quadrupled to $200 a day. New year resolutions are definitely a positive for fitness apps.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/stuartkhall.com/An+App+Experiment+Part+3/new+year+downloads.png\" alt=\"new year downloads\" />\n<img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/stuartkhall.com/An+App+Experiment+Part+3/new+year+sales.png\" alt=\"new year sales\" /></p>\n\n<h3>The Stats</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>1,412,803 downloads (5,697 per day)</li>\n<li>$27,317 in revenue</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h3>Part 4</h3>\n\n<p>Even though the stats look pretty healthy, the revenue per user is crazy low at at around 2 cents per user.</p>\n\n<p>So the big unanswered question left for me is what would people be more willing to pay for? I've had complaints about having to upgrade for features, so would people be more willing to pay for more content instead?</p>\n\n<p>As of today <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/7-minute-workout/id650762525?mt=8&amp;at=11l4LZ&amp;ct=p2\">version 2 is available</a> with two new workouts as in app purchases. The updated version also has some great new videos from <a href=\"http://efit30.com.au/\">efit30.com.au</a> who are in the process of remaking all the videos for the app.</p>\n\n<p>What will this do to sales? Stay tuned!
