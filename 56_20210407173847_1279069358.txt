The goal is to help all types of companies become innovation leaders. It caters to young entrepreneurs involved in the startup ecosystem who are looking to take their ideas one step further. tbpmx created a graphic universe to exhibit expertise and quality, hence reflecting Linker Logic's services. Therefore the logo and icon were built with versatility in mind, for them to be adaptable to any narrative while being visible. The editorial is meant to be slick while remaining clean and professional, making information easy to digest while being very appealing. This is supported by a bold color palette based on evident contrasts that keep the brand away from the usual color gradients commonly seen within the tech industry. All of this is topped with a dynamic brand universe composed of a series of graphic assets that contribute to the brand's dynamism.","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 06 Apr 2021 10:00:17 +0000","feedId":56,"bgimg":"https://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/projects/404/9a44f7116571715.Y3JvcCwxNTM0LDEyMDAsMTMyLDA.jpg","linkMd5":"fa7229ad29d335dfda53bde35d75741e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn18@2020_4/2021/04/07/17-38-06-612_404090bc5cf0dbb6.webp","destWidth":404,"destHeight":316,"sourceBytes":43034,"destBytes":12210,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/projects/404/9a44f7116571715.Y3JvcCwxNTM0LDEyMDAsMTMyLDA.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn18@2020_4/2021/04/07/17-38-06-612_404090bc5cf0dbb6.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617817086358},{"createdTime":"2021-04-08 01:38:06","updatedTime":"2021-04-08 01:38:06","title":"\"Forests-Wonders\" children book project","link":"https://www.behance.net/gallery/116130435/Forests-Wonders-children-book-project","description":"<img src='https://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/projects/404/fd81b6116130435.Y3JvcCw4MDgsNjMyLDAsMA.jpg' style='float:left;

We collaborated with their musicians, audiences, staff, executive leadership, and board members to define a shared vision for the brand, one which would become the foundation for creative and design experimentation.\n\nLeveraging new creative technologies, the new identity will use a custom variable font ? developed in close collaboration with DINAMO ? to bring the essence of sound and music to life. The identity juxtaposes the traditional with the contemporary ? introducing new, dynamic, behavior for classical letterforms.","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 06 Apr 2021 18:00:11 +0000","feedId":56,"bgimg":"https://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/projects/404/f79342114622191.606c815dcfabc.jpg","linkMd5":"4a399dd4413d03e0307b03b061c38359","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn15@2020_2/2021/04/07/17-38-06-569_826c093c987b4e39.webp","destWidth":404,"destHeight":316,"sourceBytes":9535,"destBytes":4122,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/projects/404/f79342114622191.606c815dcfabc.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn15@2020_2/2021/04/07/17-38-06-569_826c093c987b4e39.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617817086357},{"createdTime":"2021-04-08 01:38:06","updatedTime":"2021-04-08 01:38:06","title":"Influence and texture of Ukiyo-e and Japanese painting","link":"https://www.behance.net/gallery/116841711/Influence-and-texture-of-Ukiyo-e-and-Japanese-painting","description":"<img src='https://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/projects/404/600965116841711.606aba94b8a08.jpg' style='float:left; margin-right:15px;' /><br /> I am influenced by many artists and illustrators.

First, we modernized the logo, the \"Yangban\" mask, a pleasant theatrical character known for being expressive. Then, we created an adaptation of \"Horangi\", another character in Korean culture that is, despite his frightening face, nothing else than a nice tiger, funny looking but protective. The illustrator Aless MC came up with a first interpretation of the mythical tiger that has been interpreted by many artists throughout the years, just as Korean folklore paintings used to do. An amalgam of these symbols allowed us to create a branding that relates with the founders' origins. With their new 210 g bag or a superposition of three 5 lb bags, the packaging now displays the big friendly cat as the guardian of the brand and of the coffee producers with whom DeMello works every day.","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 07 Apr 2021 14:00:35
