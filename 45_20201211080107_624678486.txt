The event includes a “fire-side chat” with top vaccine regulator <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/fda-organization/peter-marks\">Peter Marks</a> from the Food and Drug Administration. There will also be talks with representatives from FedEx, UPS, McKesson, CVS, and Walgreens, who will all help get any FDA-approved vaccines to people’s arms.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1728361#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1728361&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=hqo6Xbh6WLY:YajBchRcJuw:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=hqo6Xbh6WLY:YajBchRcJuw:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=hqo6Xbh6WLY:YajBchRcJuw:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=hqo6Xbh6WLY:YajBchRcJuw:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=hqo6Xbh6WLY:YajBchRcJuw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=hqo6Xbh6WLY:YajBchRcJuw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 08 Dec 2020 16:49:00 +0000","feedId":45,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GettyImages-1229999099-800x505.jpg","linkMd5":"64dce532ebc924a9aaa7ccc9c22823f9","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn4@2020_1/2020/12/11/08-00-32-684_05dd6256e51573d3.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":505,"sourceBytes":39326,"destBytes":17110,"author":"Beth Mole","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GettyImages-1229999099-800x505.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn4@2020_1/2020/12/11/08-00-32-684_05dd6256e51573d3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=hqo6Xbh6WLY:YajBchRcJuw:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn96@2020_1/2020/12/11/08-01-02-100_20e6fd171b06dd15.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=hqo6Xbh6WLY:YajBchRcJuw:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn52@2020_5/2020/12/11/08-01-02-551_d68808d3ff6ef0c8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn74@2020_6/2020/12/11/08-01-01-960_f99fea21595d408b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn8@2020_4/2020/12/11/08-01-02-283_ca95730524b4751b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1607673632387},{"createdTime":"2020-12-11 16:00:32","updatedTime":"2020-12-11 16:00:32","title":"A promising start to new human gene-editing trials","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1728583","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GettyImages-97188294-800x548.jpg\" alt=\"Image of a patient in bed being attended by three doctors.\"><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GettyImages-97188294.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"1863\" data-width=\"2720\">Enlarge</a> <span class=\"sep\">/</span> Richard Watkins, 49, (in bed) is suffering from complications caused by sickle-cell disease.

Plenty of human genetic disorders can be traced to problems with a single gene, and that makes them a tempting target for correction. But <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Gelsinger\">someone died</a> in a very early gene-therapy trial, which set the entire field back considerably. And, despite a far more cautious approach, the risks are still considerable, as two deaths during a trial <a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/06/two-deaths-gene-therapy-trial-rare-muscle-disease\">occurred just this year</a>.</p>\n<p>But for researchers in the field, and those suffering from genetic diseases, this week provides some hope that the field's long-delayed promise might eventually be met. At a virtual scientific conference, a group presented the results of a large safety trial that saw 50 of 52 patients able to discontinue treatments for hemophilia. And a separate paper describes the use of CRISPR gene-editing and a blood stem cell transplant to successfully treat patients with sickle-cell anemia or a related disorder.</p>\n<h2>Restoring clotting</h2>\n<p>The hemophilia trial was typical of most early efforts at gene therapy. In this case, the disease is caused by a defect in a single gene, so providing cells with a new copy will correct the problem. And, since the protein that's encoded by that gene circulates in the blood, you don't have to target a small and potentially difficult-to-access population of cells in order to correct things—targeting a new copy of the gene to any cells that can export proteins to the bloodstream will work.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1728583#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1728583&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=b6ygfBQ6LuE:NsFYEVfHKrc:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=b6ygfBQ6LuE:NsFYEVfHKrc:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=b6ygfBQ6LuE:NsFYEVfHKrc:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=b6ygfBQ6LuE:NsFYEVfHKrc:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=b6ygfBQ6LuE:NsFYEVfHKrc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=b6ygfBQ6LuE:NsFYEVfHKrc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 09 Dec 2020 11:45:35 +0000","feedId":45,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GettyImages-97188294-800x548.jpg","linkMd5":"f9809866f76d5d846b4bcfdca14dbdcd","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn40@2020_4/2020/12/11/08-00-32-634_43c0a55996f1823a.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":548,"sourceBytes":85196,"destBytes":48348,"author":"John Timmer","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GettyImages-97188294-800x548.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn40@2020_4/2020/12/11/08-00-32-634_43c0a55996f1823a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=b6ygfBQ6LuE:NsFYEVfHKrc:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn53@2020_2/2020/12/11/08-01-01-989_2c28325463da18ff.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=b6ygfBQ6LuE:NsFYEVfHKrc:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn17@2020_2/2020/12/11/08-01-01-990_0eead9ff5c8b4d05.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn74@2020_6/2020/12/11/08-01-01-960_f99fea21595d408b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn8@2020_4/2020/12/11/08-01-02-283_ca95730524b4751b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1607673632380},{"createdTime":"2020-12-11 16:00:32","updatedTime":"2020-12-11 16:00:32","title":"Engine abort at T-1.3 seconds scrubs Starship launch attempt [Updated]","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1728231","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/SN8-Dec-8-2020-0522-800x534.jpeg\" alt=\"Starship SN8 got close to launching on Tuesday.\"><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/SN8-Dec-8-2020-0522.jpeg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"1334\" data-width=\"2000\">Enlarge</a> <span class=\"sep\">/</span> Starship SN8 got close to launching on Tuesday.

The original concept was a “lithium metal” battery, which could hold substantially more energy in the same volume. There was just one small problem: they invariably self-destruct. But this week, a long-watched battery-tech company announced that it believes to have solved this problem. If what the company shows is accurate, this is a big deal.</p>\n<p>First, a brief primer. Lithium batteries shuttle lithium ions from the cathode to the anode during charging, harvesting energy as the ions return to their home in the cathode material. This requires a separator in the middle that only lets lithium ions through, and it requires a conductive electrolyte. In a lithium-metal battery, the shuttling lithium ions simply form pure metallic lithium on the anode side. But the lithium has a tendency to form branching needle-like structures called dendrites that can pierce through to the cathode, causing the battery to short. And since the liquid electrolytes used in these batteries are flammable, bad things happen when they short.</p>\n\n<p>The solution was to utilize a graphite anode. The orderly structure of graphite makes a good hotel for lithium ions, which safely check into a room for their stay during charging. This greatly reduces the risk of dendrite formation. But this graphite can take up nearly half the volume of the cell without adding additional energy storage. This makes the battery work safely but dilutes its performance.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1728764#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1728764&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=amkUmy7ZFY8:nUlPQl2DBGA:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=amkUmy7ZFY8:nUlPQl2DBGA:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=amkUmy7ZFY8:nUlPQl2DBGA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=amkUmy7ZFY8:nUlPQl2DBGA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=amkUmy7ZFY8:nUlPQl2DBGA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=amkUmy7ZFY8:nUlPQl2DBGA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 09 Dec 2020 21:05:42 +0000","feedId":45,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/quantumscape_cell-cROPPED.png","linkMd5":"c05c760713f7f0ff1b9b0fbcbb3f9a90","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn16@2020_5/2020/12/11/08-01-00-435_c206dcf8146aa5cb.webp","destWidth":668,"destHeight":551,"sourceBytes":395509,"destBytes":18938,"author":"Scott K.

The four witnesses all have MDs, and three of them work at hospitals, suggesting that this is a case where the Senate will be receiving information from people with relevant expertise. It's the fourth witness, however, that suggests some of the testimony may go completely off the rails and raises further doubts that US politicians are taking a raging pandemic seriously.</p>\n<p>Jane Orient has an MD and is the head of a serious-sounding organization called the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS). But a quick look at the group's history shows that it has adopted positions—such as promoting chloroquine and opposing government vaccination programs—that make it a questionable source of COVID-19 information. And the AAPS actually has a long history of adopting extreme and fringe positions that run contrary to all evidence, in part because of its opposition to government involvement in anything. But because of these libertarian tendencies, the group has maintained a close relationship with conservative politicians.</p>\n<h2>Bad pandemic advice</h2>\n<p>It doesn't take much searching to determine that the AAPS has fringe views about the pandemic. In late April, evidence was developing that hydroxychloroquine, a malaria drug, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/04/more-reason-for-caution-with-malaria-drugs-as-covid-19-treatment/\">wasn't effective against COVID-19</a>, leading the FDA to scale back its emergency approval. Four days <em>after</em> that decision, the AAPS <a href=\"https://aapsonline.org/hcq-90-percent-chance/\">sent out a press release</a> claiming that the drug \"has about 90 percent chance of helping COVID-19 patients.\" That claim was false at the time—it was apparently based simply on counting any studies that saw any effect toward that 90-percent total. And subsequent studies have clearly indicated the drug is ineffective.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1728137#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1728137&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=V2bas0VltQc:MN8-_uzY6Y0:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=V2bas0VltQc:MN8-_uzY6Y0:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=V2bas0VltQc:MN8-_uzY6Y0:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=V2bas0VltQc:MN8-_uzY6Y0:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=V2bas0VltQc:MN8-_uzY6Y0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=V2bas0VltQc:MN8-_uzY6Y0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 07 Dec 2020 19:04:58 +0000","feedId":45,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GettyImages-660212970-800x534.jpg","linkMd5":"19aa53c33dbd6ea5791113dfdc2bd0c0","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn52@2020_5/2020/12/11/08-00-32-653_01b3ec750d31e727.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":534,"sourceBytes":60027,"destBytes":21122,"author":"John Timmer","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GettyImages-660212970-800x534.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn52@2020_5/2020/12/11/08-00-32-653_01b3ec750d31e727.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=V2bas0VltQc:MN8-_uzY6Y0:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn3@2020_3/2020/12/11/08-01-01-977_ef98ec30b2de4869.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=V2bas0VltQc:MN8-_uzY6Y0:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn40@2020_4/2020/12/11/08-01-01-977_efde801679373e6f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn74@2020_6/2020/12/11/08-01-01-960_f99fea21595d408b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn8@2020_4/2020/12/11/08-01-02-283_ca95730524b4751b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1607673632387},{"createdTime":"2020-12-11 16:00:32","updatedTime":"2020-12-11 16:00:32","title":"Watch live: SpaceX is fueling its Starship for a high-altitude flight [Updated]","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1728634","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n      <ul class=\"gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide\"><li>\n        <div class=\"gallery-item-content\">  \n        <div class=\"gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Starship-SN8-Dec-9-2020-0927-980x543.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div>\n        <p>\n          The Sun glints around the lower fin of Starship SN8 on Dec. 9, 2020.

Should a technical issue arise again, there are additional opportunities on Thursday and Friday.

While the basic underlying physics is well-known, physicists have continued to gain new insights into this fascinating granular material over the last decade or so. The latest breakthrough comes from Nobel Laureate Andre Geim's laboratory at the University of Manchester in England, where Geim and his colleagues have solved a mathematical puzzle—the \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin_equation\">Kelvin equation</a>\"—dating back 150 years, according to <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2978-1\">a new paper</a> just published in Nature.</p>\n<p>All you really need to make a sandcastle is sand and water; the water acts as a kind of glue holding the grains of sand together via capillary forces. Studies <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2012-08-sandcastle-child-physicists.html\">have shown</a> that the <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2017-06-sandcastleaccording-science.html\">ideal ratio</a> for building a structurally sound sandcastle is one pail of water for every eight pails of sand, although it's still possible to build a decent structure with varying water content. But if you want to build the kind of elaborate, towering sandcastles that win competitions, you'd be wise to stick with that ideal ratio.</p>\n<p>Back in 2008, physicists decided to <a href=\"https://physicsworld.com/a/secret-of-sandcastle-building-revealed/\">delve a little deeper</a> into why sand becomes sticky when it gets wet. Using X-ray microtomography, they took 3D images of wet glass beads of similar shape and size as grains of sand. When they added liquid to dry beads, they observed liquid \"capillary bridges\" forming between individual beads. Adding more liquid caused the bridges to grow larger, and as that happened, the bead surfaces came into contact with more water, further increasing the binding effect. However, the increased binding effect was canceled out by a corresponding decrease of the capillary forces as the bridge structures grew bigger. The team concluded that even if the moisture content changes, the forces binding the beads together do not change.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1728509#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1728509&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=TaO12dlIZLQ:OCGqicQd-GI:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=TaO12dlIZLQ:OCGqicQd-GI:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=TaO12dlIZLQ:OCGqicQd-GI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=TaO12dlIZLQ:OCGqicQd-GI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=TaO12dlIZLQ:OCGqicQd-GI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=TaO12dlIZLQ:OCGqicQd-GI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 09 Dec 2020 18:00:27 +0000","feedId":45,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/castleTOP-800x533.jpg","linkMd5":"0d87bbaf472126c12dd4c381aaf1580d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn80@2020_3/2020/12/11/08-00-32-929_437631af47c53371.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":533,"sourceBytes":57622,"destBytes":45172,"author":"Jennifer Ouellette","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/castleTOP-800x533.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn80@2020_3/2020/12/11/08-00-32-929_437631af47c53371.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=TaO12dlIZLQ:OCGqicQd-GI:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn88@2020_3/2020/12/11/08-01-02-006_963efc58658378a4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=TaO12dlIZLQ:OCGqicQd-GI:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn92@2020_1/2020/12/11/08-01-02-152_50f36435f3d982c0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn74@2020_6/2020/12/11/08-01-01-960_f99fea21595d408b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn8@2020_4/2020/12/11/08-01-02-283_ca95730524b4751b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1607673632387},{"createdTime":"2020-12-11 16:00:32","updatedTime":"2020-12-11 16:00:32","title":"So, it turns out SpaceX is pretty good at rocketing","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1728819","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n      <ul class=\"gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide\"><li>\n        <div class=\"gallery-item-content\">  \n        <div class=\"gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/SN8-Dec-9-2020-1245-980x551.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div>\n        <p>\n          At 4:45pm CT on Wednesday, SN8 took to the skies.

The intent was to <a href=\"https://www.drewexmachina.com/2017/03/13/surveyor-2-things-dont-always-go-as-planned/\">land Surveyor 2</a> on the Moon just east of its predecessor to demonstrate the feasibility of an oblique approach and landing.</p>\n<p>After a series of minor delays, <a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/surveyor-2/\">Surveyor 2</a> launched successfully on September 20, 1966 at 7:31:59.8 EST. The launch vehicle was an Atlas-Centaur rocket using liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen as propellants. Once the Centaur's engines were shut down and the spacecraft had coasted for 66 seconds, Surveyor 2 departed from spent Centaur. The rocket expelled its residual propellants to set a safe distance between itself and the Surveyor 2, giving it a trajectory that would miss the Moon by a good 5,675 kilometers and send the rocket into a solar orbit. That Centaur rocket is what astronomers have confirmed to be 2020 SO.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1727359#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1727359&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=LBywxH5B1Tg:IGoCH5TGQaE:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=LBywxH5B1Tg:IGoCH5TGQaE:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=LBywxH5B1Tg:IGoCH5TGQaE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=LBywxH5B1Tg:IGoCH5TGQaE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=LBywxH5B1Tg:IGoCH5TGQaE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=LBywxH5B1Tg:IGoCH5TGQaE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 08 Dec 2020 20:39:21 +0000","feedId":45,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/surveyTOP-800x534.jpg","linkMd5":"fbd34ec6d5052c61b1dc760b565ba9c7","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn36@2020_1/2020/12/11/08-00-35-803_4f03acd6d1710b44.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":534,"sourceBytes":64216,"destBytes":43946,"author":"Jennifer Ouellette","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/surveyTOP-800x534.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn36@2020_1/2020/12/11/08-00-35-803_4f03acd6d1710b44.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=LBywxH5B1Tg:IGoCH5TGQaE:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn19@2020_1/2020/12/11/08-01-01-978_00981e98c00f9daa.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=LBywxH5B1Tg:IGoCH5TGQaE:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn93@2020_5/2020/12/11/08-01-02-113_3a403e0d82218db3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn74@2020_6/2020/12/11/08-01-01-960_f99fea21595d408b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn8@2020_4/2020/12/11/08-01-02-283_ca95730524b4751b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1607673632380},{"createdTime":"2020-12-11 16:00:32","updatedTime":"2020-12-11 16:00:32","title":"Two very different approaches to restoring vision","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1727783","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GettyImages-614083078-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"False-color image of a medical image of the interior of a human head.\"><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GettyImages-614083078.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"683\" data-width=\"1024\">Enlarge</a> <span class=\"sep\">/</span> Two eyes and their optic nerves, seen on a radial section scan.

Once in the brain, visual input is interpreted by multiple dedicated regions that build a scene out of small pieces of shape and motion. The outcome of that processing may be further interpreted by areas of the brain that handle things like reading or face recognition.</p>\n<p>With all that complexity, lots of different things can go wrong. Accordingly, we'll likely need multiple solutions if we want to try to correct these problems. So, it was nice to see the results this week of two very different approaches to tackling visual problems tested in experimental animals. One group manipulated biology to correct problems in the transmission of information between the eye and the brain, while another group used electronics to bypass the need for an eye entirely.</p>\n<h2>Refreshing nerves</h2>\n<p>One of the most exciting developments in tissue repair has been the recognition that we could convert many cell types into stem cells just by activating four specific genes. Unfortunately, activating those genes widely in mice kills them, as the genes also promote loss of normal cellular identity and uncontrolled division. A huge US-based collaboration suspected many of these problems were due to one of those four genes (called MYC), and so it focused on working with the remaining three. The first showed that activating these three in cells from older mice restored properties that were typical of younger cells without any loss of normal cell function.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1727783#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1727783&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=t9awDmHziVM:g9zhDql_Q-U:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=t9awDmHziVM:g9zhDql_Q-U:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=t9awDmHziVM:g9zhDql_Q-U:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=t9awDmHziVM:g9zhDql_Q-U:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=t9awDmHziVM:g9zhDql_Q-U:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=t9awDmHziVM:g9zhDql_Q-U:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 06 Dec 2020 14:00:48 +0000","feedId":45,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GettyImages-614083078-800x534.jpg","linkMd5":"c5714b910c1a31b8248db3d6f8d7aa08","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn11@2020_1/2020/12/11/08-00-49-870_6c64587d3fe9578e.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":534,"sourceBytes":158284,"destBytes":77220,"author":"John Timmer","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GettyImages-614083078-800x534.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn11@2020_1/2020/12/11/08-00-49-870_6c64587d3fe9578e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=t9awDmHziVM:g9zhDql_Q-U:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn29@2020_2/2020/12/11/08-01-01-977_3f137e4b1bbcd3db.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=t9awDmHziVM:g9zhDql_Q-U:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn80@2020_6/2020/12/11/08-01-01-976_71b3bf961addba86.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn74@2020_6/2020/12/11/08-01-01-960_f99fea21595d408b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn8@2020_4/2020/12/11/08-01-02-283_ca95730524b4751b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1607673632386},{"createdTime":"2020-12-11 16:00:32","updatedTime":"2020-12-11 16:00:32","title":"FDA advisors give thumbs up to Pfizer vaccine, paving way for authorization","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1729061","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1229654108-800x502.jpg\" alt=\"An illustration picture shows vials with Covid-19 Vaccine stickers attached, with the logo of US pharmaceutical company Pfizer, on November 17, 2020. \"><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1229654108.jpg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"2603\" data-width=\"4152\">Enlarge</a> <span class=\"sep\">/</span> An illustration picture shows vials with Covid-19 Vaccine stickers attached, with the logo of US pharmaceutical company Pfizer, on November 17, 2020.
