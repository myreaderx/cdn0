The busy trail was swarming with ebikes.</p>\n<p>The paper this week had an article asking if ebikes (bicycles with electric motors which help power the rider) provide any health/exercise benefits. As it turns out, a study shows that ebikes give an adequate workout <em>and</em> people who ride them, tend to do so more often.</p>\n<p>On <a href=\"http://doug-johnson.squarespace.com/blue-skunk-blog/2019/5/15/biking-in-the-netherlands.html\">my boat/bike trip to the Netherlands</a> last year, several riders had ebikes. On the first day of riding, I volunteered to be the ride \"sweep\" -&#160; the last rider who made sure no one in the group got lost or stranded. The last person in the regular group that day was an older lady with an ebike who loved to stop and take photos, and then jump back on the assisted bike, and go like the wind to catch up with everyone else. That left me on my regular bike, straining to catch up as well. Not my favorite ride.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, one couple was having issues that an ebike solved. The husband was a strong, avid biker and often volunteered to sweep. The problem was that his wife was a rather weak cyclist who had a great deal of difficulty keeping up with the group. His having to wait while she slowly pedaled the route, did not make him very happy. Luckily, another ebike was available and after the second day of the tour, she used it and was always right behind the leader, giving her husband someone else to sweep up after (maybe the photographer).</p>\n<p>My current bike is a blue 22-year-old Cannondale road bike - much of which has been replaced over the years. It has served me well on longer bike rides in Wisconsin, Missouri, and Minnesota, as well as international rides in Ireland and Provence. It's been a workhorse and caused me very few problems. It's the only bike I own.</p>\n<p>This summer has not been a good biking summer. I've only done a few rides and these have been fairly short. The local bike clubs with which I normally do longer group rides have only been doing \"virtual\" rides since the COVID outbreak. I've been biking to YMCA about five miles from my house a couple times a week, but not feeling all that strong or confident while biking.</p>\n<p>So when does one know when it is time to shift gears and start riding an ebike? Will I be admitting to the limitations of old age? Would I have my passion for bicycling reignited by more enjoyable cycling experiences? I've more or less pledged not to covert until I reach age 70 in a couple years. It may be sooner.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 27 Sep 2020 21:20:17 +0000","feedId":36439,"bgimg":"http://doug-johnson.squarespace.com/storage/IMG_0219.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1601389010951","linkMd5":"b32c62a6cc850fc6e06b1cf3cb475ae9","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn90@2020_5/2020/10/13/06-28-02-962_3dbd16b59baa8d12.webp","destWidth":3264,"destHeight":2448,"sourceBytes":3187088,"destBytes":1506712,"author":"Doug Johnson","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://doug-johnson.squarespace.com/storage/IMG_0219.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1601389010951":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn90@2020_5/2020/10/13/06-28-02-962_3dbd16b59baa8d12.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602570418879}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-10-13 14:26:58","updatedTime":"2020-10-13 14:26:58","feedId":36439,"fetchDate":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 06:26:58 +0000","fetchMs":302,"handleMs":1681,"totalMs":68561,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"818b2f91db1355e1383e1c549cf591f8","hostName":"europe68*","requestId":"cb8496bdf0e64d178e8b041737e826bc_36439","contentType":"text/xml;charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":1506712,"bgimgsTotal":1,"bgimgsGithubTotal":1,"articlesImgsTotal":1,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":1,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx6":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 03:07:45","updatedTime":"2020-09-07 03:07:45","id":36439,"name":"Blue Skunk Blog","url":"http://doug-johnson.squarespace.com/blue-skunk-blog/atom.xml","subscriber":88,"website":null,"icon":"http://doug-johnson.squarespace.com/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":null,"description":"Home","weekly":null,"link":"http://doug-johnson.squarespace.com"},"noPictureArticleList":[],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":1506712,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1602570416662,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":536,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":1681,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":0,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"},{"spend":0,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"}]},"extra5":1,"extra6":1,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[null],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[{"code":1,"isDone":false,"source":"http://doug-johnson.squarespace.com/storage/IMG_0219.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1601389010951","sourceStatusCode":200,"destWidth":3264,"destHeight":2448,"fixedGithubDest":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn90@2020_5/2020/10/13/06-28-02-962_3dbd16b59baa8d12.webp","sourceBytes":3187088,"destBytes":1506712,"targetWebpQuality":75,"feedId":36439,"totalSpendMs":4813,"convertSpendMs":583,"createdTime":"2020-10-13 14:28:00","host":"europe-60*","referer":"http://doug-johnson.squarespace.com/blue-skunk-blog/2020/9/27/the-lure-of-the-ebike.html","linkMd5ListStr":"b32c62a6cc850fc6e06b1cf3cb475ae9,b32c62a6cc850fc6e06b1cf3cb475ae9","githubUser":"myreaderx6","githubHttpCode":201,"extra22GetBytesInfo":"1、没有Referer字段","extra23historyStatusCode":[200],"sourceSize":"3 MB","destSize":"1.4 MB","compressRate":"47.3%"}],"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx6":1},"failGithubMap":{}}
