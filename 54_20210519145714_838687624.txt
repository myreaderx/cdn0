That doesn't leave a lot of time to get creative. But if you plan ahead, you might be able to craft some hilarity.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=9032c656-5488-4c0e-914a-b6d02e911f02&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Click here to access our generator of hilarious and entertaining OOO emails.&nbsp;\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/9032c656-5488-4c0e-914a-b6d02e911f02.png\" align=\"middle\" /></a></p> \n<p>In this post, I’ll go over what an OOO message is and share some of the best examples I’ve found on Google, as well as a few from my coworkers.</p> \n<p>Also known as \"autoresponder emails,\" out-of-office messages run the gamut. From funny, to clever, to snarky, this message can both show your personality and let senders know that, well, you’re out of office.</p> \n<p>While you can keep it simple, you can also have some fun with it.</p> \n<h3>What should I put on my out-of-office message?</h3> \n<p>First things first: let’s go over the basics of an OOO email. In your away message, you typically include the following:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>A quick “I’m out of the office” phrase.</li> \n <li>The date or time range you’ll be out.</li> \n <li>Who to reach out to in case the sender needs immediate attention.</li> \n <li>A sign-off.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Putting it all together, your autoresponder would read something like:</p> \n<p><em>“Hi there,</em></p> \n<p><em>Thanks for your email. I’m currently out of office until mm/dd/yyyy. If you need help, email my colleague at <a href=\"mailto:colleague@example.com\">colleague@example.com</a>.</em></p> \n<p><em>Best,</em></p> \n<p><em>[Name]”</em></p> \n<p>But that sounds boring, right? Luckily, there are ways to spice up your OOO message by adding humor in just the right places.</p> \n<p>If you’re feeling stuck, try our free <a href=\"https://ooogenerator.com/\">OOO email generator</a> to draft a message that perfectly captures who you are and where you're going.</p> \n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Featured Resource: <a href=\"https://ooogenerator.com/\">OOO Email Generator</a></h3> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://ooogenerator.com/\"><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-01-25%20at%202.50.48%20PM.png?width=650&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-01-25%20at%202.50.48%20PM.png\" alt=\"Out of Office email generator\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" /></a><a href=\"https://ooogenerator.com/\"><em>Create your OOO email by clicking here</em></a><a href=\"https://ooogenerator.com/\"><em>. </em></a></p> \n<h2>Out-of-Office Messages for Vacation</h2> \n<h3>1. “I’ll email you back once I’ve defrosted.”</h3> \n<p>Most times, when people go on vacation, they travel to a warm, tropical place…</p> \n<p>But some of us just aren’t as lucky. Or if we’re traveling during the winter and heading up north — well, we’re going to run into some snow, aren’t we?</p> \n<p>While this may not prove so fortunate for us, we can use the poor weather for comedic relief. You can even include a screenshot of the weather forecast for a sense of realism. Not only will it give senders a chuckle, but it’ll also generate a certain amount of empathy — which is often the key to good content.</p> \n<h5>Example</h5> \n<p><em>Thanks for your message! I’m currently buried in snow and will get back to you once I’ve defrosted on January 2nd.</em></p> \n<p><em>And if you think I’m lying...</em></p> \n<p><em><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/funny-ooo-message-weather.png?width=650&amp;name=funny-ooo-message-weather.png\" alt=\"Weather forecast for out-of-office message\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" /></em></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><em><a href=\"https://www.kptv.com/weather/blog/huge-cascade-snow-storm-this-weekend-plus-another-look-at-lowland-snow/article_a824e90a-336b-11ea-a7cf-9b0de55a97ca.html\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></em></p> \n<p><em>Gotta go, my fingers are frostbitten. If you really need me, either get a shovel and dig me out of here, or reach out to my colleague Anna — who’s not frozen under snow with frostbitten fingers — at anna@example.com</em></p> \n<h3>2. “If found, contact someone other than me.”</h3> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/funny-ooo-message-meme.png?width=650&amp;name=funny-ooo-message-meme.png\" alt=\"Funny OOO message on a milk carton missing notice\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" /></p> \n<p>If your email client allows it, you could always just use an image to express your out-office sentiment, like this one. After all, they say that a picture is worth a thousand words — and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/visual-content-marketing-strategy\">visual content is still essential to successful marketing</a>.</p> \n<p>In this image, you're letting people know you're OOO with a \"Missing\" notice on a milk carton. Genius. Just be careful — this sort of autoresponder is best for internal emails, not for autoresponders that get sent to prospects and clients.</p> \n<h3>3. “I’ll get back to you when I return to civilization.”</h3> \n<p>If you’re traveling to a remote, mountainous area, why not jab some fun at your lack of WiFi in your autoresponder? Plus, that makes it less likely that people will expect an immediate response or continue to email you after the first try.</p> \n<h5>Example</h5> \n<p><em>Hi there,</em></p> \n<p><em>Sorry I missed you — I’m unable to get to my email right this second. Why? I’m on a backpacking trip, surviving on Spam, really good water, and trail mix. You should see the stars out here.</em></p> \n<p><em>I’ll get back to you when I return to civilization. Or to an area with WiFi. Or to the office on May 10th. Whichever comes first.</em></p> \n<p><em>If you need help right now, email my team at <a href=\"mailto:team@example.com\">team@example.com</a>.</em></p> \n<h3>4. “If you need to reach me, travel to my homeland of Florida.”</h3> \n<p>When one of my colleagues went on vacation, he sent an out-of-office message that was both clever and smart. First, he sent the recipient on an imaginary scavenger hunt to \"the highest peak of the tallest mountain.\" He used humorous absurdity to make it clear that he would not be checking email while he was away.</p> \n<p>Plus, he incorporated a delightful technique to let people know that if they really wanted him to read their emails, they should probably send them again after his return. Not only does that keep the sender accountable by saying, \"If this is really important, you know when to reach me,\" but it also helps him truly vacate his work while he's away. And that's hard to do.</p> \n<p>Below is an example you can use for yourself.</p> \n<h5>Example</h5> \n<p><em>Hey!</em></p> \n<p><em>I’m on vacation until July 18th. If you need to reach me, here’s what you’ll need to do:</em></p> \n<ul> \n <li><em>First, travel to my homeland of Florida.</em></li> \n <li><em>Climb to the highest peak of the tallest mountain.</em></li> \n <li><em>Find a rare flower (no specifics, of course... It’d be cheating).</em></li> \n <li><em>Put the flower back, because as the old hiking rule goes, “Leave everything as you found it.”</em></li> \n</ul> \n<p><em>When you understand that flower, you’ll know to reach me. Trust me. You’ll know.</em></p> \n<p><em>If your message requires a response faster than that, please email my manager at manager@example.com.</em></p> \n<p><em>If you want to make sure your message gets a response ASAP when I return, please send it on July 18th. I recommend using one of our <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/sales/sales-automation\">sales automation tools</a> to schedule it now, while you’re thinking about it.</em></p> \n<h3>5. “I know I’m supposed to say that I’ll have limited access to email, but...”</h3> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/ooo-message-blunt.png?width=650&amp;name=ooo-message-blunt.png\" alt=\"Blunt out-of-office message by Josh Kopelman\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" /></p> \n<p>Josh Kopelman’s vacation email is a classic example of taking a blunt approach at OOO messages.</p> \n<p>Not only did Kopelman manage to turn his out-of-office message into an epic poem of sorts, but also, he actually went through the trouble of creating a delightfully snarky, vacation-specific email address for his recipients.</p> \n<p>Giving the option to contact an email address containing \"interruptyourvacation\" provides two things — 1) A dose of humor, and 2) discouragement from actually doing what the name suggests. Plus, he prefaces it with a request for empathy, by explaining that he promised quality time to his family.</p> \n<p>Sure, Kopelman is truthful about the fact that he's on vacation, but he also lets the recipient know that he or she would be interrupting important family time if the first option is chosen. It states a point simply and uses humor to avoid making it sound like he wants the reader to feel guilty.</p> \n<p>Below is an example you can use for yourself.</p> \n<h5>Example</h5> \n<p><em>Hi there,</em></p> \n<p><em>You got this email immediately (classic autoresponder behavior), which means I’m out of office on vacation.</em></p> \n<p><em>While I hypothetically could reach my email, while I hypothetically do have my phone on hand, and while I hypothetically do have access to WiFi, I’d rather enjoy time with my family. My kids are growing up at the speed of a supersonic jet, and if I blink one more time, they’ll be 35. And I’ll be 73. And I don’t want that.</em></p> \n<p><em>If you still need to reach me, you can email interruptingfamilytime@example.com. Or you can email my assistant at <a href=\"mailto:assistant@example.com\">assistant@example.com</a>. They can point you in the right direction.</em></p> \n<p><em>Looking forward to reconnecting once I’m back.</em></p> \n<h3>6. “Hi, I’m Troy McClure.”</h3> \n<p>When one of my colleagues is out of the office, he doesn't mess around. In fact, he's turned his auto-responses into a running series of commentary from fictional cartoon character <a href=\"http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/Troy_McClure\">Troy McClure</a>.</p> \n<p>Each time McClure makes an appearance in these out-of-office messages, he \"speaks\" on behalf of my colleague and alludes to the previous auto-responses in which he starred. It's a mild form of self-deprecating humor — as if to say, \"I know, I'm out of the office again\" — made only funnier by the made-up teaser title included in the last line.</p> \n<p>Don't be afraid to use a pop cultural reference that the audience would recognize. Instead of bemoaning your absence, they'll have something fun and familiar to laugh at.</p> \n<h5>Example</h5> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/troy-mcclure.png?width=200&amp;name=troy-mcclure.png\" alt=\"Troy McClure OOO autoresponder\" width=\"200\" style=\"width: 200px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy_McClure\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p><em>Hi, I’m Troy McClure. You might remember me from such out-of-office messages as <strong>Avenge My Death if I Don’t Return from DMEXCO</strong> and <strong>Bye Now, I’m on an Absurdly Long Cycling Trip</strong>.</em></p> \n<p><em>I’m here to talk to you about someone you know. Catalina Wong is out of office until September 27. She wanted me to let you know that she’ll get back to you after her return.</em></p> \n<p><em>That’s all for now. Watch for me in the upcoming out-of-office message, <strong>It’s Not a Hangover, It’s Food Poisoning — I Swear!</strong> And be safe out there.</em></p> \n<h3>7. “The bad news is that I’m out of office. The good news is that I’m out of office.”</h3> \n<p>You can show just how thrilled you are about your vacation while still providing an apology (of sorts... not really).</p> \n<h5>Example</h5> \n<p><em>Hey there — I’ve got good and bad news for you. Let’s go with the bad first.</em></p> \n<p><em>The bad news is that I’m out of office. The good news is that I’m out of office and enjoying elotes in Cancún.</em></p> \n<p><em>If you can’t wait for a response, my colleague will be happy to take care of you. Just email them at <a href=\"mailto:someone@example.com\">someone@example.com</a>.</em></p> \n<p><em>I’ll be back on February 7th.</em></p> \n<h3>8. \"I am currently out of the office and probably chilling on the beach. Enjoy your work week.\"</h3> \n<p>That’s it. That’s all. Simple and to the point, this message will let people know that you can’t respond to messages.</p> \n<p>That said, be careful with messages that are this curt. Make sure you're familiar enough with your audience — and your boss, for that matter — to know that this sort of out-of-office message will be met with a snicker, and not with annoyance.</p> \n<h3>9. “Can you guess where I am?”</h3> \n<p>There's a term that we like to use around here called \"snowbirds,\" which is used to describe those who once resided in the northern part of the U.S., only to flee to warmer parts of the country during the winter.</p> \n<p>And although my colleague had mixed feelings about her own parents joining that population in Florida, she couldn't be too upset when her dad suggested flying down from Boston for a Red Sox spring training game.</p> \n<p>Naturally, she had to take the day off — and couldn't let folks know with any old generic auto-response. Instead, she made a guessing game of it in her out-of-office email, which you can use for yourself, below.</p> \n<h5>Example</h5> \n<p><em>Hello there,</em></p> \n<p><em>I’m currently out of the office, enjoying some peanuts and Cracker Jacks with my family. Can you guess where I am? That’s okay, you’re busy.</em></p> \n<p><em>If your message is urgent, fear not — we’ll get it addressed. Try doing one of two things:</em></p> \n<ol> \n <li><em>Send me an email at TheresNoCryingInBaseball@example.com.</em></li> \n <ol> \n  <li><em>Just kidding. That’s not a real email address.</em></li> \n </ol> \n <li><em>Reach out to my manager at manager@example.com in my absence.</em></li> \n</ol> \n<p><em>I’ll be back in the office on 7/19 and will happily respond then. Have a great weekend!</em></p> \n<h2>Holiday Out-of-Office Messages</h2> \n<h3>10. “Holiday revelry and debauchery ahead. Proceed with caution (if you dare).”</h3> \n<p>When you’re out for the holidays, how can you express your thrill for the season without sounding, well, cheesy?</p> \n<p>How about warning people of what’s to come? Take a look at an example you can use below.</p> \n<h5>Example</h5> \n<p><em>Hey there,</em></p> \n<p><em>Careful. Holiday revelry and debauchery ahead. Proceed with caution (if you dare).</em></p> \n<p><em>By which I mean to say: I’m on holiday, I’m definitely sunburnt, and I’m sorry I missed your email.</em></p> \n<p><em>Don’t you worry: while I pretend to be Santa in front of my kids, my colleague, Hannah, will cover for me. Just email her at hannah@example.com if you need urgent assistance.</em></p> \n<p><em>Take care, and don’t get too carried away with the sunbathing!</em></p> \n<h3>11. “Thank you so much for your email. I love it already.”</h3> \n<p>This holiday out-of-office email is definitely on theme, if not a little passive aggressive. If you're getting emails during the holidays, why not treat everything you receive that season like the present it is, and send a thank you note?</p> \n<p>My snarky colleague sure did in his out-of-office message below. We send thank-you letters in response to holiday gifts, so it's only natural to expect the same gesture in our work inboxes …</p> \n<h5>Example</h5> \n<p><em>Hey there,</em></p> \n<p><em>Thank you so much for your email. I love it already. It’s wrapped so nicely in its charming subject line that I just knew this message was going to be something special. Gifts like these just don’t come around every day.</em></p> \n<p><em>Unfortunately, I’m going to have to return your message. As it’s the holiday season, I’m currently away from the office. When I return, I’ll give your email a good solid read and find that your request is exactly what I needed after all! But until then, I’m going to keep it in the inbox so it doesn’t get damaged and revisit it after the holidays are over.</em></p> \n<p><em>Happy holidays!</em></p> \n<h3>12. “Die Hard Quiz.”</h3> \n<p>Check out this message from a HubSpot employee that certainly turns the tables on the email sender. Right when you thought you were the one requesting action, the recipient sent back an assignment — a fun one, at least.</p> \n<p>While the sender waits for your response to their email, take the sting out of your absence by involving them in a holiday survey, like the one below.</p> \n<h5>Example</h5> \n<p><em>Sorry I missed you. I’ll be out of the office and slow to respond until after the break. While I have you, though, help settle an argument among my colleagues and me:</em></p> \n<p><em><strong>Die Hard Quiz</strong></em></p> \n<p><em>What was the best Die Hard movie?</em></p> \n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\"> \n <li><em>Die Hard 1: The Office Christmas Party Gone Wrong.</em></li> \n <li><em>Die Hard 2: Airport Conspiracy.</em></li> \n <li><em>Die Hard 3: Samuel L. Jackson. Enough said.</em></li> \n <li><em>Die Hard 4: Cyberthreat.</em></li> \n <li><em>Die Hard 5: You should probably not pick this one.</em></li> \n <li><em>Impossible! It’s like choosing a favorite child!</em></li> \n</ul> \n<p style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><em>Submit</em></p> \n<h3>13. “Here are 10 things I’m thankful for.”</h3> \n<p>This email comes from another one of my colleagues. The purpose of this email is to intercept messages during Thanksgiving, and the way in which it does so is, well, with thankfulness.</p> \n<p>The funny and charming email template below keeps the confidence of your colleagues with a list of things anyone who works in an office is thankful for. Of course, feel free to customize this list according to the quirks of your own workplace. Thanksgiving is the perfect time to reveal them.</p> \n<h5>Example</h5> \n<p><em>Since I’m out of the office for the Thanksgiving weekend, I’ll respond to your email with a list of 10 things I’m thankful for:</em></p> \n<ol> \n <li><em>Copiers that collate</em></li> \n <li><em>Co-workers that brew more coffee when they empty the pot</em></li> \n <li><em>Donuts on Mondays AND Fridays</em></li> \n <li><em>When IT surprised me with a new laptop AND remembered to transfer my files</em></li> \n <li><em>When You-Know-Who died at the end of book 7</em></li> \n <li><em>Dry-erase boards that actually erase</em></li> \n <li><em>The brave soul who cleaned out the refrigerator</em></li> \n <li><em>When I’m early to an all-staff meeting and score a table near the door</em></li> \n <li><em>HR finally sent a memo telling people to STOP clipping their nails at their desk</em></li> \n <li><em>OOO autoresponders</em></li> \n</ol> \n<p><em>Have a great Thanksgiving, and I’ll get back to you Monday.</em></p> \n<h3>14. “I’m busy watching Christmas movies. Catch ya later.”</h3> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/holiday-ooo-message-movies.png?width=650&amp;name=holiday-ooo-message-movies.png\" alt=\"Holiday OOO message with movie marathon\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\">There's no shame in using Christmas to indulge in your childhood movie tastes, but there is shame in not sharing that adorable side of yourself when people are trying to reach you during the holidays.</img></p> \n<p>So, take a lesson from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/courtwhip\">@courtwhip</a>, editor at PEDESTRIAN.TV, who wrote the above hilarious out-of-office email, fully stocked with mentions of the best movies from the 1990s. (By the way, \"Splinter\" is from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and as we all know, he loves pizza.)</p> \n<p>Below is an example you could use for yourself. Well, it’s the same email.</p> \n<h5>Example</h5> \n<p><em>Oh hey, it’s Christmas, what are you doing emailing me?</em></p> \n<p><em>I’m extremely busy watching Home Alone, Die Hard, and the 1994 Ninja Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle Christmas Special on repeat until the new year.</em></p> \n<p><em>I might stop for food and toilet breaks, I also might not.</em></p> \n<p><em>Regardless of my general health and hygiene over the silly season, I’ll be back in the office on January 2.</em></p> \n<p><em>Catch ya then, don’t forget to buy a pepperoni pizza for Splinter.</em></p> \n<h3>15. “Thank you for your consideration during this festive or not-festive time.”</h3> \n<p>Scared of offending a coworker who may or may not celebrate the holidays? Worry not — I’ve got the perfect email for you. If this OOO message does anything particularly well, it's that it respects the differing views, religions, traditions, and opinions of your coworkers — while amusing so many others.</p> \n<p>It’s also a great impersonation of a robot. So if that’s up your alley...</p> \n<h5>Example</h5> \n<p><em>Hello,</em></p> \n<p><em>You’ve reached Michael Abioye’s inbox. This is a general notice informing you of Michael Abioye’s absence until January 2nd, 20XX. He is currently partaking in the traditions of a certain holiday, which may or may not be denominational or non-denominational. Example Company is in no way endorsing or not endorsing said holiday, nor encouraging or discouraging employees of all demographics to engage in celebratory activities. Thank you for your consideration during this festive or not-festive time.</em></p> \n<p><em>Sincerely,</em></p> \n<p><em>Management</em></p> \n<h2>Out-of-Office Messages When Working from Home</h2> \n<p>Working from home? Try these OOO messages to let people know you’re taking a break.</p> \n<h3>16. “I’ll get back to you once I’m back from my long-awaited trip to the fridge.”</h3> \n<p>If you’re taking a vacation and staying home, your clients or coworkers may still expect you to pop into the office and answer their email. Use this autoresponder to let them know you’re really not available — even if you’re bumming around on the couch.</p> \n<h5>Example</h5> \n<p>Hey,</p> \n<p><em>Thanks for your email. I’m on vacation. On the couch. Eating chips. And bingeing Stranger Things for the eighth time (don’t tell anyone).</em></p> \n<p><em>Unfortunately, I can’t answer your email (even though my office is three feet away). I’ll get back to you once I’m back from my long-awaited trip to the fridge. Bought tickets on TripAdvisor and everything.</em></p> \n<p><em>I’ll be back in the office on the third and will get back to you then.</em></p> \n<h3>17. “Alexa, play Vacation by Dirty Heads.”</h3> \n<p>Do you own an Alexa? This might be the email for you.</p> \n<h5>Example</h5> \n<p><em>“Alexa, play Vacation by Dirty Heads.”</em></p> \n<p><em>And… it’s playing in the background as I write this email. Guess what? I’m on vacation! And I do love my occupation.</em></p> \n<p><em>Your email has been received and I’ll get back to you as soon as I get back to my home office. Now, how do I turn off this Alexa thing?</em></p> \n<h3>18. “The doorbell just rang. It’s the UPS driver. He’s loading me onto the truck.”</h3> \n<p>In this email, you’re a UPS package getting delivered to your vacation destination. Ah, I wish UPS offered this service.</p> \n<h5>Example</h5> \n<p><em>Hey — you’ve reached my inbox, but hold on, the doorbell just rang. It’s the UPS driver. He’s loading me onto the truck. Dang, it’s stuffy in this truck with all these boxes. He’s taking me down to… Oh! Florida! And now I’m on the beach. Thanks, UPS driver!</em></p> \n<p><em>The UPS driver is scheduled to pick me back up on the eighth. He should deliver me back to the office by the ninth (assuming he’s not late like he was this time).</em></p> \n<p><em>Don’t worry — I’ll wrap myself in bubble wrap so nothing breaks.</em></p> \n<h2>Funny OOO Messages Never Fail</h2> \n<p>Are you fully inspired by the creative out-of-office messages above?

Anyone else remember <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smosh\">Smosh</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Figglehorn\">Fred</a>?</p> \n<p>I'm aging myself, but I digress.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Back then, using YouTube for business and marketing was a new concept. Now, more than 15 years later, it's entirely different. Brands and businesses use Youtube to engage and connect with their audience.</p> \n<p>For marketers, this means your YouTube strategy needs to have evolved from the beginning days of the social platform. If you haven't and are still using old YouTube strategies, you won't benefit from having a channel.</p> \n<p>Let's review the top outdated YouTube strategies that you need to abandon and what you should do instead.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=b33cfd44-133a-49e3-a943-086c5679d485&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"→ Free Templates: How to Use YouTube for Business [Download Now]\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/b33cfd44-133a-49e3-a943-086c5679d485.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<p></p> \n<h3>1. Focusing on selling products rather than helping your audience.</h3> \n<p>While YouTube might have been a place for entertainment before, it's now also a place for people to learn new skills and conduct research.</p> \n<p>Nelson Chacon, the principal marketing manager of YouTube at HubSpot, says, \"Don't sell, help. Users on YouTube like to be educated and not sold to.\"</p> \n<p>When businesses first started using social media sites, one of the older marketing tactics was to sell, sell, sell.</p> \n<p>But users don't want to be sold to. They want help. If they go to your business's YouTube, they probably want information too.</p> \n<p>The best way to abandon this strategy is to know what your audience needs help with. Think to yourself, <em>\"What does my audience want to learn from me?\"</em></p> \n<p>Then, create content that provides value.</p> \n<p>Chacon explains, \"Having a strategy to educate, empower, and provide some assistance can go a long way.\"</p> \n<h3>2. Being robotic instead of human.</h3> \n<p>I don't know about you, but I've seen a lot of businesses put out content that sounds robotic. It doesn't sound human and it's hard to pay attention to. In fact, I'd even say it's not interesting and it's not apparent why it's useful to me.</p> \n<p>That's why Chacon recommends being human in your videos instead. He says, \"YouTube is a very organic platform where people like and trust creators even more than corporations. This can be reflected in the content you make and the interactions you have with your audience.\"</p> \n<p>All the content you create for your marketing team should be helpful, human, and provide value to your audience.</p> \n<h3>3. Neglecting your audience.</h3> \n<p>Another outdated YouTube strategy is to neglect your audience. Some businesses have a bad habit of just putting out video content and not responding to comments or engaging with their viewers.</p> \n<p>Additionally, many businesses don't use social listening to understand what content their audience wants to see or what they're paying attention to.</p> \n<p>This isn't going to help marketers.</p> \n<p>Instead, Chacon recommends engaging and interacting with your audience. He says, \"Users on YouTube like interacting with creators. Keeping up with your social listening and monitoring is vital for success.\"</p> \n<h3>4. Not optimizing your videos.</h3> \n<p>When YouTube was created, SEO and optimization were fairly new concepts. Additionally, the industry (as is still true today) was constantly evolving.</p> \n<p>That's why many creators and businesses didn't know they should optimize their videos. Nowadays, to optimize your videos you should pay attention to what your audience is searching for and add those keywords in your title and description.</p> \n<p>Additionally, mentioning keywords in the video and adding CTAs are two great ways to keep your audience engaged with your content.</p> \n<p>To up-level your YouTube channel, you should dive in and understand how you can optimize your videos for success on YouTube.</p> \n<h3>5. Not using influencers.</h3> \n<p>Am I the only one who remembers a time before influencers?</p> \n<p>While the job of social media content creator was new back in the day, it's not anymore and it's not going anywhere.</p> \n<p>That's why companies should lean into it and use influencers that have a similar audience. On YouTube, a great way to use influencers is to find other content creators, collaborate on videos, and engage with them on their channels.</p> \n<h3>6. Not being consistent.</h3> \n<p>A great piece of general life advice is to be consistent. With marketing and YouTube strategy, it's no different.</p> \n<p>Being consistent is how your audience will build a relationship with your brand. Without consistency, then the relationship will be stilted and it won't feel organic or natural.</p> \n<p>Posting consistent content and engaging with your audience is the best way to find success on YouTube.</p> \n<h3>7. Relying on solely organic rather than promotion as well.</h3> \n<p>Of course, organic traffic and views are very important to your YouTube strategy. However, it's important to use multiple channels to direct traffic to your channel.</p> \n<p>A great way to do this is to cross-promote content to help your audience find your videos. However, this doesn't mean you should just post a link on your Facebook or Instagram page.</p> \n<p>Users don't like when they see a social media page that's sole purpose is to promote other content. Plus, this content gets little engagement.</p> \n<p>What you should do is naturally find ways to cross-promote content. For instance, you could conduct a poll on your Instagram stories, and then include a swipe-up link to your YouTube video.</p> \n<h3>8. Not using analytics.</h3> \n<p>Not using analytics is one of the biggest outdated strategies that you need to drop. It's vital to keep track of your success and measure what videos perform well and which ones don't.</p> \n<p>With analytics, you can find out when your audience is online, what they're interested in, how long they watch your videos, etc.</p> \n<p>Finding the \"best time\" to post shouldn't be the goal anymore. Now the goal is finding the best time for your audience <em>specifically</em>.</p> \n<h3>9. Faking likes and comments.</h3> \n<p>I'm not sure if people still do this, but I remember this being a big strategy that companies were doing when I was younger.</p> \n<p>So much so that most people in my generation don't trust likes, comments, or even followers/subscriber counts.</p> \n<p>Any younger generation that has grown up with social media, like millennials and Gen Z, will notice and quickly unfollow or unsubscribe if they notice these strategies.</p> \n<p>That's why you shouldn't use auto-engagement bots, mass follow accounts only to unfollow the next day, or mass comment on videos asking for a follow.</p> \n<p>This will hurt your reputation, could get you banned from social media sites, and your analytics won't be trustworthy.</p> \n<p>Plus, you won't be building a relationship with your audience, which is the point. The point in these sites is to build a relationship so people are encouraged to purchase from you. If you don't build a relationship with your audience, your vanity metrics don't mean anything.</p> \n<p>Instead, you should only follow legitimate accounts that are relevant to your brand. This way, you can actually increase brand awareness, build trust with your audience, and eventually generate revenue.</p> \n<h3>10. Using the wrong social media sites to promote your videos.</h3> \n<p>While it's important to cross-promote your content, it doesn't help to promote on a social media site that your audience isn't on.</p> \n<p>For instance, if your primary audience isn't on Snapchat or Instagram, cross-promoting there won't help build your traffic.</p> \n<p>That's why your social media strategy and YouTube strategy need to be reviewed every year. It's important to align your strategy with the sites that your audience is active on.</p> \n<p>While Gen Z and millennials turn to Instagram, only millennials or older generations really use Facebook as their main social media site. Older generations tend not to be on other sites like Snapchat.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, YouTube is an amazing platform to use to connect with your audience. And it's still growing in popularity. That's why it's important to update your YouTube strategies and drop the outdated techniques above.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=7e8681b3-9162-45a4-b6a1-f33ff244a78a&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"New call-to-action\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/7e8681b3-9162-45a4-b6a1-f33ff244a78a.png\"></a></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Foutdated-youtube-tactics&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 17 May 2021 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/b33cfd44-133a-49e3-a943-086c5679d485.png","linkMd5":"6652554c0071060da3c8313699b36d07","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn36@2020_3/2021/05/19/14-56-06-894_cf13f3171c1652e5.webp","destWidth":625,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":6230,"destBytes":9478,"author":"Rebecca Riserbato","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/b33cfd44-133a-49e3-a943-086c5679d485.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn36@2020_3/2021/05/19/14-56-06-894_cf13f3171c1652e5.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/7e8681b3-9162-45a4-b6a1-f33ff244a78a.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn4@2020_2/2021/05/19/14-56-41-481_61f66f8328bd53cd.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Foutdated-youtube-tactics&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn39@2020_4/2021/05/19/14-56-41-218_e3bd3ce93ea33437.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1621436166648},{"createdTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:06","updatedTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:06","title":"How to Make Your Emails More Interactive [Expert Tips + Examples]","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/interactive-email","description":"<p>As a Millennial, my experience with email has been quite interesting.</p>  \n<p>For a while, it's where I received chain mail that I was forced to forward unless I wanted something terrible to happen to me or my family.

Increase your email engagement.</h3> \n<p>Sometimes, you may not have anything special to promote, but you want to improve your metrics.</p> \n<p>Perhaps your clickthrough or open rate is low, and you want to encourage your subscribers to participate. That's a great reason to add some interactivity to your newsletter.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"The Daily Carnage interactive email example\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Make%20Your%20Marketing%20Emails%20More%20Interactive%20%5BExpert%20Tips%20+%20Examples%5D-Apr-30-2021-07-15-58-64-PM.jpeg?width=390&amp;name=How%20to%20Make%20Your%20Marketing%20Emails%20More%20Interactive%20%5BExpert%20Tips%20+%20Examples%5D-Apr-30-2021-07-15-58-64-PM.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 390px;\" title=\"\" width=\"390\"></p> \n<p>Take <a href=\"https://carney.co/daily-carnage/\">The Daily Carnage</a>, a daily newsletter that covers all things marketing.</p> \n<p>With every newsletter comes a question of the day that relates to a topic covered in the email. Once you submit your answers, you can see how other subscribers answered the question.</p> \n<p>This accomplishes two things: It gets users engaged and excited about the content and it helps the team at Carney learn more about their audience.</p> \n<h2>Interactive Email Examples</h2> \n<h3>GIFs</h3> \n<p><img alt=\"GIF interactive email example\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Make%20Your%20Marketing%20Emails%20More%20Interactive%20%5BExpert%20Tips%20+%20Examples%5D-4.gif?width=200&amp;name=How%20to%20Make%20Your%20Marketing%20Emails%20More%20Interactive%20%5BExpert%20Tips%20+%20Examples%5D-4.gif\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 200px;\" title=\"\" width=\"200\"></p> \n<p>GIFS are the perfect middle point between images and videos.</p> \n<p>A video can weigh down your email and make your loading speed slow. If you want to add some movement to your email but don't want to go as far as embedding a video, GIFs are the way to go. Plus, they're attention-grabby.</p> \n<p>\"Compared to a static image, GIFs are more eye-catching and therefore more click-catching,\" said Riordan.</p> \n<p>At HubSpot, we've had great success using them.</p> \n<p>When sending out welcome messages for new contacts, we've found that emails featuring GIFs have a clickthrough rate that's twice as high as emails without.</p> \n<p>In addition to capturing subscribers' attention, they also convert.</p> \n<h3>Quizzes</h3> \n<p><img alt=\"HubSpot interactive email example\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Make%20Your%20Marketing%20Emails%20More%20Interactive%20%5BExpert%20Tips%20+%20Examples%5D-Apr-30-2021-07-15-57-76-PM.jpeg?width=400&amp;name=How%20to%20Make%20Your%20Marketing%20Emails%20More%20Interactive%20%5BExpert%20Tips%20+%20Examples%5D-Apr-30-2021-07-15-57-76-PM.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 400px;\" title=\"\" width=\"400\"></p> \n<p>As we covered in the previous section with The Daily Canage, you can increase your newsletter's engagement rate by including quizzes and polls.</p> \n<p>At HubSpot, we saw a 5% increase in open rate and a jump in unique clicks after adding a \"Question of The Day\" poll to one of our newsletters.</p> \n<p>Here's how it works: Users have to answer today's \"Question of the Day\" to see the poll results from yesterday's question. This approach, says Marketing Manager at HubSpot <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/clint-fontanella-973271140\">Clint Fontanella</a>, creates this cliffhanger effect that keeps users engaged.</p> \n<p>\"This was our most successful test because it gave readers something in exchange for nothing. It gave them information and a little excitement and competition, in exchange for them visiting our blog,\" said Fontanella, who used to manage the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service\">Service Blog</a> newsletter. \"It also gave them a reason to come back every day. By participating in today's question, they could see yesterday's results.\"</p> \n<h3>Countdown Timers</h3> \n<p>Want to get your audience excited about an upcoming event or sale? Consider countdown timers.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Countdown timer interactive email example\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Make%20Your%20Marketing%20Emails%20More%20Interactive%20%5BExpert%20Tips%20+%20Examples%5D-1.png?width=400&amp;name=How%20to%20Make%20Your%20Marketing%20Emails%20More%20Interactive%20%5BExpert%20Tips%20+%20Examples%5D-1.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 400px;\" title=\"\" width=\"400\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://esputnik.com/en/blog/email-countdown-timers-how-to#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20easiest%20way,an%20email's%20'Image'%20block.&amp;text=Email%20clients%20don't%20cut,see%20them%20as%20something%20suspicious.\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>A countdown timer is a great way to create a sense of urgency and build anticipation. While this may require some HTML knowledge, it can be well worth the time.</p> \n<p>In 2020, Riordan wanted to boost registrations and build some buzz around a webinar series. She ran a 50/50 test variation with one email including a countdown timer in the header image and another without.</p> \n<p>The version with the countdown timer drove 30% more registrations.</p> \n<p>A timer isn't only useful for upcoming events or sales, you can use them for:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Product or website launches</li> \n <li>Free trial notifications</li> \n <li>Milestone celebrations</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Personalized Calculators</h3> \n<p>When we think of personalization in email, we usually think of adding the subscriber's name in the subject line and email body. However, there are ways to take it one step further. <img alt=\"HubSpot interactive email example\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Make%20Your%20Marketing%20Emails%20More%20Interactive%20%5BExpert%20Tips%20+%20Examples%5D-Apr-30-2021-07-15-56-00-PM.jpeg?width=340&amp;name=How%20to%20Make%20Your%20Marketing%20Emails%20More%20Interactive%20%5BExpert%20Tips%20+%20Examples%5D-Apr-30-2021-07-15-56-00-PM.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 340px;\" title=\"\" width=\"340\"></p> \n<p>This website grader by HubSpot, for instance, is an interactive tool that sends prospects a customized report of their website performance along with specific recommendations and resources for improvements.</p> \n<p>This is a great lead generation tool that can bring you one step closer to turning a subscriber into a customer.</p> \n<h2>Interactive Email Design Dos and Don'ts</h2> \n<h3>Do keep it to one interactive element per email.</h3> \n<p>While it may be tempting, make sure you don't overdo it with your interactive elements. A good rule of thumb is one per email.</p> \n<p>\"Your email recipients will likely be drawn to the interactive element which is the goal, but also means that other parts of your email might be overlooked,\" said Riordan. \"Try to center your email around one interactive factor, whether that be a poll, video, or GIF.\"</p> \n<p>She adds, \"You don't want to compete for attention in your own email – the interactive part should be the main message.\"</p> \n<h3>Don't be afraid to experiment.</h3> \n<p>With any new strategy you implement, there will be a learning curve.</p> \n<p>You may have to try out a few interactive elements before you figure out what works best. And even when you determine the right strategy, it may change depending on the type of email you're sending and the goals you want to achieve.</p> \n<p>For instance, let's say you want to generate more sales for a product. You've tried embedding videos of satisfied customers and adding photos of positive reviews but it doesn't yield positive results. Then, you find that creating lifestyle GIFs of the product increase conversions by 10%. You use that strategy from then on.</p> \n<p>However, as your goals change, so will the methods you try. Be flexible and always be willing to test out various strategies.</p> \n<h3>Do prioritize accessibility.</h3> \n<p>As you incorporate interactivity into your email, don't forget to keep accessibility in mind. This ensures that visually impaired, deaf, and hard-of-hearing users can enjoy your emails without any trouble.</p> \n<p>Here are some tips to keep in mind:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Include descriptive alt text in every image, GIF, or any interactive element.</li> \n <li>Use colors that contrast well.<a href=\"https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/\"> Use this tool</a> to check if you're on the right track.</li> \n <li>Design your email with \"Dark Mode\" in mind.</li> \n <li>Add captions and transcripts to your videos.</li> \n</ul> \n<h2>Interactive Email Templates</h2> \n<h3>1. <a href=\"https://www.litmus.com/\">Litmus</a></h3> \n<p><img alt=\"litmus interactive email template\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Make%20Your%20Marketing%20Emails%20More%20Interactive%20%5BExpert%20Tips%20+%20Examples%5D-Apr-30-2021-07-15-57-57-PM.jpeg?width=500&amp;name=How%20to%20Make%20Your%20Marketing%20Emails%20More%20Interactive%20%5BExpert%20Tips%20+%20Examples%5D-Apr-30-2021-07-15-57-57-PM.jpeg\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block; width: 500px;\" title=\"\" width=\"500\"></p> \n<p>Litmus makes email marketing easy.</p> \n<p>The platform offers a ton of interactive features and tools that you can customize based on the viewport (i.e. device) and email service.

know that people retain<a href=\"https://visme.co/blog/infographic-statistics/\"> 65% of the information they see</a>, but only 10% of the information they hear?</p> \n<p>Also, people follow directions <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02765184\">323% better with a combination of text and illustration</a> than instructions without illustrations.</p> \n<p>That's why, as a marketer, it's important to display information in a combination of visual and text, in an easy-to-consume way.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>A great way to do that is through infographics.</p> \n<p>If you've wanted to create and publish an infographic, you've come to the right place. I know you might be thinking, <em>\"I'm not a graphic designer\"</em> or <em>\"I've never made an infographic before.\"</em> But you're not alone.</p> \n<p>And that doesn't mean it can't be easy for you to learn.</p> \n<p>In this post, we'll take you through everything you need to know about infographics, from what they are to what kinds of infographics there are to how to promote an infographic once you've created it.</p> \n<h4>Table of Contents</h4> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/create-infographic-powerpoint-keynote#what-is-an-infographic\">What is an infographic?</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/create-infographic-powerpoint-keynote#infographic-examples\">Infographic Examples</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/create-infographic-powerpoint-keynote#infographic-dimensions\">Infographic Dimensions</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/create-infographic-powerpoint-keynote#infgraphic-ideas\">Infographic Ideas and Topics</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/create-infographic-powerpoint-keynote#infographic-tips\">Infographic Tips</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/create-infographic-powerpoint-keynote#infographic-templates\">Infographic Templates</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/create-infographic-powerpoint-keynote#how-to-share-an-infographic\">How to Share an Infographic</a></li> \n</ul> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=dc2acf6a-f8c1-44a8-ac28-b628a791cd9d&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"→ Download Now: 15 Free Infographic Templates\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/dc2acf6a-f8c1-44a8-ac28-b628a791cd9d.png\" align=\"middle\" /></a></p> \n<a></a> \n<p></p> \n<p>Infographics typically use engaging visuals to quickly and clearly communicate what the graphic is about.</p> \n<p>People use infographics because they can provide a quick overview of a topic, explain a complex process, and display data easily. Infographics are also great for comparing two opposing concepts or ideas.</p> \n<p>As a marketer, you might've experienced the feeling of indecisiveness when you want to create a marketing asset for a campaign, but you're not sure the best way to disseminate the information. Is your idea best suited to a blog post, YouTube video, or social media post? The great news is that for any medium, in any industry, you can use infographics in your marketing.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>Infographic Examples</h2> \n<h3>1. <a href=\"https://www.invitereferrals.com/blog/guerrilla-marketing-infographic/\">What is Guerilla Marketing</a>, by Invite Referrals</h3> \n<p>Below is a great example of an infographic by Invite Referrals, which focuses on describing guerilla marketing. Instead of making a blog post or video, the company decided to explain, in detail, the concept of guerilla marketing in an infographic.</p> \n<p>With an infographic, the information is easier to digest because it uses succinct copy and visuals to help get the point across.</p> \n<p>Additionally, this infographic has a clear headline that communicates what it's about, so readers can instantly tell what they're going to get from reading it.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/N6gXFqaYGxJGGl8JEJBXbtSYk6MJWzOH8--SomPk3cGgAbVEztc3epEYYXRerX3jl2gbB6sdLgteAb5UAXEtqXu4jqCV5KLkwT7ytEtwotjpg3bNUHsuEtuX4zK8DxR4l0TERsWk\" width=\"326\" height=\"816\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" alt=\"Infographic on guerilla marketing.\" /></p> \n<h3>2. <a href=\"https://www.seo.com/blog/small-business-marketing-infographic/\">Small Business and Marketing</a>, by SEO.com</h3> \n<p>This is another excellent example of an infographic because it uses a combination of data and visuals to give information on small business marketing.</p> \n<p>The creator, SEO.com, also broke down the information into sections, so readers can easily scan the graphic and see what information they want quickly.</p> \n<p>One of the ways this graphic excels is that it knows its buyer persona. SEO.com, a site to help marketers, made this infographic that directly targets small business owners and marketers.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/8Nl0EXIWMUgdIuXO7IuYC5mVNnxWfAy34YkB9_PLXr-WnAm3Daf0e78dXzK072kNgfmOZVPPxO5WjbShSq6tQBF1omjc6uPlEGZQSbfUUvhAsZKsqDzd-c1eYGfPagh7NilI_FWZ\" width=\"488\" height=\"2048\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" alt=\"Small business marketing infographic.\" /></p> \n<h3>3. <a href=\"https://visual.ly/community/Infographics/social-media/video-marketing-infographic\">Video Marketing</a>, by Visual.ly</h3> \n<p>In this example, Visual.ly uses data and visuals to communicate why video marketing is important. Additionally, the company uses bright colors to attract attention. If someone is scrolling social media, the color and design might make them stop to see what the graphic is about. It pulls the reader in.</p> \n<p>With an infographic, you can hook readers with the visual design and communicate an idea in a way that doesn't take up too much of your audience's time.</p> \n<p>Again, the concise copy and visuals will help readers get interesting information right away. And this information is exactly what marketers might want to learn about.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/sFmcgfZkJCx3T8R2MbrsSyhukTOtFx6scqwzdJ-zY32eKySaWAjpKyO6YL3-cFv_JznFnDDJxJ6dA1RaEYn2oR_2ZVGCu61NvMOllQrHMwl-XSFqO6x0EBI_KEQZfM4RiVndXX_2\" width=\"624\" height=\"932\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" alt=\"Video marketing infographic.\" /></p> \n<h3>4. <a href=\"https://advertisingrow.com/infographics/marketing/digital-marketing-the-10-marketing-skills-needed-in-2018-infographic/\">Modern Marketer</a>, by Get App</h3> \n<p>This is an excellent example of an infographic because it uses concise copy and engaging visuals to communicate information.</p> \n<p>My favorite element of this infographic is how it's visually easy to understand and you can see the hard and soft skills of being a modern marketer without needing to dive into the topics. This is a quick, easy-to-scan infographic, which is what marketers are looking for when they're working.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/lEeWak5l-UOV3i90n_dvMVu2IdizRiFOO884emEPh3zzoIefoDOXGhdydMX-oAtYyWmmvdLQIn19EVvejSAvj2VSF8f04WW9BoT6ekfJNtvIDrTLN178YLWdI3cqJoYVCE0GK3Xm\" width=\"624\" height=\"1001\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" alt=\"Infographic on the skills it takes to be a modern marketer.\" /></p> \n<h3>5. <a href=\"https://dittodigital.co.uk/content-marketing-infographic/\">Content Marketing</a>, by Ditto Digital</h3> \n<p>Another great example of an infographic is by Ditto Digital. This infographic focuses on giving tips to content marketers. What I like about this example is that the copy is easier to read than a blog post on the same topic might be.</p> \n<p>The copy is concise and the visual elements of headers and subheaders make it easier to read. Additionally, this is visually interesting and has several graphics to pull your attention.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/qHmUPqeATa1NzofxXo1HVZCNYMeMh6trsEce4Kpl4u-Dgg0orsdCT3vnDPv2I0ey0GImxohdWXV1IYyLmd8JTiX6I-jVMcBTI3cq0J3xU0Cgmw2rG8enQTR6SLUbN3a7n8w7V5O2\" width=\"624\" height=\"1560\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" alt=\"Infographic on effective content marketing.\" /></p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>Infographic Dimensions</h2> \n<p>So, now that you know what an infographic is and have seen some examples, you might be wondering how to get started with your own infographic.</p> \n<p>Before you can jump into designing, it's important to understand what size your infographic should be.</p> \n<p>The answer is that it depends on where you're going to promote it. Below are the most common places you might post an infographic with the recommended sizes:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Facebook: 1200 x 628 pixels</li> \n <li>Pinterest: 600 x 900 pixels</li> \n <li>Website/Blog: 600 x 1800 pixels</li> \n <li>Twitter: 1200 x 675 pixels</li> \n <li>Instagram: 1080 x 1080 pixels</li> \n <li>LinkedIn: 1104 x 736 pixels</li> \n</ul> \n<a></a> \n<h3>1. Comparison Infographics</h3> \n<p>A comparison infographic is an infographic that compares two ideas. Infographics are a great way to compare and contrast because you can visually see things side by side.</p> \n<p>Below is an example of a comparison infographic which compares bad posture with good posture. Not only can you visually see the difference, but you can also read the copy which explains how posture can impact your health, feelings, communication, and appearance.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/0NSqX5P-ctSYk8BMHU3DXlYj9tMkMtd10jq88G5uzak2ihW6RG149f8UscAdIu2cchtAuBbJX1vGtbSIHAbgcySb73vvcHvIjtml8xrI9XGzphsK1pNXokuUvcURnMgKr9iBESNl\" width=\"624\" height=\"404\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" alt=\"Comparison infographic on good posture versus bad posture.\" /></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 12px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.fiverr.com/moon_monalisa/designed-about-comparison-infographics\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<h3>2. Marketing Infographics</h3> \n<p>A marketing infographic is a graphic whose main purpose is to build awareness for a brand and boost engagement.</p> \n<p>With a marketing infographic, you can showcase business achievements, deliver news, display a new product or service, improve a course with handouts, drive interest on social media, show data, present quotes, summarize key points in a blog post, and more. The options are honestly endless.</p> \n<p>Really, infographics can be used for anything. Whenever you're thinking about creating a marketing asset, consider whether an infographic will help prove your point.</p> \n<h3>3. Process Infographics</h3> \n<p>A <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/process-infographic\">process infographic</a> simplifies and explains the steps of a process in primarily visual terms.</p> \n<p>Generally, it illustrates what happens during each step or phase with an intuitive layout that's easy for the viewer to follow from start to finish.</p> \n<p>A well-designed process infographic makes the concept you want to share more accessible and saves you and the audience time.</p> \n<p>Below is an example of a process infographic which explains the process of mechanical recycling.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/0Q5YuCHPZVR20k67pzkfWz2_8-6LKCPXtbyf98zjmSxEPukmW4BexJSWPl4tr1-Xc_TCX2O5zyQafRrDdABR2UYaLnvR94EayCTvYSLn6SkRChACF1XwcaP4Zq7VT9z9czM0-NPB\" width=\"268\" height=\"779\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" alt=\"Process infographic on mechanical recycling.\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><em><a href=\"https://bluevisionbraskem.com/en/intelligence/infographic-how-does-the-process-of-mechanical-recycling-work/\">Image Source</a></em></p> \n<h3>4. Timeline Infographics</h3> \n<p>A <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/make-a-timeline\">timeline infographic</a> is a way to quickly communicate important information — from key dates in your company's history to upcoming project milestones or predicted market trends.</p> \n<p>This type of infographic is what you would use if you were planning a product launch for example. Or perhaps you want to communicate a timeline of your business achievements for your website.</p> \n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Featured Resource: <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/timeline-templates-flowchart-templates\">8 Free Timeline Templates for Business</a></h3> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/timeline-templates-flowchart-templates\"><img alt=\"HubSpot timeline infographic templates.\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/The%20Ultimate%20Guide%20to%20Infographics-May-14-2021-04-14-48-06-AM.png?width=624&amp;name=The%20Ultimate%20Guide%20to%20Infographics-May-14-2021-04-14-48-06-AM.png\" title=\"\" width=\"624\" /></a><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/timeline-templates-flowchart-templates\">Download Now for Free</a></p> \n<h3>5. Statistical Infographics</h3> \n<p>A statistical infographic is a graphic whose main purpose is to show data and research. Let's say that your company has first-party data about your industry. What better way to communicate that than with an infographic?</p> \n<p>Now that we know what types of infographics there are, let's give you a few tips on the process of creating one.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>1. Find resources.</h3> \n<p>Before you start creating your own infographics, look for resources that can help you. This is particularly helpful if you aren't working with a graphic designer.</p> \n<p>For example, you can use <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/create-infographics-with-free-powerpoint-templates\">PowerPoint templates</a> or Canva templates. In fact, there's really no shortage of <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/resources-for-creating-infographics\">design resources</a> -- charts, reports, and infographics. And, depending on your budget and needs, there are a plethora of options available, all of which have their pros, with very few cons.</p> \n<h3>2. Target your buyer personas.</h3> \n<p>When we went through the examples above, you might've noticed that I commented on infographics that correctly targeted their audience. With any marketing asset, it won't accomplish what you want if it's not created for the correct buyer persona.</p> \n<p>Don't forget what the purpose of marketing is: to deliver the right message to the right audience at the right time.</p> \n<h3>3. Keep it focused and simple.</h3> \n<p>Infographics are a great way to stay focused and use simple language to communicate a message.</p> \n<p>The best messages are succinct and very specific to the audience. That's why your infographics should be as focused and simple as possible.</p> \n<p>As a marketer, it's important to simplify your messaging whenever you can. Simple messages are easier to understand and retain.</p> \n<h3>4. Use visuals.</h3> \n<p>Of course, you can't have a great infographic without visuals. In fact, the whole point of an infographic is to communicate a message with both text and visuals.</p> \n<p>The goal of the visuals should be to hook the reader and make it easier to digest the information. And you don't have to be a graphic designer to accomplish this.</p> \n<p>In fact, you can use premade templates to make your life easier. Below let's go over why templates are useful.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h2>Infographic Templates</h2> \n<p>Infographics are a powerful tool for capturing the attention of your target audiences. In fact, businesses that publish infographics grow their traffic an average of 12% more than those that don't.</p> \n<p>The hard part, of course, is finding time and resources to create these infographics. That's why HubSpot created fifteen fully customizable infographic templates that will give you the inspiration and foundation you need to build your own infographics right in PowerPoint or Illustrator.</p> \n<p>Use these infographic templates to present data for your next meeting, promote an offer on social media, or in your next blog post. Visual information is becoming more and more popular -- and now you have the resources to easily create this visual content.</p> \n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Featured Resource: <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/infographic-templates\">15 Free Infographic Templates in Powerpoint (+5 Bonus Illustrator Templates)</a></h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/infographic-templates\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/SJNPJBYrpSTTa4cno50Krsfo6sxyk_rRgoXpiD3weBclI3wTCG5E-UmNwyIr6t818E_lWCXhZQux9WD-7QbWk-DS9AxAL7uURlI7nZIA2nKYTG0BRm72OWSuC1l1GVgbNNBB-0ZC\" width=\"270\" height=\"810\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" alt=\"Infographic template from HubSpot.\" /></a></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/infographic-templates\">Download Now for Free</a></p> \n<a></a> \n<p></p> \n<h3>1. Optimize your infographic for search engines.</h3> \n<p>Infographics don't go viral by accident -- even if you've got the best infographic in the world.</p> \n<p>Instead, strategically promoting your infographic by identifying the right people and the right websites can get your infographic in front of thousands of people fast.</p> \n<p>But before we do that, you'll want to make sure to optimize your infographic for search engines. SEO won't necessarily help your infographic go viral, but it's extremely beneficial because it will help increase your search engine rankings (which means more free traffic to your website).</p> \n<p>Check out <a href=\"http://backlinko.com/on-page-seo\">this infographic by Backlinko</a> to help guide you while you're optimizing your infographic(s) for search engines:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/TczxsajxJJ-7U3vtYEG8rmoCeBT6Fy_nztVaCxoHhBnM1mY-Akwef4oZKUC15idwKEE_tTCQeZqhloZyW74_wwTxbGfEZWXtvJbM2Lh9PyduMQ1-5oIs02wrFnvCbRYAi4uwyrVK\" width=\"624\" height=\"443\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" alt=\"Infographic from Backlinko.\" /></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 12px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://backlinko.com/on-page-seo\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<h3>2. Find websites and blogs that share similar infographics.</h3> \n<p>For example, if I had just published an infographic on email marketing, I would go to Google at type in: \"Email marketing infographic.\" What you're looking for are websites and blogs that have published similar infographics made by other people.</p> \n<p>After you've got a decent list of websites that you think will be willing to share your infographic, it's time for some email outreach. First, start by identifying the authors from each of the websites that published similar infographics. You can usually find the author's name in the article's byline:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/veQfCZjQFcFSOabiCGTA3UL6HWXv5X965pr0SvSOcKgGNTLGXfQKkluiapp70UqEma-FGYdpqLYGyaW1C7Qc-NXGt4pEmNt1ogjg7Ex-Q7GM0g84sXoNlZqOMFtNBUm4APgz-mdm\" width=\"624\" height=\"271\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" alt=\"Graphic on finding websites that publish infographics.\" /></p> \n<p>Once you've got a list of authors, use a tool like <a href=\"https://www.voilanorbert.com/\">Viola Norbert</a> or <a href=\"https://contentmarketer.io/\">ContentMarketer.io</a> to find email addresses so you can start sending personalized emails.</p> \n<p>If you want to learn how the pros do email outreach, <a href=\"http://backlinko.com/white-hat-seo\">check out this article from Brian Dean at Backlinko</a>. Part of that case study highlights the \"Pre-Outreach\" and \"Content Roadshow\" strategies he used to generate buzz for his content.</p> \n<p>For example, check out Emil's 2-step approach to email outreach. Instead of doing what most people do and asking for a backlink or share right away (1-step approach) here's what he did:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Y8I9ngk8DrGm6yOUCoKFjL4c6XhHNBohUID8L20XV18TeVrDnJ0BFLBaJV591N3iPCe73B5AB_HC54xpEKXqORBi1O8fBF0jOaj7QHpOTnMlxXXwnw2V7aCZJIc8SDu8JDOjQ_OG\" width=\"624\" height=\"232\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" alt=\"An email asking for infographic publishing.\" /></p> \n<p>And because he wasn't being pushy, he gets responses like this from people asking to send his content over (2-step approach):</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/wKUfTs9lsqTCpAirinBU8I3WqJ68zmHcXjlumXraTxNvzggzLXU1070CX8m5_D6djnuC-xzgApbG9L3eznyiVw8yqKIUOTRdHIwNlk6xsaa5KZnmsx1WPWD1oq4tHXAzEI5KzA2R\" width=\"624\" height=\"109\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" alt=\"Screenshot of an email asking for infographic publishing.\" /></p> \n<p>See the difference?</p> \n<p>Now I'll be the first to admit that email outreach is not the most exciting part about infographic marketing -- but it's crucial if you want to get more eyeballs on your work.</p> \n<p>Plus, the long-term benefits from the relationships you'll build with influencers and bloggers will become invaluable down the road.</p> \n<h3>3. Share infographic with the right bloggers and influencers.</h3> \n<p>The best tool to find these influencers is <a href=\"http://buzzsumo.com/\">BuzzSumo</a>. Just type in a topic or copy/paste a specific link to pull up content that is sorted by number of social media shares.</p> \n<p>For example, if I were doing an infographic on gardening, I'd type in \"gardening infographic\" into BuzzSumo. Next, I would go through the results one by one and click \"View Sharers\" on any infographics that are similar to mine:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/DP6F4F3eBoTYSUklafmi6pcRAW4m5AanCMrlI9GSM-GHCctyXbLbHmgRweJcAxlIFSIQQsw3QOPV4kil1AUH9wiD7-SCoHdFTeY-x40wxBU7IXTvuw-KOgoBqb_y1BorsHHcubtO\" width=\"624\" height=\"109\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" alt=\"BuzzSumo screenshot.\" /></p> \n<p>This will give you a list of the people who have shared that infographic, which is helpful because you can sort by number of followers to identify influencers with a large number of followers who have shared infographics that are similar to yours.</p> \n<p>Like in the last step, find their email address and start reaching out one-by-one. Aside from <a href=\"https://www.voilanorbert.com/\">Viola Norbert</a> and <a href=\"https://contentmarketer.io/\">ContentMarketer.io</a>, another clever way to find someone's email address is to subscribe to their blog -- the welcome email and all future emails should come from an address that you can respond to.</p> \n<p>As an alternative, if you can't find someone's email address, you can always use Twitter to reach out publicly:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/QgvgirzuqUBahP6onIYlSRVUaivCpEl3AWIJqqFlgVTByVIYziAwDmmZnCB0TO3zpMechuutD_VfXIMcInEdbutMrSFEjMiLzslLZfP5xuZKjrFIcyUAiE5WuwGXZzVA3m5WIhM5\" width=\"624\" height=\"227\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" alt=\"Screenshot of a tweet asking for infographic promotion.\" /></p> \n<p>Sam Hurley has hundreds of thousands of followers but still responded and shared content from Brian Downard:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/g_8EIntDrViMeW6-h1IoMdN1Wz1ohJ_pjA3x7fLVM29ovoUdO7oIhFtOuAVDvKZE7Lh-AnWVl1oJbtJN_zg8eAm8MAiRz8Zuju7ObDhG3PG9pzeDPPBsi5JjNdCrDfFSMSuwlau8\" width=\"624\" height=\"288\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" alt=\"Screenshot of a Twitter exchanging asking for infographic promotion.\" /></p> \n<p>See how he used the same 2-step outreach approach like the email example from above? He asked if they wanted to see it and then sent the link afterward.</p> \n<p>Not being pushy is the key to getting responses and getting your content shared. You might also consider sending a friendly \"thank you\" note after an influencer shares your content to strengthen the relationship:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_XEjDsHgCXyzYr5ju5Oj3IWPdk5uezLoFrcK3eET1M5pt498tPGKQYnjikoJDYZr4WNfpJa6sfg5T06_qmfCPh0StYo-7AcwtouD_kqzMuD_3Cu3pHNdE99eIQkGxeZPzq1EkHo4\" width=\"624\" height=\"660\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" alt=\"Screenshot of a Twitter exchange.\" /></p> \n<h3>4. Submit your infographic to infographic directories.</h3> \n<p>These directories are basically websites that curate infographics for other people to see. And they are the perfect place to get your infographic discovered by people who might want to share it on their website.</p> \n<p>Trouble is, there are dozens of these directories out there, so instead of manually doing each one by yourself, I recommend using <a href=\"https://www.fiverr.com/\">Fivver</a> to pay someone to do it for you. You don't need to have someone submit your content to 50+ directories -- just stick with the people who only add it to the top 10-30 infographic directories.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/8sRsKrIXhMbkhYtErTeke8yKVIeFCRPpmOvLTZh2xsSjWzIUjA9oVluo_4Ag29v92naumOYYNpcFPgacV9oY5pmMx-fu-4-5WPZjd8rZVzk_Qdyz6hS-BBBLO4kfpiiEax1V2MHk\" width=\"624\" height=\"347\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" alt=\"Screenshot of Fivver freelancers providing infographic submissions.\" /></p> \n<h3>5. Promote through all your digital marketing channels.</h3> \n<p>Once you've added your infographic to the right directories, share it through all of your marketing channels:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Share with your email lists</li> \n <li>Schedule multiple social media posts</li> \n <li>Paid ads / remarketing ads</li> \n <li>Add links to infographic on relevant website pages</li> \n <li>Share with industry partners</li> \n <li>Send to influencers/bloggers who've shared your content in the past</li> \n <li>Share with any brand or person you mentioned in your content</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Infographics are a valuable resource that marketers can use to communicate with their audience in an easy-to-understand way. Next time you're coming up with content, consider if an infographic is a better way to communicate your message.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\"

ago, I planned a trip to Charlotte. I booked my flights, and the <em>day</em> before I was supposed to leave, I tried to find my confirmation email.</p> \n<p>I couldn't find it anywhere. Panicking, I called the airline. \"Ma'am, your payment was denied. We emailed you about this.\"</p> \n<p>Very quickly, I learned the importance of email whitelists.</p> \n<p>Fortunately, I was able to book another flight. However, this didn't save me from the stress or frustration I felt at the airline for being unable to contact me any other way.</p> \n<p>At the end of the day, you don't want a similar experience to happen to your customers. And, as a marketer, nothing is more frustrating than realizing your email marketing tactics, meant to engage and delight new prospects, aren't working simply because they aren't being delivered to your prospects' inboxes.</p> \n<p>Here, we'll explain what email whitelists are, and how you can ensure your company is on the whitelists of your email recipients.</p> \n<a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=53e8428a-29a5-4225-a6ea-bca8ef991c19&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"→ Download Now: The Beginner's Guide to Email Marketing [Free Ebook]\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/53e8428a-29a5-4225-a6ea-bca8ef991c19.png\" align=\"middle\" /></a> \n<h2>How To Get On Your Email Subscribers' Whitelists</h2> \n<p>To get on your email subscribers' whitelists, you can ask your subscribers to whitelist your email address. Consider using simple language that frames the extra step as a benefit to the recipient:</p> \n<p><em>\"To be sure our emails always make it to your inbox, please add us to your email whitelist.\"</em></p> \n<p>Ideally, you'd include this message in the first email you send new subscribers to improve email deliverability at the onset of a new relationship.</p> \n<p>You might use your own flair and brand voice to craft a compelling email message. HubSpot Agency Partner <a href=\"https://www.yokellocal.com/\">Yokel Local</a> does this well in their re-engagement campaign aimed at reconnecting with customers who may not be opening their emails:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/whitelist-email-example.jpg?width=450&amp;name=whitelist-email-example.jpg\" alt=\"whitelist email example from yokel local\" width=\"450\" style=\"width: 450px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\">While the email above is serving a specific function in an email marketing campaign, you can also include a more general whitelist reminder in the footer of all your communications like so:</img></p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/whitelist-message-in-footer.jpg?width=463&amp;name=whitelist-message-in-footer.jpg\" alt=\"whitelist message in footer\" width=\"463\" style=\"width: 463px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" /></p> \n<p>Keep in mind that not all of your recipients may know what a whitelist is, so you might also want to incorporate steps they need to take. To make the process simple, you can include links to the instructions for the most common web clients like this:</p> \n<p><em>\"To be sure our emails always make it to your inbox, please add us as a contact or put us on your whitelist. If you have a Gmail account, follow <a href=\"https://support.google.com/a/answer/2368132\">these instructions</a>. Alternatively, if you use Outlook, <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/block-or-allow-junk-email-settings-48c9f6f7-2309-4f95-9a4d-de987e880e46\">click here</a>.\"</em></p> \n<p>Just be sure that you accommodate the typical email clients your recipients use, which could even include Apple Mail, Yahoo, and more.</p> \n<p>If you want to provide more specific instructions in your email, or if you ever have a need to walk someone through the process, here are the steps for whitelisting and email in the two most common email clients, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/email-whitelist#gmail\">Gmail</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/email-whitelist#outlook\">Outlook</a>:</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>1. Click the gear icon in Gmail and select \"See all settings\" from the Quick settings menu.</h3> \n<p>In your Gmail inbox, there is a gear icon in the top right corner. When you select it, you'll either get a \"Quick settings\" menu (see below) or a drop-down with several options to choose from.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/gmail-settings.jpg?width=385&amp;name=gmail-settings.jpg\" alt=\"gmail gear icon and quick settings menu\" width=\"385\" style=\"width: 385px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" /></p> \n<p>If you get the \"Quick settings\" menu, you'll select <strong>See all settings</strong>. Otherwise, navigate to the <strong>Settings</strong> option.</p> \n<h3>2. Navigate to \"Filters and Blocked Addresses\" in the top menu.</h3> \n<p>Once you're in your expanded settings area, you'll want to click <strong>Filters and Blocked Addresses</strong> in the top menu. You'll end up on a page that looks like this:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/gmail-filters-and-blocked-addresses.jpg?width=1035&amp;name=gmail-filters-and-blocked-addresses.jpg\" alt=\"gmail filters and blocked addresses page\" width=\"1035\" style=\"width: 1035px;\" /></p> \n<h3>3. Select \"Create a new filter.\"</h3> \n<p>In Gmail, whitelisting an email actually involves creating a filter.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/gmail-create-filter.jpg?width=1035&amp;name=gmail-create-filter.jpg\" alt=\"gmail create filter on filters and blocked addresses page\" width=\"1035\" style=\"width: 1035px;\" /></p> \n<h3>4. Add a specific email or a whole domain in the \"From\" field.</h3> \n<p>The \"From\" field is where you'll specify what's getting whitelisted. In Gmail, you can specify either a specific email address (e.g. hello@domain.com), or you can whitelist a whole domain by omitting everything before the at symbol (e.g. @domain.com). The former will whitelist one specific email address while the latter whitelists anyone who is sending email from that domain.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/gmail-create-filter-process.jpg?width=732&amp;name=gmail-create-filter-process.jpg\" alt=\"gmail-create-filter-process\" width=\"732\" style=\"width: 732px;\" /></p> \n<h3>5. Click \"Create filter.\"</h3> \n<p>From there, you don't need to input any additional information. Simply click the <strong>Create filter</strong> button at the bottom of the window (next to the blue <strong>Search</strong> button).</p> \n<h3>6. Check \"Never send it to Spam\" in the checkbox.</h3> \n<p>Clicking the button brings up a new window. Here's where you'll actually specify that what you're doing is whitelisting. In Gmail, you do this by checking the <strong>Never send it to spam</strong> box. Doing so will ensure that emails that meet the criteria you specified never end up in Spam or Trash (unless you do so manually).</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/gmail-never-send-to-spam.jpg?width=727&amp;name=gmail-never-send-to-spam.jpg\" alt=\"gmail never send to spam checkbox\" width=\"727\" style=\"width: 727px;\" /></p> \n<h3>7. Click \"Create filter.\"</h3> \n<p>Once this information is specified, you click the \"Create filter\" button again, and this creates the whitelist within Gmail.</p> \n<a></a> \n<h3>1. Click the gear icon in Outlook and select \"View all Outlook settings.\"</h3> \n<p>Sign in to the web version of Outlook. There will be a gear icon in the top-right corner.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/outlook-gear-icon.jpg?width=350&amp;name=outlook-gear-icon.jpg\" alt=\"outlook gear icon\" width=\"350\" style=\"width: 350px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\">When you select it, a drop-down menu will appear. At the bottom of the drop-down menu, you'll choose <strong>View all Outlook settings</strong>.</img></p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/outlook-settings-menu.jpg?width=250&amp;name=outlook-settings-menu.jpg\" alt=\"outlook settings menu with &quot;view all outlook settings&quot; highlighted\" width=\"250\" style=\"width: 250px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" /></p> \n<h3>2. Select \"Mail\" from the settings menu.</h3> \n<p>Once you have the Settings page expanded, you'll want to select <strong>Mail</strong> from the menu on the right-hand side of the page.</p> \n<img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/outlook-junk-email-settings.jpg?width=650&amp;name=outlook-junk-email-settings.jpg\" alt=\"outlook junk email settings\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"> <h3>3. Choose \"Junk email\" from the submenu.</h3> <p>Clicking on <strong>Mail</strong> gives you access to an expanded submenu where you'll have the option to click <strong>Junk email</strong>.</p> <h3>6. Click \"Add\" under \"Safe senders and domains.\"</h3> <p>In the \"Junk email\" window is an option for adding safe senders and domains. Underneath this heading is the word <strong>Add</strong> with a plus sign next to it. Click this.</p> <p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/outlook-add-safe-senders-and-domains.jpg?width=650&amp;name=outlook-add-safe-senders-and-domains.jpg\" alt=\"outlook add safe senders and domains\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" /></p> <h3>7. Enter the email address that you want whitelisted.</h3> <p>This is where you'll specify what's getting whitelisted.</p> <h3>8. Choose \"Save.\"</h3> <p>This will save your whitelist preferences and ensure that emails that fit the criteria don't make it to your junk email folder in Outlook.</p> <h2>Whitelisting as a Best Practice</h2> <p>Encouraging your email recipients to whitelist your email or domain from the outset of the relationship is an email marketing best practice that can help you improve the deliverability of your messaging. After all, your prospects and customers will likely not take this action on their own unless they are reminded.</p> <p>However, whitelisting is not the only factor that can help you increase deliverability. You can help mitigate the possibility that your recipients' email providers mistake your emails as spam by following <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/email-marketing-guide?_ga=2.168089637.567721879.1555430872-644648569.1551722047\">email marketing best practices</a>, such as:</p> \n <ul> \n  <li>Using inbound methods to populate your database rather than buying email lists and sending spam email</li> \n  <li>Segmenting your email database to ensure you're always sending the right email to the right recipients</li> \n  <li>Keeping your contact information clean and removing defunct or nonresponsive emails</li> \n </ul> <p>All of this is so important in ensuring that your message is heard by your prospects and customers so that you stay top of mind and grow your business.</p> <p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in April 2019 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p> <p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=b229b0b2-204e-4bdf-9079-572da882b84d&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px;

For instance, your logo is a visual representation of your company. It evokes emotion and speaks to your brand's personality. Your identity, on the other hand, isn't something concrete but it is integral to building a connection with your audience.</p> \n<p>These elements work together to create consumers' perception of your company. So, you must take time crafting each element to ensure your business resonates with your ideal customer.</p> \n<p>Don't know where to start? <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/aliciacollins\">Alicia Collins</a>, brands campaign manager and copywriter at HubSpot, has a few tips.</p> \n<p>She recommends developing a brand playbook that includes:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Your brand story and positioning</li> \n <li>Your company tagline</li> \n <li>Your company mission statement and key values</li> \n <li>Your target audience</li> \n <li>Information on the voice and tone you want to use when communicating with customers</li> \n <li>High-level&nbsp;copy your team can use in assets</li> \n</ul> \"This playbook will help your team talk about your company clearly and consistently,\" said&nbsp;Collins.\n<br> \n<p>Once you know your identity, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/brand-communication-strategy\">build strategic messaging</a> to appeal to your audience. Your messaging should convey what makes your brand unique, what you offer, and why consumers should want your products or services. It should also reflect the attributes your target audience wants to see.</p> \n<p>Take <a href=\"https://www.oatly.com/int/\">Oatly</a>, the oat milk brand known for its witty, self-referential marketing campaigns.</p> \n<p>The brand's identity is rooted in ethical food production and sustainability without taking itself too seriously.

The study also revealed that most consumers believe the look and feel of a logo can make or break the brand.</p> \n<p>This shows just <em>how</em> important your assets are to brand perception.</p> \n<p>\"The aim is to use visuals that reflect your brand in a way that also tells your audience what you're about,\" said <span><a href=\"https://nz.linkedin.com/in/harriet-van-tongeren-0b8b3271\">Harriet Van Tongeren</a>, Canva's Creative Lead for Nonprofits.</span> \"Having timeless but memorable brand livery helps retain awareness of your brand, and consistency helps to develop trust.\"</p> \n<p>So, don't skimp on your creative assets.

Another way to solidify your brand is by building a community. This can look like:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Setting up a platform where your audience can meet and interact with you and others in the community, such as a<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/create-facebook-group\"> Facebook Group</a> or Slack channel.</li> \n <li>Engaging your audience on social media, through comment sections, polls, and surveys.</li> \n <li>Organizing events, such as webinars and meet-ups.</li> \n <li>Involving your followers in your process behind the scenes.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>And as you build your brand, remember that it's not solely a marketing play.</p> \n<p>\"Brand extends beyond marketing,\" said Collins, \"so make sure your brand strategy style aligns with your product strategy, sales strategy, service strategy, and more.\"</p> \n<h2>7 Steps to Market Your Brand on a Budget</h2> \n<p>You don't have to break the bank to grow and maintain a brand.

Create a persona to understand your audience.</h3> \n<p>You've probably heard that knowing your audience is the key to creating marketing messages that appeal to them. A great way to get to know them? Create a buyer persona: a semi-fictionalized representation of your ideal customer's values and characteristics.</p> \n<p>\"The job of the brand assets or 'livery' is to visually communicate what each brand wants to tell its audience,\" said Van Tongeren. \"Before you even think about the visual component, you need to know who your audience is and how you want to be perceived by them.\"</p> \n<p>Personas also outline your customer's challenges and where your business fits into solving them.</p> \n<p>Below is an example of a<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/buyer-persona-research\"> </a><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/buyer-persona-research\">buyer persona</a><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/buyer-persona-research\">,</a> Marketing Macy.

So for Macy, I want to focus on a B2B strategy that caters to her goals of lead generation and brand building.</p> \n<p>Understanding those goals helps you determine what kind of media your personas are consuming, what motivates them, and where they \"live\" online. With this information, you can also develop a compelling, effective brand that reaches the right people.</p> \n<p>Make your own buyer persona with HubSpot's free <a href=\"https://www.makemypersona.com/\">MakeMyPersona</a><a href=\"https://www.makemypersona.com/\"></a> tool, which guides you through a series of questions about your ideal customer.</p> \n<p>The tool is fun, interactive, and gets you thinking critically about <em>who</em> you want to reach with your brand and <em>how</em> you want to reach them.</p> \n<h3>2. Develop an identity and voice for your brand.</h3> \n<p>Once you've identified your buyer personas, your brand can start to take shape.</p> \n<p>Create a brand identity — what makes your brand, <em>your brand</em> — and its voice, which is the tone you use in any marketing copy or public communication.</p> \n<p>Developing a brand voice and identity is similar to constructing your personas.</p> \n<p>But instead of answering questions about your target <strong>audience</strong>, you're answering questions that are more introspective to your <strong>brand</strong>: What are your company's values, what do they represent, and how do you want people to talk about you?</p> \n<p>\"The most important part of developing a brand is prework discovery,\" said Van Tongeren. \"If you've done the work and deep-dived into who you are as a brand, figured out what you want to be known for and what your brand personifies then you're in a great spot to start.\"</p> \n<p>When you answer these questions, focus on creating content that supports them. Craft compelling emails, blogs, social posts, and multimedia that reflect your company's mission, values, and how you want to appear to customers.</p> \n<p>For example, if one of your values is to be accessible to customers, make your contact information available to users, engage them regularly, and answer their service questions in comment sections.</p> \n<p>Developing your voice comes through in the copy of that content. Are you going to use conversational language that relates to customers? Or will it be more beneficial to reach your audience from a technical standpoint?</p> \n<p>For example, a lifestyle company with a great understanding of brand identity is <a href=\"https://fanmdjanm.com/\">Fanm Djanm</a>.</p> \n<p>When you navigate to the brand's website and social channels, what you'll see is consistency in their branding. Warm and vibrant colors, powerful images of women, and copy that creates a sense of community.</p> \n<img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/p-V2bEgxnHcP-jcTe1bJRkBynD3wa3ApySx_rVsl1b17iw5QGpJ0uEFiJEwlf9-NC-gqFBOjYNV-7PqUjxCn9JANhWveLrx3Gw0kcqSOxLb0Yl4injcmiMDPBcnXyu-4vU_56ILT\" width=\"215\" height=\"409\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" alt=\"example of great branding on instagram\"> \n<p>It's a direct reflection of the brand name, which translates to \"strong women\" and its celebration of sisterhood and self-love.</p> \n<p>Even if you're not starting from scratch, establishing a strong(er) brand voice can be valuable.</p> \n<p>Just take operating system software service <a href=\"https://www.android.com/\">Android</a>, for instance. Their 2019 rebrand was a logo re-up, making the design cleaner and modern:</p> \n<img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-06-09%20at%203.47.16%20PM.png?width=500&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202020-06-09%20at%203.47.16%20PM.png\" alt=\"The Android rebrand of 2019\" width=\"500\" style=\"width: 500px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"> \n<p style=\"font-size: 12px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.superside.com/blog/2019-rebrands\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>The logo came from a need to speak to a shift in audience. Initially, Android's target audience was the developer, but instead, the company has become more consumer-facing. The change was bred from this analysis.</p> \n<h3>3. Map out a consistent social media presence.</h3> \n<p>So, we know who your personas are. And now, we have an idea of what and how to create messaging that connects with them. But where are they?</p> \n<p>There's a good chance you'll find them on social media, and that's an opportunity you don't want to miss. We've talked about how effective it is to reach people where they're already present, and that includes their online behavior.</p> \n<p>A <a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/data/index/\">2020 Sprout Social Index report</a> found that 89% of consumers will purchase from the brands they follow on social media. The study also shows that social media users want to learn about brands' new products and services. In fact, 57% of respondents said it's the top reason they follow companies on social media.</p> \n<p>Now that you have a clear picture of what your audience is interested in, the next step is figuring out <em>where</em> they're spending the most time on social media.</p> \n<p>Don't worry, you don't have to play <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inspector_Gadget\">Inspector Gadget </a>to figure this out. Check out competitors — see where they're most active (and how their language may or may not connect to audiences).</p> \n<p>Additionally, look at each social platform's demographic breakdown to better understand <em>who</em> you're targeting and <em>where</em>.</p> \n<p>For instance, the <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/187041/us-user-age-distribution-on-facebook/\">highest percentage of U.S. men and women</a> who use Facebook are between the ages of 24 and 35. TikTok, on the other hand, tends to have a younger audience, with many users falling in the Gen Z population.</p> \n<p>If you find the majority of your audience prioritizes one social network, you'll have an idea of where to allocate your resources.</p> \n<p>However, don't ignore other sites. When you build a presence on multiple social media platforms, you'll have an opportunity to diversify how you reach audiences.</p> \n<p>Diversifying the methods and channels you use for obtaining new leads helps you to connect with as many potential customers as possible.</p> \n<p>Maintaining a presence is just as important as building one — for example, have you ever gone to a brand's Facebook page, only to find that nothing has been posted in the past three months? Chances are, it didn't have a positive impact on your perception.</p> \n<p>That can be avoided by planning and scheduling social media posts like you would with any marketing calendar. This free <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/social-media-content-calendar?_ga=2.137972019.2047977140.1619808386-311229973.1619808386\">Social Media Content Calendar</a> can help.</p> \n<p>It's also important to think ahead of time about the content you'll be posting on social media and the interactions you want to have with your followers.</p> \n<p>One of the top reasons why consumers unfollow brands on social media is irrelevant content and too many ads, according to the Sprout Social Index report.</p> \n<p>If you're wondering what they're looking for, the survey respondents said it's engagement first, followed by memorable content and compelling storytelling.</p> \n<h3>4. Start a company blog.</h3> \n<p>We've covered <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/are-blogs-dead\">the importance of blogging</a> before, and it can't be emphasized enough. It's a core part of the <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/flywheel?_ga=2.142363185.2047977140.1619808386-311229973.1619808386\">inbound marketing flywheel, </a>especially the \"attract\" stage, which turns website browsers from strangers to visitors.</p> \n<img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/flywheel-5.png?width=500&amp;name=flywheel-5.png\" alt=\"Inbound Marketing flywheel attract stage.\" width=\"500\" style=\"width: 500px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"> \n<p style=\"font-size: 12px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/flywheel?_ga=2.184773802.2047977140.1619808386-311229973.1619808386\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-start-a-blog\">Starting a blog</a> is a fundamental step of inbound marketing. It helps you reach qualified customers, like your personas, by creating content that matches what they're searching for. That's why it's so important to make blog posts relevant to audiences (<em>and</em> optimize them for search engines — here's how).</p> \n<p>\"HubSpot's success has been a direct result of our blog. In fact, we had a blog before we even had a product,\" said <a href=\"https://ie.linkedin.com/in/lisatoner\">Lisa Toner</a>, director of content at HubSpot.</p> \n<p>\"Dharmesh and Brian always had the belief that in order to build a remarkable brand, you have to create remarkable content, and we've done that consistently on our blog ever since we started out in 2006.\"</p> \n<p>Senior Team Manager of the HubSpot Blogs <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/karlamcook\">Karla Cook</a> adds that our blog is a big discoverability point for our target audience.</p> \n<p>\"It's the very first interaction many people have with our brand – even before they learn about our products – and it helps us start that relationship off in a positive way,\" she said.</p> \n<p>Customers are looking for the information you're able to provide. Plus, that content can serve as material to populate your social media networks.</p> \n<p>To find what your audience is searching for, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-do-keyword-research-ht\">conduct keyword research</a>, which will tell you what the most important topics for your audience are via search engines.</p> \n<p>While blogging can be inexpensive, it does take time.</p> \n<p>The inbound marketing version of that question would ask, <em>\"Would you rather blog for one hour each day and promote content created by and for your company, or several hours a day sourcing content for your ideal customer from your competitors?\"</em></p> \n<p>An editorial calendar is also helpful in maintaining consistent timing and fresh content on your blog. That's why we put together a free <a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/editorial-calendar-templates?_ga=2.142363185.2047977140.1619808386-311229973.1619808386\">blog editorial calendar template</a>, complete with instructions and content management tips.</p> \n<h3>5. Make customer service a priority.</h3> \n<p>When we hear the name \"<a href=\"https://www.zappos.com/\">Zappos</a>,\" most of us immediately think,<em> \"Unparalleled customer service.\"</em> The online apparel retailer built this level of service into its core approach to doing business.</p> \n<p>Why is that so important? For Zappos, making excellent customer service the cornerstone of its brand actually saved money on marketing and advertising.<a href=\"http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/zappos-ceo-how-build-brand-without-spending-big-ads-104959\"> </a>That's because it created word-of-mouth among existing and potential customers.</p> \n<p>This is called earned media: The recognition that your brand has earned, not paid for, from people talking about something you did that was remarkable.</p> \n<p>For example, when I'm shopping on a new website, the first thing I do is read reviews. If I see reviews that mention speedy shipping, friendly customer service, and high-quality products, I'm more inclined to purchase.</p> \n<p>And I'm not alone. A <a href=\"https://www.zendesk.com/blog/zendesk-customer-experience-trends-report-2020/\">2020 Zendesk Customer Experience Trends study</a> found that customer service is a top consideration for consumers when deciding whether to purchase from a brand – more than the product or service itself and convenience.</p> \n<p>It only takes one bad experience to potentially lose a customer, with the report revealing that about half of consumers will switch over to a competitor after just <strong>one</strong> negative experience.</p> \n<p>This revisits the importance of your identity and voice. As you go through these brand-building steps, think about the values that you want your audience to experience, like excellent service. Those values are what shape the brand's culture, and that influence the voice you project to an audience.</p> \n<p>Wondering what actionable steps you can take? Here are research-backed ways to improve your customer experience:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.zendesk.com/blog/zendesk-customer-experience-trends-report-2020/\">Resolve consumers' issues quickly</a>, offer 24/7 customer support, and have friendly agents.</li> \n <li>Be proactive in <a href=\"https://info.microsoft.com/ww-landing-global-state-of-customer-service.html\">engaging customers with notifications.</a></li> \n <li>Respond to <a href=\"https://info.microsoft.com/ww-landing-global-state-of-customer-service.html\">customer service questions and complaints on social media</a>.</li> \n <li>Allow consumers to call in for customer support, as it is still <a href=\"https://cfigroup.com/resource-item/contact-center-satisfaction-2020/\">consumers' preferred support channel</a>.</li> \n</ul> \n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: 500;\">6. Take advantage of co-branding.</span></p> \n<p>I'll never forget what my colleague, Lisa Toner, says about negotiating co-branding agreements.</p> \n<p>\"Larger companies may have a large reach,\" she explains, \"But what do they <em>not</em> have?\"</p> \n<p>When you're just starting to build a brand, you might not have the reach that Toner's talking about. You can take the steps to build it, but that takes time. Until then, one way to get your name in front of a broader audience is to partner with a brand that does have that reach.</p> \n<p>\"Working with a co-marketing partner (an external brand) can be a really valuable way of growing your audience while building a beneficial relationship with a partner,\" said <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/margotmazur\">Margot Mazur,</a> principal marketing manager of strategic partnerships at HubSpot.</p> \n<p>\"You don't have to have a huge budget,\" she adds. \"Working with a partner means that you can split up the marketing duties.\"</p> \n<p>Let's say you're working with a partner on a lead generation campaign, such as a gated e-book, Mazur explains that one partner can take on copywriting duties and the other can take on design, or vice-versa depending on your resources.</p> \n<p>\"This way, you can save money on any freelance costs by working together on a project. Ideally, both you and your partner distribute the content piece to your audiences, driving visibility to an audience you may not have had access to,\" she said.</p> \n<p>\"That saves you advertising costs and exposes you to a new set of people interested in your content.\"</p> \n<p>But don't just pick any brand for a partnership. Make sure it's one that's aligned with yours, so it makes sense in the minds of your audience. Here are the questions we recommend asking when seeking a co-branding partner:</p> \n<ol> \n <li><strong>Will your partner's audience be interested in your brand?</strong> Is this audience difficult for you to reach without this partnership?</li> \n <li><strong>Will your audience trust your co-brand?</strong> That's crucial to getting them to listen to you, so make sure your partner reaches the audience in a way that instills confidence.</li> \n <li><strong>Do you have something to offer your co-brand?</strong> Just like Toner asks, \"What do they not have?\" The experience should be a win-win-win: For you, your co-brand, and the consumer. As an example, if you have an international audience that your partnering brand doesn't, consider pointing to that when discussing the partnership.</li> \n</ol> \n<p>Building a brand might seem like a huge undertaking, especially when resources are limited. However, there are plenty of economic ways to get started and continue the momentum.</p> \n<p>A great starting point that's both affordable and offers high ROI is video. Wondering how you can pull it off? Just use an iPhone or a smartphone with high camera capabilities and use free video editing software like iMovie.</p> \n<p>Mazur explains that you can then script your video internally, share it on YouTube and promote it across all digital channels.</p> \n<p>\"Video marketing is incredibly effective – videos can go on your product pages, help pages, blog posts, social media posts, Product Hunt pages, etc.,\" said Mazur.</p> \n<p>She continues, \"Work with your partner to split up the recording duties, as well as splitting distribution. You'll get access to a whole new audience and have an engaging piece of content you can use across your channels.\"</p> \n<p>And don't forget to have fun with the process.</p> \n<p>Of course, there has to be a degree of strategy and logic involved — that's why there are tools to help you determine the different pieces of your brand. But it's a creative exercise, so keep that in mind if you get bogged down in technicalities.</p> \n<h3>7. Host a masterclass or webinar.</h3> \n<p>What are some of the talents the minds at your company display daily? Are they masters of email marketing? Do they excel at coding? Do you earn a \"World's Best Brand Strategist\" superlative every year?</p> \n<p>A fantastic way to grow your brand – and earn leads – is to leverage these talents into a masterclass or webinar, and promote them online.</p> \n<p>By optimizing your class with hashtags and witty captions, you'll find audiences who are interested in the talents for which you're offering lessons. These masterclasses can be 45- to 60-minute sessions that provide an overview of your special expertise and showcase how to do it right.</p> \n<p>For example, if I were to offer a webinar, it would highlight the art of using emojis for business, an experiment I'm passionate about. I would start by describing why engaging copy is important for attracting customers.</p> \n<p>Then, I'd explain the pros and cons of emoji usage. Finally, I'd share the right and wrong times to include emojis in marketing messages.</p> \n<p>After that, I would present an experiment and report on my findings. Whether the experiment supports or negates my thesis always leaves room for fruitful discussion — leading to the last portion, questions.</p> \n<p>Voila – an outline for a masterclass that uses my talents to back up the credibility of a business that focuses on, let's say, marketing or social media.</p> \n<p>Running experiments doesn't have to cost a dime, and hosting a webinar takes only about an hour of your day.</p> \n<p>The result, however, is spreading the word about the value of a company, providing data that supports credibility, and promoting company values like delighting customers and giving helpful, educational content to your audience.</p> \n<p>Branding on a budget? Absolutely possible. What counts, when you're brainstorming ways to brand effectively, is how to use the resources you have to the best of your ability.</p> \n<p>Keeping your audience in mind is the first step — after that, it's about thinking of creative ways to engage those target customers.</p> \n<p>Have fun building your brand. After all, this is a creative process and while every experiment may not work, you can always learn to improve.

More than likely, this means there's an issue or temporary glitch with the website's programming.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Some potential causes include:&nbsp;</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Corrupted or broken .htaccess file&nbsp;</li> \n <li>A permissions error</li> \n <li>Faulty third-party plugins or themes</li> \n <li>the PHP memory limit being exceeded</li> \n</ul> \n<p>However, the difficulty with a 500 internal server error is it doesn't immediately tell you what the problem <em>is</em>, or how to fix it. Let's dive into a few potential solutions you can try to fix the issue.</p> \n<h2 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">How to Fix a 500 Internal Server Error</h2> \n<p>Fortunately, there are a few effective solutions for fixing most HTTP 500 Internal Server Errors.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3><strong>If You're Trying to Load a Page with a 500 Internal Server Error</strong></h3> \n<h4><strong>1. Refresh the page.</strong></h4> \n<p>This might seem obvious, but if it's a temporary loading issue, you might find success if you refresh the page. Before trying anything else in this list, reload the page and see what happens.&nbsp;</p> \n<h4><strong>2. Come back later. </strong></h4> \n<p>Since the error is on the server-side, I'm willing to bet the website owners are working as quickly as possible to resolve the issue. Give it a few minutes or upwards of an hour or two, and then reload the URL and see if the development team has fixed the issue.&nbsp;</p> \n<h4>3. <strong>Delete your browser's cookies</strong>.&nbsp;</h4> \n<p>If clearing the browser history doesn't work, you might try deleting your browser's cookies. If the cookies are associated with the error-prone webpage, deleting the cookies might help reload the page.&nbsp;</p> \n<h4>4. <strong>Paste your URL into the website \"Down for Everyone or Just Me</strong>.\"</h4> \n<p><a href=\"https://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/\"><span>This URL</span></a> should help you copy-and-paste the URL where you're seeing the internal server error. If it's a problem with the server, you'll see a message that says, \"It's not just you! [URL] is down for everyone.\" This should help assuage any concerns that it's an issue with your own computer.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3><strong>If the 500 Internal Server Error is on Your Own Website&nbsp;</strong></h3> \n<h4><strong>1. Deactivate a plugin or theme.&nbsp;</strong></h4> \n<p>Newly activated plugin or themes might conflict with your current plugins or themes. Deactivate them one at a time to identify the exact plugins or themes causing the internal server error.</p> Alternatively, if you just upgraded your software, your current plugins or themes might not be compatible with the new upgrade. Deactivating plugins or themes one at a time until the error disappears is the best way to find the root cause of your problem.\n<br> \n<h4><strong>2. Use a plugin like WP Debugging to identify the issue.&nbsp;</strong></h4> \n<p>If your site is hosted on WordPress, consider installing a plugin to help you identify the issue. This debugger plugin, for instance, helps you figure out exactly what's wrong with your site, which will result in a speedier fix.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>To learn how to download the plugin, take a look at our post, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/website/http-error-500-wordpress\"><span>How to Fix \"is currently unable to handle this request\" in WordPress [HTTP Error 500]</span></a>.</p> \n<h4><strong>3. Ensure your PHP setup is configured correctly.&nbsp;</strong></h4> \n<p>If the issue is related to a PHP timeout, consider creating timeout rules or error handling in your script to resolve the issue. Here's a full list of <a href=\"https://www.php.net/manual/en/ini.list.php\"><span>php.ini directives</span></a> to configure your PHP setup.</p> Additionally, wrong permissions on a file or folder that has a script, like a PHP or CGI script, won't allow the script to run. Check your permissions and make sure you set them correctly on your server.\n<br> \n<h4><strong>4. Check the code for your site's .htaccess file.&nbsp;</strong></h4> \n<p>Incorrect coding or improper structure with your .htaccess file could be the reason you're seeing the 500 internal error. A <a href=\"https://developers.hubspot.com/blog/12-tips-to-speed-up-your-website\"><span>.htaccess file helps you manage</span></a> how long resources should be stored in a browser's cache. Try editing the file if you're seeing a 500 internal server error.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Coding errors of an .htcaccess file and custom scripts can also cause an HTTP 500 internal server error.</p> \n<h4>5. Ensure your new software installed correctly.&nbsp;</h4> \n<p>Check to see if your recently installed or upgraded software actually failed to install or upgrade. To refresh your software, check the vendor's website for instructions.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/How%20to%20fix%20a%20500%20internal%20server%20error-min.png?width=1200&amp;name=How%20to%20fix%20a%20500%20internal%20server%20error-min.png\" alt=\"How to fix a 500 internal server error\" width=\"1200\" style=\"width: 1200px;\"></p> \n<h3>Asking a Server Administrator for Help</h3> \n<p>If troubleshooting popular software problems or debugging server-side scripts doesn't fix your HTTP 500 internal server error, you should read about the most common causes for this type of issue in your server's documentation — an HTTP 500 internal server error can occur in different operating systems for a multitude of reasons.</p> \n<p>You can also ask your server provider to access your error logs and find evidence for the root cause of your problem.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=0258a8e4-d1bc-4016-befe-fcdf39e9faca&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"seo audit\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/0258a8e4-d1bc-4016-befe-fcdf39e9faca.png\"></a></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fhttp-500-internal-server-error&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 13 May 2021 10:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/f01b80a4-709a-45fb-9327-679474f3d6da.png","linkMd5":"d4643745490157e60a0df9efa2a7dae3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn44@2020_1/2021/05/19/14-56-14-165_fea040dc9fae7902.webp","destWidth":416,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":4830,"destBytes":6818,"author":"Caroline Forsey","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/f01b80a4-709a-45fb-9327-679474f3d6da.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn44@2020_1/2021/05/19/14-56-14-165_fea040dc9fae7902.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/How%20to%20fix%20a%20500%20internal%20server%20error-min.png?width=1200&name=How%20to%20fix%20a%20500%20internal%20server%20error-min.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn88@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-41-811_2f6951adadb07ebf.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/0258a8e4-d1bc-4016-befe-fcdf39e9faca.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn16@2020_5/2021/05/19/14-56-40-764_c410f88079f384b1.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fhttp-500-internal-server-error&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn45@2020_1/2021/05/19/14-56-41-133_43dfd125b16edfaa.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1621436166637},{"createdTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:06","updatedTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:06","title":"How to Get to Know Your Email Subscribers, According to Research","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/getting-to-know-email-subscribers","description":"<p>One of the first things I do every day is check my email.

Those stats alone serve as a reminder that email marketing is not a thing of the past. It's continuing to grow and is a major way that brands learn about and engage with their customers.</p> \n<p>As the adage goes, email marketing is about sending the <em>right </em>message to the <em>right </em>people at the <em>right </em>time.</p> \n<p>But, how do you do that?</p> \n<p>In this post, let's review the top strategies you can use to get to know your email subscribers according to research.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=53e8428a-29a5-4225-a6ea-bca8ef991c19&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"→ Download Now: The Beginner's Guide to Email Marketing [Free Ebook]\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/53e8428a-29a5-4225-a6ea-bca8ef991c19.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<p></p> \n<h3>1. Use analytics.</h3> \n<p>A great way to learn about your current email subscribers is to dive into your analytics. Find out what emails perform best. Is there a pattern? What topics is your audience most interested in?</p> \n<p>What emails do they engage with the most? What day/time are your open rates higher?</p> \n<p>Analytics can help you figure all of this out so you can be in touch with and provide content that your audience wants.</p> \n<p>Cynthia Price at Litmus says, \"If emails could talk, you could learn a lot about your subscribers. Oh, wait. They do. Open rates, click-through rates, and other standard email metrics all give you signals. They're interested. They're not. They're done.\"</p> \n<p>But how do you optimize other things like templates? Or apply what you learn in your email program to other channels?</p> \n<p>Price explains, \"With analytics that go beyond opens and clicks. When you know which email clients your subscribers use, you can optimize the experience for them. For example, what if the majority of your subscribers are on mobile and using Dark Mode? You'll want to incorporate that into your design strategy and <a href=\"https://www.litmus.com/email-testing?utm_campaign=wc-2021-04-not_a_marketing_report-hubspot-get_more&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=hubspot\">QA &amp; testing process</a>. Or let's say you know an email has a high forward or print rate. You might have a possible viral piece of content on your hands. Don't miss out on insights like these—<a href=\"https://www.litmus.com/insights?utm_campaign=wc-2021-04-not_a_marketing_report-hubspot-get_more&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=hubspot\">see what your subscribers are telling you</a>.\"</p> \n<p>Ultimately, monitoring your metrics will help you identify what your audience is interested in.</p> \n<h3>2. Participate in social media listening.</h3> \n<p>Did you know that <a href=\"https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/industries/consumer-markets/consumer-insights-survey.html\">37% of consumers </a>find purchase inspiration from their social media channels?</p> \n<p>Paying attention to what your audience is doing on social media will help you learn more about your consumers so you can understand the content that they want to see.</p> \n<p>Think, <em>\"What are they interacting with on social media? What type of information are they looking for?\"</em></p> \n<p>With this information, you can learn what content your audience really enjoys.</p> \n<h3>3. Send polls.</h3> \n<p>This might seem a little too straightforward, but honestly, the best way to learn about someone is to ask them questions.</p> \n<p>Send out polls in your emails and learn about your audience.</p> \n<p>For HubSpot's Service Blog, the daily email newsletter includes a question of the day. This helps us learn more about our audience on a regular basis.</p> \n<h3>4. Conduct A/B testing.</h3> \n<p>A/B testing is one of the most reliable ways to learn what type of email content your email subscribers react well to.</p> \n<p>In fact, companies that A/B test every email see email marketing returns that are <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics\">37% higher </a>than those of brands that never include A/B tests.</p> \n<p>You can use A/B testing to see what types of subject lines work best, what type of email copy, and more.</p> \n<p>Price says, \"You can optimize content by <a href=\"https://www.litmus.com/resources/2020-state-of-email-report-fall-edition?utm_campaign=wc-2021-04-not_a_marketing_report-hubspot-get_more&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=hubspot\">A/B testing </a>like 90% of marketers. Or personalize to deepen engagement. Birthday emails are said to get <a href=\"https://www.litmus.com/resources/2020-state-of-email-report-fall-edition?utm_campaign=wc-2021-04-not_a_marketing_report-hubspot-get_more&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=hubspot\">3.42 times the revenue </a>of a standard promotional email.\"</p> \n<h3>5. Segment your lists.</h3> \n<p>Segmenting your email list when you learn more information about your audience will help you send better, personalized emails.</p> \n<p>Emails that have personalized subject lines are <a href=\"https://www.campaignmonitor.com/resources/guides/email-marketing-new-rules/\">26% more likely to be opened </a>and marketers have found a <a href=\"https://www.campaignmonitor.com/resources/guides/email-marketing-new-rules/\">760% increase in email revenue </a>from segmented campaigns.</p> \n<p>Essentially, email segmentation can help you increase open rates and improve click-through rates.</p> \n<p>When you go to segment your list, segment by how people found your page. What were they signing up for? For instance, someone who purchased a product and someone who downloaded a specific lead magnet will be interested in different email newsletters.</p> \n<p>You might segment your list by people who want to learn about blog posts and those who are interested in sales information.</p> \n<p>Additionally, you can segment by location. Or maybe even open rate -- send emails to your most engaged subscribers.</p> \n<p>This will help you send the right emails to the right people.</p> \n<h3>6. Do buyer persona research.</h3> \n<p>If you don't have a buyer persona, you might consider creating one. This will help you understand your subscriber's problems, goals, challenges, values, demographic information, and more.</p> \n<p>Conducting buyer persona research will mean that you'll interview customers and learn about their preferences. Then, create a fictionalized version of your customers based on real data. This is another reason why it's so important to use your analytics to learn more about your subscribers.</p> \n<h3>7. Try new things.</h3> \n<p>Getting to know your email subscribers can be a fun way to experiment with email marketing. Try new things and see what your audience responds to. You can try different types of content, different rich media, or different subject lines.</p> \n<p>With email marketing on the rise, it's important to optimize your strategies.

Visually displaying how a process or system works can hold people’s attention and explain complex concepts better than blocks of text can, so DFDs are able to help almost anyone grasp a system’s or process’ logic and functions.</p> \n<p>There are two types of DFDs — logical and physical. Logical diagrams display the theoretical process of moving information through a system, like where the data comes from, where it goes, how it changes, and where it ends up.</p> \n<p>Physical diagrams show you the practical process of moving information through a system, like how your system’s specific software, hardware, files, employees, and customers influences its flow of information.</p> \n<p>You can either use logical or physical diagrams to describe the same flow of information or you can use them in conjunction to understand a process or system on a more granular level. But, before you can use a DFD to understand your system or process’ flow of information, you need to know the standard notations or symbols used to describe it.</p> \n<h2>Data Flow Diagram Symbols</h2> \n<p>Data Flow Diagram symbols are standardized notations, like rectangles, circles, arrows, and short-text labels, that describe a system or process’ data flow direction, data inputs, data outputs, data storage points, and its various sub-processes.</p> \n<p>There are four common methods of notation used in DFDs: Yourdon &amp; De Marco, Gene &amp; Sarson, SSADM and Unified. All use the same labels and similar shapes to represent the four main elements of a DFD — external entity, process, data store, and data flow.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/NnLNAMluc7B7Cqpic3yuoiwAHqrwNM8Hi5nGiSOI6J3sC_BkcQmVx42KZghjxeqy5lFSIFW8MJLEshrmYvYdxc3E7Jwyyi2yQnpyFgls4l3gH_fCEksTvQC94GtzstgEgOApr6aK\" width=\"687\" style=\"width: 687px;\" alt=\"Data-flow-diagram-symbols\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://warren2lynch.medium.com/data-flow-diagram-comprehensive-guide-with-examples-d9858387f25e\"><em>Image Source</em></a></p> \n<h3>External Entity</h3> \n<p>An external entity, which are also known as terminators, sources, sinks, or actors, are an outside system or process that sends or receives data to and from the diagrammed system. They’re either the sources or destinations of information, so they’re usually placed on the diagram’s edges. External entity symbols are similar across models except for Unified, which uses a stick-figure drawing instead of a rectangle, circle, or square.</p> \n<h3 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Process</h3> \n<p>Process is a procedure that manipulates the data and its flow by taking incoming data, changing it, and producing an output with it. A process can do this by performing computations and using logic to sort the data, or change its flow of direction. Processes usually start from the top left of the DFD and finish on the bottom right of the diagram.</p> \n<h3 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Data Store</h3> \n<p>Data stores hold information for later use, like a file of documents that’s waiting to be processed. Data inputs flow through a process and then through a data store while data outputs flow out of a data store and then through a process.</p> \n<h3><strong>Data Flow</strong></h3> \n<p>Data flow is the path the system’s information takes from external entities through processes and data stores. With arrows and succinct labels, the DFD can show you the direction of the data flow.</p> \n<p>Before you start mapping out data flow diagrams you need to follow four best practices to create a valid DFD.</p> \n<p><strong>1. Each process should have at least one input and one output.</strong></p> \n<p><strong>2. Each data store should have at least one data flow in and data flow out.</strong></p> \n<p><strong>3. A system’s stored data must go through a process.</strong></p> \n<p><strong>4. All processes in a DFD must link to another process or data store.</strong></p> \n<h2><strong>Levels of Data Flow Diagrams</strong></h2> \n<p>DFDs can range from simple overviews to complex, granular representations of a system or process with multiple levels, starting with level 0. The most common and intuitive DFDs are level 0 DFDs, also called context diagrams. They’re digestible, high-level overviews of the flow of information through a system or process, so almost anyone can understand it.</p> \n<h3>Level 0: Context Diagram</h3> \n<p>This DFD level focuses on high-level system processes or functions and the data sources that flow to or from them. Level 0 diagrams are designed to be simple, straightforward overviews of a process or system.</p> \n<h3>Level 1: Process Decomposition</h3> \n<p>While level 1 DFDs are still broad overviews of a system or process, they’re also more detailed — they break down the system’s single process node into subprocesses.</p> \n<h3>Level 2: Deeper Dives</h3> \n<p>The next level of DFDs dive even deeper into detail by breaking down each level 1 process into granular subprocesses.</p> \n<h3>Level3: Increasing Complexity</h3> \n<p>Level 3 and higher-numbered DFDs are uncommon. This is largely due to the amount of detail required, which defeats its original purpose of being easy to understand.</p> \n<h2>Data Flow Diagram Examples</h2> \n<p>Professionals in various industries, like software engineering, IT, ecommerce, and product management &amp; design, can use DFDs to better understand, refine, or implement a new system or process.</p> \n<p>But what does a data flow diagram look like in practice — and how does it help your business? Here are three examples to help contextualize DFD impact.</p> \n<h3>1. Level 0 DFD</h3> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/56v9eYEW1Zi_u8d0XUxFAsMoLnxPJr5PPq7LoSqpvOoxPtPHS65GKxNdkpoNUM1rwTr8szueC5DGtYuC0jgBTQ6NajDSJHYNKF2wEZfHGCenqZHABzL_QFglIMbc_udsc7xRNdp9\" width=\"649\" style=\"width: 649px;\" alt=\"Level 0 DFD\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.visual-paradigm.com/tutorials/data-flow-diagram-example-food-ordering-system.jsp\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">This Level 0 DFD provides a contextual map of a securities trading platform. Data flows in one direction from the customer service assistant and the broker to the platform, and in two directions from customers to the platform and back again.</p> \n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">2. Level 1 DFD</h3> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/xymM5LYWsdzGKfpasqWPZm5JTf0PEyLGfftD547sAEQ8eJOd5TD2YWZU_mpKFPxXi0gPTvJHYDXkKAIfrtkXWB7ZK7KOzkuxilF1nF59D48V6XCQCdfgZve7VnIgBW44J0gypbiY\" width=\"656\" style=\"width: 656px;\" alt=\"Level 1 DFD\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.visual-paradigm.com/tutorials/data-flow-diagram-example-food-ordering-system.jsp\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>This Level 1 DFD breaks down the customer process in more detail, expanding it to include account creation, cash withdrawals, and eventual securities transactions.</p> \n<h3>3. Level 2 DFD</h3> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/7KdBsbRTsmVg2tET8VIAEGVoiXg8k5G3_gm6Eg-kTvojSxlEzq1hFCDIjRKbUmZ0D5Ld7pn27IPTZ-d7_cxinugGwKGznpiL1_36v4neJWno5ydN6_PJ02R56LC_JMT_lJDIDzy_\" width=\"665\" style=\"width: 665px;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.visual-paradigm.com/tutorials/data-flow-diagram-example-securities-trading-platform.jsp\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>This Level 2 DFD decomposes the “Place Order” process to contextualize the steps required to place an order <span style=\"color: #222222;\">— either by a customer or by a broker</span>. It even accounts for a third-party stock exchange center where transaction details are forwarded after an order is placed.</p> \n<h3>1. Select a system or process.</h3> \n<p>Begin by selecting a specific system or process you want to analyze. While any system or process can be turned into a DFD, the larger the process the more complicated the diagram and the more difficult it will be to contextualize. Wherever possible, start with a small function or process you’re looking to improve.</p> \n<h3>2. Categorize related business activities.</h3> \n<p>Next, categorize all activities related to this process into external entities, data flows, processes, and data stores.</p> \n<p>Consider a restaurant food ordering system. Customers are external entities, the food ordering system is a process, and the interaction between customers and the system (which goes in both directions) is the flow.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Also worth noting? The ordering system doubles as a data store, so for an SSADA model, this means drawing it as a rectangle with rounded corners with two horizontal lines inside to represent its dual function.</p> \n<h3>3. Draw a Context DFD.</h3> \n<p>Now it’s time to start drawing. DFDs can be created by hand, using free templates available online, or via browser extensions.</p> \n<p>Begin with a simple, Level 0 DFD: Start with your process or system, then map all basic connections and flows.</p> \n<h3>4. Check your work.</h3> \n<p>Before diving into more complex DFDs, check the work you’ve already done to make sure it’s accurate and complete. If you’ve missed (or added) a process, entity, or flow, your next-level DFDs may not make sense and you may be forced to start over.</p> \n<h3>5. Create child diagrams.</h3> \n<p>For each process or system described in your Level 0 DFD, create a new child diagram with its own entities and flows. Eventually, you can use these child diagrams to connect processes together.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>6. Expand processes into Level 1 DFDs.</h3> \n<p>Using your child diagrams, you should map more in-depth connections between each process. In the case of our restaurant example, this could mean digging deeper into the food ordering system and its connection to suppliers, managers, customers, and kitchen staff.</p> \n<h3>7. Repeat as needed.</h3> \n<p>Each process — no matter how large or small — can be reimagined as a Level 0 context diagram and the cycle can begin again. Repeat these steps as needed to create as many DFDs as required, or break processes down further to develop Level 2, 3, etc. DFDs.</p> \n<h2>Perfecting Your Process</h2> \n<p>While there’s no such thing as a “perfect” data flow diagram, continued practice can help streamline the process and offer critical insight into what’s working, what isn’t and where your business can make improvements that offer the biggest impact.</p> \n<p>Your best bet? Remember the rule: Keep it simple. Start with context, build out connected processes, and repeat as needed to map key connections, flows, and entities across your organization.</p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=2f02d8fe-c9b0-4078-a3ae-5831c892fbd0&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"Blog - Data Visualization [List-Based]\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/2f02d8fe-c9b0-4078-a3ae-5831c892fbd0.png\"></a></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fdata-flow-diagram&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 13 May 2021 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/6ecf26a9-faff-4c16-a2d4-b70751ce8b65.png","linkMd5":"b5fbaa6f17f2667b34431a4d5979d282","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn51@2020_5/2021/05/19/14-56-06-930_7ade77560e3aa6a9.webp","destWidth":711,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":7474,"destBytes":11474,"author":"cchi@hubspot.com (Clifford Chi)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/6ecf26a9-faff-4c16-a2d4-b70751ce8b65.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn51@2020_5/2021/05/19/14-56-06-930_7ade77560e3aa6a9.webp","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/yRNYZN-fzFHaVOshx6i7pa8on6Ub9EdKkOMRXvF6YkHpzdL-GVGYvTn3fuGx9tlb_RTynjbg3wMxl1W-vj4dHCooxCgpL7lxgSY2VZrMBM8inKYhiXorRGe7sladWhvVLrk1q70T":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn36@2020_5/2021/05/19/14-56-41-105_71989e2f6faffc96.webp","https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/NnLNAMluc7B7Cqpic3yuoiwAHqrwNM8Hi5nGiSOI6J3sC_BkcQmVx42KZghjxeqy5lFSIFW8MJLEshrmYvYdxc3E7Jwyyi2yQnpyFgls4l3gH_fCEksTvQC94GtzstgEgOApr6aK":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn50@2020_2/2021/05/19/14-56-41-700_5dc03d24c099c58f.webp","https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/56v9eYEW1Zi_u8d0XUxFAsMoLnxPJr5PPq7LoSqpvOoxPtPHS65GKxNdkpoNUM1rwTr8szueC5DGtYuC0jgBTQ6NajDSJHYNKF2wEZfHGCenqZHABzL_QFglIMbc_udsc7xRNdp9":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn57@2020_1/2021/05/19/14-56-42-615_04c25dce2352aa72.webp","https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/xymM5LYWsdzGKfpasqWPZm5JTf0PEyLGfftD547sAEQ8eJOd5TD2YWZU_mpKFPxXi0gPTvJHYDXkKAIfrtkXWB7ZK7KOzkuxilF1nF59D48V6XCQCdfgZve7VnIgBW44J0gypbiY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn7@2020_5/2021/05/19/14-56-41-192_9664fb676f63a2eb.webp","https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/7KdBsbRTsmVg2tET8VIAEGVoiXg8k5G3_gm6Eg-kTvojSxlEzq1hFCDIjRKbUmZ0D5Ld7pn27IPTZ-d7_cxinugGwKGznpiL1_36v4neJWno5ydN6_PJ02R56LC_JMT_lJDIDzy_":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn31@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-40-591_537bce42a818ee39.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/2f02d8fe-c9b0-4078-a3ae-5831c892fbd0.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn88@2020_5/2021/05/19/14-56-41-259_fef54fc89717fe8d.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fdata-flow-diagram&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn13@2020_2/2021/05/19/14-56-41-350_94749f6840a44c99.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1621436166640},{"createdTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:06","updatedTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:06","title":"How to Find the Perfect GIF: 10 Must-Try Websites","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/gif-websites","description":"<p>Serving as snackable — and often laughable — bits of visual content, GIFs help us accurately convey our thoughts and feelings when we're limited to virtual communication.</p> \n<p>The trouble is, finding the perfect GIF by hunting through Google Image Search or that desktop folder of your favorites can take <em>way</em> more time than it's worth.</p>  \n<p>Finding the right GIF doesn't have to be a lengthy process, you just have to know where to look.

Here are a few noteworthy ones:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/gifs\">/r/gifs/</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/reactiongifs\">/r/reactiongifs</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/analogygifs\">/r/analogygifs</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/HighQualityGifs\">/r/highqualitygifs</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/dancegifs\">/r/dancegifs</a></li> \n</ul> \n<p>While all of the different, categorized options make it easy for you to find what you need, many of these subreddits commit to a series of guidelines to refine their entries even further. For example, while \"reaction gifs\" and \"analogy gifs\" may sound pretty similar, there's actually a difference according to <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/reactiongifs/wiki/index\">the /r/reactiongif's wiki page</a>. Allow me to demonstrate...</p> \n<h4>Reaction GIF</h4> \n<p>I don’t know about you but when I find out payday is coming up <em>I react like</em>:</p> \n<h4><strong><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/p7rj35Jn4dQxfrvCjf9NEu9Np-PZo8S7vFJR5g7JYucw-ym_RYjA6Om7dkW_5k94erc9LL-TAohaf5ZnUdox1UrBaUF6u7e4i7-rxW-nNlFuOxJnv5Dbx0Q-_u0UAgnUGFjOMar8\" width=\"596\" height=\"335\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" alt=\"Reddit reaction GIF\"></strong></h4> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"http://imgur.com/CF7qD5A\" style=\"text-decoration: none; font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<h4>Analogy GIF</h4> \n<p>When I try answering emails before my coffee, <em>I feel like</em>:</p> \n<p><strong><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/j5z7WUBz1jMzcnThR8uRSGS4LKADkVXLGG81bdFMPzv1KouH5ZHC247f49qaH9QwRSQwi81LaWo4e84n2ylyGJnxQezUWZxGjQooOls-goO1TcS1PwpWTm5YiGKNI5VHEdzYy_TL\" width=\"404\" height=\"720\" alt=\"Reddit analogy GIF\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></strong></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 13px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://imgur.com/DRJAURZ\" style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: italic; text-decoration: none;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/reactiongifs/wiki/index\">explained on the /r/reactiongif's wiki page</a>, \"A reaction gif is a physical or emotional response that is captured in a .gif which you can link in response to someone or something on the Internet. A gif which is a metaphorical reaction to something does not qualify as a reaction gif. Generally speaking, most posts that use the term \"How I Feel When\" are analogy gifs.\"</p> \n<h3>3. <a href=\"http://tumblr.com\">Tumblr</a></h3> \n<p>Tumblr is a huge blogging platform where GIFs are made and shared like crazy. Bloggers on this platform do an excellent job of pairing relevant GIFs with relatable scenarios. There’s plenty of blogs dedicated to sharing funny GIFs daily, but my favorite ones to share on a Monday would be in hashtags like #work-memes #workfromhome and more.</p> \n<p>For instance:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/rJ78claM0uUFRU5-VI9_BpiySwfg4VYGTSvvCrYG-oURiy-xCKoU06xtfoU4BGAc2uyIBLbfiJMlCFf7dA-PhHJNmIi6iIPc9mgWn1P0ah7pNMMTeywTzwjsRht_J2wl4IwCsNpx\" width=\"298\" height=\"420\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" alt=\"Tumblr funny work meme GIF\"></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 13px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://purrrcrastination.tumblr.com/post/181854858682\" style=\"font-style: italic; font-weight: normal;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>We all know that feeling — right? (If not, then I must ask you, <em>what’s it like to be perfect?</em>)</p> \n<p>Anyways, all you have to do is use the top search bar to lookup hashtags of the content you’re looking for, or follow some blog pages that are dedicated to uploading GIFs daily. GIFs featured on Tumblr are either handmade in Photoshop by the creators or sourced from different websites, and they're pretty good about giving credit where credit is due.</p> \n<h3>4.<a href=\"http://huluperfectgif.tumblr.com/\"> </a><a href=\"http://gfycat.com\">Gfycat</a></h3> \n<p>Gfycat is another gallery with millions of GIFs to dive into. Not only is it one of the most popular GIF sites, but it has an easy Video-to-Gif creator tool to turn your favorite Twitter, Vimeo, and Twitch streams into your library of memes.</p> \n<p>Navigate its selection of GIFs from the search bar or left menu, choosing from the latest “Trending” or “Explore” section to find different popular categories of GIFs or stickers.</p> \n<p>And who would I be to share a site called “Gfycat” without an obligatory cat GIF?</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Gfycat cat GIF\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Find%20the%20Perfect%20GIF%2010%20Must-Try%20Websites-1.gif?width=390&amp;height=294&amp;name=How%20to%20Find%20the%20Perfect%20GIF%2010%20Must-Try%20Websites-1.gif\" title=\"\" width=\"390\" height=\"294\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px;\"><a href=\"https://gfycat.com/adeptinsubstantialantelopegroundsquirrel\" style=\"font-style: italic; text-decoration: none; font-weight: normal;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<h3>5.<a href=\"http://animalygifs.tumblr.com/\"> </a><a href=\"https://tenor.com/\">Tenor</a></h3> \n<p>Tenor is a great way to throw a relatable GIF into any conversation, whether on your PC or iPhone.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Tenor mobile GIF keyboard\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Find%20the%20Perfect%20GIF%2010%20Must-Try%20Websites.png?width=624&amp;name=How%20to%20Find%20the%20Perfect%20GIF%2010%20Must-Try%20Websites.png\" title=\"\" width=\"624\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>Having funny GIFs at your fingertips is a great way to share a quick laugh with your friends and family. All you have to do is type in how you’re feeling on your phone’s keyboard and Tenor will automatically start populating tons of GIFs. Perfect for putting in your conversation with cousin Katy who still gets a kick out of watching America’s Funniest Home Videos.</p> \n<h3>6. <a href=\"http://www.reactiongifs.com/\">Reaction GIFs</a></h3> \n<p>This site serves up an appropriate GIF for just about anything you're thinking. Depending on what you're searching for, there are several different ways to uncover a perfect match.</p> \n<p>One way is to use the dropdown menus on the right side of the site. These menus allow users to surface GIFs that match a specific feeling (tired, confused, proud, etc.) or answer (yes, no, undecided, etc.). For example, a search for \"excited\" might surface something like this:<img alt=\"Excited Perfect GIF Tina Fey\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Find%20the%20Perfect%20GIF%2010%20Must-Try%20Websites-4.gif?width=500&amp;name=How%20to%20Find%20the%20Perfect%20GIF%2010%20Must-Try%20Websites-4.gif\" title=\"Excited.gif\" width=\"500\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>Users also have the option to search by galleries or tags. Galleries are organized into categories such as \"OMG,\" \"Dance Party,\" and \"LOL,\" but there’s plenty more tags to explore.</p> \n<h3>7.<a href=\"http://www.gifbin.com/\"> </a><a href=\"http://www.gifbin.com/\">GIFbin</a></h3> \n<p>Here's another stellar resource for uncovering GIFs.</p> \n<p>On GIFbin, users can filter thumbnails by \"Newest,\" \"Top Rated,\" and \"Most Viewed,\" or by tags. The interesting thing about GIFbin's tag system is that they are categorized by both name and count.</p> \n<p>While the names are pretty standard search terms — animals, babies, sports, etc. — the count feature allows you to easily uncover terms with the highest volume of available GIFs. Check it out:</p> \n<p><img alt=\"GIFbin Browse Gif Tags page\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Find%20the%20Perfect%20GIF%2010%20Must-Try%20Websites-2.png?width=596&amp;height=376&amp;name=How%20to%20Find%20the%20Perfect%20GIF%2010%20Must-Try%20Websites-2.png\" title=\"Browse_Gif_Tags.png\" width=\"596\" height=\"376\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>Or if you’ve got too much free time on your hands like me, click through the rabbit hole— I mean— “random GIF” button for endless fun.</p> \n<h3>8. <a href=\"http://imgur.com/r/gifs\">Imgur</a></h3> \n<p><em>Ah yes, Imgur, the Reddit of GIF sites without all the text threads. </em></p> \n<p>Imgur is an image hosting site that shares an array of funny or cool GIFs. It’s library is a mix between new uploads and even some of my favorites from the 2010s.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Imgur perfect GIF lotr\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Find%20the%20Perfect%20GIF%2010%20Must-Try%20Websites-2.gif?width=408&amp;height=160&amp;name=How%20to%20Find%20the%20Perfect%20GIF%2010%20Must-Try%20Websites-2.gif\" title=\"\" width=\"408\" height=\"160\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 13px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://imgur.com/gallery/6d2g1DT\" style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>Search up any tags for all the funny movie edits, or whatever else you’re interested in via Imgur.</p> \n<h3>9. <a href=\"https://imgflip.com/?tgz=gifs\">Imgflip</a></h3> \n<p>Imgflip is another extensive library of GIFs. There are a few ways to browse Imgflip content,<a href=\"https://imgflip.com/about\"> </a><a href=\"https://imgflip.com/about\">as detailed on the website</a>:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Hot/Latest images on the homepage</li> \n <li>Use the Previous / Next / Random navigation on image pages</li> \n <li>Use the hotkeys as described on image pages</li> \n <li>Tag pages (such as<a href=\"https://imgflip.com/tag/cats\"> </a><a href=\"https://imgflip.com/tag/cats\">cats</a>)</li> \n <li>Meme pages such as Grumpy Cat, found on the meme templates page</li> \n</ul> \n<p><img alt=\"imgflip GIF gallery\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Find%20the%20Perfect%20GIF%2010%20Must-Try%20Websites-3.png?width=596&amp;height=384&amp;name=How%20to%20Find%20the%20Perfect%20GIF%2010%20Must-Try%20Websites-3.png\" title=\"imgflip.png\" width=\"596\" height=\"384\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>If you like a little competition, you can <a href=\"https://imgflip.com/gifgenerator\">create your own GIFs</a> and earn a spot on the leaderboard. If your GIF gets upvoted enough, you can bask in the glory of making strangers on the internet laugh.</p> \n<h3>10.<a href=\"http://gifsfln.tumblr.com/\"> </a><a href=\"https://gyazo.com/\">Gyazo</a></h3> \n<p>Last but not least, we have Gyazo. This website is a bit different from the others, but with this tool you can capture your PC screen (like a clip instead of a screenshot) and create GIFs out of them. Made to convert footage into GIFs quickly, it stores your library in your account, so you can link or download your favorite GIFs whenever you want.</p> \n<p>As a different method to making your own GIFs, Gyazo makes it easy to create, store, and share your favorite GIFs with your favorite people.</p> \n<p>For your viewing pleasure, enjoy some GIFception as I used Gyazo myself to make a GIF out of a video of someone using Gyazo to make a GIF.</p> \n<p><img alt=\"Gyazo gif maker video\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Find%20the%20Perfect%20GIF%2010%20Must-Try%20Websites-3.gif?width=624&amp;height=320&amp;name=How%20to%20Find%20the%20Perfect%20GIF%2010%20Must-Try%20Websites-3.gif\" title=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"320\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p style=\"font-size: 13px; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bYA1XLRrnA\" style=\"font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<h2>Why You Should Use GIFs in a Business Setting</h2> \n<p>On a more serious note, GIFs are another form of visual content that can be used for both fun, and strategically for marketing. For businesses, they can be a tool to demonstrate company culture and drive more engagement by appealing to customers looking for authenticity.</p> \n<h3>Internal Use</h3> \n<p>On an internal level, exchanging GIFs in conversation or including them throughout presentations can help break up the monotony of day-to-day business.</p> \n<p>Adding some level of quirkiness in meetings or seminars can keep employees more engaged and satisfied than otherwise. Plus, it never hurts to share a quick laugh in the office, as long as you don’t get too carried away.</p> \n<h3>External Use</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/2016_B2C_Research_Final.pdf\">55% of B2C content creators</a> say that creating or sharing visual content is a big priority for them presently. Similar to videos or live recordings, using GIFs to convey ideas in a business setting offers viewers visuals that are more stimulating than text-only content.</p> \n<p>For instance, when people hear information, they're likely to remember only 10% of that information three days later. However, if a relevant image is paired with that same information, people retain <a href=\"http://brainrules.net/vision/\">65% of the information three days later</a>.</p> \n<p>Also, using GIFs on social media accounts is a great way to catch the attention of potential customers. Whether it’s Instagram, Twitter, or a blogging platform, adding a visual like GIFs to your post can prove useful to a business.</p> \n<h2>The World is Your Image Library</h2> \n<p>There’s plenty of websites to choose from when it comes to finding some pretty cool GIFs. Whether you need to send one to your coworker's birthday email chain, or make your brother, Trevor, laugh at the dinner table, we hope this list helps narrow down your search for the perfect GIF.</p>

selected for the search engine results pages (SERPs).</p> \n<p>Now I know there is a science to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/blog-search-engine-optimization\">blog optimization</a>, and what I was throwing into my blog posts to make them look professional was called header/heading tags — and are an important tool for comprehension <em>and</em> SEO.</p> \n<p><a

<li><strong>H1</strong> — The title of a post. They're usually keyword-centric, focused around the \"big idea\" of a page or post, and crafted to grab a reader's attention.</li> \n <li><strong>H2</strong> — These are subheaders that classify the main points of your paragraphs and separate sections. Consider using semantic keywords related to the \"big idea\" in your H1 while also helping the reader easily find the sections they want to read.</li> \n <li><strong>H3</strong> — These are subsections that clarify the points made in the H2 further. Alternatively, they can be used in formatting lists or bullet points.</li> \n <li><strong>H4</strong> —These are subsections that clarify the points made in the H3 further. Alternatively, they can be used in formatting lists or bullet points.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>The \"H\" in H1, H2, etc. officially stands for \"heading element,\" though the SEO community also commonly calls these tags \"header tags.\"</p> \n<p>As you can guess from the guide above, the numeral indicates the hierarchal relationship between each one (with H1 being the most important, H2 being less important, and so on).</p> \n<p>Here's an example of how this hierarchal structure might manifest in a blog outline:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/heading-tag-hierarchy-example.jpg?width=650&amp;name=heading-tag-hierarchy-example.jpg\" alt=\"heading-tag-hierarchy-example\" width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px;\">Now that you understand that header tags provide structure to a page, let's talk about them with greater specificity, starting with the H1 tag.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Don't make the mistake of using header tags as nothing more than stylistic elements. After all, they are structural in nature. Think of the H1 as you would a book title. Usually, there's only one title for a book, so there should only be one title for your page or post.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In addition, H1 tags should always be at the top of your page before the rest of your content, just as the book title is on the outside cover before you dive into the text inside.</p> \n<p>To illustrate, the header tag in the example below is the title, \"<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-trends?_ga=2.226611358.2017233232.1579814840-940436819.1565181751\">The Ultimate Guide to Product Marketing in 2021</a>.\"</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Header%20Tags%20What%20they%20Are%20and%20How%20to%20Use%20Them-1.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"example of an h1\">\n</div> \n<p>The title is designated as the H1 for the page using HTML code. This code might manifest in the web page's source code like so:</p> \n<p class=\"codepen\" style=\"height: 172px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;\"><span>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/hubspot/pen/QWdepjR\"> H1 Example 1</a> by Christina Perricone (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/hubspot\">@hubspot</a>) on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</span></p>  \n<p>However, as we alluded to earlier, there are other heading tags that also help with creating the structure of a page.</p> \n<h2>How many header tags are supported by HTML?</h2> \n<p>HTML supports up to six header tags (H1-H6) for you to use to structure your page as needed. They can be stylized visually according to your brand, and with the exception of the H1, you can have as many of these tags on a page as you want.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Your headers should stick to the theme of what you're writing about because they can help the reader (and the search engines) find the main points within the content and guide them through the flow of the page. When you're formatting, use your best judgment when breaking up sections.</p> \n<p>Below is a screenshot of a HubSpot blog post with examples of header tags indicated with arrows:</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/example-h2-h3.jpg?width=650&amp;name=example-h2-h3.jpg\" alt=\"example of h2 and h3 heading tags\" width=\"650\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 650px;\">\n</div> \n<p>As you can see, every header tag looks different visually, and each header tag is used for a new idea.</p> \n<p>Now that you know a little more about what header tags are, let's get into how they're used for SEO.</p> \n<h2>Header Tags and SEO</h2> You may think that header tags are inconsequential in the grand scheme of website-related things. However, header tags can help provide structure to a piece of content and call attention to the most important ideas, themes, and (in effect)&nbsp;\n<em>keywords&nbsp;</em>in that content. As a result, header tags hold weight with keyword relevancy and readability.&nbsp; \n<p>Consider this: Google finds content to serve up to its users by <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/submit-website-google\">crawling web pages</a>. As it does so, it analyzes the text, images, and other elements it finds to <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/search/docs/beginner/how-search-works\">understand what that page is about</a>.</p> \n<p>When you put text into a header tag, you're signalling that this text is important, and Google will use these to determine the context of the page, which then helps Google serve up results that are relevant to searchers' queries.</p> \n<p>That's why it's important when using header tags to make sure they're correctly matching a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/importance-of-user-intent-in-seo\">keyword intent</a>. If a post's H1 tag doesn't have a keyword, or if you put irrelevant text in H2 and H3 tags, Google will have a harder time understanding a page. As a result, that page won't rank as well as it could.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>To illustrate, let's say your keyword is \"eCommerce.\" You'd want this to be reflected in your H1 tag, so a title like \"The Guide to Starting an eCommerce Business\" would be ideal. That would tell Google exactly how to send web browsers to your post.</p> \n<p>Search engines also look at header tags within your post, so it's good to keep those keyword-centric, as well. For instance, you might create some H2 sections surrounding popular long-tail keywords related to eCommerce, like \"five steps for creating an eCommerce business\" or \"best social media tools for eCommerce.\"</p> \n<p>You don't have to think of keywords by yourself, either — in fact, you can do some easy <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-do-keyword-research-ht?_ga=2.19535163.2017233232.1579814840-940436819.1565181751\">keyword research</a> to help you out or look into keyword research tools like <a href=\"https://www.semrush.com/\">SEMRush</a> or <a href=\"https://ahrefs.com/\">Ahrefs</a>. Just make sure that your header tags are friendly to both humans and the search engine robots.</p> \n<p>Headers also make pages easier to read. Sectioning off different parts of a webpage keeps information organized and broken up in a comprehensible way. This helps readers find information they're looking for but also search engines which are scanning along, too.</p> \n<p>If your sections aren't making sense, your page might not rank. Think of the sections in this post — do you think they were broken up in a readable way?</p> \n<h2>How to Add Header Tags in HTML</h2> \n<p>Adding header tags in HTML is a fairly simple process. If you want to notate an H1, you would type in &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;/h1&gt;, putting the H1 text in-between those two tags. This is the same method for any type of header tag.</p> \n<p>For example, if your h1 was \"<em>The Guide to Starting eCommerce,</em>\" it would look like this:</p> \n<p class=\"codepen\" style=\"height: 193px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;\"><span>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/hubspot/pen/MWJNpeY\"> H1 Example 2</a> by Christina Perricone (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/hubspot\">@hubspot</a>) on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</span></p>  \n<p>This will work for HTML4 or older. If you're working with HTML5, you might have to use a slightly different line to get the same result. The change is to give a heads up to Google about what the H1 is:</p> \n<p class=\"codepen\" style=\"height: 201px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;\"><span>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/hubspot/pen/vYgoxKR\"> H1 Example 3</a> by Christina Perricone (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/hubspot\">@hubspot</a>) on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</span></p>  \n<p>You can also include punctuation between the two tags. For instance, you might have:</p> \n<p class=\"codepen\" style=\"height: 179px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;\"><span>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/hubspot/pen/abpeJZp\"> H3 Example 1</a> by Christina Perricone (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/hubspot\">@hubspot</a>) on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</span></p>  \n<p>Remember, Google will scan the HTML of header tags to tell web browsers what your page is about, so it's important to look them over and see if your headers in HTML are formatted correctly.</p> \n<p>Some blogging platforms, like WordPress and HubSpot, have an option on the toolbar to create header tags, so every time you want to add one, you don't have to dig into the source code or HTML to do so.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/hubspot-wysiwyg-heading-tags.jpg?width=301&amp;name=hubspot-wysiwyg-heading-tags.jpg\" alt=\"applying heading tags using HubSpot's blog editor\" width=\"301\" style=\"width: 301px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p>The next time you create a post for your website, see if adding relevant header tags affects SEO, and how your readers are comprehending information.</p> \n<p>A good test I like to use is sending posts to a close family member who doesn't know much about blogging or marketing. Using outsider feedback and asking if they can comprehend my writing before I publish helps me format posts so they're understandable.</p> \n<p>Because using headers can help with readability for your users as well as crawlability for search engines, there's no reason not to use them when creating pages and posts. You may even see jumps in search engine rankings, traffic, and time on page.</p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published in January 2020 and has been updated for comprehensiveness.</em></p> \n<p><a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=05aa9467-4eda-4dd6-8b7f-ad9855abfe33&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; \" alt=\"marketing\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/05aa9467-4eda-4dd6-8b7f-ad9855abfe33.png\"></a></p> \n<p></p>  \n<img src=\"https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&amp;k=14&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fheader-tags&amp;bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&amp;bvt=rss\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"min-height:1px!important;width:1px!important;border-width:0!important;margin-top:0!important;margin-bottom:0!important;margin-right:0!important;margin-left:0!important;padding-top:0!important;padding-bottom:0!important;padding-right:0!important;padding-left:0!important; \">","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 13 May 2021 11:00:00 +0000","feedId":54,"bgimg":"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/1d7211ac-7b1b-4405-b940-54b8acedb26e.png","linkMd5":"98d5ae3323308614e9cf5319a5a0a4b4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn64@2020_5/2021/05/19/14-56-07-054_ac504860637ee534.webp","destWidth":368,"destHeight":59,"sourceBytes":4411,"destBytes":6042,"author":"Kayla Carmicheal","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/1d7211ac-7b1b-4405-b940-54b8acedb26e.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn64@2020_5/2021/05/19/14-56-07-054_ac504860637ee534.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/heading-tag-hierarchy-example.jpg?width=650&name=heading-tag-hierarchy-example.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn31@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-42-080_6d55e7fbb5c8f486.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Header%20Tags%20What%20they%20Are%20and%20How%20to%20Use%20Them-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn89@2020_3/2021/05/19/14-56-42-319_050d8471e88afdad.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/example-h2-h3.jpg?width=650&name=example-h2-h3.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn62@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-40-641_a45874ae65314278.webp","https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/hubspot-wysiwyg-heading-tags.jpg?width=301&name=hubspot-wysiwyg-heading-tags.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn26@2020_3/2021/05/19/14-56-41-637_45593e3c558e60f1.webp","https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/05aa9467-4eda-4dd6-8b7f-ad9855abfe33.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn13@2020_3/2021/05/19/14-56-42-575_339ca67d143927cd.webp","https://track.hubspot.com/__ptq.gif?a=53&k=14&r=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hubspot.com%2Fmarketing%2Fheader-tags&bu=https%253A%252F%252Fblog.hubspot.com%252Fmarketing&bvt=rss":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn1@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-40-649_61e907323fe62fb7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1621436166644},{"createdTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:06","updatedTime":"2021-05-19 22:56:06","title":"3 Easy Steps to Build Your Brand Promise [+10 examples]","link":"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/brand-promise","description":"<p>If you're a decent human being, you always honor a pinky promise.</p> \n<p>For the uninitiated, a pinky promise is usually between two people and it holds more weight than a spit shake, legal contract, verbal agreement, and \"I swear on my [insert family member]\" statements combined.

It serves as a company's foundational value and informs every aspect of the company, from its messaging to its customer service.</p> \n<p>Your brand promise should be central to your company, something that remains constant as it grows and evolves.</p> \n<p>Not every brand promise is explicit. In many cases, it's more of an internal mantra that's shared with employees, investors, and partners. However, when you have built a strong <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/agency/develop-brand-identity\">brand identity</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-message\">clear messaging</a>, your brand promise can be assumed by your target audience.</p> \n<p>There's often some confusion between a brand promise and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/brand-slogans-and-taglines\">a tagline</a>, so let's break it down.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"difference between brand promise and tagline\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/3%20Easy%20Steps%20to%20Build%20Your%20Brand%20Promise%20%5B+%2010%20examples%5D.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" title=\"\"></p> \n<p>While it can be just as short as a tagline, a brand promise tells consumers, \"<em>Hey, this is what you'll find every time you interact with our brand</em>.\"</p> \n<p>So, why have one? Well, a brand promise:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Helps internal and external stakeholders know what to expect from you.</li> \n <li>Gains consumer trust.</li> \n <li>Serves as the foundation from which you build out how your company operates from a consumer interaction perspective.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>One thing to note about a brand promise, it is a promise after all. So when you break it, it can affect your reputation and your revenue.</p> \n<p>For instance, let's say your brand promise is something like \"Innovation at every turn,\" and your company hasn't come out with something new and fresh in the last five years, that can deter potential consumers.</p> \n<p>Here are the most common types of brand promises:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Emotional</strong>: A promise appealing to emotion.</li> \n <li><strong>Action-based</strong>: A promise tied to a specific action.</li> \n <li><strong>Social: </strong>A promise based on ethical or social responsibility.</li> \n</ul> \n<h2>How to Build a Brand Promise</h2> \n<h3>1. Focus on your audience.</h3> \n<p>Your brand promise outlines your commitment to your audience. So, to figure out what your promise should be, your first step is determining what <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/audience-profile\">your audience</a> wants from you.</p> \n<p>It goes beyond a specific product or service, it's more specific to the experience you're providing.</p> \n<p>For instance, <a href=\"https://www.planetfitness.com/\">Planet Fitness</a>'s brand promise is based on people's reluctance to join the gym for fear of judgment and embarrassment. The brand, in response, promises to create an environment that encourages people at all fitness levels to go to the gym and feel comfortable working out.</p> \n<p>Another goal of your brand promise is to set you apart from your competitors. What makes you unique, is it your customer service, your product, your mission, your values? Use that to offer a promise that's distinctive.</p> \n<p>In Planet Fitness' case, the brand did something no one else had done: Address the problem with the gym environment, not its users.</p> \n<h3>2. Think about your customer touchpoints.</h3> \n<p>With your brand promise, you're guaranteeing something to your customers.</p> \n<p>As such, place yourself in the shoes of your consumers and envision how you want those interactions to go. Is there a specific feeling involved? What do they have to gain?</p> \n<p>Once you put those into words, you'll be able to craft a brand promise that reflects the experience you want to promote.</p> \n<h3>3. Keep it simple, unique, and inspiring.</h3> \n<p>Your brand promise should be clear and to the point, something you can say in one sentence. It won't necessarily be as fun as a tagline, but it should definitely inspire trust and confidence.</p> \n<p>If you can't articulate your promise in this way, perhaps you haven't fully fleshed out your brand's purpose. If that's the case, start by asking yourself these questions:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>What should my customers expect from me?</li> \n <li>What does my company stand for?</li> \n <li>What makes us unique?</li> \n</ul> \n<h2>Brand Promise Examples</h2> \n<p>Keep in mind that some of these examples of brand promises are assumed and some have been shared by the companies. Use them as inspiration when crafting your own.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/\">HubSpot</a></strong> – Help millions of companies grow better.</li> \n <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.nike.com/\">Nike</a></strong> – Inspire every athlete in the world.</li> \n <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/\">Apple</a></strong> – Think differently.</li> \n <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.starbucks.com/\">Starbucks</a></strong> – To inspire and nurture the human spirit – one person, one cup, one neighborhood at a time.</li> \n <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.coca-colacompany.com/home\">Coca-Cola</a></strong> – Refresh the world in mind, body, and spirit, and inspire moments of optimism.</li> \n <li><strong><a href=\"https://animairis.com/\">Anima Iris</a></strong> – Feel empowered and emboldened.</li> \n <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.telfar.net/\">Telfar</a></strong> – Redefine luxury as accessible and inclusive.</li> \n <li><strong><a href=\"https://trucolourbandages.com/\">Tru Colour</a></strong> – Celebrate our differences.</li> \n <li><strong><a href=\"https://noirbnb.com/\">Noirbnb</a></strong> – Create a safe space for POC to travel and discover new adventures.</li> \n <li><strong><a href=\"https://shoppurhome.com/\">Pur Home Clean</a></strong> – Change the way you think about cleaning.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>What's common across all of these promises is that they never refer to a particular offering or numerical goal. Instead, they are statements that encompass the brand's broader purpose.</p> \n<h2>Brand Promise Template</h2> \n<p>There isn't an exact formula to create your brand promise. However, we have mentioned that it is a blend of a few things that make up your company. So here's a formula you can use to create your promise:</p> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/brand-positioning-strategy\">Positioning</a> + <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/inspiring-company-mission-statements\">Vision</a> + Value Proposition = Your Brand Promise</strong></p> \n<p>Write your answers down and start blending these concepts together into one succinct idea.</p> \n<p>Crafting your brand promise should be a top priority when developing your identity.

However, many marketers still fail to use Facebook to source leads. You'd be losing out on reaching thousands or millions of potential customers if you're one such marketer.</p> \n<p>Even if you're currently generating leads on Facebook, we all could probably use a little boost in our lead generation efforts. And that’s why we created this guide.</p> \n<p>To make sure we're all on the same page, let's start with what a lead is (and isn't) and the two types of leads you can generate on Facebook.<a class=\"cta_button\" href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/cs/ci/?pg=ed40e380-bf04-4fea-b0c3-257696630e08&amp;pid=53&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic=\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img \" style=\"border-width: 0px; /*hs-extra-styles*/; margin: 0 auto; display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px\" alt=\"Sign Up for HubSpot Academy's Free Facebook Ads Training Course\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/ed40e380-bf04-4fea-b0c3-257696630e08.png\" align=\"middle\"></a></p> \n<h2>What is a Facebook lead?</h2> \n<p>A lead is a person who has indicated an interest in your company's product or services by giving you their information in some way. A lead can show interest in various ways: by filling out a form to download an ebook, requesting a demo, or completing an online survey.</p> \n<p>Unfortunately, simply liking a status update, photo, or video on your Facebook page doesn't qualify someone to become a Facebook lead. That type of action doesn't indicate interest in your company or product/services, as it's possible they just liked your post because it had a cute puppy in it, you know?</p> \n<p>Below, let’s review the two types of leads you can capture on Facebook and what their differences are.</p> \n<h3>The 2 Types of Leads You Can Capture on Facebook</h3> \n<p>There are two types of leads you can generate on Facebook: direct and indirect leads.</p> \n<pre><a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/four-days-of-facebook?utm_campaign=GLOBAL%20HSCM%20Four%20Days%20of%20Facebook%20-%20Additional%20Blog%20Posts&amp;utm_source=Additional%20Blog%20Posts&amp;utm_medium=Additional%20Blog%20Posts”\">Don't miss this live virtual event with Facebook and HubSpot on how to grow your business faster than ever with Facebook.</a></pre> \n<h4>Direct Leads</h4> \n<p>A direct Facebook lead is generated by sharing content that links directly back to a lead form on your website. Visitors then share information in exchange for an offer — whether an ebook, coupon, infographic, or any other piece of content. This form is typically on a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-landing-page-builder?_ga=2.4870900.613338208.1620124416-494221050.1620124416\">landing page</a> dedicated to that specific offer.</p> \n<h4>Indirect Leads</h4> \n<p>Indirect leads are generated by using Facebook on the path to conversion. For example, if you share a blog post containing a<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/call-to-action-examples?_ga=2.9657074.613338208.1620124416-494221050.1620124416\"> call-to-action</a> to a landing page at the bottom of the post, your initial Facebook share indirectly leads visitors to that landing page.</p> \n<p>While directly promoting landing pages is an instant gratifier of leads generated, providing relevant content without a form makes your Facebook presence a friendlier home for content that your target audience will want to come back for again and again.</p> \n<p>Let's look at few ways to generate both indirect and direct leads in the section below.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>How to Generate Leads on Facebook</h3> \n<h4>Lead Ads</h4> \n<p>Lead ads are arguably the most popular tool used on Facebook to generate leads. These are posts that are sponsored by your business and they appear on your audience's News Feeds, Stories, Marketplace, and more. These ads target Facebook users who are most likely to be interested in your company based on the behaviors they display both on Facebook and off. Once a user clicks on a lead ad, they're prompted to fill out a form and submit contact information to your company.&nbsp;</p> \n<h4>Facebook Posts</h4> \n<p>Your Facebook posts are probably what got your audience's attention in the first place. These can be one-off posts or a dedicated campaign that points viewers back to your website or Facebook page. You can include a link to a form within the actual post, or direct users to a landing page where they can submit their information.&nbsp;</p> \n<h4>Facebook Messenger</h4> \n<p>Facebook Messenger is like a built-in live chat feature for your Facebook Page. Users can reach out to you in a private 1:1 conversation and ask questions about your brand and its products.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Don't have the time to manage a live chat channel 24/7? No problem. You can install a bot on your page to respond to customer inquiries.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Whether it's a bot or a person, your team can use Facebook Messenger to direct interested visitors to your website and landing pages so they can convert from prospects to leads.&nbsp;</p> \n<h4>Facebook Events</h4> \n<p>Does your company host an annual networking event? Perhaps has a charity or a fundraiser that users can donate to? Share it on Facebook.</p> \n<p>You can use the Events tool to create dedicated pages for your upcoming events. Your audience can sign up, fill out forms, and become leads all while registering for your event in one place.&nbsp;</p> \n<h4>Facebook Live Video</h4> \n<p>If you're looking for a more spontaneous approach to lead generation, you might want to try Facebook Live Video. Live Video creates a real-time, public stream that your audience can watch on their News Feed. Viewers react and comment on your video as it's running and you can use this platform as a way to direct prospects to your marketing content.</p> \n<p>For example, if you're partnering with a local celebrity for an upcoming road race, you might ask them to \"Go Live\" on Facebook and show your followers what they're doing to prepare for the race. Not only does this give people a behind-the-scenes look at the race prep, but it also gets the word out about your event.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>When you're video is over, the recording is still available on your Facebook page. That way, people who may have missed the live version can catch the recording later on.&nbsp;</p> \n<h4>Photo Albums</h4> \n<p>Keeping with our road race example, let's your race when off without a hitch and it was a massive success. Your marketing team was there the entire time taking photos and capturing the most exciting moments from the day.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But, the marketing team wasn't just taking photos for fun. They're planning to repurpose those images as lead generation content on your Facebook page.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>How? For starters, they can post a photo album on your company's Timeline. This album would show followers how much fun and excitement there was at your race and it would motivate people to sign up for your next one. All you have to do now is include a link to your website in the comments, and you'll be generating new leads in no time.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>These are just a few ideas for leveraging Facebook for lead generation. Read on for some more ways you can use this platform to generate leads for your business.</p> \n<h2>12 Ways to Generate Leads on Facebook</h2> \n<p>Now, let’s dive into some ways you can capture leads, whether they are direct or indirect.</p> \n<h3>1. Post landing pages for offers directly to Facebook.</h3> \n<p>One of the best lead generation ideas on Facebook is sending people directly to a landing page containing your offer. (If you don't have many lead-generating offers yet, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/lead-gen-content-ideas?_ga=2.43219042.613338208.1620124416-494221050.1620124416\">read this blog post for ideas</a>.)</p> \n<p>When you do this, make sure the offer has a compelling featured image that's getting pulled into the Facebook post. To ensure Facebook pulls the right image from your blog post into your Facebook posts, you'll need to optimize the image size and add the proper open graph tags to your website, which <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/open-graph-tags-facebook-twitter-linkedin?_ga=2.43219042.613338208.1620124416-494221050.1620124416\">you can learn how to do here</a>.</p> \n<p>You'll also want to make sure it's clear to the reader where you're sending them. If they think they're clicking into a blog post and find themselves needing to fill out a form, they could get confused or frustrated.</p> \n<p>Use phrases like \"Download your ebook\" or \"Get your cheat sheet\" to indicate where you're sending them and the action they need to take.</p> \n<p>Here's an example from <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SproutSocialInc/posts/4025317124156892\">Sprout Social's Facebook Page,</a> which contains a \"Download this toolkit\" CTA.</p> \n<div class=\"hs-embed-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0; max-width: 500px; max-height: 505px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;\">\n <div class=\"hs-embed-content-wrapper\">\n  <div style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 101%; margin: 0px;\">\n   <iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FSproutSocialInc%2Fposts%2F4025317124156892&amp;width=500&amp;show_text=true&amp;height=505&amp;appId\" width=\"500\" height=\"505\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div> \n<div class=\"fb-post\">\n &nbsp;\n</div> \n<p>In addition to using clear language, you may want to nix the stock photo from that image in favor of your custom image. Even the least design-savvy of marketers can easily create a custom image in PowerPoint or Canva that includes the name of the offer, just like we did in the example below.

Post the blog posts that generate the most leads.</h3> \n<p>Another way of generating leads from your content is to pick and post the blog posts that generate the most leads.

If you aren't using anchor text CTAs yet, you may want to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/blog-anchor-text-call-to-action-study\">read up on the study we did on anchor text CTAs</a> and consider adopting the process yourself. In every post we tracked for that study, the anchor text CTA was responsible for between 47% and 93% of a post's leads.</p> \n<p>Here's an example of a<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hubspot/posts/10158003953044394\"> post from our Facebook page</a> linking to a blog post that includes an anchor text CTA in the introduction:</p>  \n<div class=\"hs-embed-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: auto; padding: 0; max-width: 500px; max-height: 486px; min-width: 256px; display: block; margin: auto;\">\n <div class=\"hs-embed-content-wrapper\">\n  <div style=\"position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 97.2%; margin: 0px;\">\n   <iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhubspot%2Fposts%2F10158003953044394&amp;width=500&amp;show_text=true&amp;height=486&amp;appId\" width=\"500\" height=\"486\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>  \n<p>And here's that anchor text CTA, indicated by the red arrow. The blog post has a pop-up that prompts readers to download a free report containing more social media stats.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/C_s5xMuZeVL34uJCRx8SAo7mr2XPGb60nCSURItGojKCRmykJ3R-7IYWrenG0cFScG3rFcMD8brF_P9fA5Z0sZ1hO9WWlL_S_HxoyixVLHfL4qxmvBG95KB7v54Hbh_t3lL1wVzL\" width=\"682\" style=\"width: 682px;\" alt=\"HubSpot Tik Tok Blog Post Facebook Lead Gen\"></p> \n<h3>3. Include links to landing pages in your image captions.</h3> \n<p>Most marketers understand <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/visual-content-marketing-strategy?_ga=2.51666670.613338208.1620124416-494221050.1620124416\">the importance of using visuals</a> like images and videos in their Facebook strategy. For example, Facebook posts with images see <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/DataReportal/digital-2021-global-overview-report-january-2021-v03\">a higher engagement rate</a> when compared to those without images.</p> \n<p>To turn these higher engagement rates into lead generation opportunities, consider including links to your website in the descriptions for your images — especially your profile picture and cover photo descriptions.</p> \n<p>Whether it's to a blog post, a piece of lead gen content, or just an <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/remarkable-about-us-page-examples?_ga=2.237722695.613338208.1620124416-494221050.1620124416\">\"About Us\" page</a>, links help your audience get to know your company better. And the descriptions of your profile picture and cover photo are prime real estate to do it. That way, any time people view your cover photo directly, they can access the download link.</p> \n<p>Make sure you <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-are-utm-tracking-codes-ht?_ga=2.237722695.613338208.1620124416-494221050.1620124416\">shorten your links and add UTM codes</a> so you can track clicks on them. Shortening and tracking features are available <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/analytics?hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-lead-generation-tips-ht&amp;hubs_post-cta=in%20the%20HubSpot%20Marketing%20Platform&amp;_ga=2.237722695.613338208.1620124416-494221050.1620124416\">in the HubSpot Marketing Platform</a> and with tools like <a href=\"https://bitly.com/\">Bitly</a>.</p> \n<p>Here's an example from<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/smexaminer/posts/10159106310899383\"> Social Media Examiner's Facebook Page</a>:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/3H22PDugoIUeq9s3zx6EE6oQ88mS7Gl-VDeND6bzxJB__4K4ECQZcGr20r6JSj-V8oX8ubEugXJ9o-vRDuvwIgT5u-DB5KBpRkRDybo63sTTBvr-SejqnBpGTBPezemmJ4dFM0yy\" width=\"440\" height=\"584\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" alt=\"facebook-post-showing-link-in-image-caption\"></p> \n<h3>4. Use videos to promote lead generation offers.</h3> \n<p>Facebook's organic reach dropped to around<a href=\"https://wearesocial.com/blog/2020/04/digital-around-the-world-in-april-2020\"> 5.2%</a> in 2020, a massive dip from<a href=\"http://marketingland.com/facebook-organic-reach-drop-steepens-52-publishers-pages-187253\"> 52%</a> in 2016, thanks to the tweaks in Facebook's algorithm.</p> \n<p>Without creating a Facebook ad, it's almost impossible for your audience to see your content. To get as much engagement as possible, marketers have turned to videos.</p> \n<p>Why? For starters, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-algorithm-works-facebook-twitter-instagram?_ga=2.38410340.613338208.1620124416-494221050.1620124416\">Facebook's algorithm favors video content</a>. As a result, <a href=\"https://hootsuite.com/resources/digital2020-q4-update\">video posts have an average engagement rate of 0.26%</a>, which is higher than engagement rates of other post types.</p> \n<p>So, if you're trying to increase your lead generation efforts on Facebook, you'll want to start using videos on your Facebook page to introduce and promote your content, whether they're offers, events, courses, or something else.</p> \n<p>In addition to the text CTA that you can add in the video's description, you can also include a verbal CTA to \"register\" or \"download,\" both earlier in the video and at the very end.</p> \n<p>Check out how <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/llbean/\">L.L. Bean</a> used a video to encourage sign-ups for its course:</p> \n<iframe style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fllbean%2Fvideos%2F10154018287577415%2F&amp;show_text=1&amp;width=560\" width=\"560\" height=\"419\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> \n<p>Here's another example from us here at HubSpot, in which we used a how-to video to introduce a gated offer:</p> \n<iframe style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhubspot%2Fvideos%2F10154419244884394%2F&amp;show_text=1&amp;width=560\" width=\"560\" height=\"425\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> \n<p>We've also created videos specifically to promote lead generation content as we did here for our career assessment called <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/the-next-five?hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-lead-generation-tips-ht&amp;hubs_post-cta=The%20Next%20Five&amp;_ga=2.46410848.613338208.1620124416-494221050.1620124416\">The Next Five</a>:</p> \n<iframe style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden; margin: 0px auto; display: block;\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhubspot%2Fvideos%2F10154195390049394%2F&amp;show_text=1&amp;width=560\" width=\"560\" height=\"419\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> \n<h3>5. Use Facebook Live videos to remind people to register.</h3> \n<p>Videos can be pretty time-intensive to create, not to mention intimidating. But you don't necessarily have to pull together the time and resources to create a perfectly scripted and edited marketing video to leverage the power of video on Facebook — especially if you're a small business.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-live-guide?_ga=2.207254484.613338208.1620124416-494221050.1620124416\">Facebook Live</a> is a feature that allows anyone to broadcast videos from their mobile device straight to their Facebook News Feed. The best part about these live videos is that they're meant to be a little scrappier and more spontaneous than regular marketing videos — making them more authentic and personal.</p> \n<p>So, get the conversation going about your lead generation offers by creating a live video to promote them. You might promote an event by showing the setup live, for example. Or, you might promote an offer by hosting an open Q&amp;A on live video where you interact with Facebook commenters live and on camera.</p> \n<p>Just like you'd do with your standard videos, add a verbal CTA to the video in addition to the text CTA. In a live video, though, you'll want to repeat that CTA even more than you would with a pre-recorded video. Why? Because when you first start live streaming, you may have zero people watching. Even a few seconds in, you could only have a handful of viewers.</p> \n<p>As people find your video on their News Feeds, they'll join in — but that means you'll want to repeat the CTA a few times to catch people up. You can also add a text CTA in the video's description.</p> \n<h3>6. Pin posts that link to lead generation offers to the top of your feed.</h3> \n<p>Pinning a post to the top of your Page's Timeline allows you to highlight and showcase what would otherwise be a typical post. It'll stay at the top of your Timeline <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/235598533193464\">for up to seven days</a>, after which it'll return to the date it was published on your Page's Timeline.</p> \n<p>You can identify a pinned post by an unmistakable “pinned post” marker at the top of the post. Any post you decide to pin should be valuable to your audience and relevant to your online objectives.</p> \n<p>Here's an example from <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ApttusCorporation\">Apttus' Facebook Page</a>:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/apttus-pinned-facebook-post.png?width=494&amp;height=418&amp;name=apttus-pinned-facebook-post.png\" alt=\"apttus-pinned-facebook-post.png\" width=\"494\" height=\"418\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">You can pin any type of post, from text to images to videos, even live videos. If you pin a Facebook Live video, that video will simply show up at the top of your profile with the whole recording, indicating that the Page \"was live\" at a certain point.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Here's an example of what that looks like from <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/refinery29/\">Refinery29's Facebook Page</a>:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignCenter shadow\" src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/refinery29-facebook-live-pinned-post.png?width=495&amp;height=622&amp;name=refinery29-facebook-live-pinned-post.png\" alt=\"refinery29-facebook-live-pinned-post.png\" width=\"495\" height=\"622\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\"></p> \n<h3>7. Add a CTA button to your Facebook Page.</h3> \n<p>Adding a relevant CTA button to your Facebook Page is a crucial lead generation tactic that no marketers will want to miss out on.</p> \n<p>Back <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-call-to-action-buttons-business-pages?_ga=2.42227426.613338208.1620124416-494221050.1620124416\">in late 2014</a>, Facebook added a feature to its business Pages allowing users to place a simple call-to-action button at the top of their Facebook Pages. This button is simple but powerful, and it can help drive more traffic from your Facebook Page to your website — including landing pages, contact sheets, and other <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/forms?hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-lead-generation-tips-ht&amp;hubs_post-cta=lead%20generation%20forms&amp;_ga=2.42227426.613338208.1620124416-494221050.1620124416\">lead generation forms</a>. You can <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-cta-button?_ga=2.42227426.613338208.1620124416-494221050.1620124416\">learn how to install and use the Facebook CTA button here</a>.</p> \n<p>You'll find you have 17 pre-made button options to choose from. These options include \"Sign Up,\" \"Shop Now,\" \"Contact Us,\" \"Book Now,\" \"Use App,\" Watch Video,\" and \"Play Game.\"</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ji_dVDxP5kVWWUmxl0sJNCVpBNU7xMJDBh_MSuWPjQumWgklO61VMUM3c4DP3y9g5X1emQZQOXvRLOknFgRLqV_0SytH4WtDGx-R1RpaHNRuk5Byv7FnOkwlW7mBP-XVTEc-eg3b\" width=\"388\" height=\"793\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" alt=\"Facebook-CTA-buttons\"></p> \n<p>Once you choose a button and link it to a page on your website, it’ll appear up at a fixed location right below your cover photo and to the right.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/81JpbifpLocv3GR2i6DRJgRJ2bjGbcvmxMZ6Rp7GT9R7-NacnbKJzHLdusH9sIrGgPwfp-ElyGK42ezk_5ulwF-NTocSrarXIE03tt8NDR9eJqIdlBSNe__P_dh2fYL1c5care8r\" width=\"602\" height=\"335\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" alt=\"Facebook-CTA-button-example\"></p> \n<p>While some marketers choose a CTA and keep it the same for weeks and months at a time, consider taking your marketing game a step further and switching up that button — and the web page it links to — to match your team's and business goals and the campaigns you're running at the time.</p> \n<p>For example, you might align the CTA with <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-cover-photos-best-practices-ht?_ga=2.240942788.613338208.1620124416-494221050.1620124416\">your cover photo design</a> and a pinned post around a single campaign</p> \n<h3>8. Ask for input from your Facebook audience about your products.</h3> \n<p>You can feed two birds with one scone (as my colleague <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlystec\">Carly Stec</a> would say) by posting a status update asking for feedback on your products/services and then linking to a landing page where people try your tool for free.</p> \n<p>You'll encourage sign-ups by linking directly to the landing page, and your followers will love the opportunity to give their two cents.</p> \n<p>The obvious risk here is that you'll be opening up the floodgates for negative commenters, so be selective on the tools and products you post for feedback.</p> \n<p>Make sure you're posting something you're proud of and ready to receive feedback for. You'll also want to have at least one or two people prepared to respond to Facebook comments as they roll in — both the positive and the negative.</p> \n<p>If you <em>do </em>receive negative feedback, respond as quickly as possible to show you care and prevent them from turning into something more serious. If you get complaints about the product, use the \"customer is always right\" approach and say you're sorry.</p> \n<p>You'll get respect from other customers for being upfront. Share your appreciation for folks' feedback. Finally, ask how you can help — and then actually help. Take notes on the feedback you get and send it to the people who can make things happen.</p> \n<p>(<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/19614/How-to-Deal-With-Negative-Nancy-s-Comments-in-Social-Media.aspx?_ga=2.204296919.613338208.1620124416-494221050.1620124416#sm.0000o5c3iom8gdkipdw2l236rj19q\">This post contains more tips for dealing with negative comments on social media</a>)</p> \n<h3>9. Run a contest or giveaway.</h3> \n<p>People love contests and giveaways. Not only are they fun, but they can also teach <em>you </em>a lot about your audience — all the while engaging them, growing your reach, driving traffic to your website, and (drum roll, please) generating leads.</p> \n<p>Since your giveaway aims to generate leads, you'll need to publish posts that include an attractive featured image or video, compelling and straightforward copy, and a link to your giveaway page where they can fill out their details into your lead forms.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33352/Everything-You-Need-to-Run-a-Successful-Social-Media-Contest.aspx?_ga=2.39023460.613338208.1620124416-494221050.1620124416#sm.0000o5c3iom8gdkipdw2l236rj19q\">Read this post</a> to learn more about running successful social media contests.</p> \n<p>(Before you start your Facebook contest, though, make sure you can run it legally by <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/page_guidelines.php\">reading through their Page Guidelines</a>. Facebook has cracked down on contests due to liability issues, so read through their strict rules ahead of time.)</p> \n<p>Below is an example from<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/zeamofitness/photos/a.619923918214929/1527837777423534\"> Zeamo's Facebook Page</a>:</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/OFDav3_tuSTEb3_DI9GRUvfL1f5-kCrvA1Co4sztjbNpQuA5jC5NrUgIpN16jdYDpcXkfkFWy_X82GbBoNgbzfHqpuCABOPVUm1rvpivE45lEmgEbfATMvcSb5FIN-zVc60JAGgi\" width=\"517\" height=\"416\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" alt=\"Zeamo Facebook Contest\"></p> \n<p>And here's another example, this time from <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Yoplait/\">Yoplait</a>. It promoted its contest using a video to get more visibility on folks' News Feeds. And you can tell the contest was a success considering the amount of engagement the post received.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/VwUGZaeR3xSAsGA3ciQN6HEU1TNCJ_FqnB40HalAaIIPVrobM6wqCQz4hc0UzWaCRhJ4_lHHeUT9x9lIAvqXZQSCtFsTCTnGlTCIQNVLN0TKq_kvxMWUSRuZfe0WKHhSFSj8oyZ2\" width=\"446\" height=\"800\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" alt=\"Yoplait-Facebook Contest\"></p> \n<p>You could also extend your giveaways throughout other platforms like Instagram and Twitter.</p> \n<h3>10. Create a Facebook event page for your next webinar.</h3> \n<p>While sharing landing pages with dedicated content offerings are effective, webinars are <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/lead-gen-content-ideas?_ga=2.212679763.613338208.1620124416-494221050.1620124416\">another great format for capturing leads</a>. While you can promote your webinar's sign-up form by posting them to your business Timeline. Another way to spread the word is by creating a Facebook Event with a separate registration page on your website.</p> \n<p>Once you invite someone to a Facebook Event, you can encourage them to register on a separate page, where they'll become a lead. In terms of reaching new audiences, Facebook Events are also <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2015/11/inside-facebook-events-updates/\">more visible than standard posts</a> on the News Feed.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/IAvevPSkysv6zBEvNFKYg3cBtK3izxMJkCyfp-_XUMFj22kkN8GpXLB-AlhCeRPI7WeDzTQlWH-kqnuDXBJKwCZCbwXJLT7b1wC6CvDQmt95gXgTKpqTP6buN6cMtuCD6UigJy_c\" width=\"602\" height=\"296\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" alt=\"HubSpot Facebook Event\"></p> \n<p>Facebook also <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/news/events\">added new features</a> that help businesses promote their events and see how they’re performing. For example, you can create ads for the desktop and mobile News Feed that boost awareness of events and drive responses.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Iz6tcWXkatGGta8vyBRzdF71Ih90AcCIYabomp2LMEN7TzKMShxDBjCvNkPd6Ga92EVLlTG1VLmXRVjZRMj0Ilx-OyEKz0ifGJTENMG4okhY3GphEoyjWgUaAhNdi7bm62Sahz8C\" width=\"445\" style=\"width: 445px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" alt=\"Facebook event example\"></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 12px;\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/news/events\" style=\"font-style: italic;\">Image Source</a></p> \n<p>If you host events and webinars often, you can also use the Events tab on your Facebook page to share with your followers in a single view. That way, people visiting your page can scroll through your upcoming events and webinars. (If you don’t see the tab on your Page, click \"Manage Tabs\" at the bottom of your tabs and reorder them, so Events is one of the first to appear.) <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33540/18-Ways-to-Guarantee-Nobody-Misses-Your-Next-Webinar.aspx#sm.0000o5c3iom8gdkipdw2l236rj19q\">Read this blog post for more tips on hosting great webinars</a>.</p> \n<h3>11. Run targeted ads to extend your content's reach.</h3> \n<p>One of the best things Facebook can do for your business is to expand your reach to new audiences by running a targeted ad campaign for lead generation.</p> \n<p>Thanks to Facebook's very sophisticated targeting options, you create ads that target people based on their location, age, gender, interests — and even the things they do off Facebook.</p> \n<p>There are three overarching formats for Facebook ads that I'll cover here: boosted posts, right-hand column ads, and News Feed ads.</p> \n<p>The main distinction here is the placement of the ad and the amount of writing and size of images they allow.</p> \n<ol> \n <li><strong>Boosted Post: </strong>This is Facebook's way of letting marketers turn otherwise regular Facebook posts into ads by \"boosting\" them. The post will show organically to some users, but to get better reach, the admin will press \"boost\" (shown only to admins, not to other users) to deliver to a larger number of fans and targets you can select ahead of time.</li> \n <li><strong>Right-Hand Column Ads: </strong>This is the most traditional ad placement used to turn a user into a Facebook lead. The ad usually appears on the right side of a user’s News Feed. We often see less expensive clicks and conversions when using these ads, along with more advanced testing options.</li> \n <li><strong>News Feed Ads: </strong>These appear directly in a user's News Feed and look more like <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/native-advertising-examples?_ga=2.215242576.613338208.1620124416-494221050.1620124416\">native advertising</a>, although you can also add a small CTA button. They're part of a tactic <a href=\"https://www.ducttapemarketing.com/blog/facebook-dark-posts/\">called \"dark posts,\"</a> which means using News Feed-style ads that don't get published to the News Feed of your Page. In our experience, these ads have a higher engagement rate than right-hand column ads (which makes your Page look super healthy), but they can also be more expensive.</li> \n</ol> \n<p>While we won't go too much more in-depth on Facebook advertising (<a href=\"https://offers.hubspot.com/how-to-create-epic-facebook-ads?hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-lead-generation-tips-ht&amp;hubs_post-cta=download%20our%20Facebook%20advertising%20ebook%20if%20you%20want%20to%20learn%20more&amp;_ga=2.215251024.613338208.1620124416-494221050.1620124416\">download our Facebook advertising ebook if you want to learn more</a>), here are two examples of Facebook ads in users' News Feeds.

Run lead ads to simplify the mobile signup process.</h3> \n<p>As if Facebook's addition of CTA buttons to its link ads wasn't exciting enough, it added an entirely new feature called lead ads <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/news/lead-ads-launch\">in 2015</a>, which lets users sign up for lead-generating offers and content without leaving Facebook.</p> \n<p>Facebook created lead ads specifically to simplify the mobile sign-up process by creating instant forms that make it super easy for mobile users to fill out their contact details.</p> \n<p>Why? Because the forms will auto-populate instead of mobile users having to pinch-and-zoom and type into tiny form fields. When you click on a lead ad, a form opens with your contact information automatically populated based on what you've shared with Facebook already, like name and email address.</p> \n<p>Talk about solving for a form of friction.

Sharks have a week dedicated to him. Mosquitoes refuse to bite him purely out of respect.”</p> \n<p>Have you heard of him before? Yes, he’s “The Most Interesting Man in the World”— a fictional character that drinks Dos Equis beer and stars in the company’s <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/anna-guerrero/10-most-compelling-ad-campaigns-of-the-decade-and-what-your-brand-can-learn-from.html\">viral commercials</a>.</p> \n<p>The commercials — which make me laugh every time — are part advertisement, part comedy skit and have a similar theme so fans always know when they’re watching a Dos Equis advertisement.</p> \n<p>The company targets its audience of sophisticated beer drinkers in an engaging, creative, and humorous way through TV, social media, and YouTube. The unique campaign created fans around the world that helped spread it across multiple platforms, so much so that people even dress up as the commercial's main character for <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Most-Interesting-Man-World-Beard/dp/B005XELBJC\">Halloween</a>.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Dos Equis may not have been 100% sure that their campaign would take off the way it did, but they had a good idea about its potential popularity.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Similarly, there is no guaranteed way to ensure your content goes viral, but there are certain steps you can take to give your marketing campaign the best chance at success.</p> \n<p class=\"p1\"><span></span><span class=\"s2\">&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p>Many marketers hope for a campaign to go viral — meaning it's recognized, widely-accepted, and influential. But there's no guaranteed formula. However, if you think about some of your favorite viral marketing campaigns, you'll notice some common features. Marketers wanting to reach a bigger audience should keep these attributes in mind when creating their next campaign:</p> \n<h4>1. It appeals to a target audience.</h4> \n<p>A successful viral marketing campaign considers the target audience. For any campaign to go viral, it needs to resonate with the audience and make them feel so strongly about your content that they decide to share it with their family, friends, and followers.</p> \n<p>Determine who your target audience is in the earliest stages of your campaign creation. To achieve this, ask questions such as: Who do I want to connect with? What content would they feel passionate about? What are their hopes, dreams, and values? Why would they care about my campaign? What will can I do to make them want to share my content with their social network?</p> \n<h4>2. It has a strong visual strategy.</h4> \n<p>Viral marketing campaigns require a visual strategy — this guides potential customers to understand your brand through the use of images.</p> \n<p>A campaign should tell a story and that story is best told using visual elements that resonate with your audience. Your visual strategy needs to be compatible with your brand and target audience — it should be interesting, informative, and contain some element of intrigue, such as humor or hope.</p> \n<h4>3. It's highly creative.</h4> \n<p>Think about your favorite viral marketing campaign. What sets it apart from others?</p> \n<p>Marketing campaigns don’t go viral unless they have a unique, interesting, and innovative idea behind them — your campaign needs to be something new and attention-grabbing.</p> \n<h4>4. It has emotional appeal.&nbsp;</h4> \n<p>Have you seen the <a href=\"https://www.dove.com/us/en/stories/campaigns/real-beauty-sketches.html\">Dove Real Beauty Sketches</a> campaign? It makes you feel frustrated, insecure, strong, and confident in just a few minutes.</p> \n<p>Each commercial shows a person sitting behind a curtain describing their appearance while an artist — who cannot see them — draws their portrait. After the individual is done describing his or her features and the portrait is complete, the curtain is removed. The artist then draws a second portrait of the individual based off what they <em>actually</em> see.</p> \n<p>After the second portrait is finished, the artist places the two drawings next to each other. As you can probably imagine, the portrait derived from the individual’s self-description is less attractive than what the artist draws in the second portrait.</p> \n<p>In fact, in each video throughout the campaign, the portrait that the artist creates is a much brighter and more realistic depiction of the individual. This is a message about self-esteem and the beauty within all of us.</p> \n<p>The campaign went viral because of its relatability and emotional appeal. You need to make your audience feel something — otherwise, why would they want to share your content?</p> \n<h4>5. It's easy to share and promote.</h4> \n<p>Thanks to the internet and social media, sharing and promoting your content with the rest of the world is pretty simple. You don’t need huge sums of money to produce successful photo or video content that can be consumed by the greater population.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>For <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-makes-content-go-viral\">something to actually go viral</a>, it needs to be shared over and over again. This means you and your company need to share the content first in as many places — and in as many ways — as possible.&nbsp;Then, you need to make it easy for your audience to share it as well.</p> \n<p>Enable sharing, embedding, and downloading capabilities on all of your content so your viewers can tag their parents on Facebook, message their best friends on Instagram, or download your video so they can easily turn your content into a memorable GIF. Create calls-to-action or elements that encourage people to send it to their friends.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Think about asking a celebrity to promote your content if an influencer would fit with your overall message and add value to your campaign. For example, viewers may find your insurance commercial more entertaining and share-worthy if Peyton Manning or Brad Paisley are <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/NationwideInsurance/playlists?view=50&amp;shelf_id=20&amp;sort=dd&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI2I7u4b722wIVk8JkCh3DEwgkEAAYASAAEgJVb_D_BwE\">singing</a>.</p> \n<h4>6. It's published at the right time.</h4> \n<p>You should also consider the date and time that you share your content. Marketers use major holidays — such as Christmas — as well as major events, like the presidential race and the Super Bowl, to their advantage.</p> \n<p>More people are scrolling through their social media feeds, watching TV, and keeping up with current events during these times which causes marketers to <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2015/11/13/media/christmas-adverts-billion-dollar-industry/index.html\">spend more money</a> on their campaigns.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Similarly, anyone who uses a platform like Instagram knows what I’m talking about when I say the date and time of your posts matter.</p> \n<p>For example, if you post on a Saturday at 8 p.m., most people are out at dinner, seeing a movie, or just hanging out with friends — meaning they are most likely not browsing their newsfeed ... at least not as much as they do on <a href=\"http://buzzsumo.com/blog/day-post-affect-number-social-shares/#gs.0ET1CLM\">Tuesdays</a>.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>After all of this sharing and promoting, you need to wait and see whether or not people latch onto your content. If so, you could have created a viral campaign. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/why-content-goes-viral\">I</a><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/why-content-goes-viral\">f not, you may have to try again.</a></p> \n<p><em>Read <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/movember-data-viral-campaign\">this</a> blog to learn about the reasons why some older campaigns stand the test of time. </em></p> \n<h2>The Advantages of Viral Marketing Campaigns</h2> \n<p>Creating a viral marketing campaign isn’t an easy or predictable achievement. But if your campaign does go viral, it can mean thousands or even millions of new people being introduced to your brand and buying your products — money in the bank!</p> \n<p>For example, the <a href=\"https://www.dollarshaveclub.com/get-started/plan/daily-essentials?utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_source=goog&amp;utm_campaign=dr&amp;utm_content=acq_br&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI_IXTks2X3AIVhYjICh0SRQMkEAAYASAAEgIEzvD_BwE\">Dollar Shave Club</a>’s campaign <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ZUG9qYTJMsI\">video</a> went viral, which made them a household name. They were then acquired by <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/07/19/unilever-buys-dollar-shave-club-for-1-billion/\">Unilever for $1 billion</a> — not bad.</p> \n<p>Here are a few more advantages of producing viral content:</p> \n<h4>1. They can build your brand.</h4> \n<p>When a marketing campaign goes viral, your audience automatically learns about your company, products, services, and brand. This includes people who may not have ever heard about your company otherwise. This is how some small companies make their “big break” and how large companies stay relevant.</p> \n<h4>2. They don’t require a large budget.</h4> \n<p>Some of the most successful viral content is created on a low budget. These days, individuals and <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/12-small-brands-that-went-viral\">companies of any size</a> can film high-quality video and take professional-looking photos all on an iPhone.</p> \n<p>Many content creators, or people who simply upload a random video, have found themselves become famous almost overnight. It’s not about the resources and budget — it’s all about what catches the attention of the internet. Marketers don’t always need a large-scale production with a celebrity to make their campaign funny, surprising, relatable, or informational.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Fun fact:<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0326091/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm\">Jonathan Goldsmith</a>, the man behind the “Most Interesting Man in the World” commercials, had only done a few gigs prior getting his big break when the campaign went viral.&nbsp;</p> \n<h4>3. They get your brand in front of a new (and larger) audience.</h4> \n<p>Campaigns are considered “viral” when they have a large reach. Companies may experience an increase in sales, greater engagement on social media, and a boost in conversation about their brand and products.</p> \n<p>This is exactly what happened for Smart Water when they brought Jennifer Aniston on board for their <a href=\"https://www.adweek.com/digital/this-week-in-viral-videos-march-11-2011/\">campaign</a> in 2012. The video has over<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phpb_ssnyug\"> 6 million views</a> on YouTube, and their humorous campaigns have done so well with the public that Aniston was featured in them through 2017.</p> \n<div class=\"video-container-responsive\">\n <iframe src=\"https://youtu.be/ByFxn98wkVQ\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div> \n<h2>3 of the Most Famous Viral Campaigns</h2> \n<p>Now that we have reviewed the features of successful viral campaigns and how to launch one yourself, let’s dive into some of the most popular viral campaigns ever created.</p> \n<h4><a href=\"https://www.dandad.org/en/d-ad-old-spice-case-study-insights/\">Old Spice: “The Man Your Man Could Smell Like”</a></h4> \n<p>Old Spice found that women are the ones to purchase men’s personal hygiene products, so they created an ad that spoke directly to this audience.</p> \n<p>The “Old Spice Man” talks directly to the audience in a bold, confident, and humorous way.

For the challenge, you had to pour ice cold water over your entire body and then nominate a friend to do the same. This became a movement that raised $115 million in the summer of 2014 alone. Because ... who doesn’t want to watch a family member or friend pour freezing cold water on their head?</p> \n<p>Celebrities from around the world started participating, challenging their famous friends, donating, and raising awareness. There was an Ice Bucket Challenge hashtag that gained popularity allowing for the videos to spread easily over multiple social media channels.</p> \n<p>Most importantly — the challenge is fun and makes participants feel like a part of a bigger movement, which is why it remains relevant years later.</p> \n<h4><a href=\"https://always.com/en-us/about-us/our-epic-battle-like-a-girl\">Always “#LikeAGirl”</a></h4> \n<p>This video became a major hit because it directly addressed how phrases that are so commonly used can be detrimental to someone's self image and confidence. In the video, various men, women, and young boys are asked to \"run like a girl\" or \"fight like a girl\". Then young girls are asked to do the same, with a very different approach: They show strength and confidence in their movements.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>It made viewers recognize how quickly we use female-oriented phrases as insults, and that doing something #LikeAGirl should be seen as inspiring and brave.&nbsp;</p> \n<div class=\"video-container-responsive\">\n <iframe src=\"https://youtu.be/XjJQBjWYDTs\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div> \n<p>The original TV commercial that came out in 2014 has over 65-million views on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjJQBjWYDTs\">Youtube</a>, and the hashtag — #LikeAGirl — remains popular today.</p> \n<p><em>For more great examples of viral video marketing campaigns, check out <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/viral-video-marketing\">this</a> blog. </em></p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>There is no roadmap for making your content “go viral.” You can review what has been successful in the past and try to emulate this, but ultimately, it’s about creating great content that connects with your audience and <em>makes</em> them want to share it.

Don’t worry — that used to be gobbledygook to me, too.</p> \n<p>Twitter has become a social network with its own unique language — and rightfully so. After all, when you only have 280 characters to say what you mean, every word counts.</p> \n<p>And don’t just take our word for it. For the best engagement results, Twitter recommends keeping tweets short and conversational, too.</p> \n<p>This, my friends, is why marketers need to be well-versed in the language of Twitter.</p> \n<p>When I found myself heading for Google every time I checked out my Twitter feed, I knew it was time to start writing some definitions down so I could learn the language myself, so that's exactly what I did.

As you find a few to sprinkle into your next batch of scheduled Tweets for your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/25084/the-ultimate-cheat-sheet-for-expert-twitter-marketing.aspx?_ga=2.269116081.190325510.1619835205-414304604.1619835205\">Twitter marketing campaign</a>, try to avoid the temptation to use them all at once — a little goes a long way.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h3>@mention</h3> \n<p>When you want to “tag” someone in a tweet or direct message on Twitter, you can do so by mentioning them using their Twitter username. Add this mention in and they’ll get a notification that you’ve done so in the “Mentions” section of their account. Essentially, this is used to have conversations with people on Twitter.</p> \n<h3>#</h3> \n<p>While known as the pound key on your phone, on Twitter, this symbol is a hashtag, and it’s used in front of other words in a tweet to provide context or to make it easy for users to search for specific topics on Twitter. But be careful not to over-hashtag your tweets — <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketers-guide-proper-social-media-etiquette\">one or two is probably enough</a>.</p> \n<h3>Bots</h3> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2013/08/07/the-type-of-people-most-likely-to-get-suckered-by-a-twitter-bot/\">Forbes</a> defines bots as “a social networking account powered by artificial intelligence.” Bots are different from trolls because they aren’t people — they’re scripts written by people, waiting to pounce. But every once in a while, you’ll <a href=\"http://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/the-10-best-twitter-bots-you-arent-following/\">stumble across bots</a> that are created to do some pretty cool stuff.</p> \n<h3>DM</h3> \n<p>A \"DM,\" or \"direct message,\" is a private message between two Twitter users. It’s different from a public @mention because, in order to send a DM, the recipient must follow you.</p> \n<h3>Feed</h3> \n<p>Your Twitter “feed” (HubSpot customers <a href=\"https://app.hubspot.com/l/monitoring?hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com/marketing/34-twitter-terms-defined-list&amp;hubs_post-cta=know%20it%20as%20their%20%E2%80%9CTimeline%E2%80%9D\">know it as their “Timeline”</a>) is any list of tweets that constantly updates when new tweets that fit the specified criteria pop up. Your home feed updates every time someone you follow tweets.</p> \n<h3>FF or #FF</h3> \n<p>#FollowFriday started as a way to recommend other Twitter users to your followers. It happens on Fridays, and you can search Twitter for the hashtag on Fridays to watch the kudos pour in.</p> \n<h3>Follower</h3> \n<p>A “follower” is someone who follows you on Twitter and sees your updates on their home feed. Just because someone follows you doesn't mean you have to follow them back, the way some other social networks work. But if you want to find some insightful marketers to follow, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/insightful-marketing-insiders-follow-twitter-list\">here’s a helpful list</a> to get you going.</p> \n<h3>Period before @mention</h3> \n<p>This is the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/one-mistake-everybody-makes-on-twitter-ht\">one mistake almost everyone makes on Twitter</a>. If you tweet @username without a period, only your mutual followers (in other words, people who follow both you and @username) and the person your tweeting to</p> \n<p>will see it in their streams. Add a period before @username, though, and all of your followers will see your tweet in their streams.</p> \n<h3>PRT</h3> \n<p>A \"partial retweet\" is similar to a modified tweet, but it lets the reader know you’ve taken out some of the original ideas of the tweet, either to save space or to add your own two cents.</p> \n<h3>Reply</h3> \n<p>When you reply on Twitter, you’re responding to a particular tweet someone has tagged you in with a @mention. Unless it’s a direct message (DM), a reply can be seen by anyone and everyone, regardless of whether they follow you or not.</p> \n<h3>RT</h3> \n<p>A retweet is the basic form of currency on Twitter. When you see “RT” in front of a tweet, it means the person found the content valuable enough to share with their followers. If the original tweet is yours, way to go!</p> \n<h3>Trolls</h3> \n<p>Beware! Trolls are people on Twitter who abuse the service by spamming users with off-topic tweets and other erratic behavior. Trolling is a form of internet harassment, so if you think someone is trolling you on Twitter, you can <a href=\"http://www.hashtags.org/platforms/twitter/twitter-trolls-begone-reporting-violations-and-abuse/\">learn how to take action here</a>.</p> \n<h3>Tweeps</h3> \n<p>Tweeps are Twitter folks that follow each other from one social network to another. It's not uncommon for the people you're friends with on Facebook to also follow you on Twitter — they would be your Tweep. It's a Twitter-ized version of \"peeps.\"</p> \n<h3>Tweet</h3> \n<p>Arguably the most common Twitter term. Every update you post to your followers on Twitter is called a tweet. Every tweet has a 140-character limit, and remember: Your tweets are public and searchable by anyone on Twitter, even if they don’t follow you. Heck, <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ceo-guide-to-twitter-listening\">even CEOs may be listening to your tweets</a>.</p> \n<h3>Trends or Trending Topic</h3> \n<p>Any person, place, thing, or idea that a lot of people are tweeting about at once is considered a trend. You can find trends on the left side of your Twitter homepage, and you can even tailor what trends you see based on your location and who you follow.</p> \n<p>Tip: Are you a local business? Connecting with users who are in your same geographic location is a great way to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/get-more-twitter-business-value\">get more business value out of Twitter</a>.</p> \n<h3>Tweeple, Twerson, and Twitterverse</h3> \n<p>Literally, the people (or person, in the singular) that make up the vast Twitterverse (universe!) of Twitter users.</p> \n<h3>Unfollow</h3> \n<p>Just like someone can unfriend you on Facebook, people can choose to unfollow you on Twitter so your tweets stop showing up in their feed. Be careful about aggressively following or unfollowing users, though — it's a great way to <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33589/40-Ways-to-Get-Banned-From-the-Top-5-Social-Networks.aspx\">get yourself banned from Twitter</a>.</p> \n<h3>Via</h3> \n<p>This term is sometimes used in place of “RT” as a way to let people know where your content is from and to give credit to the original content creator.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Twitter terms are helpful for anyone who’s new to the platform or building a profile for their business. Twitter slang, however, is helpful to be aware of so that you can connect with your audience better. By knowing some common slang terms used in tweets, you can join the conversation with your followers without sounding out of place.</p> \n<h3>atm</h3> \n<p>Giving status updates is a common reason for many of the tweets we see on our timelines. As a result, you may have seen the acronym “atm” used in the context of something other than money. This stands for “at the moment” and shouldn’t be confused with an automated teller machine.</p> \n<h3>atp</h3> \n<p>Some Twitter users enjoy telling stories on their timelines and a transitional phrase used in those narratives is “at this point”. Of course, with just a limited number of characters per Tweet, users abbreviate words anywhere they can, so “atp” might take the place of that phrase.</p> \n<h3>BFN</h3> \n<p>If you're having a Twitter conversation, one polite way to sign off is to say this, which stands for “bye for now.” It lets the other person know you're signing off and that any further tweets may go unanswered for a period of time.</p> \n<h3>BR</h3> \n<p>Just like in email, there’s something to be said for <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketers-guide-proper-social-media-etiquette\">social media etiquette</a>, and “best regards” is another nice, commonly used sign-off when leaving a conversation on Twitter.</p> \n<h3>Canceled</h3> \n<p>Cancel culture has been around for nearly half a decade and it’s very popular on Twitter. It’s usually reserved for high-profile members of society like celebrities, politicians, and influencers. If these individuals behave in a way that disturbs expectations (whether reasonable or unreasonable) they can be canceled by “cancel culture twitter.” There are varying opinions about <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/12/30/20879720/what-is-cancel-culture-explained-history-debate\">cancel culture</a>.</p> \n<h3>Crank Tweet</h3> \n<p>Remember when you used to make prank phone calls? (C’mon, don’t be shy — everyone's done so at one point or another.) Well, crank tweets are the new prank calls, except in written form. They’re misleading tweets, tweeted on purpose.</p> \n<h3>EM</h3> \n<p>This one's simple enough: It's short for “email me.”</p> \n<h3>FTW</h3> \n<p>When someone comes in to save the day on Twitter, they might get praised with tweets that mention them directly followed by “FTW!” This stands for “for the win” and is derived from sports games where the commentator announces the name of a player who scored the game-winning point.</p> \n<h3>Fub free</h3> \n<p>Fub free means “follow, unfollow, block” free. Some Twitter users add this phrase in their Twitter bio to let followers know that they won’t be upset or retaliate if a follower unfollows or blocks their account. This is commonly used for Twitter accounts that tend to post spoilers to movies or temporarily post content their followers may otherwise not want to see. These followers might block or unfollow the account for a period of time and return later when the undesirable content has ceased.</p> \n<h3>HAND</h3> \n<p>You should smile if you see this tweeted at you. Why? Because someone on Twitter is telling you to \"have a nice day!\"</p> \n<h3>HT</h3> \n<p>A “hat tip” is usually followed by someone’s Twitter username. Using HT means you aren’t quoting or retweeting them directly, but instead acknowledging that the user gave you the idea for the content you’re tweeting.</p> \n<h3>ICYMI</h3> \n<p>This acronym for “in case you missed it” can be used when someone is tweeting about big news or a trending topic a few days after the fact, or they’ve already tweeted about it. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ICYMI&amp;f=realtime\">Searching “ICYMI” on Twitter</a> is a great way to catch up on what you’ve missed if you’ve been off the Twitter radar for a few days.</p> \n<h3>IDK</h3> \n<p>When 280 characters is your limit, shortening words is a must. Thus, typing “I don’t know” is sometimes too long to include in a tweet, believe it or not.</p> \n<h3>IFYKYK</h3> \n<p>“If you know, you know” is a term used by people who want to maintain some exclusivity to their Tweet. An underground artist, a hole-in-the-wall restaurant, or even another acronym may all be adorned with a tweet that reads “IFYKYK”. And if you didn’t know, well now you know.</p> \n<h3>IJS</h3> \n<p>“I’m just saying” might seem redundant, but the acronym gives some tone and context to a tweet. Perhaps the user wants to introduce a difference of opinion to the conversation, or maybe they don’t want to be held responsible for the consequences of what they just said. Regardless, you might see “ijs” pop up on your timeline every once in a while from an opinionated Twitter user.</p> \n<h3>IMO or IMHO</h3> \n<p>You’ll usually see “in my opinion” or “in my humble opinion” when someone wants to agree or disagree with a piece of content they’re sharing. That way, the reader knows it's opinion, not fact.</p> \n<h3>MT</h3> \n<p>This means “modified tweet,” which is a retweet that you had to clip to save space. However, it should still hold the meaning of the original tweet.</p> \n<h3>NTS</h3> \n<p>“Note to self” is a good way to mark tweets that you want to go back to later. It’s also used when someone is trying to be sarcastic or funny. For instance, I might tweet: \"NTS: Pizza is way better cold — especially when it's for breakfast.\" (Which we all know is true, of course.)</p> \n<h3>OOMF</h3> \n<p>If you don’t want to mention one of your followers directly, but you want to say something about them, you might use the acronym OOMF which means “One of my followers.” This term can be used in a neutral way or in a passive-aggressive tone if you’re subtweeting your follower.</p> \n<h3>SMH</h3> \n<p>“Shaking my head” usually accompanies a tweet when someone can’t believe or doesn’t understand the content they’re sharing. It’s a total mimic of real-life body language.</p> \n<h3>Stan</h3> \n<p>If you’re familiar with fans of celebrities, you’ll catch on quickly to Twitter stans. These are overzealous and slightly obsessed fans of celebrities or influencers. The term is a combination of “stalker” and “fan.” There are mixed opinions about whether <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/10/07/767903704/the-2010s-social-media-and-the-birth-of-stan-culture\">stan culture is healthy</a> for the stan or the celebrity.</p> \n<h3>Subtweet</h3> \n<p>Occasionally, people Tweet about other Twitter users without mentioning them using the @ symbol. This can be done passive-aggressively or even in a <a href=\"https://thoughtcatalog.com/cehudspeth/2013/06/6-passive-aggressive-ways-to-subtly-get-your-crushs-attention/\">flirtatious manner</a>. There are two types of subtweets: overt and covert. An overt subtweet may still mention the person by name but without mentioning their Twitter with the @ symbol so that it is tied directly to them. A covert subtweet won’t mention names at all, but will instead give subtle hints about who the subject of the tweet might be.</p> \n<h3>TBH or TBQH</h3> \n<p>This is shorthand for “to be honest.” You may see a “Q” pop in there, for “to be quite honest.” (Fancy, we know.)</p> \n<h3>TFTF</h3> \n<p>You always want to say thank you, so “thanks for the follow” is a nice way to recognize that someone has decided to add you to their Twitter feed.</p> \n<h3>TMB</h3> \n<p>If you see “tweet me back” when someone mentions you on Twitter, they want you to literally tweet them back with an answer to or your opinion of their tweet.</p> \n<h3>Twitterati</h3> \n<p>The “Twitterati” is a group of A-list Twitter users that have a big number of followers and are famous in Twitter circles (and sometimes outside too).</p> \n<h2>Should your business use Twitter slang?</h2> \n<p>Twitter slang isn’t a good fit for every tweet, but just about every business can benefit from shortening a word or phrase to meet the character limit. Before you rule out Twitter terms and slang altogether, take a look at this list to see how you can make your statement short and sweet. After all, people want to hear from people, not brands, so speak like your followers do and start a genuine conversation on Twitter ASAP.</p> \n<p><em>Editor's note: This post was originally published
