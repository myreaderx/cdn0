There’s just one nefarious twist: the only people who gained these powers were likely to be sociopaths. So, in essence, what if, 40 years ago, supervillains were created but without an opposing force of good to stop them? How would these cruel villains run rampant over the societies of the world? What nasty plans would they have for the rest of us, who would be hopeless to fight back? What dystopic horrors would be enacted upon us all?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are among the very reasonable questions raised and promptly, bafflingly ignored by the new Netflix action comedy </span><strong><i>Thunder Force</i></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, whose very basic premise is a lot more interesting than its filmmakers are willing to explore. Aside from that setup, the real premise is “What if Melissa McCarthy got superpowers?” That must have been the elevator pitch for McCarthy and her husband/frequent collaborator, Ben Falcone (who wrote and directed </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thunder Force</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">). That setup is all well and good, but this whole film feels like an elevator pitch: tossed off without any detailed thought. It’s true that this is, compared to Falcone’s other directorial efforts, pretty much the cream of the crop. But that doesn’t make </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thunder Force</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> any good.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"more-666033\"></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">McCarthy plays Lydia, who we first meet as a child, befriending and defending her incredibly smart classmate Emily from a pack of bullies. Though the two become best buds, their inherent differences – Lydia is goodhearted but not very smart, and Emily is a whiz-kid-in-training – separate them over time. In the present, Lydia is a blue-collar worker and Emily (Octavia Spencer) is a pioneering scientist who has made a breakthrough: she’s figured out a formula to imbue a regular human with superpowers. Emily, driven by the loss of her parents at the hands of a villain back in the 1980s, wants to balance the scales and bring justice back. But after a mishap (thanks to Lydia touching expensive machinery she says aloud that she shouldn’t touch), Emily’s formula is tested by her estranged friend, who gains super-strength, while the scientist gains the power of invisibility.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A large chunk of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thunder Force</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is dedicated to Lydia and Emily testing out their new powers as they also mend their friendship, but there’s surprisingly little afforded to the threat of the bad guys, known as Miscreants. Once we learn about the Miscreants themselves&#8230;well, there’s surprisingly little to learn. Miscreants appear to be localized to Chicago, there appear to be just three of them, and one (Jason Bateman) only became a Miscreant after an inadvertent run-in with a radioactive crab gave him massive crab pincers in place of his arms and hands. (Because&#8230;sure.) The notion that only sociopaths would be given superpowers is dark and complex, and something this movie has no interest in exploring once it’s brought up in a very brief opening styled like a comic book, a visual flourish that isn’t revived until the end credits. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">McCarthy and Spencer have a decent enough chemistry, even though they’re both such fiercely intelligent performers that the basic shtick of a schlub and a nerd paired together seems radically below their talents. (Lydia’s constant negging of Emily is especially lazy, no more so than in an extended bit where Lydia is confused that no one seems to know who Steve Urkel. This inspires her to do an impression of the character, which manages to be as unfunny as Steve Urkel himself was.) Bateman at least has more fun (unlike when he co-starred with McCarthy in the execrable </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Identity Thief</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">). As ridiculous as it is that his character has crab pincers for arms (even in a world with supervillains, everyone is unfazed by this), Bateman’s probably the best part of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thunder Force</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The other baddies, played by Bobby Cannavale and Pom Klementieff, are mostly just standard-issue villains whose powers are vastly more generic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At one point in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thunder Force</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, there’s a shot of a police truck reading “Chicago Police Miscreant Task Force.” That would seem logical enough, right? If there are supervillains roaming the streets of a major metropolitan city, the police would have to fight against that threat. What would it be like to fight supervillainy when you’re not superpowered yourself? How would Chicago – or any city, really – stand up to the onslaught for 40 years? Do the cops have special technology to fend off these attackers? The questions could go on and on, but </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thunder Force</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> isn’t remotely interested in the details of a comic-book world (in spite of a special thank-you in the end credits to Falcone’s family for encouraging his “comic-book addiction”).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the fifth film Ben Falcone has directed and written or co-written starring his wife. Compared to films like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tammy</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Superintelligence</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thunder Force</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a cut above, if only because its comic focus is clear, even as its world-building is a stumble from the start. (And unlike </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Superintelligence</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, also co-starring Cannavale, this movie doesn’t serve as a weird feature-length ad for a talk-show host.) But </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thunder Force</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has too good of a core idea to be left so unexplored. Melissa McCarty can’t be stopped, but she continues to be content making films that leave her talent frustratingly untapped. </span></p>\n<p><strong>/Film Rating: 4 out of 10</strong></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/thunder-force-review/\">&#8216;Thunder Force&#8217; Review: Yes, Melissa McCarthy and Ben Falcone Made Another Bad Movie</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=D2SInL75mRk:3QJ9Iv4varQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=D2SInL75mRk:3QJ9Iv4varQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=D2SInL75mRk:3QJ9Iv4varQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=D2SInL75mRk:3QJ9Iv4varQ:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=D2SInL75mRk:3QJ9Iv4varQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=D2SInL75mRk:3QJ9Iv4varQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/D2SInL75mRk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Apr 2021 15:00:19 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Thunder-Force-Review-700x300.jpeg","linkMd5":"10a1f97a2890891f2fd3f66ff648650f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn21@2020_6/2021/04/09/16-41-24-298_901906a485f379a2.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":41131,"destBytes":26234,"author":"Josh Spiegel","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Thunder-Force-Review-700x300.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn21@2020_6/2021/04/09/16-41-24-298_901906a485f379a2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn15@2020_3/2021/04/09/16-42-22-291_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=D2SInL75mRk:3QJ9Iv4varQ:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn43@2020_6/2021/04/09/16-42-22-421_db3d9fd3e25735b3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn55@2020_5/2021/04/09/16-42-22-746_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=D2SInL75mRk:3QJ9Iv4varQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn100@2020_5/2021/04/09/16-42-22-218_553f0a054d3ce8a4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/D2SInL75mRk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn99@2020_6/2021/04/09/16-42-22-708_76745c0058d09d5e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617986483819},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:23","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:23","title":"The Future of Disney Parks Includes Disney+ Synergy, Metaverse Integration, and…Real Working Lightsabers?","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=666050","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-666064 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/disneyland-mickeymouse-welcome-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Disney Theme Parks Future\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/disneyland-mickeymouse-welcome.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/disneyland-mickeymouse-welcome-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Disney Parks recently unveiled their hopeful plans for a <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/disneyland-proposes-immersive-theme-park-expansion-may-include-black-panther-frozen-and-avatar-lands/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">massive expansion of Disneyland</a> in Anaheim, California that would allow them to integrate attractions, restaurants, hotels, and more in a single area of the park. But that&#8217;s not all Disney Parks has in store for the future of their theme park experiences.</p>\n<p>In a recent interview, Disney Parks Chairman <strong>Josh D&#8217;Amaro</strong> talked about the company&#8217;s vision for the future of their theme parks across the world. It should come as no surprise that Disney+ properties will begin to have a prominent presence in the parks, but the biggest plans that Disney has for theme parks come in the form of technology that will change experiences all the time. Oh, and Disney will reportedly be revealing real working lightsabers in the near future too.<span id=\"more-666050\"></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/08/media/disney-parks-future-interview/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CNN Business</a> spoke with Josh D&#8217;Amaro about the future of Disney Parks in honor of Disney World celebrating its 50th anniversary this year. He said, &#8220;It&#8217;s going to be fresh, it&#8217;s going to be technology-ridden. It&#8217;s going to be incredibly relevant to guests all around the world.&#8221; Yes, this Josh D&#8217;Amaro certainly sounds like a real person and not a theme park advertising robot.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-587727 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/disney-technical-difficulties-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"disney+ technical difficulties\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/disney-technical-difficulties-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/disney-technical-difficulties-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/disney-technical-difficulties-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/disney-technical-difficulties.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>Integration of Disney+</h2>\n<p>We&#8217;ll get to the expanding technology part in a moment, but first, fans can expect to see the incorporation of Disney+ intellectual property as years go on. D&#8217;Amaro said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Disney+ has been phenomenally successful at the Disney company. We have the benefit of having these unbelievably powerful assets in the ground and the combination of a company that&#8217;s got such a strong and growing digital footprint, with the physical footprint, I think gives us opportunity to fuse those two things together like no other company can.</p>\n<p>I think that as the Disney company continues to see such huge success with Disney+, and as you see new intellectual properties start to materialize -— whether that be in the world of Marvel or the Imagineers creating something incredibly new and interesting — that is the Disney difference. We will bring those things together to take to the world in a different way.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>He didn&#8217;t get specific about how Disney+ movies and TV shows could be integrated into the park, but it&#8217;s probably a safe bet that they&#8217;ll figure out a way to make <strong><em>The Mandalorian</em></strong> – and probably the rest of the upcoming <em><strong>Star Wars</strong></em> shows on the streaming service – part of the experience in Star Wars: Galaxy&#8217;s Edge. Plus, there&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/avengers-campus-opening/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Avengers Campus opening in June</a>, an area of the park that D&#8217;Amaro says &#8220;will never be done.&#8221; That means they will always figure out new ways of updating it, and that includes fresh technology that changes the experience in the physical park.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-607421 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/avengerscampus-webbuilding-night-700x316.jpg\" alt=\"Avengers Campus Details\" width=\"700\" height=\"316\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/avengerscampus-webbuilding-night-700x316.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/avengerscampus-webbuilding-night-360x162.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/avengerscampus-webbuilding-night-768x346.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/avengerscampus-webbuilding-night.jpg 1320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>Upgraded Technology to Create a Metaverse</h2>\n<p>During the interview, D&#8217;Amaro also referenced the idea of a &#8220;metaverse&#8221; being created within Disney theme parks. What that means is that there will be a whole digital experience on top of the physical park structures and attractions. D&#8217;Amaro elaborated:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;It provides us with unending opportunities at these theme parks. It can bring Main Street alive in ways that you&#8217;ve never seen it before, never thought about it before. You can have the whole theme park participate in a game that culminates in a celebration at the hub at the top of Main Street. The possibilities are endless and I think that&#8217;s where we&#8217;re incredibly unique at the Disney company. This combination of a very forward-looking digital footprint with our legacy assets that we have in place, and making them incredibly relevant today.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>This sounds like an idea that&#8217;s still early in development and execution, though there are aspects of this kind of technology that have already appeared in Star Wars: Galaxy&#8217;s Edge and will start to manifest themselves even more in Avengers Campus. Through the Disney Parks app on your phone, there will be virtual games and puzzles that allow you to interact with the physical park in unique ways. Currently in Galaxy&#8217;s Edge you can use your phone to access the Star Wars Datapad to hack into various pieces of tech, translate alien languages, or play minigames that give you digital rewards. But Disney Parks hopes to expand that with more exciting and immersive technological advances in the coming years.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-346445 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/path-of-a-lightsaber-700x300.png\" alt=\"path of a lightsaber\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/path-of-a-lightsaber.png 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/path-of-a-lightsaber-360x154.png 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>A Real Working Lightsaber?</h2>\n<p>Ever since the lightsaber was introduced in <em>Star Wars</em> back in 1977, fans have wanted to see the elegant weapon for a civilized age become a reality in the modern world. Unfortunately, science doesn&#8217;t exactly allow for a lightsaber to exist in the way that it does in the <em>Star Wars</em> universe. But Disney has apparently figured out a way to make one for park-goers that appears much like the real thing as possible without being a deadly weapon.</p>\n<p>You may remember that back in 2018, <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/disney-lightsaber-patent/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Disney filed a patent</a> for a &#8220;Sword Device with Retractable, Internally Illuminated Blade.&#8221; It wasn&#8217;t referred to as a lightsaber, but we know a lightsaber when we see it. This build of a lightsaber replica finally allowed for a blade of light to completely expand and retract from the hilt without a hunk of plastic sticking out of it all the time. The new device was described thusly:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The new technology exemplified in this patent application is used to build a lightsaber hilt that works like a motorized tape measure. At the press of a button, the tapes will extend to a total length several times that of the hilt itself. The tapes will also have some kind of LED lighting inside, such that the lightsaber can light up similar to the way they appear in the films.</p>\n<p>The same mechanics that operate to eject the blade will be used in reverse to retract the blade. The LEDs will be affixed to a tape that retracts onto a spool as the lightsaber blade retracts.</p></blockquote>\n<p>At a &#8220;Special Look Inside Disney Parks&#8221; press conference (via <a href=\"https://collider.com/disney-star-wars-working-lightsaber/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Collider</a>), D&#8217;Amaro was said to have pulled out the new lightsaber in question and simply said, &#8220;It&#8217;s real.&#8221; Though he didn&#8217;t show off the technology, it&#8217;s expected that it will be revealed as part of the upcoming Star Wars hotel at Walt Disney World in Florida. Inside the resort, there&#8217;s supposed to be an area where young Jedis can begin their training in their hotel rooms, which will likely include this lightsaber. Will it be made for sale to fans, or only made as part of the Star Wars hotel experience? That remains to be seen.</p>\n<p>Disney clearly has big plans for the future of their theme parks, and it will be interesting to see how technology will come into play. There&#8217;s a part of me that doesn&#8217;t like the integration of digital devices at theme parks since we spend so much time on our phones and tablets out in the real world. It would be nice to have a park experience that stands on its own and allows for an escape from all that nonsense. Of course, it will still be possible to enjoy the park in the old fashioned analog way, but as time goes on, technology integration will likely become a cornerstone of the theme park experience, so we better get used to it.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/disney-theme-parks-future-plans/\">The Future of Disney Parks Includes Disney+ Synergy, Metaverse Integration, and&#8230;Real Working Lightsabers?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=SkH-VQzjqlU:-a78luxGJMk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=SkH-VQzjqlU:-a78luxGJMk:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=SkH-VQzjqlU:-a78luxGJMk:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=SkH-VQzjqlU:-a78luxGJMk:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=SkH-VQzjqlU:-a78luxGJMk:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=SkH-VQzjqlU:-a78luxGJMk:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/SkH-VQzjqlU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Apr 2021 16:00:22 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/disneyland-mickeymouse-welcome-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"fcf595d8faf569366bf73a7d929d74bf","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn68@2020_5/2021/04/09/16-41-44-634_a8130aed2c7e0517.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":45800,"destBytes":32514,"author":"Ethan Anderton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/disneyland-mickeymouse-welcome-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn68@2020_5/2021/04/09/16-41-44-634_a8130aed2c7e0517.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/disney-technical-difficulties-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn31@2020_2/2021/04/09/16-42-22-724_5b0befaa70b49476.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/avengerscampus-webbuilding-night-700x316.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn87@2020_4/2021/04/09/16-42-22-767_76657201d4a5efaf.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/path-of-a-lightsaber-700x300.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn83@2020_6/2021/04/09/16-42-23-050_38ec3e43464f53d0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn15@2020_3/2021/04/09/16-42-22-291_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=SkH-VQzjqlU:-a78luxGJMk:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn3@2020_5/2021/04/09/16-42-22-699_09e5a364c5040706.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn55@2020_5/2021/04/09/16-42-22-746_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=SkH-VQzjqlU:-a78luxGJMk:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn86@2020_3/2021/04/09/16-42-22-059_97b4b26700864ec4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/SkH-VQzjqlU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn55@2020_1/2021/04/09/16-42-22-664_636623d0862d9afe.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617986483826},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:23","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:23","title":"‘Black Adam’ Cast Adds Bodhi Sabongui in “Key Role”","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=665999","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/black-adam-cast-Bodhi-Sabongui.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-666003\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/black-adam-cast-Bodhi-Sabongui-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"black adam cast Bodhi Sabongui\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/black-adam-cast-Bodhi-Sabongui-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/black-adam-cast-Bodhi-Sabongui-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/black-adam-cast-Bodhi-Sabongui-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/black-adam-cast-Bodhi-Sabongui.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Black Adam</em></strong> cast continues to grow.

It&#8217;s just something that will remain a mystery for the time being. Sabongui joins a cast lead by <strong>Dwayne Johnson</strong>, who stars as the DC anti-hero for director <strong>Jaume Collet-Serra</strong>.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-665999\"></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/black-adam-13-year-old-bodhi-sabongui-nabs-key-role-in-new-lines-dc-movie-exclusive\">THR</a> broke the news that young actor Bodhi Sabongui is joining the <em>Black Adam</em> cast in a key, but mysterious, role. The cast so far features Dwayne Johnson as Black Adam, a member of an ancient civilization chosen by the Council of Wizards – who also helped out Billy Batson in <em>Shazam!</em> – to become a hero and save his people. But Black Adam&#8217;s methods were considered to be too cruel and villainous, and the council went ahead and imprisoned him for 5000 years. When Black Adam finally escapes from his prison, a team of superheroes known as the Justice Society comes together to stop him. That team consists of <strong>Aldis Hodge</strong> as Hawkman, <strong>Noah Centineo</strong> as Atom Smasher, <strong>Quintessa Swindell</strong> as Cyclone, and <strong>Pierce Brosnan </strong>as Doctor Fate. <strong>Marwan Kenzari</strong> is also part of the cast, playing the movie&#8217;s villain, and <strong>James Cusati-Moye</strong> is in the film as well.</p>\n<p><em>Black Adam</em> is traditionally a <em>Shazam</em> villain, and Johnson has been attached to play the role for several years now. At one point, the plan was to make Black Adam the bad guy in the <em>Shazam!</em> movie. But plans changed, and it was decided that Black Adam would get his own standalone film before eventually meeting up with Shazam in a future <em>Shazam!</em> sequel.</p>\n<p>Jaume Collet-Serra, the director of <em>Orphan</em>, <em>The Shallows</em>, and more, is helming <em>Black Adam</em>. He previously directed Johnson in the upcoming Disney movie <em>Jungle Cruise</em>. <strong>Rory Haines</strong>, <strong>Sohrab Noshirvani</strong>, and <strong>Adam Sztykiel</strong> all worked on the screenplay. <em>Shazam!</em> was a fun film, and I&#8217;m a big fan of the art-rash (this is a compliment, I swear) Collet-Serra, so I&#8217;m interested in seeing how <em>Black Adam</em> pans out. Lawrence Sher, who is the cinematographer on the film, previously <a href=\"https://geekvibesnation.com/black-adam-cinematographer-says-dwayne-johnson-and-jaume-collet-serra-are-aiming-high/\">said</a> of the project: &#8220;I know with Jaume and myself and with Dwayne, we do want to reinvent something. But when you try to reinvent something and try to push it to the next level, it takes a bit of brainwork to get there. You have to think, ‘How do you crack the code of what’s going to be next?’ I’m still in the code-cracking mode on this one. But I have a little time. I want it to be something singular and feel wholly original within the genre.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>Black Adam</em> is set to open <strong>July 29, 2022</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/black-adam-cast-bodhi-sabongui/\">&#8216;Black Adam&#8217; Cast Adds Bodhi Sabongui in &#8220;Key Role&#8221;</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=2EQ8B0lP_PA:FPu2nbM0HwQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=2EQ8B0lP_PA:FPu2nbM0HwQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=2EQ8B0lP_PA:FPu2nbM0HwQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=2EQ8B0lP_PA:FPu2nbM0HwQ:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=2EQ8B0lP_PA:FPu2nbM0HwQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=2EQ8B0lP_PA:FPu2nbM0HwQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/2EQ8B0lP_PA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 08 Apr 2021 22:30:48 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/black-adam-cast-Bodhi-Sabongui-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"659c6dad1a010cb2044e3797cd844179","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn15@2020_1/2021/04/09/16-41-24-185_b918d581054b3a25.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":25053,"destBytes":15522,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/black-adam-cast-Bodhi-Sabongui-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn15@2020_1/2021/04/09/16-41-24-185_b918d581054b3a25.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn15@2020_3/2021/04/09/16-42-22-291_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=2EQ8B0lP_PA:FPu2nbM0HwQ:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn68@2020_6/2021/04/09/16-42-22-502_830c32f2a25d96ad.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn55@2020_5/2021/04/09/16-42-22-746_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=2EQ8B0lP_PA:FPu2nbM0HwQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn64@2020_4/2021/04/09/16-42-22-147_6c2bc67c279d50cf.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/2EQ8B0lP_PA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn33@2020_4/2021/04/09/16-42-22-231_c2d6b3f13691979d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617986483824},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:23","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:23","title":"‘The Woman in the Window’ Trailer: Nosy Neighbor Amy Adams Witnesses a Murder…or Does She?","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=665944","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-woman-in-the-window-trailer-netflix.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-665962\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-woman-in-the-window-trailer-netflix-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"the woman in the window trailer netflix\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-woman-in-the-window-trailer-netflix-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-woman-in-the-window-trailer-netflix-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-woman-in-the-window-trailer-netflix-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-woman-in-the-window-trailer-netflix.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>We&#8217;re finally going to get to see <strong><em>The Woman in the Window</em></strong>, the <strong>Joe Wright</strong>/<strong>Amy Adams</strong> film that was once scheduled to hit theaters in 2019. Poor test screenings, reshoots, and COVID-19 changed all that, but Netflix stepped in and purchased the film, and now they&#8217;re gearing up to start streaming it in May. Which means it&#8217;s time for a new trailer! Based on the best-selling novel by A. J. Finn (AKA Dan Malloy), <em>The Woman in the Window</em> is heavily inspired by familiar titles such as <em>Rear Window</em> and follows Adams as an agoraphobic child psychologist who begins to suspect something is amiss with her neighbors.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-665944\"></span></p>\n<h2><strong>The Woman in the Window Trailer</strong></h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/v_0GJg_Jnlo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>The long, strange saga of <em>The Woman in the Window</em> is almost over. The story originated as a book by A. J. Finn, a pseudonym for writer Dan Malloy. The book became a huge bestseller, which meant a movie was inevitable. And the movie attracted some major talent – Joe Wright directs a cast that includes Amy Adams, <strong>Gary Oldman</strong>, <strong>Anthony Mackie</strong>, <strong>Fred Hechinger</strong>, <strong>Wyatt Russell</strong>, <strong>Brian Tyree Henry</strong>, <strong>Jennifer Jason Leigh</strong>, and <strong>Julianne Moore</strong>. Pulitzer Prize-winning writer <strong>Tracy Letts</strong> (who also appears in the film) wrote the script. With that type of pedigree, <em>The Woman in the Window</em> began to generate awards season-buzz before anyone had even seen a single frame.</p>\n<p>And then things went wrong. The movie was initially set for a theatrical release in 2019, but poor test screenings resulted in reshoots. The reshoots kept pushing the release date around, and it was recently revealed that <strong>Tony Gilroy</strong>, who has become Hollywood&#8217;s go-to script doctor, was brought in for rewrites. Alas, none of this seemed to help the movie, and when the reshot version was test screened the reaction was about the same. In the midst of all this, <em>The New Yorker</em> published a lengthy <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/02/11/a-suspense-novelists-trail-of-deceptions\">article</a> about A. J. Finn/Dan Malloy that pointed out the writer&#8217;s long history of deceiving people during his climb to the top of the bestseller list.</p>\n<p>Now, after all of these shenanigans and misadventures, <em>The Woman in the Window</em> will see the light of day thanks to Netflix. In the film, &#8220;Anna Fox (Amy Adams) is an agoraphobic child psychologist who finds herself keeping tabs on the picture perfect family across the street through the windows of her New York City brownstone. Her life is turned upside down when she inadvertently witnesses a brutal crime.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>The Woman in the Window</em> arrives on Netflix on <strong>May 14, 2021</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-woman-in-the-window-trailer-netflix/\">&#8216;The Woman in the Window&#8217; Trailer: Nosy Neighbor Amy Adams Witnesses a Murder&#8230;or Does She?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=1uVk57GPrpI:Tu1oH2LH8oE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=1uVk57GPrpI:Tu1oH2LH8oE:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=1uVk57GPrpI:Tu1oH2LH8oE:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=1uVk57GPrpI:Tu1oH2LH8oE:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=1uVk57GPrpI:Tu1oH2LH8oE:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=1uVk57GPrpI:Tu1oH2LH8oE:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/1uVk57GPrpI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 08 Apr 2021 20:30:08 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-woman-in-the-window-trailer-netflix-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"042092975998fb73cd504f42b61533ef","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn60@2020_5/2021/04/09/16-41-43-332_0e268a07740b8133.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":26518,"destBytes":13282,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-woman-in-the-window-trailer-netflix-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn60@2020_5/2021/04/09/16-41-43-332_0e268a07740b8133.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn15@2020_3/2021/04/09/16-42-22-291_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=1uVk57GPrpI:Tu1oH2LH8oE:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn19@2020_1/2021/04/09/16-42-22-936_730981fe0005971b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn55@2020_5/2021/04/09/16-42-22-746_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=1uVk57GPrpI:Tu1oH2LH8oE:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn10@2020_1/2021/04/09/16-42-22-632_7a3503e9b1b2e06e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/1uVk57GPrpI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn23@2020_5/2021/04/09/16-42-22-777_ec6fb594591a64a2.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617986483838},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:23","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:23","title":"Those Mini-Pufts From ‘Ghostbusters: Afterlife’ Are Toys Now, Obviously","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=665933","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Mini-Pufts-Toys.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-665942\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Mini-Pufts-Toys-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"Mini-Pufts Toys\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Mini-Pufts-Toys-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Mini-Pufts-Toys-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Mini-Pufts-Toys-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Mini-Pufts-Toys.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>The minute everyone laid eyes on the Mini-Pufts from the recently released <strong><em>Ghostbusters: Afterlife</em></strong> clip I&#8217;m fairly confident we all knew they would inevitably be turned into toys.

Some folks were completely enamored with the look of the Mini-Pufts, a gaggle of tiny Stay-Puft Marshmallow Men that seem tailor-made to appeal to those who love Baby Groot/Baby Yoda/The Minions, and so on. Others – like me, a negative nelly – thought the clip was kind of disappointing. To be fair, the clip in question is completely out of context, and it may very well work better when viewed with the rest of the movie. For now, though, I remain skeptical.</p>\n<p>No matter! The people behind <em>Ghostbusters: Afterlife</em> know that moviegoers/consumers are going to want their own Mini-Pufts, and Hasbro is ready to give them exactly what they want.

But according to writer <strong>Chris Terrio</strong>, the studio&#8217;s original draft was way darker: Ben Affleck&#8217;s Batman brands criminals in both versions, but Warner Bros.&#8217; original draft actually ended with Batman branding Lex Luthor (<strong>Jesse Eisenberg</strong>).</p>\n<p>In a new interview, Terrio defends his scripts for both <em>Batman v Superman</em> and <em>Justice League</em>, specifically saying that the theatrical cut of <em>Justice League</em> &#8220;doesn&#8217;t represent [his] work&#8221; and that he wanted to take his name off the movie after he saw Joss Whedon&#8217;s rewrites.<br />\n<span id=\"more-665976\"></span></p>\n<p>After <em>Man of Steel</em> came out in 2013, David Goyer (<em>Batman Begins</em>, <em>Man of Steel</em>) was hired to write the script for <em>Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice</em>. He eventually left the project due to scheduling conflicts, and Terrio was brought in to help with the tone of Affleck&#8217;s Batman character. Now, in a fascinating interview with <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2021/04/chris-terrio-justice-league-batman-v-superman\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Vanity Fair</a>, Terrio is pushing back against the narrative that he&#8217;s the one who made the film as dark and gritty as it is.</p>\n<p class=\"paywall\">&#8220;The studio seemed to take this position after <em>BvS</em> that <em>my</em> writing was too dark and that this was their problem,&#8221; Terrio told the outlet. &#8220;But what they didn&#8217;t mention was that, for example, in the draft of the Batman/Superman script that W.B. had developed—[which was] the draft I was handed when I joined the project—Batman was not only branding criminals with a bat brand, he also <em>ended</em> the movie by branding Lex Luthor. That ending was a point over which I explicitly went to the mat with the studio again and again. I argued that Batman cannot end the movie continuing this behavior, which amounted to torture, because then the movie was endorsing what he did.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The entire interview is absolutely worth reading, but I wanted to highlight one more section which illustrates just how much WB was struggling to create a cohesive narrative behind the scenes. Terrio says &#8220;there was never any thought to how the world was constructed before they issued this edict&#8221; about the order of releases for the DC movies. &#8220;They said, &#8216;Conform to this schedule.'&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The <em>Wonder Woman</em> script wasn&#8217;t even finished when I wrote <em>Justice League</em>,&#8221; Terrio explained. &#8220;So I had no basis to write Wonder Woman other than Batman/Superman. Themyscira didn&#8217;t even exist. I was never shown anything on the page for it. I didn&#8217;t know whether people could talk underwater. That was a thing that I had to ask, because I didn&#8217;t know if I could do underwater scenes with Aquaman and Atlanteans. It was all just from scratch because there had been no [solo] character films. So <em>Justice League</em> needed to establish three of the characters; it had to create a long game mythology for the DC Universe.

The staff gathered a truly great list. I would like to add one more recommendation:</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CONQUEST OF THE USELESS by Werner Herzog</span>. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This book is a collection of journal entries written by Herzog himself during the filming of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fitzcarraldo</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This is hands down one of the most amazing books about filmmaking I have ever read. Anyone familiar with Herzog’s work or his interviews knows that he has one of the most captivating voices in the media landscape bar none. The book is emotional, grim, and occasionally quite humorous. I would go so far as to say one does not even have to appreciate the movies Herzog makes to enjoy his writing — I for one haven’t even seen </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fitzcarraldo</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Herzog is a force of nature and his writing is a treasure. – Cade from Iowa</span></p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All the other stuff you need to know:</span></p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<ul> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can find more about all the stories we mentioned on today’s show at slashfilm.com, and linked inside the show notes.</span></li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">/Film Daily is published every weekday, bringing you the most exciting news from the world of movies and television as well as deeper dives into the great features from slashfilm.com.&nbsp;</span></li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can subscribe to /Film Daily on </span><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/film-daily/id1254073246?mt=2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apple Podcasts</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"https://www.google.com/podcasts?feed=aHR0cDovL2RhaWx5LnNsYXNoZmlsbS5jb20vZmVlZC8%3D\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google Podcasts</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"https://overcast.fm/itunes1254073246/film-daily\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overcast</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"https://u922627.ct.sendgrid.net/wf/click?upn=TvhtDiauxJVhRdbUMx2NHL6ODzLmx4MtfKCdFx-2FSGFQNyT19gu7suETHskKPLeObN63kZLIJaqHCutUuD2JSOw-3D-3D_Mf-2FCkfRivOmMK7O7F0Y-2FexQfRdP6nJdv0CvMHIllgbkxYonk7OFRtOKgc2RI2FTZjosX7Gy5-2F0LZYTCm1KUveJQurOXZQv5Dj2WhJrhmTrs0v3SJiEiBpyb-2F1L8jvr-2B-2BkxkiGeoPD1UieLppbdRBRhz-2BVOyI6R94uU85wuTnw695jKUkbDYkfDzQF2AmxCxzLBCpnE6CnunSfOnUc5T4w6Rt0VfqnTdL8n5IRPTbqCQRp1Xk2jliYNZ7ZDeIS9PTLnYnsWPYrfKEGJy8pKEuEg-3D-3D\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spotify</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and all the popular podcast apps (</span><a href=\"http://daily.slashfilm.com/feed/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">RSS</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">).&nbsp;</span></li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Send your feedback, questions, comments and concerns to us at </span><a href=\"mailto:peter@slashfilm.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">peter@slashfilm.com</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

Now we have word that she&#8217;ll be joined by <em>Hamilton</em> co-star <strong>Renée Elise Goldsberry</strong>.<span id=\"more-666039\"></span></p>\n<p>Deadline has news on the latest addition to the <em>She-Hulk</em> TV series cast. Goldsberry&#8217;s character is said to be named Amelia, but there aren&#8217;t any details about her beyond that. The actress had a breakthrough role as Angelica Schuyler in the original stage production of <em>Hamilton</em>, for which she won a Tony award, and she will soon be seen in the <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/girls5eva-trailer-peacock/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Peacock comedy series <em>Girls5Eva</em></a> from Tina Fey, Robert Carlock, and Meredith Scardino. She also starred in the feature film <em>Waves,</em> Netflix’s sci-fi series<em> Altered Carbon</em>, and NBC’s musical comedy <em>Zoey’s Extraordinary Playlist.</em></p>\n<p>In Marvel Comics, there seems to be only one somewhat prominent character named Amelia, and that&#8217;s Amelia Voght. She&#8217;s a mutant who appears in <em>X-Men</em> comics as <span class=\"aCOpRe\">a former nurse who helped Professor X to recover from the injury that took the use of his legs. But in other comics, she was also a member of a S.W.O.R.D.&#8217;s sub-teams known as the <a class=\"new\" title=\"S.W.O.R.D. Teleport Team (Earth-616) (page does not exist)\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-uncrawlable-url=\"L3dpa2kvUy5XLk8uUi5ELl9UZWxlcG9ydF9UZWFtXyhFYXJ0aC02MTYpP2FjdGlvbj1lZGl0JnJlZGxpbms9MQ==\">Teleport Team</a>, a group of mutants with teleportation skills. </span>If Amelia Voght is the character being played by Goldsberry, it&#8217;s likely that Marvel Studios will be taking plenty of liberties with her. It&#8217;s more likely that Amelia is merely a codename for the character and Goldsberry will be playing someone who is better known in the <em>She-Hulk</em> comics.</p>\n<p><em>She-Hulk</em> has been described as a half-hour legal comedy where Jennifer Walters represents superheroes in court, so we can expect to see some other familiar names from Marvel Comics popping up throughout the series. The series sounds like something extremely different from the rest of Marvel&#8217;s television offerings on Disney+.</p>\n<p>Previously, actress <strong>Ginger Gonzaga</strong> (<em>Kidding</em>, <em>Space Force</em>) <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/she-hulk-cast-adds-ginger-gonzaga/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">joined the cast</a> as Jennifer Walters&#8217; best friend. No name for the character was given, but we speculated that she might be playing Patricia “Patsy” Walker, a private investigator who helps She-Hulk with some of her cases and also goes by the superhero name Hellcat. Other more familiar faces include <strong>Mark Ruffalo</strong> returning as Professor Hulk and <strong>Tim Roth</strong> making a long-awaited return as the Abomination, the villain last seen in <em>The Incredible Hulk</em> with Edward Norton back in 2008.</p>\n<p><em>She-Hulk</em> will be directed by <strong>Kat Coiro</strong> and <strong>Anu Valia</strong> with <strong>Jessica Gao</strong> acting as head writer. The series doesn&#8217;t have a set release date yet, but it&#8217;s expected to arrive on Disney+ sometime in<strong> 2022</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/marvels-she-hulk-tv-series-cast-adds-renee-elise-goldsberry/\">Marvel&#8217;s &#8216;She-Hulk&#8217; Series Adds &#8216;Hamilton&#8217; Star Renée Elise Goldsberry</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=7rdrDTUg3TI:hTU7pPK5r98:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=7rdrDTUg3TI:hTU7pPK5r98:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=7rdrDTUg3TI:hTU7pPK5r98:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=7rdrDTUg3TI:hTU7pPK5r98:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=7rdrDTUg3TI:hTU7pPK5r98:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=7rdrDTUg3TI:hTU7pPK5r98:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/7rdrDTUg3TI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Apr 2021 14:30:16 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/alteredcarbon-reneeelisegoldsberry-bridge-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"7ce832020cf87b144dc81bcc274a9fe3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn79@2020_2/2021/04/09/16-42-16-249_be9691ad9f985814.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":20617,"destBytes":12248,"author":"Ethan Anderton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/alteredcarbon-reneeelisegoldsberry-bridge-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn79@2020_2/2021/04/09/16-42-16-249_be9691ad9f985814.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn15@2020_3/2021/04/09/16-42-22-291_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=7rdrDTUg3TI:hTU7pPK5r98:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn43@2020_5/2021/04/09/16-42-22-461_e9dc9ebb48b80367.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn55@2020_5/2021/04/09/16-42-22-746_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=7rdrDTUg3TI:hTU7pPK5r98:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn31@2020_1/2021/04/09/16-42-22-322_df77a9fdd5b35b59.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/7rdrDTUg3TI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn40@2020_3/2021/04/09/16-42-22-810_d07aa51d1a8b0257.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617986483826},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:23","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:23","title":"‘High School Musical: The Musical: The Series’ Season 2 Trailer: The Trailer Post","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=665984","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/High-School-Musical-The-Musical-The-Series-Season-2-Trailer.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-665996\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/High-School-Musical-The-Musical-The-Series-Season-2-Trailer-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"High School Musical The Musical The Series Season 2 Trailer\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/High-School-Musical-The-Musical-The-Series-Season-2-Trailer-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/High-School-Musical-The-Musical-The-Series-Season-2-Trailer-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/High-School-Musical-The-Musical-The-Series-Season-2-Trailer-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/High-School-Musical-The-Musical-The-Series-Season-2-Trailer.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Hello, this is the <strong><em>High School Musical: The Musical: The Series</em></strong> Season 2 Trailer: The Trailer Post.

On last week&#8217;s episode of <strong><em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em></strong>, Zemo, as played by <strong>Daniel Brühl</strong>, was seen dancing very awkwardly. Zemo&#8217;s pathetic dance moves immediately turned into a meme, and the interest in seeing Zemo boogie on down was heightened when Brühl revealed there was even more footage of him dancing. Fans, as they are wont to do, began <em>demanding</em> that Marvel release the extended &#8220;Zemo cut&#8221; of Brühl dancing. And now, Marvel has delivered. Sort of.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-666038\"></span></p>\n<h2><strong>Zemo Dancing</strong></h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5nEzCv5u1O8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Behold: one hour of Zemo (Daniel Brühl) dancing! To be fair, this isn&#8217;t an hour&#8217;s worth of new footage – instead, it&#8217;s the footage that was already released looped into a full hour. But for those of you craving more moments of Zemo busting a move, this loop should suffice. Zemo was first introduced in the MCU in <em>Captain America: Civil War</em>. Now he&#8217;s back in <em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em>, and he&#8217;s clearly ready to dance.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s so hysterical. [That moment] was improvised when I saw the crowd dancing, going loco. I felt the beat and was like, Zemo has been sitting in a dodgy German prison cell for years. So, he needs to let off some steam and show his moves. Let&#8217;s go for it!&#8221; Brühl told <a href=\"https://ew.com/tv/the-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier-daniel-bruhl-interview-baron-zemo/\">EW</a>. &#8220;I enjoyed so much the reaction of Anthony and Sebastian looking at me. Still, I was 100 percent sure that they would cut it out [of the show]. I was really surprised and happy that they kept it. It was a long dance. There&#8217;s more to it, but they cut this little moment. I didn&#8217;t know what was happening, but I then received all these messages from my friends cracking up. My friends who know me well know I&#8217;m an embarrassing, passionate dancer on the floor but it would be different moves. It would be the Spanish side of me kicking in and doing some matador, flamenco moves, going down on my knees. Highly embarrassing for my friends.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/zemo-dancing/\">Okay, Sure, Here&#8217;s Zemo Dancing on &#8216;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier&#8217; in a One-Hour Loop</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=HouqcuiQKM4:9bdvFfLyudM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=HouqcuiQKM4:9bdvFfLyudM:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=HouqcuiQKM4:9bdvFfLyudM:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=HouqcuiQKM4:9bdvFfLyudM:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=HouqcuiQKM4:9bdvFfLyudM:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=HouqcuiQKM4:9bdvFfLyudM:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/HouqcuiQKM4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Apr 2021 15:30:25 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/zemo-dancing-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"b314e7930252463ad20b2702d3f4229a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn39@2020_4/2021/04/09/16-41-46-352_9c85739e3d6ef530.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":21282,"destBytes":11656,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/zemo-dancing-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn39@2020_4/2021/04/09/16-41-46-352_9c85739e3d6ef530.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn15@2020_3/2021/04/09/16-42-22-291_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=HouqcuiQKM4:9bdvFfLyudM:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn84@2020_5/2021/04/09/16-42-22-530_2345c84923c39393.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn55@2020_5/2021/04/09/16-42-22-746_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=HouqcuiQKM4:9bdvFfLyudM:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn51@2020_6/2021/04/09/16-42-22-489_91255ff7c405de76.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/HouqcuiQKM4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn95@2020_1/2021/04/09/16-42-22-508_b4ed1f72888f98f0.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617986483828},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:23","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:23","title":"Tom Holland to Star in First Season of ‘The Crowded Room’, a New Anthology Series From Akiva Goldsman","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=665950","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-665960 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Crowded-Room-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"The Crowded Room\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Crowded-Room.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Crowded-Room-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Tom Holland</strong> is taking another bite out of Apple.</p>\n<p>The once and future Spider-Man actor recently worked with the streamer on the Russo Brothers&#8217; film <em>Cherry</em>, and now word has arrived that he will play the lead role in a new anthology series for AppleTV+ called <strong><em>The Crowded Room</em></strong>, which hails from writer and executive producer <strong>Akiva Goldsman</strong>. And it sounds like he&#8217;ll be playing another character that will allow him to flex a different set of muscles as an actor.<br />\n<span id=\"more-665950\"></span></p>\n<p>According to a press release from AppleTV+, Tom Holland will be executive producing and starring in <em>The Crowded Room</em>, a &#8220;seasonal anthology&#8221; set to be produced by Apple Studios and New Regency. The streamer has already given the show a series order. Here&#8217;s what it will be about:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The Crowded Room is a gripping anthology series that will explore the true and inspirational stories of those who have struggled, and learned to successfully live with, mental illness. The anthology&#8217;s 10-episode first season is a captivating thriller, inspired by the award-winning biography &#8220;The Minds of Billy Milligan&#8221; by Daniel Keyes. It tells the story of Billy Milligan (Holland), the first person ever acquitted of a crime because of Multiple Personality Disorder (now known as Dissociative Identity Disorder).</p></blockquote>\n<p>On one hand, based on his previous track record, Akiva Goldsman is not the person I would choose to be writing a story that involves any disorders, real or fictional. He&#8217;s not exactly a subtle type of writer, and a lightning rod topic like that requires nuance and a deep understanding so as not to offend anyone who actually has Dissociative Identity Disorder or perpetuate stereotypes about people who do. For example, I remember there being a bit of pushback to the way that M. Night Shyamalan&#8217;s <em>Split</em> handled that topic (a case could be made that that film took place in a heightened world, but that doesn&#8217;t completely absolve the movie of any missteps).</p>\n<p>On the other hand, playing a character with that disorder is probably like catnip for an actor, because they get to play multiple characters within the same physical body.

Not only is it a new Scorsese movie, but it also reunites Scorsese with both <strong>Leonardo DiCaprio</strong> and <strong>Robert De Niro</strong>. On top of that, it&#8217;s adapting an acclaimed book by David Grann, based on a true story. Now, as we all sit around eagerly awaiting the movie, screenwriter <strong>Eric Roth</strong> has shed some light on the project, going so far as to say the film is going to be &#8220;one for the ages,&#8221; and that &#8220;it&#8217;ll be like nothing we&#8217;ve ever seen.&#8221;</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-665918\"></span></p>\n<p>To be fair, Roth isn&#8217;t exactly an impartial party here – he wrote the movie, so obviously he wants to believe it&#8217;s going to be good. Still, it&#8217;s hard not to get hyped for whatever Scorsese and company are cooking up here. Speaking with <a href=\"https://collider.com/killers-of-the-flower-moon-movie-update-role-changes-western-eric-roth-interview/\">Collider</a>, screenwriter Eric Roth played up the fact that not only is this a new Martin Scorsese movie, it&#8217;s a Martin Scorsese <em>Western</em>. But it&#8217;s not going to be your standard Western.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I know Marty&#8217;s trying to make a movie that&#8217;s probably the last Western that would be made like this, and yet, with this incredible social document underneath it, and the violence and the environment,&#8221; Roth said. &#8220;I think it&#8217;ll be like nothing we&#8217;ve ever seen, in a way. And so this one is, to me, one for the ages.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Based on a true story, <em>Killers of the Flower Moon</em> follows the investigation into a series of murders among the wealthy Osage people that took place in Osage County, Oklahoma in the early 1920s. And while that 1920s setting will keep the film from looking exactly like an old school Hollywood Western, the Western movie ideology is going to be there. &#8220;I mean, people will be in suits and things because it&#8217;s 1921. It&#8217;s during the prohibition, but the ethos I think is very Western,&#8221; Roth said, adding: &#8220;And also, I think Western justice, about how they said that you couldn&#8217;t find 12 white men to convict a white man of killing a Native American&#8230;And that&#8217;s kind of the feeling on that. And then also, you have these incredible people, the Osage family that a character comes and marries into, and who&#8217;s a villain and who isn&#8217;t. And then into that comes a kind of heroic guy — Tom White, his name was, who <strong>Jesse Plemons</strong> is playing — who was in the Texas Rangers, and you couldn&#8217;t get more Western than that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Jesse Plemons&#8217;s character Tom White was originally intended for Leonardo DiCaprio, but DiCaprio decided to take on a role that was more morally grey. When Plemons stepped into the role the headline was that Plemons was now the lead of the film, but Roth says that&#8217;s not quite correct. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t say [Plemons is] the lead,&#8221; said the screenwriter. &#8220;I would say that he was the designated hero. But yeah, I think that&#8217;s fairer because I think the parts are pretty equal and they were always equal to a certain extent, and Leo&#8217;s part is very complicated and very interesting. It&#8217;s a smart part for a smart actor to play. I mean, if Montgomery Clift was alive, I think he might think of playing him.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Roth also added: &#8220;I just think [Martin Scorsese&#8217;s] going to make — and obviously I would say this — but I think [of] all my work, this one could be one of the great movies. I really mean that. I think it has all the ingredients, which I don&#8217;t want to jinx it, but the story is so important.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>Killers of the Flower Moon</em> is set to film July, and we likely won&#8217;t see it until 2022.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/killers-of-the-flower-moon-update/\">Martin Scorsese&#8217;s &#8216;Killers of the Flower Moon&#8217; Will &#8220;Be Like Nothing We&#8217;ve Ever Seen,&#8221; Says Screenwriter Eric Roth</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=xpXzA92Ogzc:l4L0puhwrKE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=xpXzA92Ogzc:l4L0puhwrKE:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=xpXzA92Ogzc:l4L0puhwrKE:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=xpXzA92Ogzc:l4L0puhwrKE:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=xpXzA92Ogzc:l4L0puhwrKE:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=xpXzA92Ogzc:l4L0puhwrKE:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/xpXzA92Ogzc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 08 Apr 2021 21:30:08 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/killers-of-the-flower-moon-update-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"57eac46c049dc1070a8043e4b05a4ddd","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn4@2020_4/2021/04/09/16-42-06-964_ecf412122a542db8.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":41976,"destBytes":29006,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/killers-of-the-flower-moon-update-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn4@2020_4/2021/04/09/16-42-06-964_ecf412122a542db8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn15@2020_3/2021/04/09/16-42-22-291_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=xpXzA92Ogzc:l4L0puhwrKE:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn56@2020_2/2021/04/09/16-42-22-110_4554853058f97417.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn55@2020_5/2021/04/09/16-42-22-746_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=xpXzA92Ogzc:l4L0puhwrKE:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn91@2020_6/2021/04/09/16-42-22-493_a174a399d2393788.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/xpXzA92Ogzc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn95@2020_3/2021/04/09/16-42-22-184_0a346eb45dd1e9e0.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617986483824},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:23","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:23","title":"‘The Falcon and the Winter Soldier’ Realize “The Whole World is Watching” in a Grim, Pivotal Episode","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=665738","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-666035 size-medium\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Falcon-and-the-Winter-Soldier-The-Whole-World-is-Watching-Review-700x300.jpeg\" alt=\"The Falcon and the Winter Soldier The Whole World is Watching Review\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Falcon-and-the-Winter-Soldier-The-Whole-World-is-Watching-Review.jpeg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Falcon-and-the-Winter-Soldier-The-Whole-World-is-Watching-Review-360x154.jpeg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Hello, and welcome to your weekly recap of <strong><em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em></strong>. These are meant to be read after watching, so they will go deep into <strong>spoiler</strong> territory. You have been warned!</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-665738\"></span></p>\n<h2>Previously On…</h2>\n<p>In “Power Broker,”  Sam Wilson (<strong>Anthony Mackie</strong>), Bucky Barnes (<strong>Sebastian Stan</strong>), and Zemo (<strong>Daniel Brühl)</strong> took the Baron’s private jet to Madripoor in search of answers about the new Super Soldier Serum that&#8217;s hitting the streets. There they reunited with ex-S.H.I.E.L.D Agent Sharon Carter (<strong>Emily VanCamp</strong>), who&#8217;s been hiding out on the island as an enemy of the state after breaking the Sokovia Accords. Together, they track down Dr. Wilfred Nagel (<strong>Olli Haaskivi</strong>), a former HYDRA scientist turned CIA stooge who used Isaiah Bradley&#8217;s blood to create the new serum for the mysterious Power Broker. The episode ends with our heroes — and Zemo — traveling to Riga, Latvia, in search of the Flag Smashers&#8217; Karli Morgenthau (<strong>Erin Kellyman</strong>). Before they can get down to business, however, Bucky has a run-in with Ayo (<strong>Florence Kasumba</strong>), a member of the Dora Milaje — the personal bodyguards and royal security of the Black Panther. The warrior has only one thing to say. “I’m here for Zemo.”</p>\n<h2>The White Wolf of Wakanda</h2>\n<p>Written by <strong>Derek Kolstad</strong>, &#8220;The Whole World is Watching&#8221; begins with a flashback. Six years ago, Bucky Barnes — given the name White Wolf by the people of Wakanda — was freed from HYDRA&#8217;s brainwashing by Princess Shuri. On a mountainside at night, Ayo tests the success of the deprogramming process by reciting the code words to activate the Winter Soldier. A flashback within the flashback shows us all the pain Bucky has endured over the years and the unspeakable acts he committed as the Winter Soldier. The deprogramming procedure was a success. With tears in his eyes, Bucky realizes that he&#8217;s truly free for the first time since World War II.</p>\n<p>Riga, Latvia. The present. Ayo is not pleased to hear that Bucky helped spring Zemo from prison. &#8220;With time, will, and the resources, the Winter Soldier programming was removed from you like a rotten fur,&#8221; she says.</p>\n<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m grateful for that. I&#8217;m grateful for everything you and Shuri have done&#8230;&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Zemo murdered our King T&#8217;Chaka at the U.N. The man who chose <em>us</em>. Who chose <em>me</em> to protect him.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I understand,&#8221; begins Bucky, but Ayo finishes his sentence. &#8220;Very little, if anything, of our loss and our shame.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a means to an end,&#8221; Bucky says in Wakandan.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Eight hours, White Wolf. Then we come for him.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>Super Soldier Supremacy</h2>\n<p>After his run-in with Ayo, Bucky catches up with Sam and Zemo at their safehouse. The team receives word that Karli Morgenthau has bombed a GRC supply depot, leaving eleven injured and three dead. &#8220;She&#8217;s getting worse,&#8221; Zemo interjects. &#8220;She&#8217;s a supremacist,&#8221; he continues. &#8220;The very concept of a Super Soldier will always trouble people. It&#8217;s that warped aspiration that led to Nazis, to Ultron, to the Avengers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Karli is radicalized, but Sam argues there must be a peaceful way to stop her. According to Zemo, however, the desire to become superhuman cannot be separated from supremacist ideals. &#8220;Anyone with that serum is inherently on that path.&#8221; But as Bucky points out, the serum never corrupted Steve Rogers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Touché. But there has never been another Steve Rogers, has there?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Touché, indeed. Sam and Bucky hope to find Karli by gathering intel on the recently deceased Donya Madani (<strong>Veronica Falcón</strong>), a pillar of the community and the woman who raised Karli. Accompanied by Zemo, they begin canvassing the streets, questioning the locals. Sam encounters a teacher (<strong>Adam Vacula</strong>) who explains the current situation. &#8220;The Global Repatriation Council promised to send more teachers, supplies. That was six months ago.&#8221; While the teacher knows who Sam is, he can&#8217;t trust him, and so the search for answers continues.</p>\n<p>Zemo, meanwhile, has a more direct approach. Singing &#8220;Baa, Baa, Black Sheep,&#8221; the Baron strolls into the town square with a pocketful of Turkish Delight to use as a bargaining chip with a group of children. A sweet made with starch and powdered sugar and flavored with rosewater or lemon, Turkish Delight was also used by the White Witch in C. S. Lewis&#8217;s <i>The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</i> (1950) to persuade a young Edmund Pevensie to spill the beans on his siblings and betray his family.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My old friend, Donya, passed away,&#8221; Zemo tells a young girl. &#8220;I would like to pay my last respects. Do you know where her funeral will be?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Back at the clubhouse, Sam and Bucky are waxing philosophical on Karli&#8217;s methods. The ol&#8217; &#8220;do the ends justify the means&#8221; conversation. Bucky thinks she&#8217;s no different than Zemo or anyone else they&#8217;ve fought. Sam isn&#8217;t so so sure. &#8220;She&#8217;s different. She&#8217;s not motivated by the same things.&#8221; Before the conversation can continue, Zemo lets them know that Donya&#8217;s funeral is this afternoon, and he knows where it will be held.</p>\n<p>Before they leave, Sam contacts Sharon Carter on Madripoor for a favor. &#8220;I know I owe you already,&#8221; begins Sam,&#8221; but we could use a trustworthy set of eyes on the camp. You got any more tricks in your bag?&#8221; It turns out that ex-S.H.I.E.L.D Agent does, in fact, still have a few tricks. &#8220;I may or may not have access to a satellite or two. Let me see what I can do.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Sharon warns Sam that the Power Broker &#8220;went apeshit&#8221; when he heard about Dr. Nagel&#8217;s death. &#8220;You killed the golden goose. Madripoor&#8217;s about to get real nasty.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>Absolute Power Corrupts Absolutely</h2>\n<p>On their way to the memorial, the gang bumps into Captain America (<strong>Wyatt Russell</strong>) and Battlestar (<strong>Clé Bennett</strong>), who are tired of being kept in the dark. &#8220;Karli Morgenthau is too dangerous for you guys to be pulling this shit.&#8221; Language, John F. Walker! Anyway, Sam wants to talk to Karli — the person closest to her died and she&#8217;s vulnerable, she might be reasoned with — but Walker ain&#8217;t having that. Battlestar, however, thinks it might be worth a try if Falcon can talk her down.</p>\n<p>At the memorial, Sam watches as Karli delivers a eulogy for the woman who raised her:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Like a lot of you here, Mama Donya saved me. She clothed me, fed me, loved me. She taught me that we have to do for each other because <em>they</em> won&#8217;t. And we know who <em>they</em> are. They imposed struggle and hardship on us, then labeled us as criminals for pushing back. But the struggle is what brings us all together. People who have nothin&#8217; in common. For we are, after all, simply one world and one people. So live accordingly.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>After the service, Sam approaches Karli. &#8220;I understand your frustration,&#8221; Sam begins. &#8220;I understand your helplessness.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;So, you want me to stop because people are gettin&#8217; hurt, right?&#8221; asks Karli. &#8220;But Sam, what if I&#8217;m making the world a better place?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not a better place if you&#8217;re killing people,&#8221; replies Sam. &#8220;It&#8217;s just different.&#8221;</p>\n<p>To this, Karli smiles. &#8220;You&#8217;re either brilliant or just hopelessly optimistic.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Sam Chuckles. &#8220;Can&#8217;t I be a little bit of both?&#8221; He continues, &#8220;This guy I know, who knows more about Super Soldiers than anyone else on the planet, he says you&#8217;re a supremacist.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Karli is shocked. &#8220;Me? That&#8217;s ridiculous. Everything I do is to end supremacy. These corporations and the beasts who run them, they&#8217;re the supremacists.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Sam asks if she&#8217;s going to increase her army using the Super Soldier Serum the Flag Smashers have procured. &#8220;The people I&#8217;m fighting,&#8221; she replies, &#8220;are trying to take your home, Sam. Why are you here instead of stopping them?&#8221; Sam assures her that he isn&#8217;t her enemy. &#8220;I agree with your fight. I just can&#8217;t get with the way you&#8217;re fighting it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Just as Sam and Karli are about to find common ground, Captain America busts in to arrest her. Feeling setup, Karli springs into action, knocking Walker aside and making an acrobatic escape with the remaining serum. Zemo, however, catches up with her, shoots her in the stomach, and destroys the vials, save one. Before he can finish the job, Walker knocks the Baron out cold with his shield.</p>\n<p>Remember earlier when Zemo said the desire to become superhuman could not be separated from supremacist ideals? It would seem this was some not-so-subtle foreshadowing as to what the fate of John F. Walker will be. Thanks to Peter Parker&#8217;s Uncle Ben, we know that with great power comes great responsibility. In the case of Walker, the responsibility of being Captain America demands great power — the kind of power that can only be gifted via the miraculous Super Soldier Serum. We know he&#8217;s going to take the serum, and we know what he&#8217;ll become.</p>\n<p>Historian and moralist Lord Acton (1834–1902), a baron in his own right, once said, &#8220;Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Great men are almost always bad men.&#8221; We know that once Walker gains the power he thinks he needs to be Captain America, he will be corrupted by it. As Dr. Erskine (<strong>Stanley Tucci</strong>) says in 2011&#8217;s <em>Captain America: The First Avenger</em>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;A strong man, who has known power all his life, may lose respect for that power. But a weak man knows the value of strength, and knows compassion.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Walker has never been a scrawny weakling deemed unfit for military service.  His moral compass isn&#8217;t unwavering, and his Star-Spangled Boy Scout routine is only skin-deep. He doesn&#8217;t fully respect the responsibility he&#8217;s been given or the power he&#8217;s willing to take. He isn&#8217;t Steve Rogers. But he&#8217;s about to show the world who he <em>really</em> is.</p>\n<p>Back at the safehouse, Zemo, Bucky, and Sam are confronted by Walker and Battlestar. Before another Civil War breaks out, however, Ayo and two members of the Dora Milaje show up. &#8220;Let&#8217;s put down the pointy sticks and we can talk this through,&#8221; says Walker with a supremacist attitude.</p>\n<p>Sam warns him to take it easy, but Walker won&#8217;t listen. What the new Cap doesn&#8217;t know, of course, is that the Dora Milaje have jurisdiction wherever the Dora Milaje find themselves to be. Walker and Battlestar are easily outmatched by the three Wakandan warriors, which infuriates Walker even further. Sam and Falcon attempt to break up the fight but only get pulled deeper into the conflict. Ayo deactivates Bucky&#8217;s vibranium arm while Zemo, seizing an opportunity to escape, slips away undetected.</p>\n<p>Realizing their target &#8220;pulled an El Chapo,&#8221; the Dora Milaje stop fighting and give chase. A warrior returns Captain America&#8217;s shield to Walker, who is having serious self-esteem issues after having his ass handed to him by women who aren&#8217;t even Super Soldiers.</p>\n<p>Later, at a café, Battlestar and Captain America weigh the advantages of taking the serum.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Power just makes a person more of themselves, right?&#8221; asks Battlestar. &#8220;Karli Morgenthau. Steve Rogers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;And me?&#8221; asks Walker.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You already have three Medals of Honor,&#8221; replies Battlestar. &#8220;You consistently make the right decisions in the heat of battle.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Now we get some additional insight on the &#8220;heroic acts&#8221; that led to Walker being recruited as Captain America:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Three badges of excellence to make sure I never forget the worst day of my life. We both know that the things that we had to do in Afghanistan to be awarded those medals felt a long way from being right. Being Cap is the first time I&#8217;ve had the chance to do something that actually feels right.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Battlestar concludes the conversation with, &#8220;But God! Imagine how many lives we could have saved that day if we had that serum.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>Cold-Blooded Karli</h2>\n<p>Karli calls Sam&#8217;s sister Sarah (<strong>Adepero Oduye</strong>). &#8220;I&#8217;m thinking if I need to kill your brother,&#8221; she begins. &#8220;I thought I could trust him. I got the impression that he and I had some things in common, but then it turns out he&#8217;s working for your new Captain America.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Sarah responds, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t choose him,&#8221; to which Karli asks who she would have chosen instead. &#8220;My world doesn&#8217;t matter to America,&#8221; Sarah says. &#8220;So why should I care about its mascot?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I like you, Sarah. You remind me of me.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Karli, if you believe one thing, believe this. My brother is not working for that man.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I hope you&#8217;re right,&#8221; says Karli. &#8220;I need to meet with Sam. Alone.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Karli needs Sam to know that she&#8217;s serious. And she needs to know that he won&#8217;t betray her trust again. &#8220;Otherwise,&#8221; she says, &#8220;instead of meeting Sam here, I can always meet with you, and AJ, and little Cass there, maybe out back, by the dock?&#8221;</p>\n<h2>Blood on the Shield</h2>\n<p>Sam and Bucky meet up with Karli. &#8220;You called my sister? That&#8217;s how we&#8217;re gonna play this?&#8221; Sam asks.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Sam, I would never hurt her. I just wanted to understand you better. I see you didn&#8217;t come alone.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t wanna hurt you,&#8221; Karli continues. &#8220;You&#8217;re just a tool in the regimes I want to destroy. You&#8217;re not hiding behind a shield. If I were to kill you, it&#8217;d be meaningless. I was gonna ask you to join me. Or do the world a favor and let me go.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Before Sam can reply, Sharon Carter checks in with news that Cap and Battlestar are moving on their location. A fight ensues between Bucky, Sam, Walker and the Flag Smashers, and it&#8217;s here we learn that Walker has taken the last vial of Nagel&#8217;s Super Soldier Serum. In the ensuing battle, Battlestar is killed by Karli, which causes Walker to finally snap. He jumps out a window and chases a Super Soldier to the town square, and pummels him into submission. As the Super Soldier pleas for his life, Captain America brings the shield down over and over, like Jack Torrance with an ax, as a crowd gathers and records the events with their smartphones.</p>\n<p>When he&#8217;s done, Cap&#8217;s shield is covered in blood and the unarmed Flag Smasher is dead. Walker has become what we knew he would be: A Super-Patriot and a supervillain with the whole world watching.</p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>With &#8220;The Whole World is Watching&#8221; in the books, there are only two episodes of <em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em> left, Overall, I&#8217;ve really enjoyed <strong>Malcolm Spellman</strong>&#8216;s series so far. It&#8217;s been a treat to watch Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, and Daniel Brühl further develop their characters and build upon their established chemistry while newcomers like Erin Kellyman and Wyatt Russell make the Marvel Cinematic Universe feel bigger and more complicated post-<em>Endgame</em>. I&#8217;m very excited to see what lies ahead for these characters and how this series shapes future MCU films.</p>\n<p>But what do you think? Are you enjoying The Falcon and the Winter Soldier so far? And who is the mysterious Power Broker? Could it be Thaddeus E. &#8220;Thunderbolt&#8221; Ross (<strong>William Hurt</strong>) or Sharon Carter playing both sides? Or is it someone new we haven&#8217;t met before? Could it be disgraced military contractor Justin Hammer (<strong>Sam Rockwell</strong>)? And if so, will he break out some sweet James Brown dance moves?

The NYPD&#8217;s finest are back on the beat, for the eighth and final season of <strong><em>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</em></strong>. Production on <em>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</em> has officially started, with the stars of the NBC sitcom, posting on Instagram to celebrate the occasion and show off their quarantine hairstyles.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-665969\"></span></p>\n<p>Cameras began rolling on the final 10 episodes of <em>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</em> on Tuesday, which is set to air on NBC as part of the 2021-22 broadcast TV season. It comes after a long delay, after the beloved sitcom was supposed to return during the 2020-2021 TV season, but was pushed back in the wake of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the calls for racial justice in the wake of George Floyd&#8217;s murder. Co-creator <strong>Dan Goor</strong> threw out four completed episodes to address the topic of police brutality head-on in the new season, which will be its last.</p>\n<p>Melissa Fumero, who plays Amy Santiago, announced the start of <em>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</em> season 8&#8217;s production with an <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CNYBzathXM0/?utm_source=ig_embed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram</a> picture of herself and co-stars <strong>Terry Crews</strong> and <strong>Andre Braugher</strong> back in the old Nine-Nine office, surrounded by masked crew members.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Ba ba ba back in the Nine Nine!!!&#8221; she wrote. &#8220;Yesterday, I was so excited to be back at work, I forgot to take a pic to commemorate the occasion, so here’s a Day 2 pic!&#8221;</p>\n<p>Co-star Stephanie Beatriz also took a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CNVYtIHgESV/?utm_source=ig_embed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">selfie</a> inside the Nine-Nine&#8217;s favorite haunt, Shaw&#8217;s Bar, sporting Rosa Diaz&#8217;s signature leather jacket, while Jo Lo Truglia posted sped-up footage of the hair cut and dye job that it took to transform him back into Charles Boyle. &#8220;Back to Boyle, vacation&#8217;s over!&#8221; he <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CNS4MUDpJ9h/?utm_source=ig_embed\">wrote</a>.</p>\n<p>Lastly, Joel McKinnon-Miller (Scully) shared a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CNVGhwKDG3y/?utm_source=ig_embed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">video</a> from the makeup chair, and posed for a masked photo with <em>Brooklyn Nine-Nine&#8217;s </em>director of photography Rick Page.</p>\n<p>NBC announced in February that <em>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</em> would end with a shortened eighth season — a bittersweet but timely ending for the series that had evaded death once before. <i>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</i> had its time, but it&#8217;s hard to imagine the cop-centric sitcom thriving in a post-Black Lives Matter world now. Executive producer Dan Goor released a statement at the time, writing, &#8220;I’m so thankful to NBC and Universal Television for allowing us to give these characters and our fans the ending they deserve… Ending the show was a difficult decision, but ultimately, we felt it was the best way to honor the characters, the story and our viewers. I know some people will be disappointed it’s ending so soon, but honestly, I’m grateful it lasted this long.

Disney and Pixar have Disney+. Paramount has Paramount + and Universal has Peacock. But unlike its competitors, <strong>Sony</strong> is one of the few major studios that has not yet launched its own streaming platform to compete with <strong>Netflix</strong>. But Sony&#8217;s sticking by the old adage, if you can&#8217;t beat &#8217;em, join &#8217;em. And if you&#8217;re going to join &#8217;em, join with the biggest streamer in the market.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-665947\"></span></p>\n<p>Sony and Netflix have struck a major licensing deal that will make Netflix the streaming home for all of Sony&#8217;s new theatrical releases. Starting next year, all Sony Pictures movies will stream on Netflix, following their theatrical and home video windows. That includes all the future <em>Spider-Man</em> movies and its surrounding cinematic universe titles.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Starting in 2022, Netflix will be the first US streaming home for Sony Pictures films following their theatrical releases.

Future installments from major Sony franchises like <em>Jumanji</em> and <em>Bad Boys</em> will also head to Netflix after theaters too.</p>\n<p>This is a big win for both Sony and Netflix. Sony won&#8217;t have to weather the cost of launching their own streaming platform while still having one major streamer to house their releases, while Netflix gets a pipeline of new theatrical titles to compete with newcomers like Disney+ and HBO Max, which have adapted to COVID-19 times by dropping major titles straight to streaming. Netflix has long been building out its own library of originals, but as the streaming and theatrical landscape change post-COVID, this new Netflix Sony alliance will strengthen both companies.</p>\n<p>This deal didn&#8217;t come completely out of nowhere. Netflix and Sony already have a pre-existing output deal for Sony Pictures Animation titles, which was first struck in 2014. But now Sony&#8217;s library — including the century-old catalog of Columbia — can be licensed out to Netflix.</p>\n<p>As part of the deal, Netflix will also reach into its bottomless well of cash to finance a number of Sony titles. This includes films that Sony intends to make directly for streaming, or plans to later license for streaming. However, the announcement (via <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/netflix-nabs-streaming-rights-to-sonys-feature-beginning-in-2022\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Hollywood Reporter</a>) notes that Sony&#8217;s theatrical output will &#8220;continue at its current volume.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;At Sony Pictures, we produce some of the biggest blockbusters and the most creative, original films in the industry. This exciting agreement further demonstrates the importance of that content to our distribution partners as they grow their audiences and deliver the very best in entertainment,&#8221; said Keith Le Goy, Sony&#8217;s president of worldwide distribution.</p>\n<p>Netflix film head Scott Stuber added, &#8220;This not only allows us to bring their impressive slate of beloved film franchises and new IP to Netflix in the U.S., but it also establishes a new source of first-run films for Netflix movie lovers worldwide.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/netflix-sony-streaming/\">Netflix to Become the Streaming Home for All New Sony Releases Starting Next Year</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=vP6NeQZ5Z7c:VeCrkH-XR0g:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=vP6NeQZ5Z7c:VeCrkH-XR0g:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=vP6NeQZ5Z7c:VeCrkH-XR0g:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=vP6NeQZ5Z7c:VeCrkH-XR0g:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=vP6NeQZ5Z7c:VeCrkH-XR0g:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=vP6NeQZ5Z7c:VeCrkH-XR0g:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/vP6NeQZ5Z7c\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 08 Apr 2021 20:00:55 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/spiderman-farfromhome-panic-endcredits-700x294.jpg","linkMd5":"cd7e65dea80fb656ed3a6bfe1faa3938","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn13@2020_1/2021/04/09/16-41-45-177_558cd019f0b05668.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":294,"sourceBytes":28368,"destBytes":17558,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/spiderman-farfromhome-panic-endcredits-700x294.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn13@2020_1/2021/04/09/16-41-45-177_558cd019f0b05668.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn15@2020_3/2021/04/09/16-42-22-291_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=vP6NeQZ5Z7c:VeCrkH-XR0g:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn23@2020_1/2021/04/09/16-42-22-172_394f86d8047f903d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn55@2020_5/2021/04/09/16-42-22-746_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=vP6NeQZ5Z7c:VeCrkH-XR0g:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn20@2020_4/2021/04/09/16-42-22-118_5f4eb75e91ebca00.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/vP6NeQZ5Z7c":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn8@2020_5/2021/04/09/16-42-22-589_6baec6638d7c0b11.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617986483826},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:23","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:23","title":"‘Saw 10’ is Already in Development, Because Not Even Death Can Stop Jigsaw","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=665858","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/saw-10.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-665915\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/saw-10-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"saw 10\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/saw-10-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/saw-10-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/saw-10-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/saw-10.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong><em>Spiral</em></strong>, the latest entry in the blood-drenched <strong><em>Saw</em></strong> franchise, isn&#8217;t here yet – but that&#8217;s not going to stop Jigsaw&#8217;s blades from buzzing. <strong><em>Saw X</em></strong>, the tenth entry in the series, is reportedly already in active development. It&#8217;s too soon to say what the movie is even about, or if it&#8217;ll be bringing back the characters introduced in the upcoming movie. But at the very least, <em>Saw</em> fans can rest assured that there will be even more blood to come.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-665858\"></span></p>\n<p>Not too long ago there was a period of time – between 2004 and 2010 – where we&#8217;d be blessed (or cursed, depending on what you thought of the franchise) with a new <em>Saw</em> sequel every year, just in time for Halloween. It got to the point where they even started using the somewhat nonsensical tagline &#8220;If it&#8217;s Halloween, it must be <em>Saw</em>!&#8221; But like most horror franchises, interest in <em>Saw</em> started to wain, and the series was brought to a close with 2010&#8217;s <em>Saw 3D. </em></p>\n<p>Of course, Hollywood never really gives up on a once-successful series, and by 2017, <em>Saw</em> returned with the film <em>Jigsaw</em>. That entry wasn&#8217;t a big enough hit to immediately get a sequel greenlit for the following year – but Lionsgate did eventually get around to it, and the ninth entry, <em>Spiral: From the Book of Saw</em>, is finally due out this year. And now it looks like Lionsgate might be ready to get back into the &#8220;<em>Saw</em> movie every year&#8221; business, because <a href=\"https://www.productionweekly.com/\">Production Weekly</a> is listing <em>Saw X</em>, the tenth <em>Saw</em> movie, as being in active development.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s really all we know for now. There&#8217;s no director or writer attached, and since <em>Spiral</em> hasn&#8217;t been released yet, it&#8217;s hard to say how directly it will tie into this tenth entry. Will <em>Spiral</em> star <strong>Chris Rock</strong> be coming back? Or is his involvement with the franchise strictly a one-and-done event? We&#8217;ll have to wait and see. James Wan&#8217;s Robot Monster production company is listed as being attached to <em>Saw X</em>, and while the Robot Monster banner hasn&#8217;t been in front of the previous <em>Saw</em> films, Wan, as co-creator of the franchise, has been listed as a producer on all the entries to date. Some have speculated that adding the Robot Monster banner to <em>Saw X</em> hints that Wan is going to be more actively involved with this sequel than the previous entries, but <a href=\"https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3659222/saw-franchise-targets-milestone-tenth-film-development-underway/\">Bloody Disgusting</a> has confirmed that&#8217;s not the case. That&#8217;s not too surprising, since Wan is a very busy guy and already has <em>Aquaman 2 </em>to deal with.</p>\n<p><em>Spiral</em> opens on <strong>May 14, 2021</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/saw-10/\">&#8216;Saw 10&#8217; is Already in Development, Because Not Even Death Can Stop Jigsaw</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=b_pcJc8tkeQ:bQhJh7Qro3Q:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=b_pcJc8tkeQ:bQhJh7Qro3Q:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=b_pcJc8tkeQ:bQhJh7Qro3Q:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=b_pcJc8tkeQ:bQhJh7Qro3Q:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=b_pcJc8tkeQ:bQhJh7Qro3Q:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=b_pcJc8tkeQ:bQhJh7Qro3Q:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/b_pcJc8tkeQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 08 Apr 2021 21:00:50 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/saw-10-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"9b9d4a61545554c5796693da935f47de","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn52@2020_5/2021/04/09/16-41-53-101_6035725b4e027a51.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":50054,"destBytes":37602,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/saw-10-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn52@2020_5/2021/04/09/16-41-53-101_6035725b4e027a51.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn15@2020_3/2021/04/09/16-42-22-291_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=b_pcJc8tkeQ:bQhJh7Qro3Q:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn27@2020_5/2021/04/09/16-42-22-774_1c3bbc36fefe3e6f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn55@2020_5/2021/04/09/16-42-22-746_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=b_pcJc8tkeQ:bQhJh7Qro3Q:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn79@2020_4/2021/04/09/16-42-22-680_44ca79c688d029bf.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/b_pcJc8tkeQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn51@2020_5/2021/04/09/16-42-22-706_7e975714334a1a50.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617986483828},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:23","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:23","title":"‘Indiana Jones 5’ Cast Adds Phoebe Waller-Bridge as Female Lead, John Williams Returning for Musical Score","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=666081","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Indiana-Jones-5-Cast-Phoebe-Waller-Bridge.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-666087\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Indiana-Jones-5-Cast-Phoebe-Waller-Bridge-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"Indiana Jones 5 Cast Phoebe Waller-Bridge\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Indiana-Jones-5-Cast-Phoebe-Waller-Bridge-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Indiana-Jones-5-Cast-Phoebe-Waller-Bridge-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Indiana-Jones-5-Cast-Phoebe-Waller-Bridge-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Indiana-Jones-5-Cast-Phoebe-Waller-Bridge.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong><em>Indiana Jones 5</em></strong> has added a new face and brought back a familiar name. <em>Fleabag</em> creator/star <strong>Phoebe Waller-Bridge</strong> has joined the cast as the female lead, while the legendary <strong>John Williams</strong> is coming back to score the film.<strong> Harrison Ford</strong> is back as Indy, of course, with <strong>James Mangold</strong> directing. Plot details remain locked away, but production is expected to begin sometime this summer.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-666081\"></span></p>\n<p>Disney and Lucasfilm have announced that Phoebe Waller-Bridge is joining the <em>Indiana Jones 5</em> cast as the female lead. This isn&#8217;t Waller-Bridge&#8217;s first time working with Disney/Lucasfilm – she also had a role in <em>Solo: A Star Wars Story</em>. Plot details about <em>Indiana Jones 5</em> aren&#8217;t available just yet, and we don&#8217;t know anything about Waller-Bridge&#8217;s character. Still, the news of her joining the cast is pretty damn exciting. One also has to wonder if Waller-Bridge, who co-wrote the upcoming James Bond movie <em>No Time to Die</em>, might be asked to contribute to the script as well. <strong>Jonathan Kasdan</strong> and <strong>David Koepp</strong> were both previously announced as working on the script, but Koepp is no longer involved, and the official press release curiously makes no mention of who is writing the film.</p>\n<p>In addition to this casting news, we also now know that John Williams will be back to compose the film&#8217;s score, and thank heavens for that – imagine an <em>Indiana Jones </em>movie without John Williams&#8217;s music. Of course, while Williams will be back, <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/indiana-jones-5-script-disagreements-steven-spielberg\">Steven Spielberg will not</a> – and that&#8217;s a detail that I remain slightly apprehensive about. <em>Indiana Jones</em> is so tied up with Spielberg&#8217;s identity that I have trouble accepting a new film without him. For a while there, Spielberg was intending to return to helm. But after several delays, the filmmaker handed directorial duties over to <em>Logan</em> director James Mangold. Spielberg will still serve as a producer on the project. Spielberg, <strong>Kathleen Kennedy</strong>, <strong>Frank Marshall</strong>, and<strong> Simon Emanue</strong>l will executive produce.</p>\n<p>Mangold is a good filmmaker – but let&#8217;s be real, he&#8217;s no Spielberg. Nonetheless, I&#8217;m curious to see what he does here. &#8220;I&#8217;m thrilled to be starting a new adventure, collaborating with a dream team of all-time great filmmakers,” said Mangold. &#8220;Steven, Harrison, Kathy, Frank, and John are all artistic heroes of mine. When you add Phoebe, a dazzling actor, brilliant creative voice, and the chemistry she will undoubtedly bring to our set, I can’t help but feel as lucky as Indiana Jones himself.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Deadline adds that the hope is to start filming <em>Indiana Jones 5</em> this summer. By all accounts, this will be Harrison Ford&#8217;s last outing as the adventure-seeking archeologist. <em>Indiana Jones 5</em> is set to open <strong>July 29, 2022</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/indiana-jones-5-cast-phoebe-waller-bridge/\">&#8216;Indiana Jones 5&#8217; Cast Adds Phoebe Waller-Bridge as Female Lead, John Williams Returning for Musical Score</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=0qmHOSYIr7M:vlihnwomJzo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=0qmHOSYIr7M:vlihnwomJzo:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=0qmHOSYIr7M:vlihnwomJzo:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=0qmHOSYIr7M:vlihnwomJzo:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=0qmHOSYIr7M:vlihnwomJzo:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=0qmHOSYIr7M:vlihnwomJzo:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/0qmHOSYIr7M\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Apr 2021 16:25:29 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Indiana-Jones-5-Cast-Phoebe-Waller-Bridge-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"b07f587a402a75090fc636d51db4667a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn11@2020_3/2021/04/09/16-41-29-416_fdd1ce04504b5fc3.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":32940,"destBytes":16836,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Indiana-Jones-5-Cast-Phoebe-Waller-Bridge-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn11@2020_3/2021/04/09/16-41-29-416_fdd1ce04504b5fc3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn15@2020_3/2021/04/09/16-42-22-291_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=0qmHOSYIr7M:vlihnwomJzo:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn37@2020_4/2021/04/09/16-42-22-117_4e476a4364f30c65.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn55@2020_5/2021/04/09/16-42-22-746_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=0qmHOSYIr7M:vlihnwomJzo:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn67@2020_3/2021/04/09/16-42-22-083_81daa5572a63e9b4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/0qmHOSYIr7M":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn3@2020_4/2021/04/09/16-42-22-020_16734943b86749c2.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617986483827}],"record":{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:23","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:23","feedId":21,"fetchDate":"Fri, 09 Apr 2021 16:41:23 +0000","fetchMs":94,"handleMs":606,"totalMs":60516,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":20,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"070acbb593b2130d04205a1cc2cf3afe","hostName":"us-008*","requestId":"5d71b65863e746edaf4337268bdc933a_21","contentType":"text/xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":662882,"bgimgsTotal":20,"bgimgsGithubTotal":20,"articlesImgsTotal":89,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":89,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx8":2,"myreaderx14":3,"myreaderx7":3,"myreaderx15":3,"myreaderx6":3,"myreaderx16":3,"myreaderx32":3,"myreaderx4":4,"myreaderx10":2,"myreaderx33":2,"myreaderx11":3,"myreaderx3":3,"myreaderx12":4,"myreaderx2":4,"myreaderx13":3,"myreaderx1":3,"myreaderx30":3,"myreaderx31":3,"myreaderx18":3,"myreaderx19":4,"myreaderx":3,"myreaderx25":3,"myreaderx27":4,"myreaderx21":3,"myreaderx22":3,"myreaderx23":3,"myreaderx24":3,"myreaderx5oss":3,"myreaderx29":3},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-05-30 17:21:38","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 09:23:23","id":21,"name":"/Film","url":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/slashfilm","subscriber":null,"website":null,"icon":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/cropped-ZZ46A5EC75-32x32.jpg","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx64/cdn36@2020_2/2020/09/01/01-23-09-121_cba84478f5ca776d.jpg","description":"Movie News and Reviews This feed is for non commercial use.
