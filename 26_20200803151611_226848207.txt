After years of partnerships and Nexus devices, when Google finally did enter the smartphone market in earnest, it found itself attempting to chip away at an already mature category — an even more difficult feat when most of that competition is already running your operating system. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In an important sense, the Pixel line&#8217;s differentiator may actually be its lack of flash — something that draws a sharp contrast from industry leaders like Samsung, Apple and Huawei. If phones were cars, it would be a reasonable sedan — competent, well-priced and no one is making comments when you drive it up to the PTA meeting. Through much of this, however, Google seems to have struggled to find an identity.</span></p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"ckT1bceNJw\"><p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/13/top-members-of-googles-pixel-team-have-left-the-company/\">Top members of Google’s Pixel team have left the company</a></p></blockquote><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Top members of Google’s Pixel team have left the company&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/13/top-members-of-googles-pixel-team-have-left-the-company/embed/#?secret=ckT1bceNJw\" data-secret=\"ckT1bceNJw\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Sales have been mediocre. It’s the sort of thing that has less than zero effect on Google’s bottom line at the end of the day, but the company clearly has grander ambitions. The division recently underwent a seismic shift in management with the exit of division head Mario Queiroz and camera wizard Marc Levoy. It was, seemingly, a sign that Google is set to blaze a new path for its mobile line, which could ultimately make the Pixel 4 and 4a the last of their kind. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I do think there’s value in reconsidering its approach to the flagship. But the budget “a” really was Google getting things right at the right time. And the sales reflected that with the Pixel 3a, following a disappointing performance by the 3. The 3a nailed the smartphone zeitgeist in a way that previous Pixels had failed, delivering solid and affordable options as the smartphone-buying public had grown weary of paying $1,000+ for a new flagship.</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-2026403\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/00100lrPORTRAIT_00100_BURST20200802095904993_COVER.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/00100lrPORTRAIT_00100_BURST20200802095904993_COVER.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/00100lrPORTRAIT_00100_BURST20200802095904993_COVER.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/00100lrPORTRAIT_00100_BURST20200802095904993_COVER.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/00100lrPORTRAIT_00100_BURST20200802095904993_COVER.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/00100lrPORTRAIT_00100_BURST20200802095904993_COVER.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/00100lrPORTRAIT_00100_BURST20200802095904993_COVER.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/00100lrPORTRAIT_00100_BURST20200802095904993_COVER.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/00100lrPORTRAIT_00100_BURST20200802095904993_COVER.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It was even less flashy than other Pixels, and lacking in horsepower under the hood, but it was custom-built to deliver one of the best and purest Android experiences on the market. Last year’s Pixel 4 got off to a rocky start. The device was solid, but had one extremely important flaw: abysmal battery life. Sales suffered, though Google was reportedly able to make up for a rough start out of the gate due to pretty solid discounts over the handset’s life.</span></p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"zvb0xVSDub\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/21/google-pixel-4-review-more-camera-greatness/\">Pixel 4 review: Google ups its camera game</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Pixel 4 review: Google ups its camera game&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/21/google-pixel-4-review-more-camera-greatness/embed/#?secret=zvb0xVSDub\" data-secret=\"zvb0xVSDub\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">That all brings us to the Pixel 4a, which, most importantly, addresses the 4’s most glaring problem. Battery life is one of those things that rarely gets mentioned in the first sentence or two about a new smartphone. It’s not cool or interesting or new or sexy. But after the honeymoon of the first few weeks or so with a new handset, it can rocket to the top of the most important things about a phone. It’s the sort of thing you tend to only notice when it’s back. And with the Pixel 4, people definitely noticed. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The 4a, mind you, is not a battery powerhouse, but it’s decent. And that, in and of itself, is enough to recommend it over the Pixel 4. At 3140 mAh, the 4a’s battery is nothing to write home about, but it’s a nice improvement over the 4’s 2800 mAh and a slight bump over the 3a’s 3080 mAh. Using the 4a as my regular phone, I was able to get more than a day out of the handset, with the battery finally giving up the ghost around 27 hours after I unplugged it from the charger. That number is going to shrink if you enable the always-on display. </span></p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"by9hWQHJar\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/08/what-pixel-3a-tells-us-about-the-state-of-the-smartphone-and-google/\">What Pixel 3a tells us about the state of the smartphone — and Google</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;What Pixel 3a tells us about the state of the smartphone — and Google&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/08/what-pixel-3a-tells-us-about-the-state-of-the-smartphone-and-google/embed/#?secret=by9hWQHJar\" data-secret=\"by9hWQHJar\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Inside, the handset sports last year’s Snapdragon 730G (an overlooked version of the 730). There was likely little consideration of the new 765, for reasons having to do with price. For most tasks the processor choice won’t make a huge difference day to day, but it’s certainly noticeable on some key things like shooting photos, which take a few extra moments to process.</span></p>\n<p>[gallery ids=\"2025622,2025627,2025619,2025620,2025621,2025623,2025625,2025626,2025628,2025629,2025630,2025631,2025632,2025633,2025634\"]</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The camera has, of course, long been the centerpiece of the Pixel line. That fact certainly extends to its budget offshoots. The 4a maintains the 3a’s single 12.2-megapixel rear-facing camera, albeit configured into a square camera module à la the 4. Middling camera hardware has always been a strange source of pride for Google.</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-2025627\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/00100lrPORTRAIT_00100_BURST20200731065844624_COVER.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/00100lrPORTRAIT_00100_BURST20200731065844624_COVER.jpg 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/00100lrPORTRAIT_00100_BURST20200731065844624_COVER.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/00100lrPORTRAIT_00100_BURST20200731065844624_COVER.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/00100lrPORTRAIT_00100_BURST20200731065844624_COVER.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/00100lrPORTRAIT_00100_BURST20200731065844624_COVER.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/00100lrPORTRAIT_00100_BURST20200731065844624_COVER.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/00100lrPORTRAIT_00100_BURST20200731065844624_COVER.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The company has long insisted that it’s able to provide some of the best mobile imaging by letting on-board computation and software do most of the heavy lifting. And honestly, the results speak for themselves. The Pixel 3a takes some truly excellent photos for a handset at this price point, including low light and zoom.</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-2025656\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/usmzrCo5.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"410\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/usmzrCo5.jpeg 5000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/usmzrCo5.jpeg?resize=150,60 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/usmzrCo5.jpeg?resize=300,120 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/usmzrCo5.jpeg?resize=768,307 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/usmzrCo5.jpeg?resize=680,272 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/usmzrCo5.jpeg?resize=1536,614 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/usmzrCo5.jpeg?resize=2048,819 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/usmzrCo5.jpeg?resize=50,20 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Hardware does, indeed, still matter. And it’s going to for the foreseeable future. Google, for example, is able to do some really impressive things with the Super Res Zoom feature introduced on the Pixel 3.

Google’s is one of the best in the business. But while it’s most good enough to offer the illusion of bokeh blur, there are still computation limitations of a system that’s designed to guess at an image’s depth of field. Having been switching between the iPhone 11 and Pixel 3a a fair bit in recent days, among other things, I’ve really come to appreciate the close range at which the Google device is able to shoot in Portrait Mode. Both, however, continue to run into some depth issue with more complex subject matter or noisy background. Shooting a chain link fence, say, can create some blurring chaos. </span></p>\n<p><img class=\"breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-2025642\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/7a3pPO6b.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"410\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/7a3pPO6b.jpeg 5000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/7a3pPO6b.jpeg?resize=150,60 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/7a3pPO6b.jpeg?resize=300,120 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/7a3pPO6b.jpeg?resize=768,307 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/7a3pPO6b.jpeg?resize=680,272 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/7a3pPO6b.jpeg?resize=1536,614 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/7a3pPO6b.jpeg?resize=2048,819 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/7a3pPO6b.jpeg?resize=50,20 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p><em>[L-R: iPhone 11, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/pixel-2\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"pixel-2\">Pixel <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> 4a]</em></p>\n<p><span class=\"s1\" style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Night Sight, on the other hand, continues to shine in low light.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I recently asked a colleague what drew him to keep purchasing Pixels.

I’m always a little wary of how much to play up the feature. I know as a reporter who does a lot of interviews, it’s a pretty indispensable tool in my daily life. The same could probably go for college kids who attend a lot of lectures. Beyond that, I’m not sure how handy it’s going to be for most folks’ day to day. But I’m excited to see Google continue to build on the app with new features like Google Doc integration and Google Assistant support. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Other notable software additions include live captioning for phone calls and video calls, which essentially integrates the above technology. Doing so will alert the users on the other end. As Google notes, it’s really only good for conversations between two people. Adding more than that has a way of frying the algorithm in my experience with these services. And for privacy purposes, it will alert the person on the other end when it has been enabled. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">At $349, the Pixel 4a starts at $50 cheaper than the 3a and less than half the price of Pixel 4. It also puts it well under budget flagships from the likes of Samsung and Apple. Even with that aggressive pricing in mind, there’s really no measure by which the Pixel 4a is an exciting phone. But it’s one that will get the job done, which is probably the most we can ask of it. Well, that and a headphone jack. </span></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=G8V_u6OAh0E:xRCeYTjCXxU:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=G8V_u6OAh0E:xRCeYTjCXxU:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=G8V_u6OAh0E:xRCeYTjCXxU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=G8V_u6OAh0E:xRCeYTjCXxU:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=G8V_u6OAh0E:xRCeYTjCXxU:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=G8V_u6OAh0E:xRCeYTjCXxU:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=G8V_u6OAh0E:xRCeYTjCXxU:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=G8V_u6OAh0E:xRCeYTjCXxU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/G8V_u6OAh0E\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 03 Aug 2020 15:00:05 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/00100lrPORTRAIT_00100_BURST20200802095904993_COVER.jpg","linkMd5":"f1c313922496c5058af089dae849f460","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn26@2020_3/2020-08-03/1596467741772_a91e392a687c49fa.webp","author":"Brian Heater","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/00100lrPORTRAIT_00100_BURST20200802095904993_COVER.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn26@2020_3/2020-08-03/1596467741772_a91e392a687c49fa.webp","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/00100lrPORTRAIT_00100_BURST20200731065844624_COVER.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn13@2020_5/2020-08-03/1596467766648_3e1d028e0a7f56fc.webp","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/usmzrCo5.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn13@2020_5/2020-08-03/1596467769977_af33643110214852.webp","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/00100lrPORTRAIT_00100_BURST20200802091727670_COVER.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn25@2020_2/2020-08-03/1596467769525_a007d7b8225665e8.webp","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/7a3pPO6b.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn42@2020_4/2020-08-03/1596467767986_ed37d09e9aaeadca.webp","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/00100lrPORTRAIT_00100_BURST20200802095914246_COVER.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn17@2020_4/2020-08-03/1596467769233_c13f03953f1e1a00.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn34@2020_5/2020-08-03/1596467738877_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn29@2020_5/2020-08-03/1596467767420_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn45@2020_1/2020-08-03/1596467766288_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=G8V_u6OAh0E:xRCeYTjCXxU:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn93@2020_3/2020-08-03/1596467766365_705da4a2a0498a34.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=G8V_u6OAh0E:xRCeYTjCXxU:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn53@2020_4/2020-08-03/1596467767463_249d8d45c7481e7b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn57@2020_1/2020-08-03/1596467767356_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/G8V_u6OAh0E":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn1@2020_1/2020-08-03/1596467767278_24b32607e84a1180.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-03 23:15:35","updatedTime":"2020-08-03 23:15:35","title":"The 4a and 5 will be Google’s first 5G-enabled Pixels","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2026447","description":"<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Surprise.

That’s a fairly significant bump over the standard 4a’s $349 starting price, but still pretty reasonably priced for a 5G phone. Obviously the Pixel 5 will be going 5G as well — Google even said as much in a blog post this morning (with a rare peak behind the curtains). From the sound of things, the devices will be released in roughly the same timeframe, but the details are understandably still very limited on that front.</span></p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"> It’s promised more on both in the coming months, though we do know for sure that both models will be available in the U.S., Canada, U.K., Ireland, France, Germany, Japan, Taiwan and Australia. It&#8217;s a strange strategy that bucks previous next-gen technology roll outs (not the mention how virtually every other manufacturer has approached 5G). Likely it has more to do with timing that any, though there&#8217;s notably been an aggressive push to democratize 5G access, led by the likes of Qualcomm. </span></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ImYmKaJ1NEU:o2zCVN4Xb9g:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ImYmKaJ1NEU:o2zCVN4Xb9g:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ImYmKaJ1NEU:o2zCVN4Xb9g:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ImYmKaJ1NEU:o2zCVN4Xb9g:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=ImYmKaJ1NEU:o2zCVN4Xb9g:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ImYmKaJ1NEU:o2zCVN4Xb9g:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=ImYmKaJ1NEU:o2zCVN4Xb9g:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=ImYmKaJ1NEU:o2zCVN4Xb9g:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/ImYmKaJ1NEU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 03 Aug 2020 15:12:00 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"8dc4a59ca8bc8299834aa3815e3070fc","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn34@2020_5/2020-08-03/1596467738877_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","author":"Brian Heater","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn34@2020_5/2020-08-03/1596467738877_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn29@2020_5/2020-08-03/1596467767420_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn45@2020_1/2020-08-03/1596467766288_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=ImYmKaJ1NEU:o2zCVN4Xb9g:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn94@2020_1/2020-08-03/1596467766342_6d67a36fe8812c7f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=ImYmKaJ1NEU:o2zCVN4Xb9g:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn57@2020_4/2020-08-03/1596467766338_90c6137678882ab3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn57@2020_1/2020-08-03/1596467767356_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/ImYmKaJ1NEU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn49@2020_1/2020-08-03/1596467766220_8b198d8b0d7a48ba.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-03 23:15:35","updatedTime":"2020-08-03 23:15:35","title":"OneKey wants to make it easier to work without a desktop by integrating apps into mobile keyboards","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2026306","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">&#8220;The app that you use the most on your phone and you don&#8217;t realize it is your keyboard,&#8221; says Christophe Barre the co-founder and chief executive of <a href=\"https://www.getonekey.io/\">OneKey</a>.</p>\n<p>A member of <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/y-combinator\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"y-combinator\">Y Combinator&#8217;s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> most recent cohort, OneKey has a plan to make work easier on mobile devices by turning the keyboard into a new way to serve up applications like calendars, to-do lists, and, eventually, even <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/salesforce\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"salesforce\">Salesforce <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> functionality.</p>\n<p>People have keyboards for emojis, other languages, and gifs, but there have been few ways to integrate business apps into the keyboard functionality, says Barre. And he&#8217;s out to change that.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>Right now, the company&#8217;s first trick will be getting a Calendly-like scheduling app onto the keyboard interface.

She was living there and he was working on a sales automation startup called DeepLook. Together with his DeepLook co-founder (and high school friend), Ulysses Pryjiel, Barre set out to see if he could bring some of the business tools he needed over to the mobile environment.</p>\n<p>The big realization for Barre was the under-utilized space on the phone where the keyboard inputs reside. He thinks of OneKey as a sort of browser extension for mobile phones, centered in the keyboard real estate.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The marketplace for apps is the longterm vision,&#8221; said Barre. &#8220;That&#8217;s how you bring more and more value to people. We started with those features like calendars and lists that brought more value quickly without being too specialized.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The idea isn&#8217;t entirely novel. SwiftKey had a marketplace for wallpapers, Barre said, but nothing as robust as the kinds of apps and services that he envisions.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you can do it in a regular app, it&#8217;s very likely that you can do it through a keyboard,&#8221; Barre said.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=W0-VH9anGJc:BGpjmwyureg:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=W0-VH9anGJc:BGpjmwyureg:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=W0-VH9anGJc:BGpjmwyureg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=W0-VH9anGJc:BGpjmwyureg:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=W0-VH9anGJc:BGpjmwyureg:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=W0-VH9anGJc:BGpjmwyureg:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=W0-VH9anGJc:BGpjmwyureg:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=W0-VH9anGJc:BGpjmwyureg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/W0-VH9anGJc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 03 Aug 2020 13:39:16 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/c1dfcd_24404e21b4fe4db287e92edc8e2bc653~mv2.gif","linkMd5":"41335fb3dc800b9cd2a9a425858efdfa","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn38@2020_4/2020-08-03/1596467761576_0adf9cd341fd28e2.webp","author":"Jonathan Shieber","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/c1dfcd_24404e21b4fe4db287e92edc8e2bc653~mv2.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn38@2020_4/2020-08-03/1596467761576_0adf9cd341fd28e2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn34@2020_5/2020-08-03/1596467738877_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn29@2020_5/2020-08-03/1596467767420_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn45@2020_1/2020-08-03/1596467766288_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=W0-VH9anGJc:BGpjmwyureg:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn9@2020_1/2020-08-03/1596467766362_8dd53129de16a81c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=W0-VH9anGJc:BGpjmwyureg:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn49@2020_6/2020-08-03/1596467767578_b64616ff925cb455.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn57@2020_1/2020-08-03/1596467767356_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/W0-VH9anGJc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn33@2020_5/2020-08-03/1596467767391_243d6ec62c7e1f64.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-03 23:15:35","updatedTime":"2020-08-03 23:15:35","title":"Facebook fights order to globally block accounts linked to Brazilian election meddling","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2026317","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"facebook\">Facebook <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> has branded a legal order to globally block a number of Brazilian accounts linked to the spread of political disinformation targeting the country&#8217;s 2018 election as &#8220;extreme&#8221;, claiming it poses a threat to freedom of expression outside the country.</p>\n<p>The tech giant is simultaneously complying with the block order &#8212; beginning Saturday after it was fined by a Supreme Court judge for non-compliance &#8212; citing the risk of criminal liability for a local employee were it not to do so.</p>\n<p>However it is appealing to the Supreme Court to try to overturn the order.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>A spokesperson for the tech giant sent us this statement on the matter:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Facebook complied with the order of blocking these accounts in Brazil by restricting the ability for the target Pages and Profiles to be seen from IP locations in Brazil.

Beyond the new whitepaper, the next step in the system&#8217;s development will be to implement a proof-of-concept, which Adobe plans to have ready later this year for Photoshop.</p>\n<p>TechCrunch spoke to Adobe&#8217;s Director of CAI Andy Parsons about the project, which aims to craft a &#8220;robust content attribution&#8221; system that embeds data into images and other media, from its inception point in Adobe&#8217;s own industry-standard image editing software.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>&#8220;We think we can deliver like a really compelling sort of digestible history for fact checkers consumers anybody interested in the veracity of the media they&#8217;re looking at,&#8221; Parsons said.</p>\n<p>Adobe highlights the systems appeal in two ways. First, it will provide a more robust way for content creators to keep their names attached to the work they make. But even more compelling is the idea that the project could provide a technical solution to image-based misinformation. As we&#8217;ve written before, manipulated and even out-of-context images play a big role in misleading information online. A way to track the origins — or &#8220;provenance,&#8221; as it&#8217;s known — of the pictures and videos we encounter online could create a chain of custody that we lack now.</p>\n<p>&#8220;&#8230; Eventually you might imagine a social feed be or a news site that would allow you to filter out things that are likely to be inauthentic,&#8221; Parsons said. &#8220;But the CAI steers well clear of making judgment calls — we&#8217;re just about providing that layer of transparency and verifiable data.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Of course, plenty of the misleading stuff internet users encounter on a daily basis isn&#8217;t visual content at all. Even if you know where a piece of media comes from, the claims it makes or the scene it captures are <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/technology/virus-video-trump.html\">often still misleading</a> without editorial context.</p>\n<p>The CAI was <a href=\"https://theblog.adobe.com/content-authenticity-initiative/\">first announced</a> in partnership with Twitter and the New York Times, and Adobe is now working to build up partnerships broadly, including with other social platforms. Generating interest isn&#8217;t hard, and Parsons describes a &#8220;widespread enthusiasm&#8221; for solutions that could trace where images and videos come from.</p>\n<h3>Beyond EXIF</h3>\n<p>While Adobe&#8217;s involvement makes CAI sound like a twist on EXIF data — the stored metadata that allows photographer to embed information like what lens they used and GPS info about where a photo was shot — the plan is for CAI to be much more robust.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Adobe’s own XMP standard, in wide use across all tools and hardware, is editable, not verifiable and in that way relatively brittle to what we&#8217;re talking about,&#8221; Parsons said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When we talk about trust we think about ‘is the data that has been asserted by the person capturing an image or creating an image is that data verifiable?’ And in the case of traditional metadata, including EXIF, it is not because any number of tools can change the bytes and the text of the EXIF claims. You can change the lens if you wish to… but when we&#8217;re talking about, you know, verifiable things like identity and provenance and asset history, [they] basically have to be cryptographically verifiable.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The idea is, that over time such a system would become totally ubiquitous — a reality that Adobe is likely uniquely positioned to achieve. In that future, an app like Instagram would have its own &#8220;CAI implementation,&#8221; allowing the platform to extract data about where an image originated and display that to users.</p>\n<p>The end solution will use techniques like hashing, a kind of pixel-level cross-checking system likened to a digital fingerprint. That kind of technique is already <a href=\"https://news.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2018/09/12/how-photodna-for-video-is-being-used-to-fight-online-child-exploitation/\">widely in use by AI systems</a> to identify online child exploitation and other kinds of illegal content on the internet.</p>\n<p>As Adobe works on bringing partners on board to support the CAI standard, it&#8217;s also building a website that would read an image&#8217;s CAI data to bridge the gap until its solution finds widespread adoption.</p>\n<p>&#8220;&#8230; You could grab any asset drag it into this tool and see the data revealed in a very transparent way and that sort of divorces us in the near term from any dependency on any particular platform,&#8221; Parsons explained.</p>\n<p>For the photographer, embedding this kind of data is opt-in to begin with, and somewhat modular. A photographer can embed data about their editing process while declining to attach their identify in situations where doing so might put them at risk, for example.</p>\n<h3>Thoughtful implementation is key</h3>\n<p>While the main applications of the project stand to make the internet a better place, the idea of an embedded data layer that could track an image&#8217;s origins does invoke digital rights management (DRM), an access control technology best known for its use in the entertainment industry. DRM has plenty of industry-friendly upsides, but it&#8217;s a <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/pages/unintended-consequences-fifteen-years-under-dmca\">user-hostile system</a> that&#8217;s seen countless individuals hounded by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act in the U.S. and all kinds of other <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/xw9bwd/1201-exemptions-right-to-repair\">cascading effects</a> that stifle innovation and threaten individuals with disproportionate legal consequences for benign actions.</p>\n<p>Because photographers and videographers are often individual content creators, ideally the CAI proposals would benefit them and not some kind of corporate gatekeeper — but nonetheless these kinds of concerns that arise in talk of systems like this, no matter how nascent. Adobe emphasizes the benefit to individual creatives, but it&#8217;s worth noting that sometimes these systems can be abused by corporate interests in unforeseen ways.</p>\n<p>Due diligence aside, the misinformation boom makes it clear that the way we share information online right now is deeply broken. With content often divorced from its true origins and rocketed to virality on social media, platforms and journalists are too often left scrambling to clean up the mess after the fact. Technical solutions, if thoughtfully implemented, could at least scale to meet the scope of the problem.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"UdvCzBvJjZ\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/12/facebook-upgrades-its-ai-to-better-tackle-covid-19-misinformation-and-hate-speech/\">Facebook upgrades its AI to better tackle COVID-19 misinformation and hate speech</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Facebook upgrades its AI to better tackle COVID-19 misinformation and hate speech&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/12/facebook-upgrades-its-ai-to-better-tackle-covid-19-misinformation-and-hate-speech/embed/#?secret=UdvCzBvJjZ\" data-secret=\"UdvCzBvJjZ\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=uOsDxwFxd40:VH9r7EvcpR4:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=uOsDxwFxd40:VH9r7EvcpR4:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=uOsDxwFxd40:VH9r7EvcpR4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=uOsDxwFxd40:VH9r7EvcpR4:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=uOsDxwFxd40:VH9r7EvcpR4:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=uOsDxwFxd40:VH9r7EvcpR4:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=uOsDxwFxd40:VH9r7EvcpR4:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=uOsDxwFxd40:VH9r7EvcpR4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/uOsDxwFxd40\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 03 Aug 2020 12:00:55 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"1f053737f3a108ad4c98f3d50b3865d0","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn34@2020_5/2020-08-03/1596467738877_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","author":"Taylor Hatmaker","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn34@2020_5/2020-08-03/1596467738877_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn29@2020_5/2020-08-03/1596467767420_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn45@2020_1/2020-08-03/1596467766288_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=uOsDxwFxd40:VH9r7EvcpR4:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn54@2020_3/2020-08-03/1596467766348_1ea817434a773ced.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=uOsDxwFxd40:VH9r7EvcpR4:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn5@2020_6/2020-08-03/1596467768008_493c961d19f4f500.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn57@2020_1/2020-08-03/1596467767356_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/uOsDxwFxd40":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn73@2020_3/2020-08-03/1596467766209_654f08daa40e475c.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-03 23:15:35","updatedTime":"2020-08-03 23:15:35","title":"Mobile banking startup Varo is becoming a real bank","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2026415","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Mobile banking startup <a href=\"https://www.varomoney.com/\">Varo </a>is becoming its own bank.

These accounts will transition to Varo Bank over time.</p>\n<p>Varo notes it&#8217;s the first U.S. consumer <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/aax-b20d\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"aax-b20d\">fintech <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> to be granted a banking charter. But others may soon follow. In March, <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/square-gets-conditional-approval-for-industrial-loan-charter-2020-03-18?mod=mw_quote_news\">Square said it received approval</a> from the FDIC to conduct deposit insurance so it could open its own bank, Square Financial Services Inc. SoFi in July also <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/sofi-moves-to-start-its-own-bank-11594398461?mod=searchresults&#38;page=1&#38;pos=3\">filed an application</a> with regulators to create SoFit Bank, in order to expand into new products.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s Varo&#8217;s plan, as well. The company says the banking charter will allow it to serve a broader set of customer needs, including &#8220;financial resiliency, affordable access to credit, and the easier management of volatile cash flows.&#8221; Or, more simply put, credit cards, loans and savings products.</p>\n<p>These expanded offerings will be useful to customers amid the economic downturn drive by COVID-19 health. Already, Varo responded to the pandemic by offering early access to stimulus deposits, increasing deposit and ATM limits, and expanding tis partnerships with job platforms to help customers find work.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is a thrilling milestone for Varo, as the bank charter has been a core part of Varo’s disruptive vision from the very beginning,” said Varo Bank founder and CEO Colin Walsh, in statement. &#8220;2020 has been challenging for many of us across the country and has highlighted, once again, how the traditional financial system is not meeting the needs of hardworking, everyday Americans. The ability to operate as a full-service national bank gives Varo more freedom to deliver the kind of innovation and allyship that many Americans have never had from their bank before. We are excited to lead a new wave of financial inclusion by offering fair, transparent, intelligent, and comprehensive financial services to all,&#8221; he added.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=zcuNl3EDhoo:M1-0bgSpz2c:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=zcuNl3EDhoo:M1-0bgSpz2c:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=zcuNl3EDhoo:M1-0bgSpz2c:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=zcuNl3EDhoo:M1-0bgSpz2c:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=zcuNl3EDhoo:M1-0bgSpz2c:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=zcuNl3EDhoo:M1-0bgSpz2c:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=zcuNl3EDhoo:M1-0bgSpz2c:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=zcuNl3EDhoo:M1-0bgSpz2c:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/zcuNl3EDhoo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 03 Aug 2020 14:51:07 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/varo.png?w=711","linkMd5":"0033d395d5d37b4fa38309aea186634f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn58@2020_4/2020-08-03/1596467766631_583554ccdb3599ff.webp","author":"Sarah Perez","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn34@2020_5/2020-08-03/1596467738877_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn29@2020_5/2020-08-03/1596467767420_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn45@2020_1/2020-08-03/1596467766288_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=zcuNl3EDhoo:M1-0bgSpz2c:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn37@2020_2/2020-08-03/1596467767431_29166c0696044cdd.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=zcuNl3EDhoo:M1-0bgSpz2c:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn81@2020_5/2020-08-03/1596467766316_fc61cf815cce38cf.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn57@2020_1/2020-08-03/1596467767356_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/zcuNl3EDhoo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn39@2020_6/2020-08-03/1596467766269_9ff860367ea52dda.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-03 23:15:35","updatedTime":"2020-08-03 23:15:35","title":"Y Combinator’s Kuleana is making an animal-free substitute for raw tuna","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2025678","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Companies like Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat that are making vegetable-based meat substitutes have captured the imagination and wallets of consumers, but so far, there&#8217;s been no real corollary for the seafood industry.</p>\n<p>Now, a startup coming from Y Combinator&#8217;s summer cohort, <a href=\"https://kuleana.co/product\">Kuleana</a>, is hoping it can swim in those waters.</p>\n<p>While new businesses like Wild Type, Finless Foods, and Shiok Meats are all developing cell-based alternatives to using live tuna, salmon, and shrimp and Good Catch and Ocean Hugger are proposing their own tuna replacements, but Kuleana hopes to differentiate itself by replicating sushi-grade raw tuna.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>And that&#8217;s only the beginning, according to Kuleana co-founder and chief executive, Jacek Prus.

Using an initial EUR50,000 in seed funding from Good Seed Ventures, Kuleana is developing a scaffolding that will enable the company to recreate the taste and texture of raw fish, without using 3D printing techniques (which Prus said could make the product look and taste &#8220;cooked&#8221;).</p>\n<p>To get to market Kuleana is reaching out to a number of sushi chefs at restaurants around the country, because the first target is, in fact, restaurants.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What we found is that 60 percent [of seafood] is eaten out of the home, and with raw seafood that&#8217;s significantly higher,&#8221; said Prus. &#8220;We&#8217;re doing it heavier on the food service route.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Within the year, Kuleana may be appearing in some stores as a tuna alternative in sushi rolls and poke bowls at a price that Prus said is already competitive with higher grade tuna loin.</p>\n<p>Kuleana already held two successful taste tests in Barcelona and San Francisco and the company boasted in a recent note to investors that there were letters of intent for orders of over 50,000 pounds of the company&#8217;s vegetarian tuna substitute.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">&#8220;The taste of tuna isn&#8217;t the hardest part&#8230; It’s the texture,&#8221; says Prus. &#8220;[Competitors] are formatting their process through extrusion and it will not work.

The two processes are so different, so all-consuming and require such different priorities that it is nearly impossible to do both well. Running a sale process, though, is much different from positioning your company for sale, and positioning for a sale is very easy to do while you are focused on execution and fundraising. In fact, thinking like a buyer often helps make your business better even if you never sell, and if you do end up exiting through a merger or acquisition (far more common than an IPO in any event), you’ll be that much farther ahead.</p>\n<h2>It’s not just about your KPIs anymore</h2>\n<p>Investors care about results far more than methods. If the business is growing and the results are strong, founders are apt to face few questions from investors about the details of how they run their businesses.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>It can come as quite a shock, then, when a buyer begins questioning <em>everything </em>during a sale<em>. </em>An acquisition represents not just the purchase of a revenue stream but also the team, technology, culture and a swarm of contractual relationships. Consider that a buyer is acquiring everything you have built up to this point, and they will take a close interest in all of it, not just your results.</p>\n<p>At times, it can feel infuriatingly unfair. When I sold my first startup, Prism, several buyers castigated us for building on .NET. The product worked beautifully, and we had strong revenue growth. The tech stack was efficient and reliable. In fact, buyers would often congratulate us for the technology we had built and in the same breath insult our method of building it. Unfair, perhaps, but entirely reasonable considering that the buyer had to consider not just our results but how to integrate our team and product into their company. I’ve heard similar stories from founders concerning issues that range from culture and hiring practices to core hours and partnerships.</p>\n<p>While growth is always the priority, looking at the business objectively can pay handsome dividends even if no buyer ever materializes and starts asking questions. It is easy for teams to become insular and to ignore problems festering underneath the shiny performance metrics, and forcing yourself to think like a buyer can help uncover problems early. Security and accounting are the best and most obvious examples here, but are far from the only ones. Even if you decide not to make a given change (we would not have changed our tech stack, for example), you will be able to get in front of any objections. A good offense is always the best defense, and the more you address incompatibilities proactively with a buyer, the stronger your position will be.</p>\n<h2>A peek behind the curtain</h2>\n<p>So how does a sale actually happen, and how does your preparation pay off? Typically, there are two general paths: the traditional process and the “serendipitous” encounter. In a traditional process, the founder explicitly seeks to sell the company. In a large transaction, it’s common to hire an investment bank to run the process; founders tend to manage smaller transactions themselves. Either way, the founder or the banker will comb through a list of potential acquirers and pitch the business to them in a process that feels somewhat like raising money.</p>\n<p>The “serendipitous” encounter is a much looser construction. Sometimes, it is truly happenstance, when an acquirer expresses genuinely unexpected interest. More often, those scare quotes are doing yeoman’s work, and the founder starts feeling out potential buyers by casually discussing how great their business is with those around them. Some founders are better at this dance than others, but once a buyer expresses genuine interest, the next steps look exactly like the formal process. Look, there <em>may </em>be environments in which having zero competition for your deal makes sense, just like there may be environments in which “Well, at this point, the best path forward definitely is to wrestle with that alligator” is a sensible thing to say. Both environments are equally likely. In almost all cases, it is imperative to get others interested in your company, even if you would prefer to sell to the first buyer. Auctions drive up prices and improve your negotiating position on literally everything, so you need to run a process just as if you’d planned one from the beginning.</p>\n<p>So what does “interest” look like? It’s a fuzzy concept, but typically it means that someone with agency (either a C-suite executive or someone in the corporate M&#38;A group) tells you that they want to consider acquiring your business. A lot of euphemisms get thrown around at this point to avoid scaring founders; you’ll hear “building a closer relationship” or word salads like “working together in a more structurally consistent manner” or if the person has a New York investment banking background, “Let’s get a deal done” likely delivered staccato with a finger. jabbing. the. table. for. emphasis. These phrases all mean the same thing, namely that the company that person represents wants to consider buying your company.</p>\n<p>At this point, the conversation is pretty high level. You typically won’t be tearing into the technical wizardry, but rather demonstrating that you have what it takes to play the game: a good business model, a reliable product, strong team chemistry, and a product that fits well into the acquirer’s business. You, your co-founders and probably some senior engineers will spend some time at the acquirer’s offices, meeting with the management and product teams, trying to get a sense for how well these various groups of people gel. The CEO will spend time with the other company’s CEO (or in the case of larger acquirers, divisional leadership), hashing out employee benefit packages and transition agreements. Pro tip: “Synergies” mean firing people, and if that’s off the table for you, make that clear upfront. Even if there’s a desire to keep the whole team, it’s pretty unusual for every last person to make the transition.</p>\n<p>If these first couple meetings go well, you need to start formalizing the process. Your sale will be much more successful if you establish an internal champion (sometimes the CEO but ideally your head of corporate development, business unit leader or GC) who can navigate the sale. Having one key point person will streamline the process and allow the founders to focus on ensuring that the business doesn’t fall apart from all of the distraction.</p>\n<p>At some point early in this process, you’ll want to ask for an Initial Indication of Interest, or “IOI.” Legally, it’s a worthless piece of paper, but it keeps honest people honest. In it are outlined the terms of the proposed deal, the expected timing and other major deal points. Much can and will change, but having a common and documented starting ground is essential. NDAs tend to get signed around this time as well or may already be in place if the process started more formally. At this point, you also need to communicate to your other potential buyers (you have a few, right?) that you’re “in exclusivity,” meaning you can’t negotiate with anyone else. Doing so typically heightens their interest, because they’re human beings. From then on, you’ll almost certainly be prohibited from talking to <em>new </em>buyers about the business at all, so your only fallback options are the others already in the process.</p>\n<p>From then on, it’s a sprint to the finish. Technical diligence, legal diligence, security reviews, accounting reviews, etc. It all takes longer than it should and creates proliferating headaches. Anything can derail a deal, but most of this work just creates more negotiating room for the buyer. It’s like a really expensive and prolonged home inspection, and if you’ve done a good job on maintenance over the years, it’ll go smoothly (see previous section).</p>\n<h2>The sellers matter, too</h2>\n<p>Your investors, employees and customers all have a stake in this outcome as well. While you’re busy trying to think like a buyer, you also need to empathize with all of your selling stakeholders. Each situation is different, so it’s hard to give generic advice. More communication is better than less, especially to your lead investors who likely have to approve any M&#38;A in the first place. If a transaction comes out of nowhere, it can feel desperate and leave investors wondering what was left on the table. Investors have come to associate poor communication with poor management, and it’s not an unfair assumption.</p>\n<p>You’ll need to bring employees into the circle as the diligence process unfolds, and involving your top people is almost always the right initial step. You need your leaders on board with the deal, and it is much easier to get people excited when they have a say in the process and outcome. Unfortunately for your customers, they will have to wait for the public deal announcement, but be transparent and honest in that communication. It should come from one of the CEOs.</p>\n<p>Finally, be sure to give people who have supported you in the past — journalists, bloggers, podcasters, advisors — a heads-up as well so they don’t feel blindsided. Doing so is especially important if an acquisition will significantly disrupt the product; if someone put their reputation on the line for you, do your best to tell them what’s happening before they wake up to the news alert.</p>\n<h2>Ultimately, think like a sales lead</h2>\n<p>Every CEO is in <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/sales-8ea4\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"sales-8ea4\">sales <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a>. Pitching investors, selling to customers, recruiting all-stars, courting acquirers: It’s all sales. Preparing to sell your most important asset — the company itself — should be no less a part of your DNA.

Other things happened too, don&#8217;t worry. Here&#8217;s the rundown:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/02/microsoft-pursuing-tiktok-purchase-with-september-15th-deadline-may-invite-u-s-investors-to-participate/\">TikTok-Microsoft deal is back</a> on.</li>\n<li>Lordstown Motors is <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/electric-pickup-truck-maker-lordstown-motors-to-go-public-through-buyout-by-spac-diamondpeak-2020-08-03\">looking to go public via a SPAC</a>. To which we have to say that the EV boom and SPAC crush are going to fuse and lose some people a lot of money. Not this deal, necessarily, mind.</li>\n<li>Google is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/03/google-to-invest-450m-in-smart-home-security-solutions-provider-adt/\">dumping money into ADT as part of a Nest deal</a>.</li>\n<li>And Zoom&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/03/zoom-to-halt-direct-sales-of-services-to-users-in-china.html\">latest move regarding the Chinese market</a> feels like a harbinger of times to come.</li>\n<li>On the TikTok front, Microsoft never really fully abandoned consumer hardware and software, it just pruned deeply under its current CEO Satya Nadella. Windows Phone? Gone. Surface? Bigger than ever. Mixer? No. Bing? Yep. That sort of thing. And Microsoft, like any modern super-platform, doesn&#8217;t just want to own your time when you are at work. It wants to burn your eyes out around the clock.</li>\n<li>For a <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bytedance/company_financials\">host of ByteDance backers</a> like Yuri Milner, Sequoia Capital China, General Atlantic, SoftBank, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, the deal could be rather lucrative, we presume.</li>\n<li>Rounds for <a href=\"https://www.wejo.com/\">Wejo</a> (<a href=\"https://tech.eu/brief/wejo-funding/\">coverage here</a>), <a href=\"https://lezzoo.com/\">Lezzoo</a> (<a href=\"https://adigitalboom.com/iraqs-first-super-app-lezzoo-raises-seven-figure-seed-round/\">coverage here</a>), and <a href=\"https://www.livefeather.com/\">Feather</a> (<a href=\"http://www.finsmes.com/2020/08/feather-secures-30m-credit-line-from-credit-suisse.html\">coverage here</a>).</li>\n<li>Finally, <em>why</em> does Microsoft want to buy TikTok?

But <a href=\"https://www.heyartifact.com/\">Artifact</a>, a new YC-backed company launching today, has a different idea.</p>\n<p>It all started when cofounder and CEO Ross Chanin lost his grandfather. He found himself wishing he&#8217;d spent more time asking him about his life. At the same time, he was mulling the audio revolution underway in the tech world after having cofounded Reputation.com and serving as COO at Euclid (acquired by WeWork).</p>\n<p>Over a beer with his friend George Quraishi, a journalist, they decided to try out the idea of a more personal podcast for a specific, smaller audience, starting with Ross&#8217;s Aunt Cindy. They did audio interviews with three of Aunt Cindy&#8217;s closest friends, who shared intimate details about their friendships with Cindy, from how they met to their favorite memories to what they love most about her.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>&#8220;When Ross’s cousin got out his phone and played the mp3 for Cindy on her birthday, she started crying,&#8221; <a href=\"https://www.heyartifact.com/blog/hey-were-artifact/\">wrote Qurashi</a>. &#8220;And laughing. Later, she said, &#8216;You know, you just go through life, you don’t really think about somebody recalling what’s important to them about you, or what you mean to them.'&#8221;</p>\n<p>This was the glimmer in the eye of Chanin and Qurashi to build out Artifact. They teamed up with Moncef Biaz (CTO) to handle the technical back end infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Using professionally contracted interviewers, Artifact conducts short interviews with a person&#8217;s closest friends or family and turns them into a personal podcast. Some of these interviewers are journalists like Qurashi, and others are simply great listeners, such as a bartender, a few actors, and even a comedian.</p>\n<p>Interviewees either call a phone number for their interview, or the more tech-savvy among them can dial in via their computer for a higher fidelity audio quality.</p>\n<p>After the interview, Artifact handles the editing and polish to offer a higher-quality final product that is delivered to the recipient via the web.</p>\n<p>&#8220;On the one hand you have your purely user generated content and then you have this high-production content,&#8221; said Chanin. &#8220;Our general sense is that there is a pretty large missing middle. We&#8217;re getting to 80 or 90 percent of what a studio-produced podcast would sound like. And no one cares about that extra 10 or 20 percent.&#8221;</p>\n<p>One of the things that is most special about Artifact also happens to be a big challenge for the product: It can be used in almost any way. This can make it difficult to define and leave the ball in the court of the user to dream up what they want their Artifact to be.</p>\n<p>The Portrait, which focuses on stories from friends and family about a single person, is an obvious use case. But Artifact is also used by couples for their wedding, with annual podcasts for each year of their marriage. Folks can use the service to reflect on huge milestones in their lives, or to catalogue the growth of their child from the kid&#8217;s point of view. Businesses are even starting to use Artifact in this COVID-19 world to get to know their colleagues better during remote work.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our customers are not the product,&#8221; said Chanin. &#8220;They are buying a product. We think that Artifact loses a lot if the default assumption is that millions of people are going to hear this. Certainly, Artifacts can be used in that way, but the primary sharing is to close friends and family.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Chanin added that the average Artifact episode is listened to by about 30 people.</p>\n<p>Artifact generates revenue by charging users per episode, with each episode allowing up to two interviewees. One episode costs $175, two episodes costs $325, and four episodes costs $625.</p>\n<p>The team is comprised of four full time workers, with 12 interviewers contracted on the project. The full time team is 100 percent male and 50 percent of employees are people of color. Fifty-five percent of contractors are people of color and 35 percent are women.</p>\n<p>The company has raised a total of $500,000, which includes $150,000 from Y Combinator, as well as funding from David Lieb (Founder of Bump and Director, Google Photos), Sander Daniels (cofounder of Thumbtack), Eric Kinariwala (founder and CEO of Capsule), and Sean Bratches (Fmr. Managing Director, Formula 1. Fmr.

As of writing, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"microsoft\">Microsoft <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/02/microsoft-pursuing-tiktok-purchase-with-september-15th-deadline-may-invite-u-s-investors-to-participate/\">confirmed</a> it&#8217;s in talks with US officials to pursue a TikTok purchase. Trump previously <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/31/trump-ban-tiktok/\">said </a>he would not support the purchase of the Chinese-owned app by an American company.</p>\n<p>On the China end, Zhang told his staff that the company has &#8220;initiated preliminary discussions with a tech company to help clear the way for us to continue offering the TikTok app in the U.S.&#8221; The message corroborates <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/01/tiktok-says-its-not-planning-on-going-anywhere-in-response-to-pending-u-s-ban/\">reassurance</a> from the app&#8217;s US general manager Vanessa Pappas that TikTok is &#8220;not planning on going anywhere.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Zhang is unabashed about his frustration in the letter: &#8220;We disagree with CFIUS’s conclusion because we have always been committed to user safety, platform neutrality, and transparency. However, we understand their decision in the current macro environment.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>Angry netizens</h2>\n<p>But ByteDance&#8217;s responses clearly have not won favor with some people in China. On Weibo, a popular microblogging platform in China, hundreds of anonymous users joined in under a <a href=\"https://weibo.com/1642634100/JebZ5rcJw?refer_flag=1001030103_&#038;type=comment#_rnd1596443501721\">post</a> about Zhang&#8217;s letter, cursing him as a traitor of China, an American apologist, a coward, among many other labels.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Zhang Yiming used to praise the US for allowing debate, unlike in China, where opinions are one-sided. Now he got a slap in the face, why doesn&#8217;t he go argue with the US?&#8221; Chastised one of the most popular comments with over 3,600 likes.</p>\n<p>The commentator appears to be referring to some of Zhang&#8217;s Weibo posts from the early 2010s, which can be seen by some as liberal-leaning, putting the entrepreneur in the rank of &#8220;public intellectuals.&#8221; The term has in recent years been thought of as <a href=\"https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1795/why-public-intellectuals-have-become-targets-of-online-abuse\">derogatory</a>, as internet patriots see the group as ignorant and worshippers of Western values.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The general view among Chinese social media users is that this is a tit-for-tat measure as part of the ongoing US-China trade war. They also believe that these steps are being taken due to TikTok’s success and because it has now become a threat to US platforms such as Facebook and Twitter,&#8221; said Rich Bishop, CEO of AppInChina, which helps international apps and games publish in China.</p>\n<p>Zhang&#8217;s Weibo <a href=\"https://weibo.com/zhangyiming?nick=%E5%BC%A0%E4%B8%80%E9%B8%A3&#038;is_all=1&#038;is_search=1&#038;key_word=%E7%BE%8E%E5%9B%BD#_0\">account</a> is currently suspended, presumably to prevent armies of angry patriots from flooding his posts.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to gauge how representative the online sentiment is of the Chinese public, or whether the discourse is orchestrated by government-paid commentators. Compared to the internet fury, though, Beijing appeared relatively resigned, with a Foreign Ministry spokesperson merely <a href=\"https://news.cgtn.com/news/2020-07-29/China-denies-US-accusation-of-meddling-in-election-via-TikTok-SwvcOoEfWU/index.html\">denying</a> US allegations against TikTok as fabricated &#8220;out of nothing&#8221; during a regular presser. (There&#8217;s no concrete evidence publicly presented by the US government yet to support its claims that TikTok is a national security threat.)</p>\n<p>After all, the Chinese government can&#8217;t do much to retaliate, given there are scant examples of American internet giants with a considerable business in China.</p>\n<h2>Sympathy from peers</h2>\n<p>Startups and investors in China are more sympathetic toward ByteDance. Many agree that if the Microsoft deal goes through, it could be the least bad outcome for TikTok.</p>\n<p>&#8220;They are stuck between a rock and a hard place,&#8221; said William Bao Bean, general partner at Chinaccelerator, a cross-border accelerator backed by SOSV. &#8220;We are in a fast-changing regulatory environment. I think the consumers would probably want to continue using the service, and this is one potential way to make that happen. Obviously, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s what ByteDance really wants.&#8221;</p>\n<p>AppInChina&#8217;s Bishop reminded us of Microsoft&#8217;s non-confrontational attitude towards Beijing. &#8220;I think it’s a good outcome for all sides. Microsoft of course benefits hugely from getting into social media. Bytedance gets a good payout, and Bytedance and the Chinese government are relatively friendly towards Microsoft.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The tech community is well aware that TikTok is a rarity. Although the backlash will have a chilling effect on Chinese companies expanding to the US, and potentially other Western markets, there simply aren&#8217;t many internet companies going from China to the West in the first place.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Most solutions that are built for China don&#8217;t solve problems that people have in the West,&#8221; observed Bao Bean.</p>\n<p>Chinese games probably have the best shot in conquering the West, as WeChat parent Tencent, through aggressive acquisitions and numerous smash-hits, has demonstrated. Smaller developers resort to the strategy of &#8220;laying low&#8221; about their Chinese origin.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We simply don&#8217;t take media interviews,&#8221; said CEO of a US-listed Chinese internet firm on condition of anonymity.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not about the chilling effect. The problem is there won&#8217;t be opportunities in the US, Canada, Australia, or India anymore. The chance of succeeding in Europe is also becoming smaller, and the risks are increasing a lot,&#8221; a former executive overseeing an American giant&#8217;s Chinese business lamented, asking not to be named.</p>\n<p>&#8220;From now on, Chinese companies going global can only look to Southeast Asia, Africa, and South America.&#8221;</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=_Tm89m4eXUo:ktsvMZE1koM:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=_Tm89m4eXUo:ktsvMZE1koM:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=_Tm89m4eXUo:ktsvMZE1koM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=_Tm89m4eXUo:ktsvMZE1koM:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=_Tm89m4eXUo:ktsvMZE1koM:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=_Tm89m4eXUo:ktsvMZE1koM:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=_Tm89m4eXUo:ktsvMZE1koM:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=_Tm89m4eXUo:ktsvMZE1koM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/_Tm89m4eXUo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 03 Aug 2020 11:33:49 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GettyImages-641244694.jpg?w=600","linkMd5":"13368ce1f8fcbe8ca8e7b99c055e9a79","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn70@2020_2/2020-08-03/1596467766669_2744a9d22cd069eb.webp","author":"Rita Liao","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn34@2020_5/2020-08-03/1596467738877_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn29@2020_5/2020-08-03/1596467767420_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn45@2020_1/2020-08-03/1596467766288_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=_Tm89m4eXUo:ktsvMZE1koM:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn97@2020_6/2020-08-03/1596467766399_4a1266a57c73d458.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=_Tm89m4eXUo:ktsvMZE1koM:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn41@2020_5/2020-08-03/1596467767457_4c30c4de0b74f9bf.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn57@2020_1/2020-08-03/1596467767356_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/_Tm89m4eXUo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn45@2020_1/2020-08-03/1596467767338_0854927315c51507.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-03 23:15:35","updatedTime":"2020-08-03 23:15:35","title":"Metro Bank is acquiring peer-to-peer lender RateSetter for up to £12M","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2026321","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Incumbent banks acquiring fintechs is nothing new, and amidst the coronavirus crisis, we can likely expect to see that trend continue.

Interestingly, it will continue to operate RateSetter as an independent platform and offer loans under both the RateSetter and Metro Bank brands.</p>\n<p>However, there is one significant change to RateSetter: Metro Bank says it will use its deposit base to fund all new unsecured personal loans originated via the RateSetter platform i.e. future RateSetter lending will on appear Metro Bank&#8217;s balance sheet. With that said, RateSetter will continue to manage the existing RateSetter loan portfolio and &#8220;Provision Fund&#8221; on behalf of its existing peer-to-peer investors, &#8220;with Metro Bank assuming no credit risk for these existing loans&#8221;.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=vrN5h8IkSfQ:I-FE01dX36A:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=vrN5h8IkSfQ:I-FE01dX36A:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=vrN5h8IkSfQ:I-FE01dX36A:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=vrN5h8IkSfQ:I-FE01dX36A:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=vrN5h8IkSfQ:I-FE01dX36A:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=vrN5h8IkSfQ:I-FE01dX36A:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=vrN5h8IkSfQ:I-FE01dX36A:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=vrN5h8IkSfQ:I-FE01dX36A:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/vrN5h8IkSfQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 03 Aug 2020 11:09:16 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI","linkMd5":"7955177973dc001d1780a296bc8c6974","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn34@2020_5/2020-08-03/1596467738877_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","author":"Steve O'Hear","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn34@2020_5/2020-08-03/1596467738877_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn29@2020_5/2020-08-03/1596467767420_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn45@2020_1/2020-08-03/1596467766288_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=vrN5h8IkSfQ:I-FE01dX36A:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn21@2020_5/2020-08-03/1596467766313_0f1fba04fc7e1a0e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=vrN5h8IkSfQ:I-FE01dX36A:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn65@2020_6/2020-08-03/1596467766321_086665d3199e2b64.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn57@2020_1/2020-08-03/1596467767356_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/vrN5h8IkSfQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn89@2020_6/2020-08-03/1596467766314_66db88a8adee4a15.webp"}}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-08-03 23:15:38","updatedTime":"2020-08-03 23:15:38","feedId":26,"fetchDate":"Mon, 03 Aug 2020 15:15:38 +0000","fetchMs":27,"handleMs":3491,"totalMs":36894,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":20,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"52.16.192.249","hostName":"europe-017.herokuapp.com","requestId":"73e6d5351dba45e1ae309fcec7ea2ef2_26","bgimgsTotal":15,"bgimgsGithubTotal":15,"articlesImgsTotal":58,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":58},"extra4":{"start":1596467735050,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":123,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":3491,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":2246,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":1643,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"},{"spend":5819,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"}]},"extra5":58,"extra6":58,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[]}
