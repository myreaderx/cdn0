Moss' racing career was prolific, as were the watches he wore. One interesting aspect of Moss' watch ownership was that he often wore them on a special twin-bar bracelet. The story goes that Moss had grown tired of leather straps becoming soiled with oil when racing, and the interchangeable bracelet allowed for easy cleaning. </p>\n  \t<figure>\n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://hodinkee.imgix.net/uploads/images/1604008485506-zrgj7qb9nln-6be74ef78272b3ae6f016046d34826eb/IMG_9868.jpg?ixlib=rails-1.1.0&#38;fm=jpg&#38;q=55&#38;auto=format&#38;usm=12&#38;ch=Width%2CDPR%2CSave-Data&#38;fit=crop&#38;w=2000\" />\n  <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n  \t<p>The bracelet was a key part of a great driver's watch-wearing history, worn in numerous races and at important events for 38 years.
