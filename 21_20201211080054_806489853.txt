The House of Mouse is reportedly considering pushing the premieres of its upcoming live-action remakes <strong><em>Pinocchio</em></strong>, <strong><em>Peter Pan and Wendy</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Cruella</em></strong> to Disney+, foregoing a theatrical release completely.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-646789\"></span></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">One of Disney’s all-time classics is coming to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DisneyPlus?src=hash&#38;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DisneyPlus</a> with the new live-action retelling of Pinocchio, starring Tom Hanks and directed by Robert Zemeckis. ? <a href=\"https://t.co/44bHbFRhMe\">pic.twitter.com/44bHbFRhMe</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Walt Disney Studios (@DisneyStudios) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DisneyStudios/status/1337186518004355072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 11, 2020</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Peter Pan &#38; Wendy will be flying to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DisneyPlus?src=hash&#38;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DisneyPlus</a>.

The outlet reports Disney is looking at &#8220;launching a number of its upcoming tentpole family films on Disney+ instead of the theatrical release bows that were envisioned when the films were developed and green lit.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The movies that are being discussed to get their releases pushed to Disney+ are <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/cruella-first-look-photo-d23/\"><em>Cruella</em></a>, the <strong>Craig Gillespie</strong>-directed live-action origin story of the <em>101 Dalmatians</em> villain starring <strong>Emma Stone</strong> and <strong>Emma Thompson</strong>; <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/pinocchio-remake/\"><em>Pinocchio</em></a> directed by <strong>Robert Zemeckis </strong>and starring <strong>Tom Hanks</strong> as Gepetto; and David Lowery&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/peter-pan-and-wendy-cast-yara-shahidi/\"><em>Peter Pan and Wendy</em></a>, which features <em>Grown-ish</em> star <strong>Yara Shahidi</strong> as Tinker Bell.</p>\n<p>Nothing is set in stone yet, neither is it clear whether these films would be offered free to Disney+ subscribers, like the upcoming Disney+ release of Pixar&#8217;s <em>Soul</em>, or whether their will be a premium fee like the release of <em>Mulan</em>. But it seems like Disney is fast to react to big release changes like WarnerMedia&#8217;s pushing <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wonder-woman-1984-hbo-max-release/\"><em>Wonder Woman 1984</em> to a day-and-date release</a> on HBO Max and in theaters on Christmas Day.</p>\n<p>Deadline reports that Disney is &#8220;looking at every option, and everything is under consideration and contingency planning, as Disney makes plans to lean in heavily on its direct-to-consumer initiative and towards continuing to build the juggernaut Disney+, whose subscriber numbers brightened up a last quarter that would otherwise have been bleak because of the wallop that theme parks and live entertainment took from the COVID pandemic.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Disney has found a comfortable pandemic option with Disney+, which has seen tremendous subscriber growth to a whopping 73.7 million as of early October — boosted by the premieres of former theatrical releases like <em>Hamilton</em> and <em>Mulan</em>. It&#8217;s still uncertain whether <em>Mulan</em>&#8216;s PVOD release on Disney+ <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/tenet-box-office-vs-mulan/\">can be counted as a success</a>, especially in relation to what it could have raked in at the box office during a normal release, but it seems like it was enough of a hit to encourage Disney to look at Disney+ as its one-stop shop for future live-action remakes. However, Deadline reports that Disney is still planning to save its bigger titles for theatrical release once the market recovers — with Marvel&#8217;s <em>Black Widow</em> not even being contemplated for a streaming debut.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/disney-live-action-remakes-on-disney/\">Disney is Pushing Premieres of Live-Action Remakes &#8216;Pinocchio,&#8217; &#8216;Peter Pan,&#8217; &#8216;Cruella&#8217; to Disney+ [Updated]</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=H3YoqGES7vw:tfiXBEmxO9s:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=H3YoqGES7vw:tfiXBEmxO9s:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=H3YoqGES7vw:tfiXBEmxO9s:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=H3YoqGES7vw:tfiXBEmxO9s:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=H3YoqGES7vw:tfiXBEmxO9s:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=H3YoqGES7vw:tfiXBEmxO9s:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/H3YoqGES7vw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 00:15:44 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/cruella-firstlook-photo-full-e1605878850808-700x329.jpg","linkMd5":"1d44904b4072f7bd5b772a3df68fe601","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn7@2020_2/2020/12/11/08-00-45-992_b34f9d6c53a8f731.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":329,"sourceBytes":58663,"destBytes":44872,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/cruella-firstlook-photo-full-e1605878850808-700x329.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn7@2020_2/2020/12/11/08-00-45-992_b34f9d6c53a8f731.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn76@2020_6/2020/12/11/08-00-52-628_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=H3YoqGES7vw:tfiXBEmxO9s:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn83@2020_2/2020/12/11/08-00-52-650_f81282d77b115d34.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn75@2020_5/2020/12/11/08-00-52-891_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=H3YoqGES7vw:tfiXBEmxO9s:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn43@2020_4/2020/12/11/08-00-51-671_8c712f05d1fd435f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/H3YoqGES7vw":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn44@2020_5/2020/12/11/08-00-52-824_2aecefef00a21c87.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1607673616875},{"createdTime":"2020-12-11 16:00:16","updatedTime":"2020-12-11 16:00:16","title":"New Pixar Movies: Buzz Lightyear Origin Story ‘Lightyear’ Will Feature Chris Evans, ‘Turning Red’ Coming From ‘Bao’ Director","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=649536","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/lightyear.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-649552\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/lightyear-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"lightyear\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/lightyear-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/lightyear-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/lightyear-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/lightyear.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Two new Pixar titles have been announced during the Disney Investor event, and one is a <em>pretty</em> big surprise.

This show will arrive on Disney+ in <strong>Spring 2022</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/disney-animation-baymax-zootopia/\">&#8216;Baymax!&#8217; and &#8216;Zootopia+&#8217; Animated TV Shows Coming to Disney+</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=VEFtmLt2Uzs:SRx1WVdGDA8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=VEFtmLt2Uzs:SRx1WVdGDA8:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=VEFtmLt2Uzs:SRx1WVdGDA8:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=VEFtmLt2Uzs:SRx1WVdGDA8:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=VEFtmLt2Uzs:SRx1WVdGDA8:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=VEFtmLt2Uzs:SRx1WVdGDA8:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/VEFtmLt2Uzs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 00:49:47 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Baymax-logo-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"e939d845b81b0f639560bf1850ab9868","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn43@2020_2/2020/12/11/08-00-17-186_d34f6e7e3fe6aa7d.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":24781,"destBytes":14504,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Baymax-logo-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn43@2020_2/2020/12/11/08-00-17-186_d34f6e7e3fe6aa7d.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Zootopia-Plus-logo-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn17@2020_2/2020/12/11/08-00-51-605_6d80d66e8cfb3b8d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn76@2020_6/2020/12/11/08-00-52-628_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=VEFtmLt2Uzs:SRx1WVdGDA8:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn22@2020_1/2020/12/11/08-00-51-864_2b089fc6ab12c007.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn75@2020_5/2020/12/11/08-00-52-891_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=VEFtmLt2Uzs:SRx1WVdGDA8:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn99@2020_3/2020/12/11/08-00-52-731_afd3260473f70aa8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/VEFtmLt2Uzs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn48@2020_2/2020/12/11/08-00-51-667_cca8bb94b4c517d6.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1607673616873},{"createdTime":"2020-12-11 16:00:16","updatedTime":"2020-12-11 16:00:16","title":"‘Disenchanted’: Amy Adams Will Officially Be Back in Disney+ ‘Enchanted’ Sequel, Disney Confirms","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=649514","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-649522\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/enchanted-e1607645579489-700x359.jpeg\" alt=\"disenchanted\" width=\"700\" height=\"359\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/enchanted-e1607645579489-700x359.jpeg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/enchanted-e1607645579489-360x184.jpeg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/enchanted-e1607645579489-768x393.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><strong><em>Disenchanted</em></strong> could have used a little of that Disney magic to help it get off the ground.

It was one of the few updates we had heard in a few years of the <em>Enchanted</em> sequel, which director <strong>Adam Shankman</strong> had last teased in 2o18, revealing that a draft of the script was done.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are handing in a script in a couple weeks that I’m super happy with,&#8221; director <strong>Adam Shankman</strong> <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/enchanted-2-script/\">said</a> in 2018. &#8220;Then gotta get the music written.&#8221;</p>\n<p><i>Disenchanted </i>has been in development since 2010.<strong> </strong>The sequel will pick up with Adams&#8217; former animated Disney princess who decided to stay in live-action New York at the end of <i>Enchanted</i>. The sequel is set 10 years after 2007&#8217;s <i>Enchanted</i>, with Giselle potentially rethinking her love of the real world.</p>\n<p>Now that the script, songs, and star are down, <em>Disenchanted </em>seems to finally be a real thing that will be coming to Disney+ sooner rather than later. Maybe this will be the movie that earns Adams the Oscar she deserves (after an arguably awards-worthy performance that she gave in the first <em>Enchanted</em>). <em>Disenchanted</em> will be joining the plethora of other live-action Disney films, like <em>Cruella</em> and <em>Pinocchio</em>, that will be heading straight to Disney+.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/disenchanted-amy-adams-back-disney/\">&#8216;Disenchanted&#8217;: Amy Adams Will Officially Be Back in Disney+ &#8216;Enchanted&#8217; Sequel, Disney Confirms</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=NIV95tZkyM4:rZFYxgjhPT8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=NIV95tZkyM4:rZFYxgjhPT8:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=NIV95tZkyM4:rZFYxgjhPT8:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=NIV95tZkyM4:rZFYxgjhPT8:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=NIV95tZkyM4:rZFYxgjhPT8:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=NIV95tZkyM4:rZFYxgjhPT8:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/NIV95tZkyM4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 00:29:37 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/enchanted-e1607645579489-700x359.jpeg","linkMd5":"6ca8744e66a0b03abc0ff0b1849bcd41","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn67@2020_1/2020/12/11/08-00-33-263_28a4a5577d3958bc.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":359,"sourceBytes":51413,"destBytes":34276,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/enchanted-e1607645579489-700x359.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn67@2020_1/2020/12/11/08-00-33-263_28a4a5577d3958bc.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn76@2020_6/2020/12/11/08-00-52-628_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=NIV95tZkyM4:rZFYxgjhPT8:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn55@2020_2/2020/12/11/08-00-52-906_10eadbd0dd4cc279.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn75@2020_5/2020/12/11/08-00-52-891_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=NIV95tZkyM4:rZFYxgjhPT8:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn51@2020_2/2020/12/11/08-00-51-741_1ef60e4fb073dc5d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/NIV95tZkyM4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn67@2020_2/2020/12/11/08-00-52-571_55a949249385f944.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1607673616897},{"createdTime":"2020-12-11 16:00:16","updatedTime":"2020-12-11 16:00:16","title":"‘Encanto’ is Disney’s Next Magical Animated Musical, Arriving in Fall 2021","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=649527","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-649545 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/encanto-logo-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Encanto Logo\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/encanto-logo.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/encanto-logo-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Walt Disney Animation officially announced their new animated musical during the big investors meeting today.

She&#8217;s compared to Lucille Ball and uses her humor to cover up struggles with her self-worth. </span></p>\n<p>There&#8217;s also Juana, a woman in her 40s with a maternal presence in the film who is a deep thinker and good listener, and Fernando, a handsome, funny, and loud man in his 40s described as the life of the party with an excellent singing voice.</p>\n<p>Meawhile, Mariana has an enemy in the form of a 15-year old boy named Carlos. He&#8217;s also funny and a great singer, but he has a habit of telling tall tales.

We&#8217;re just guessing, but Rogen has to be voicing Monterey Jack, right? That makes the most sense for his comedic talents and vocal style.</p>\n<p><em>Chip ‘n Dale: Rescue Rangers</em> ran for three seasons as an animated series on The Disney Channel in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and became a staple for ’90s kids while airing in syndication.

That show will drop on Disney+ in 2022. Both new shows were announced during Disney&#8217;s big Investor Day presentation.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-649511\"></span></p>\n<p>In <em>Moana</em>, &#8220;An adventurous teenager sails out on a daring mission to save her people. During her journey, Moana meets the once-mighty demigod Maui, who guides her in her quest to become a master way-finder. Together they sail across the open ocean on an action-packed voyage, encountering enormous monsters and i<span class=\"yZlgBd\">mpossible odds.

Her dream takes a slight detour when she meets Prince Naveen (Bruno Campos), who has been turned into an amphibian by evil Dr. Facilier. Mistaking her for a princess and hoping to break<span class=\"yZlgBd\"> the spell, Naveen plants a kiss on poor Tiana &#8212; thereby turning her into a frog as well. The pair hop along on an adventure through the bayous to seek the help of a powerful voodoo priestess.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p>Now, Disney+ is giving both films their own shows.</p>\n<p><em>Moana</em> is one of my favorite recent Disney movies, so I&#8217;ll admit I&#8217;m actually pretty damn excited to return to that world with the upcoming Disney+ <em>Moana</em> series. We don&#8217;t really have many details at the moment, but the show was announced during the Disney Investor Day presentation, where it was revealed <em>Moana</em> would be &#8220;a long-form musical comedy series&#8221; due out in 2023. Hopefully, the original voice cast, especially Auli&#8217;i Cravalho and Dwayne Johnson, will be returning.</p>\n<p>Then there&#8217;s <em>Tiana</em>, a series that will serve as a sequel to <em>The Princess and the Frog</em>. The show follows <em>Princess and the Frog</em> main character Tiana as she serves as a real princess. <em>Princess and the Frog</em> was one of the rare modern-day Disney flicks that used hand-drawn animation techniques instead of just computer-generated imagery. The film was&#8230;fine? I guess? I really enjoyed the opening scenes, but the moment main character Tiana turned into a frog, it kind of lost me. Maybe the show will fair better since it&#8217;s likely to avoid that (I mean, <em>Frog</em> isn&#8217;t in the title, so it has that going for it). <em>Tiana</em> will arrive on Disney+ in 2022.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-12-10-at-7.20.31-PM.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-649529\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-12-10-at-7.20.31-PM-700x289.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"289\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-12-10-at-7.20.31-PM-700x289.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-12-10-at-7.20.31-PM-360x149.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-12-10-at-7.20.31-PM-768x317.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/moana-series/\">&#8216;Moana&#8217; and &#8216;The Princess and the Frog&#8217; Sequel Shows Headed to Disney+</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=NipLwLreYRM:EFx6hmqSxqE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=NipLwLreYRM:EFx6hmqSxqE:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=NipLwLreYRM:EFx6hmqSxqE:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=NipLwLreYRM:EFx6hmqSxqE:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=NipLwLreYRM:EFx6hmqSxqE:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=NipLwLreYRM:EFx6hmqSxqE:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/NipLwLreYRM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 00:49:40 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/moana-series-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"fae1d5357e502be3c08423bfc4b0f34a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn83@2020_3/2020/12/11/08-00-27-171_dad25b888d54a0af.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":26267,"destBytes":15154,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/moana-series-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn83@2020_3/2020/12/11/08-00-27-171_dad25b888d54a0af.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Screen-Shot-2020-12-10-at-7.20.31-PM-700x289.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn71@2020_6/2020/12/11/08-00-51-720_c9295b078141a29a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn76@2020_6/2020/12/11/08-00-52-628_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=NipLwLreYRM:EFx6hmqSxqE:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn59@2020_2/2020/12/11/08-00-51-679_b0fcaad5ca05145d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn75@2020_5/2020/12/11/08-00-52-891_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=NipLwLreYRM:EFx6hmqSxqE:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn79@2020_4/2020/12/11/08-00-51-671_d245b0f0c1334668.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/NipLwLreYRM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn60@2020_5/2020/12/11/08-00-52-835_814bcce27f16f7fe.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1607673616893},{"createdTime":"2020-12-11 16:00:16","updatedTime":"2020-12-11 16:00:16","title":"‘Songbird’ Early Buzz: The First COVID-19 Movie Apparently Wasn’t Worth Shooting During a Pandemic","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=649315","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-643542 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/songbird-trailer-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"Songbird Reviews\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/songbird-trailer-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/songbird-trailer-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/songbird-trailer-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/songbird-trailer.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Before it was even slated for release, the <strong>Michael Bay</strong>-produced, COVID-19-inspired pandemic thriller <strong><em>Songbird</em></strong> was already <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/songbird-covid-protocols/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">stirring up controversy</a>. Apparently during the production, which unfolded in the midst of the pandemic, the crew was ignoring important safety protocols to help control the spread of coronavirus. Was it worth the trouble?

Infected Americans are ripped from their homes and forced into quarantine camps known as Q-Zones, from which there is no escape, as a few brave souls fight back against the forces of oppression. Amid this dystopian landscape, a fearless courier, Nico (KJ Apa), who’s immune to the deadly pathogen, finds hope and love with Sara (Sofia Carson), though her lockdown prohibits them from physical contact. When Sara is believed to have become infected, Nico races desperately across the barren streets of Los Angeles in search of the only thing that can save her from imprisonment …or worse.</p></blockquote>\n<p>A handful of critics have already seen the movie, and the consensus doesn&#8217;t paint much of a positive portrait. Michael O&#8217;Sullivan at <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/goingoutguide/movies/songbird-movie-review/2020/12/08/88c1f9a0-371f-11eb-8d38-6aea1adb3839_story.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>The Washington Post</em></a> called the movie &#8220;deadly dull&#8221; and wrote in his review just one compliment:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I’ll say one other nice thing: The film isn’t terribly long. You’ll keep waiting for the suspense to kick in. Spoiler alert: It never really does, except feebly, after about an hour and 15 minutes. And then, unceremoniously, it’s over.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Yikes. Alonso Duralde at <a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/songbird-film-review-kj-apa-covid-michael-bay/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Wrap</a> doesn&#8217;t have any kind words for the movie either. On top of saying &#8220;there&#8217;s no point&#8221; to the thriller, he also wrote:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;&#8216;Songbird&#8217; doesn’t even offer the prospect of staggeringly bad taste or questionable politics; it’s less “Too soon!” and more “So what?” We’re left with just a standard-issue post-apocalyptic dystopian thriller, albeit one with a massively overqualified cast of actors.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Frank Scheck at <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/songbird-film-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Hollywood Reporter</a> forgives the film&#8217;s low production quality due to the limitations of being produced during the pandemic, but that&#8217;s hardly the biggest problem of the movie. His review said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;It would be churlish to criticize the film&#8217;s low-level production values, since, well, it <em>was</em> filmed during a pandemic. But that doesn&#8217;t prevent one from pointing out the simplistic nature of the script by director Mason and Simon Boyes, which feels as perfunctory as the obviously rushed production schedule must have necessitated. Despite the high-stakes drama, there&#8217;s nary a compelling moment throughout, and some of the characterizations, especially Stormare&#8217;s villainous Sanitation Department honcho, are so absurdly one-note that it&#8217;s hard not to think that the film is meant as parody.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Richard Roeper at <a href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/movies-and-tv/2020/12/10/22165828/songbird-review-pandemic-movie-coronavirus-covid-19-kj-apa-sofia-carson-michael-bay\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>The Chicago Sun-Times</em></a> is a little more kind in his review, but not exactly complimentary, writing:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;If you can set aside the dubious decision to use COVID as a plot point when we’re still in the midst of a pandemic, this is a harmlessly forgettable actioner with the talented cast doing their best to inject some humanity and empathy into an empty-calories plot, with the standard techno-score incessantly pounding away.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>There is one reviewer who seems to be more upbeat about the movie. Benjamin Lee at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/dec/10/songbird-review-hollywoods-first-covid-thriller-is-a-technical-triumph\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Guardian</a> writes that <em>Songbird</em> is an &#8220;acceptably watchable thriller that’s more notable for what it achieves technically than anything else.&#8221; He also wrote:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Despite the many familiar ingredients of Songbird (some of which start to feel musty by the convoluted last act), there’s an undeniable jolt in seeing a glossy thriller rooted in a version of the grim reality we’ve all been facing this year. Taking elements we’ve come to know so well (from the viral terminology we spout daily to the isolated way we now live) and using them to create an even scarier world is, at times, mightily effective, if also a little bit exploitative to some.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>On the opposite end of the spectrum, David Ehrlich at <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/2020/12/songbird-review-1234603497/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">IndieWire</a> gave the the most harsh criticism by saying the movie &#8220;somehow makes COVID even less fun.&#8221; He added:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;It makes all too much sense that the first mainstream American movie shot during and inspired by COVID-19 would insist government-imposed quarantines are worse than any disease and that super-spreaders are hot and cool and ride motorcycles. After all, it’s hard to make a high-octane action spectacle about people practicing personal responsibility despite an unforgivable lack of federal support. But films have a funny way of revealing the truth about the world in which they were made, even when they’re lying through their teeth. And “Songbird,” to its credit, is definitely one of them.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Well, this certainly doesn&#8217;t sound like the kind of thriller that anyone is going to be in the mood for this December when we&#8217;re still dealing with the coronavirus pandemic. In fact, things are worse now than they were earlier in the year, and there&#8217;s no sign of them getting better until we get a vaccine. Maybe it would have been best to let this idea simmer a little longer instead of rushing it out there in an attempt to be the most relevant and topical movie on the scene.</p>\n<p><em>Songbird</em> is slated for a release on premium VOD starting on <strong>December 11, 2020</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/first-songbird-reviews-early-buzz/\">&#8216;Songbird&#8217; Early Buzz: The First COVID-19 Movie Apparently Wasn&#8217;t Worth Shooting During a Pandemic</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=KH96X4L5lmY:9HB24yy-KEo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=KH96X4L5lmY:9HB24yy-KEo:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=KH96X4L5lmY:9HB24yy-KEo:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=KH96X4L5lmY:9HB24yy-KEo:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=KH96X4L5lmY:9HB24yy-KEo:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=KH96X4L5lmY:9HB24yy-KEo:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/KH96X4L5lmY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 01:00:58 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/songbird-trailer-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"a94e61a8ef370f1c0e1510347173c372","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn55@2020_6/2020/12/11/08-00-29-540_0375ec8324c48d6e.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":26684,"destBytes":14246,"author":"Ethan Anderton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/songbird-trailer-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn55@2020_6/2020/12/11/08-00-29-540_0375ec8324c48d6e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn76@2020_6/2020/12/11/08-00-52-628_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=KH96X4L5lmY:9HB24yy-KEo:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn48@2020_3/2020/12/11/08-00-52-820_c6137965ff20f313.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn75@2020_5/2020/12/11/08-00-52-891_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=KH96X4L5lmY:9HB24yy-KEo:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn20@2020_5/2020/12/11/08-00-51-686_c265ad7da68f645a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/KH96X4L5lmY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn36@2020_5/2020/12/11/08-00-52-812_1201cb8f7d11b7a7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1607673616897},{"createdTime":"2020-12-11 16:00:16","updatedTime":"2020-12-11 16:00:16","title":"Christian Bale to Play ‘Thor: Love and Thunder’ Villain Gorr the God Butcher","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=649611","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-649613\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/thor-love-and-thunder-e1607650184701-700x346.jpeg\" alt=\"thor love and thunder villain\" width=\"700\" height=\"346\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/thor-love-and-thunder-e1607650184701-700x346.jpeg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/thor-love-and-thunder-e1607650184701-360x178.jpeg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/thor-love-and-thunder-e1607650184701-768x380.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Christian Bale</strong> has lived long enough to see himself become the villain — and a Marvel villain at that.

But if there&#8217;s anyone who can make it work, it&#8217;s James Gunn and the quirky, cosmic characters of <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>. In fact, he&#8217;s one of the few who genuinely loved the <em>Star Wars Holiday Special</em>, as he wrote on Twitter:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Even seeing this here makes me laugh. One of my favorite stories ever, which I have bugged <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Kevfeige?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Kevfeige</a> endlessly about over the years. I can’t believe we’re actually doing this. And, yes, I unironically loved the Star Wars Holiday Special as a kid. <a href=\"https://t.co/JjymrARoV7\">pic.twitter.com/JjymrARoV7</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; James Gunn (@JamesGunn) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JamesGunn/status/1337203096145936386?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 11, 2020</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>Using the Guardians of the Galaxy in this way might seem cheesy, but it also makes perfect sense. After all, Gamora is green, Groot can easily be decorated as a Christmas tree, and Star-Lord probably has at least a few Christmas songs on the Zune he received at the end of <em>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2</em>. James Gunn has given the <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> movies incredible soundtracks, so we&#8217;re sure he&#8217;ll do the same for their holiday special. And he&#8217;s also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JamesGunn/status/1337204271180222467\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">confirmed that this will be canon</a>.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Disney+ will have a series of short adventures for the little guy known as Baby Groot:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Everyone’s favorite little tree, Baby Groot, will star in a series of shorts on Disney+ featuring several new and unusual characters.</p>\n<p>I Am Groot, an Original Series from Marvel Studios, is coming to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DisneyPlus?src=hash&#38;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DisneyPlus</a>. <a href=\"https://t.co/U5nfDkFKjW\">pic.twitter.com/U5nfDkFKjW</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Marvel Studios (@MarvelStudios) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarvelStudios/status/1337199966784249857?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 11, 2020</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>Disney+ will also have a new short animated series focusing on Baby Groot on a series of different adventures that will feature &#8220;new and unusual characters.&#8221; Could this be based on the <a href=\"https://www.marvel.com/comics/series/23126/i_am_groot_2017\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>I Am Groot</em> comic book</a> series from 2017? Here&#8217;s the synopsis for those comics:</p>\n<blockquote><p>When the Guardians of the Galaxy get caught in a wormhole, a smaller-than-normal Groot is separated billions of light-years away from the team. Falling to a planet below, Groot discovers he is on an entirely alien and unknown world full of strange creatures and societies. Seriously underdeveloped and with nobody who can understand him, Groot will need to make the journey to the center of this world and find the way back to his family!</p></blockquote>\n<p>Yeah, sounds like that could easily be the plot of the series to me. And making it animated allows for a lot of opportunity to explore new, weird worlds without worrying about a huge live-action budget.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/guardians-of-the-galaxy-holiday-special-arrives-in-2022-before-vol-3/\">&#8216;Guardians of the Galaxy&#8217; is Getting a Live-Action Holiday Special in 2022 Before Vol. 3 Arrives in 2023</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=kAfKYV-4u2g:WJncDKpZCtU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=kAfKYV-4u2g:WJncDKpZCtU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=kAfKYV-4u2g:WJncDKpZCtU:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=kAfKYV-4u2g:WJncDKpZCtU:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=kAfKYV-4u2g:WJncDKpZCtU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=kAfKYV-4u2g:WJncDKpZCtU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/kAfKYV-4u2g\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 01:44:52 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/guardiansofthegalaxy-holidayspecial-logo-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"68b2edd2c4435c8e776e961a5ee34240","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn12@2020_4/2020/12/11/08-00-33-470_88bcba527fba2734.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":46208,"destBytes":27752,"author":"Ethan Anderton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/guardiansofthegalaxy-holidayspecial-logo-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn12@2020_4/2020/12/11/08-00-33-470_88bcba527fba2734.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn76@2020_6/2020/12/11/08-00-52-628_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=kAfKYV-4u2g:WJncDKpZCtU:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn31@2020_6/2020/12/11/08-00-52-785_028285981fca8f39.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn75@2020_5/2020/12/11/08-00-52-891_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=kAfKYV-4u2g:WJncDKpZCtU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn83@2020_5/2020/12/11/08-00-51-754_c924ebddf005bc42.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/kAfKYV-4u2g":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn47@2020_5/2020/12/11/08-00-51-647_41ea25782b61da32.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1607673616893},{"createdTime":"2020-12-11 16:00:16","updatedTime":"2020-12-11 16:00:16","title":"‘Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania’ is the Official Title of ‘Ant-Man 3’","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=649584","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ant-man-3-title.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-649599\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ant-man-3-title-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"ant-man 3 title\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ant-man-3-title-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ant-man-3-title-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ant-man-3-title-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ant-man-3-title.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>We now have an official title of <strong><em>Ant-Man 3</em></strong>, and it&#8217;s a mouthful: <strong><em>Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania</em></strong>. I almost feel like it should have an exclamation point at the end, like the reader has to shout &#8220;Quantumania!&#8221;, but that&#8217;s me. <strong>Peyton Reed</strong> is back in the director&#8217;s chair, and <strong>Paul Rudd</strong>, <strong>Evangeline Lilly</strong>, <strong>Michael Douglas</strong>, and <strong>Michele Pfeiffer</strong> are all back as well. Newcomers to the franchise include <strong>Kathryn Newto</strong>n, playing Ant-Man&#8217;s re-cast daughter Cassie, and <strong>Jonathan Majors</strong> as Kang the Conqueror.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-649584\"></span></p>\n<p>Ready for some <em>Quanumania</em>? You better be, because that&#8217;s the title of <em>Ant-Man 3 </em>– <em>Ant-Man 3: Quantumania</em>. Today at the Disney Investor Day presentation, Marvel Studios head honcho Kevin Feige confirmed something <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/ant-man-3-villain/\">previously reported</a>: Jonathan Majors is playing Kang the Conqueror. In the comics, Kang is a 30th-century scholar named Nathaniel Richards. He’s also a possible descendant of Reed Richards, AKA Mr. Fantastic of <em>The Fantastic Four</em>, and since Marvel <em>also</em> announced a new <em>Fantastic 4</em> movie today, that might end up being relevant.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, another newcomer is Kathryn Newton, who can currently be seen in <em>Freaky</em>. She&#8217;ll be playing Cassie Lang, daughter of Scott Lang, AKA Ant-Man. Let&#8217;s just saw that she takes after her father in the comics and engages in her own super-heroics.</p>\n<p>Paul Rudd is, of course, back as well, with Evangeline Lilly also returning as Hope van Dyne/Wasp; Michael Douglas as Hank Pym; and Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet van Dyne. And while he wasn&#8217;t part of the announcement, we have to hope and assume the best <em>Ant-Man</em> character, Michael Peña&#8217;s Luis, will be back as well.</p>\n<p>Plot details are non-existent at the moment, but based on the title, the Quantum Realm will play a big part, as it has in the previous two <em>Ant-Man</em> films. There&#8217;s no release date just yet, but I&#8217;m sure Marvel will get around to announcing that sooner or later.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/ant-man-3-title/\">&#8216;Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania&#8217; is the Official Title of &#8216;Ant-Man 3&#8217;</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=OCvWI4CCXGA:3s23NW2fRSs:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=OCvWI4CCXGA:3s23NW2fRSs:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=OCvWI4CCXGA:3s23NW2fRSs:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=OCvWI4CCXGA:3s23NW2fRSs:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=OCvWI4CCXGA:3s23NW2fRSs:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=OCvWI4CCXGA:3s23NW2fRSs:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/OCvWI4CCXGA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 01:32:05 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ant-man-3-title-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"40a055ad2be9e7c9f060f07de922dd0d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn80@2020_3/2020/12/11/08-00-25-248_2760c1e08003e227.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":21482,"destBytes":14804,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ant-man-3-title-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn80@2020_3/2020/12/11/08-00-25-248_2760c1e08003e227.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn76@2020_6/2020/12/11/08-00-52-628_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=OCvWI4CCXGA:3s23NW2fRSs:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn93@2020_2/2020/12/11/08-00-52-728_cf8ff5848e818d91.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn75@2020_5/2020/12/11/08-00-52-891_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=OCvWI4CCXGA:3s23NW2fRSs:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn63@2020_4/2020/12/11/08-00-51-677_590022dc26287890.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/OCvWI4CCXGA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn38@2020_6/2020/12/11/08-00-51-682_061424130d361ffb.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1607673616896},{"createdTime":"2020-12-11 16:00:16","updatedTime":"2020-12-11 16:00:16","title":"‘The Falcon and the Winter Soldier’ Trailer Revealed, Series Debuts in March 2021","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=649540","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-649558 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Falcon-and-the-Winter-Soldier-trailer-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"The Falcon and the Winter Soldier trailer\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Falcon-and-the-Winter-Soldier-trailer.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Falcon-and-the-Winter-Soldier-trailer-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Once upon a time, <strong><em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em></strong> was set to be the first ever live-action Marvel Studios TV series.

She was the relatable teen superhero next door that people were craving since Peter Parker grew up, in addition to being the first Muslim superhero to headline her own Marvel comic. It was no wonder that her screen debut was eagerly anticipated by Marvel fans and creators alike, who speak about the process of bringing Kamala Khan to her own Disney+ series with this <em>Ms. Marvel</em> sizzle reel, which debuted at the Disney Investors conference.</p>\n<p>The first footage from the Disney+ series can be seen in flashes at the end of the sizzle reel, teasing the character&#8217;s normal teen life and idolatry of the Avengers, particularly Captain Marvel (Brie Larson). And she&#8217;ll get to meet her hero sooner than later. It was confirmed during the conference that <em>Captain Marvel 2</em> will feature both Vellani&#8217;s Ms. Marvel and Parris&#8217; Monica Rambeau. The two are being introduced in Disney+ shows before their big screen debut, in <em>Ms. Marvel</em> and <em>WandaVision</em>, respectively.</p>\n<p><em>Captain Marvel 2</em> is scheduled to be released on <strong>July 8, 2022</strong>, but before Kamala Khan makes her big screen debut, you can see her in <em>Ms. Marvel</em>, coming to Disney+ in late <strong>2021.</strong></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/ms-marvel-first-look-captain-marvel-2/\">&#8216;Ms. Marvel&#8217; First Look Teases New Disney+ Series, Character Confirmed to Appear in &#8216;Captain Marvel 2&#8217;</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=f97r3FkpNf0:JPrMPR9dw_U:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=f97r3FkpNf0:JPrMPR9dw_U:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=f97r3FkpNf0:JPrMPR9dw_U:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=f97r3FkpNf0:JPrMPR9dw_U:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=f97r3FkpNf0:JPrMPR9dw_U:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=f97r3FkpNf0:JPrMPR9dw_U:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/f97r3FkpNf0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 01:40:48 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ms.-marvel-2-e1607649092469-700x317.jpg","linkMd5":"a8d40b07f56b46be4d0388e3260251d3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn35@2020_5/2020/12/11/08-00-35-821_d145f1518a504cbd.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":317,"sourceBytes":16573,"destBytes":7608,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/ms.-marvel-2-e1607649092469-700x317.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn35@2020_5/2020/12/11/08-00-35-821_d145f1518a504cbd.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn76@2020_6/2020/12/11/08-00-52-628_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=f97r3FkpNf0:JPrMPR9dw_U:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn28@2020_4/2020/12/11/08-00-51-642_19caab6ce6a1294e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn75@2020_5/2020/12/11/08-00-52-891_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=f97r3FkpNf0:JPrMPR9dw_U:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn91@2020_2/2020/12/11/08-00-52-719_5829825213144533.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/f97r3FkpNf0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn100@2020_6/2020/12/11/08-00-51-570_a4971882b6b9b511.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1607673616898},{"createdTime":"2020-12-11 16:00:16","updatedTime":"2020-12-11 16:00:16","title":"Marvel Announces ‘Secret Invasion’, ‘Ironheart’, ‘Armor Wars’, and More Marvel Shows Coming to Disney+","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=649590","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-649615\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Secret-Invasion-logo-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Secret Invasion logo\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Secret-Invasion-logo.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Secret-Invasion-logo-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>During the Disney investor presentation this evening, Marvel Studios head <strong>Kevin Feige</strong> dropped a metric ton of news about Marvel&#8217;s upcoming plans.

have been done dirty on the big screen not once, not twice, but <em>three </em>times. Four times if you include the infamously never-released film from the &#8217;90s. However, Marvel Studios is looking to polish this gem of a superhero team with a new take set firmly within the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Fifth time&#8217;s the charm, as Marvel Studios&#8217; Kevin Feige announced during Disney&#8217;s Investors Day presentation that <em>Spider-Man: Homecoming</em> and <em>Spider-Man: Far From Home</em> director <strong>Jon Watts</strong> will direct the new <em>Fantastic Four</em> movie.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-649582\"></span></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Jon Watts will direct the new feature film for Marvel&#39;s First Family, Fantastic Four! <a href=\"https://t.co/Eu26ghxbGT\">pic.twitter.com/Eu26ghxbGT</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Marvel Studios (@MarvelStudios) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarvelStudios/status/1337200479063994368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 11, 2020</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, the Fantastic Four are a found family of misfits who gain super-powers after an expedition into space goes terribly wrong. There&#8217;s the super-genius Reed Richards, who gains the ability to stretch to impossible proportions and becomes Mr. Fantastic. There&#8217;s Sue Storm, who can turn invisible and create force fields, and becomes the Invisible Woman. Her hot-headed brother Johnny Storm becomes the Human Torch, who can take flight and become empowered with flame. And there&#8217;s Reed&#8217;s old buddy Ben Grimm, a blue collar pilot who gains super-strength and skin of stone, transforming him into the Thing.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a motley crew, but that&#8217;s the point. They&#8217;re a family unit with disparate powers who act as scientists and adventurers as often as they are traditional superheroes. Their best stories are high-concept science fiction tales powered by heart and humor. All of that was missing in the previous film adaptations, and knowing how much humor and pathos Watts brought to his Spidey movies, he seems like a solid fit for the material.</p>\n<p>So, how do the Fantastic Four, the &#8220;first&#8221; family in the Marvel comics, fit into an MCU that is over a decade into its storytelling? We shall see. But I have a good feeling about this one.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/new-fantastic-four-movie/\">Marvel Studios Confirms &#8216;Fantastic 4&#8217; Movie Coming From &#8216;Spider-Man: Far From Home&#8217; Director Jon Watts</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=_0MKQP8paTU:7BXZ1IICJ_w:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=_0MKQP8paTU:7BXZ1IICJ_w:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=_0MKQP8paTU:7BXZ1IICJ_w:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=_0MKQP8paTU:7BXZ1IICJ_w:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=_0MKQP8paTU:7BXZ1IICJ_w:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=_0MKQP8paTU:7BXZ1IICJ_w:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/_0MKQP8paTU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 01:24:50 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/New-Fantastic-Four-Movie-700x299.jpg","linkMd5":"ec99cab7bc2cf034a7a711aa06e7e168","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn47@2020_5/2020/12/11/08-00-39-414_5bd2c24031784f0c.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":299,"sourceBytes":12426,"destBytes":6360,"author":"Jacob Hall","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/New-Fantastic-Four-Movie-700x299.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn47@2020_5/2020/12/11/08-00-39-414_5bd2c24031784f0c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn76@2020_6/2020/12/11/08-00-52-628_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=_0MKQP8paTU:7BXZ1IICJ_w:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn36@2020_4/2020/12/11/08-00-51-705_f50e032df5fdfa56.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn75@2020_5/2020/12/11/08-00-52-891_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=_0MKQP8paTU:7BXZ1IICJ_w:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn36@2020_3/2020/12/11/08-00-51-743_71bea9227484baff.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/_0MKQP8paTU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn31@2020_4/2020/12/11/08-00-51-648_63b4287f7e4fe99f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1607673616876},{"createdTime":"2020-12-11 16:00:16","updatedTime":"2020-12-11 16:00:16","title":"‘Shogun’: FX Series Retelling of James Clavell’s Novel Will Be ‘Game of Thrones’ in Feudal Japan","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=649490","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-649493\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/shogun-e1607644488990-700x336.jpeg\" alt=\"shogun series\" width=\"700\" height=\"336\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/shogun-e1607644488990-700x336.jpeg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/shogun-e1607644488990-360x173.jpeg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/shogun-e1607644488990-768x369.jpeg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/shogun-e1607644488990.jpeg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>FX is developing the scripted series <strong><em>Shogun</em></strong>, a retelling of <strong>James Clavell</strong>&#8216;s bestselling novel, which is being billed as <em>Game of Thrones</em> in feudal Japan. <em>Boardwalk Empire</em> producer and <em>Thrones</em> director <strong>Tim Van Patten</strong> is set to produce the series.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-649490\"></span></p>\n<p>At the Disney Investors conference, FX announced that it is developing a retelling of <em>Shogun</em> from <em>Counterpart</em> creator <strong>Justin Marks</strong> and his wife Rachel Kondo, who will act as supervising producer. The duo are teaming up with Tim Van Patten to adapt Clavell&#8217;s <em>Shogun</em>, which follows marooned Englishman John Blackthorne as he is thrust into 17th century Japan, and must negotiate the foreign culture and customs.</p>\n<p>Marks, who wrote the Disney live-action <em>Jungle Book</em>, penned the first two episodes of the new retelling of <em>Shogun</em> and heads a writing team that also includes co-executive producer Shannon Goss, consulting producer Matt Lambert, script editor Maegan Houang and staff writer Emily Yoshida. FX had been employing cultural consultants to help with the scripts, according to Deadline.</p>\n<p>The series has been in development at FX for quite some time, and was even deep into pre-production last year, before FX put the limited series on hold. Marks was brought on as writer and executive producer in January 2020 with a targeted production start date in Japan in the summer, but then the pandemic hit.

As internal political strife and a clash of cultures lead to seemingly inevitable conflict, Blackthorne&#8217;s loyalty and strength of character are tested by both passion and loss, and he is torn between two worlds that will each be forever changed.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/shogun-series-fx/\">&#8216;Shogun&#8217;: FX Series Retelling of James Clavell&#8217;s Novel Will Be &#8216;Game of Thrones&#8217; in Feudal Japan</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=7zviUhRE_NA:HQutuoyIIIw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=7zviUhRE_NA:HQutuoyIIIw:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=7zviUhRE_NA:HQutuoyIIIw:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=7zviUhRE_NA:HQutuoyIIIw:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=7zviUhRE_NA:HQutuoyIIIw:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=7zviUhRE_NA:HQutuoyIIIw:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/7zviUhRE_NA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 00:10:42 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/shogun-e1607644488990-700x336.jpeg","linkMd5":"a9be55d0c92c4a16b5f7f612daaf8916","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn23@2020_2/2020/12/11/08-00-17-170_d642d434acae8b62.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":336,"sourceBytes":16224,"destBytes":9114,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/shogun-e1607644488990-700x336.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn23@2020_2/2020/12/11/08-00-17-170_d642d434acae8b62.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn76@2020_6/2020/12/11/08-00-52-628_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=7zviUhRE_NA:HQutuoyIIIw:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn11@2020_1/2020/12/11/08-00-51-710_c0796d9cf9884fe1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn75@2020_5/2020/12/11/08-00-52-891_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=7zviUhRE_NA:HQutuoyIIIw:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn15@2020_5/2020/12/11/08-00-52-781_5aac4181985561bc.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/7zviUhRE_NA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn96@2020_5/2020/12/11/08-00-51-650_5e456c180ba1b712.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1607673616877}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-12-11 16:00:16","updatedTime":"2020-12-11 16:00:16","feedId":21,"fetchDate":"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 08:00:16 +0000","fetchMs":147,"handleMs":801,"totalMs":38182,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":20,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"0ee86a5c743ee2ecbe52c7cbbd91eaa1","hostName":"europe63*","requestId":"44c6f352ffb14a6ea50871a8b7cc48ab_21","contentType":"text/xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":438202,"bgimgsTotal":20,"bgimgsGithubTotal":20,"articlesImgsTotal":85,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":85,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx8":2,"myreaderx14":2,"myreaderx15":4,"myreaderx7":2,"myreaderx6":3,"myreaderx16":4,"myreaderx10":3,"myreaderx32":2,"myreaderx4":2,"myreaderx3":4,"myreaderx33":3,"myreaderx11":3,"myreaderx2":3,"myreaderx12":3,"myreaderx13":3,"myreaderx1":4,"myreaderx30":2,"myreaderx31":3,"myreaderx18":3,"myreaderx19":4,"myreaderx":3,"myreaderx25":3,"myreaderx27":3,"myreaderx21":3,"myreaderx22":2,"myreaderx23":2,"myreaderx24":3,"myreaderx5oss":3,"myreaderx29":4},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-05-30 17:21:38","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 09:23:23","id":21,"name":"/Film","url":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/slashfilm","subscriber":null,"website":null,"icon":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/cropped-ZZ46A5EC75-32x32.jpg","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx64/cdn36@2020_2/2020/09/01/01-23-09-121_cba84478f5ca776d.jpg","description":"Movie News and Reviews This feed is for non commercial use.
