Since then, his studio’s work has gained a lot of recognition for their exploratory, imaginative approach towards materials and design processes in lighting design and luxury interiors. Arjun works to create single pieces made together with craftsmen as well as mass produced objects developed with manufacturers – the full spectrum. That said, the studio has no particular style but follows their instincts and their ethos of “light, form(s), emotion”.&nbsp;</em><em>With a belief that lighting can have a strong emotional and transformational impact on spaces, Arjun’s studio has executed intricate and extensive lighting installations at The Lodha World Towers, India’s tallest residential building, and The Lodhi Hotel in Delhi. The studio is currently working on India’s largest lighting installation for a commercial banquet space in Kolkatta, as well as other projects for various luxury residences. Arjun Rathi Design is due to open a retail setup in London in 2021 with retail tie-ups already all across major Indian cities.</em></p> \n<p><em>Today Arjun joins us with some of his favorite things and a few pieces of his own work for <a href=\"https://design-milk.com/column/friday-five/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Friday Five</a>!</em></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=445368\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-445368\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-445368\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/F5-Arjun-Rathi-Nepal-North-East-India-Mountains-810x608.jpg\" alt=\"mountains\" width=\"810\" height=\"608\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/F5-Arjun-Rathi-Nepal-North-East-India-Mountains-810x608.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/F5-Arjun-Rathi-Nepal-North-East-India-Mountains-800x600.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/F5-Arjun-Rathi-Nepal-North-East-India-Mountains-768x576.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/F5-Arjun-Rathi-Nepal-North-East-India-Mountains.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p> \n<p><strong>1. Nepal and North East India Mountains</strong><br /> Travel to hills and spending time alone or with few close friends in the mountains has always been my escape. Solo treks and foraging in nature for relaxation and inspiration is something that I plan every year. The food, culture and scenery of the Himalayas, meditating while staring at the ice-capped peaks in North East India and Nepal is one of the most relaxing experiences for me.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=445364\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-445364\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-445364\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/F5-Arjun-Rathi-Graphic-Novel-810x1080.jpg\" alt=\"graphic novel\" width=\"810\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/F5-Arjun-Rathi-Graphic-Novel-810x1080.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/F5-Arjun-Rathi-Graphic-Novel-800x1067.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/F5-Arjun-Rathi-Graphic-Novel-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/F5-Arjun-Rathi-Graphic-Novel-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/F5-Arjun-Rathi-Graphic-Novel.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p> \n<p><strong>2. Graphic Novels</strong><br /> Graphic novels are one of my biggest sources of inspiration. Graphic novelists imagine spaces and cities in imaginary ways which formally trained designers can seldom do. Mister X, written by Dean Motter and illustrated Paul Rivoche, is one of my biggest influences. The graphic novel is set in Radiant City, an imagined dystopian city influenced by Bauhaus and Fritz Lang’s Metropolis. His radical theories of “psyche-tecture” cause the citizenry to go mad, and he takes on the mission to repair his creation. Asterios Polyp, by architect David Mazzucchelli, is a great take on life, design and work ethic. Something that I strongly related to.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=445362\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-445362\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-445362\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/F5-Arjun-Rathi-Bootcamps-810x608.jpg\" alt=\"group of people standing outdoors\" width=\"810\" height=\"608\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/F5-Arjun-Rathi-Bootcamps-810x608.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/F5-Arjun-Rathi-Bootcamps-800x600.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/F5-Arjun-Rathi-Bootcamps-768x576.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/F5-Arjun-Rathi-Bootcamps.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p> \n<p><strong>3. Cycling and Bootcamps</strong><br /> My general love for food is always at loggerheads with my fitness goals. I try to set goals through my long cycling sessions and local Bootcamp classes. An old professor of mine in Switzerland once told me, “If you don’t take care of your health and fitness, you will not have the strength to become famous.”</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=445363\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-445363\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-445363\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/F5-Arjun-Rathi-Film-Photography-810x804.jpg\" alt=\"fisheye lens photo of cherries\" width=\"810\" height=\"804\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/F5-Arjun-Rathi-Film-Photography-810x804.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/F5-Arjun-Rathi-Film-Photography-800x794.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/F5-Arjun-Rathi-Film-Photography-100x100.jpg 100w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/F5-Arjun-Rathi-Film-Photography-768x763.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/F5-Arjun-Rathi-Film-Photography.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p> \n<p><strong>4. Film Photography</strong><br /> Shooting with film and self-developing has always been a passion. Using the camera as a tool to tell stories was something I used extensively in my early work. I always feel blurry pictures tell a lot more about the situation you are documenting and the energy. Also, developing black and white rolls using non-standard processes like black coffee, orange juice, etc., result in a very different output which is exciting.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=445371\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-445371\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-445371\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/F5-Arjun-Rathi-Vipassana-Meditation-810x608.jpg\" alt=\"temple\" width=\"810\" height=\"608\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/F5-Arjun-Rathi-Vipassana-Meditation-810x608.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/F5-Arjun-Rathi-Vipassana-Meditation-800x600.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/F5-Arjun-Rathi-Vipassana-Meditation-768x576.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/F5-Arjun-Rathi-Vipassana-Meditation.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p> \n<p><strong>5. Vipassana Meditation</strong><br /> The ten day meditation course after my college graduation was one of the most impactful experiences of my life. The Buddhist term for meditation literally translates to “insight” and is taught in the original way since the times of Buddha. The meditation teaches controlled breathwork, which is great to relax from the daily stresses of work and life.</p> \n<p><em><strong>Work by Arjun Rathi:</strong></em></p> \n<div

Curiosities\" /></a></p> \n<p>Twin brothers Dan and Dave Buck’s interest in playing cards began at an early age, when they practiced card tricks and pioneered the art of <a href=\"https://www.artofplay.com/blogs/articles/kings-of-cardistry\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">cardistry</a>. In 2013, they founded <a href=\"http://bit.ly/3cieuGO\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Art of Play</a> as a boutique store for designer playing cards. As students of design and architecture they both appreciate quality and details, but also understand how quickly products can become expensive and feel out of reach. Playing cards allow Dan and Dave to create a luxury product that people can afford. All of Art of Play’s playing cards are produced in the United States, utilizing paper from sustainable forests and vegetable-based inks – a win for Mother Earth and your bottom dollar. You might also notice how their tuck box packaging jumps off the shelf, that’s thanks to the use of vintage letterpress machines. Art of Play even hand-assembles each of their decks in San Diego, California. Dan and Dave’s background in sleight of hand, magic and illusion made the brand’s expansion into puzzles and games a natural evolution.

My obsession with anything quintessentially Japanese continues with the discovery of Morioka Shoten, a bookstore in Ginza, Tokyo that sells only one book. Each week, Yoshiyuki Morioka – who considers books to be art – selects a single book to share with customers, a hyper-focused curated retail experience. The space also serves as a meeting place for the community (in non-COVID times) with live events and an art gallery.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=445152\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-445152\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-445152\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/bjooks-810x540.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"810\" height=\"540\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/bjooks-810x540.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/bjooks-800x534.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/bjooks-768x512.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/bjooks.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p> \n<p>4.

Boucle fabrics, hand woven rugs, felt folded cushions, chunky weaves and wallpaper add even more tactility to the home and help to create a luxe yet comfortable environment.</p> \n<p><a

One is a look back at how we ate in 2020, and the other a look into the future of how we can eat again together in the future.</p> \n<div id=\"attachment_445404\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n <a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=445404\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-445404\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-445404\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/Corona-Food-Habits–hej-studio-1-SOURDOUGH-810x1080.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"810\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/Corona-Food-Habits–hej-studio-1-SOURDOUGH-810x1080.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/Corona-Food-Habits–hej-studio-1-SOURDOUGH-800x1067.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/Corona-Food-Habits–hej-studio-1-SOURDOUGH-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/Corona-Food-Habits–hej-studio-1-SOURDOUGH-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/Corona-Food-Habits–hej-studio-1-SOURDOUGH.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a>\n <p class=\"wp-caption-text\">SOURDOUGH \\\\\\ CORONA FOOD HABITS \\\\\\ Photo: Angela Lamprecht</p>\n</div> \n<p>First, is the observational photo series conceived by <a href=\"https://www.hejstudio.at/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">hej studios’</a> Creative Director, Brini Fetz and brand strategist <a href=\"https://lisalangmantel.at/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Lisa Langmantel</a>, captured by Austrian-based photographer <a href=\"https://lamprecht.biz/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Angela Lamprecht</a>.

<em>A Bigger Splash</em>, 1967</p>\n</div> \n<p>The second project we wanted to showcase is actually Pinch’s Pool Party. Inspired by David Hockney’s <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-david-hockneys-pool-paintings-making-splash\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">iconic pool paintings</a>, our latest food furniture design was developed to make future party-goers feel safe by offering individualized portions, but presented with a splash of POP. Thus, the pool is adorned with 80s square white tiles and fun vibrant accents of yellow and blue. At Pinch, we love solving party problems, and so re-imagining how grab-and-go “buffets” could remain COVID-friendly while offering an interactive component for the guest was very important to us. In this instance, food is warmed via a sous-vide wand hidden in the diving board, keeping the floating glass jars of goodness at the perfect temperature. Two of our favorite jar menus for this interaction are a faux risotto with Arborio rice, maitake mushrooms, mushroom demi-glace, egg yolk and parmesan butter. The other a zucchini bolognese, with roasted tomato, cavatelli and mirepoix. Guests select their jar, shake to emulsify + enjoy, without ever coming in contact with another party-goer’s plate.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=445416\" rel=\"attachment

href=\"http://www.microclimat.ca/fr/projets/52/maison-berri\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Berri House</a> is a minimal residence located in Montréal, Canada, designed by <a href=\"http://www.microclimat.ca/fr/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Architecture Microclimat</a>. The challenge was to optimize the maximum capacity of the site in order to welcome a contemporary building that would respectfully integrate with the rest of the neighborhood.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=444602\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-444602\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-444602\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/berrihouse_architecturemicroclimat_3-810x568.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"810\" height=\"568\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/berrihouse_architecturemicroclimat_3-810x568.jpeg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/berrihouse_architecturemicroclimat_3-800x561.jpeg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/berrihouse_architecturemicroclimat_3-768x539.jpeg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/berrihouse_architecturemicroclimat_3.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p> \n<p>The new building would include two above ground floors as well as a mezzanine and partial basement. The response was to move the living area, kitchen and dining room to the upper level, in part, to attract more natural light.</p> \n<p>While the composition of the facades assumes a contemporary language, the architects state that,”it is reminiscent of the more traditional aspects of Montreal’s patrimonial architecture. The horizontal bands of stone that both break and unite the facade, the stone lintel above the windows, and the rows of vertical brick at the top all enrich the building’s composition. A monochrome application of lighter shades of beige and grey offers a softer touch.”</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=444590\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-444590\"

/></a></p> \n<p>We know, we know – you’re probably keenly aware that the past year has been, well, different. While we could start counting off the ways the COVID-19 pandemic has changed society, potentially forever, we’re going to cut to the chase. Over the past 12 months, the general population has spent more time at home than ever before in our lifetimes. In the interior design world, that single pandemic-induced behavioral change is dramatically impacting the industry. More specifically, it’s created a laser focus on <a href=\"https://shop.design-milk.com/collections/wellness\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"exclude\">wellness</a> and sustainability.</p> \n<p>In March 2020, before we had any idea just how long we’d be in lockdown, everything froze. People froze their assets, their social lives, their <a href=\"https://shop.design-milk.com/collections/office-tech\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"exclude\">office</a> lives – really, just anything and everything stopped. And that included design businesses.</p> \n<div id=\"attachment_445549\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n <a href=\"https://sweeten.com/referral/?referral_code=LUCYSPENCE47\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-445549 external noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-445549 size-large\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/04/Wellness-Sustainability-Renovations-4-Courtesy-Sweeten-810x540.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"810\" height=\"540\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/04/Wellness-Sustainability-Renovations-4-Courtesy-Sweeten-810x540.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/04/Wellness-Sustainability-Renovations-4-Courtesy-Sweeten-800x534.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/04/Wellness-Sustainability-Renovations-4-Courtesy-Sweeten-768x512.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/04/Wellness-Sustainability-Renovations-4-Courtesy-Sweeten.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a>\n <p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Courtesy of Sweeten</p>\n</div> \n<p>“At the beginning of the pandemic with the stay-at-home orders, we saw a dramatic decrease in business,” says Tisha Leung, editor at home renovation company <a href=\"https://sweeten.com/referral/?referral_code=DESIGNMILK\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Sweeten</a>, a service that connects homeowners and contractors. “We are an online platform that facilitates an offline transaction, and so when general contractors were not able to actually be in spaces to renovate, they were dramatically impacted.”</p> \n<p>But when the dust settled and people realized we’d be in this – this being not only the pandemic, but literally our homes – for the long haul, perspectives changed, and actions were taken. Namely, people took note of their immediate surroundings and went to work improving them.</p> \n<div id=\"attachment_445551\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n <a href=\"https://design-milk.com/how-the-pandemic-has-us-rethinking-wellness-and-sustainability-at-home/wellness-sustainability-renovations-6-photo-lea-jacobson-courtesy-of-renvation-angel/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-445551\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-445551 size-large\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/04/Wellness-Sustainability-Renovations-6-Photo-Lea-Jacobson-Courtesy-of-Renvation-Angel-810x540.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"810\" height=\"540\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/04/Wellness-Sustainability-Renovations-6-Photo-Lea-Jacobson-Courtesy-of-Renvation-Angel-810x540.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/04/Wellness-Sustainability-Renovations-6-Photo-Lea-Jacobson-Courtesy-of-Renvation-Angel-800x533.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/04/Wellness-Sustainability-Renovations-6-Photo-Lea-Jacobson-Courtesy-of-Renvation-Angel-768x512.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/04/Wellness-Sustainability-Renovations-6-Photo-Lea-Jacobson-Courtesy-of-Renvation-Angel.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a>\n <p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Renovation Angel \\\\\\ Photo: Lea Jacobson</p>\n</div> \n<p>Renovating in the wake of a major crisis isn’t a new phenomenon. “What happened after 9/11 was cocooning. People were trying to get out of the city, and they were buying homes, figuring how to telecommute, which started to become possible then, and really focusing on their spaces,” says Steve Feldman, founder of <a href=\"https://renovationangel.com/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\">Renovation Angel</a>, a non-profit that recycles luxury <a href=\"https://shop.design-milk.com/collections/kitchen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"exclude\">kitchens</a>. “That was when the kitchen industry really started to gain steam. Everybody wanted stone countertops, custom cabinetry, nicer stainless appliances and nicer finishes.”</p> \n<p>The same effect is happening during the pandemic. Rather than spending money on travel, shopping or <a href=\"https://shop.design-milk.com/collections/dining\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"exclude\">dining</a> out, people are investing in home renovations – particularly in high-quality ones that impart a sense of wellness into their lives. As it pertains to the home, wellness is traditionally found in the creation of sanctuary-like spaces, often in bedrooms or bathrooms. But during the pandemic, renovators are taking the concept of wellness even further.</p> \n<div id=\"attachment_445550\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n <a href=\"https://www.revelwoods.com/?ref=DesignMilk\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-445550 external noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-445550 size-large\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/04/Wellness-Sustainability-Renovations-5-Stephen-Reardon-Photography-Courtesy-Revel-Woods-810x540.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"810\" height=\"540\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/04/Wellness-Sustainability-Renovations-5-Stephen-Reardon-Photography-Courtesy-Revel-Woods-810x540.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/04/Wellness-Sustainability-Renovations-5-Stephen-Reardon-Photography-Courtesy-Revel-Woods-800x533.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/04/Wellness-Sustainability-Renovations-5-Stephen-Reardon-Photography-Courtesy-Revel-Woods-768x512.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/04/Wellness-Sustainability-Renovations-5-Stephen-Reardon-Photography-Courtesy-Revel-Woods.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a>\n <p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Revel Woods \\\\\\ Photo: Stephen Reardon Photography</p>\n</div> \n<p>“There are studies that say surrounding yourself in nature creates a calming effect,” says John Dupra, co-founder of flooring company <a href=\"https://www.revelwoods.com?ref=DesignMilk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Revel Woods</a>**. “And there are some studies that show that in having natural products in your home, in indoor spaces, some of that still translates. It can reduce stress levels.”</p> \n<p>That’s one of the reasons why Dupra has seen such an increase in demand for natural wood flooring over the past year. “We just can’t meet the demand. It’s unbelievable,” he says.</p> \n<p>But people aren’t only installing wood floors for their aesthetic. “I would say that this demand for authentic materials and is not just because of physical health benefits or mental health benefits, but also its environmental benefits,” says Dupra. “It’s actually a carbon-negative building product, not just carbon-neutral.”</p> \n<p>Beyond incorporating natural materials into their spaces, homeowners are also finding a sense of wellness in creating efficient and effective organization systems – something that’s crucial as rooms become multi-purpose to accommodate <a href=\"https://shop.design-milk.com/collections/work-from-home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"exclude\">work-from-home</a> and learn-from-home culture.</p> \n<p>“In L.A., we’re remodeling a lot of ADUs [accessory dwelling units], where people are turning their garage into a <a href=\"https://shop.design-milk.com/collections/work-from-home\" data-wpel-link=\"exclude\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">home office</a> that is also a studio apartment that could be rented when they go back to the office,” says Leung. “We’re seeing attics turn into places for children.

BOXI is a direct-to-consumer cabinetry company designed to help take the stress out of big home renovation projects – and lower costs as compared to traditional custom cabinetry.</p> \n<p>Even though consumers are willing to spend on high-quality, modern renovations these days, they’re still quite conscious of budget, particularly as the economy is less-than-stellar right now. “There’s something that happens when you go through something like the Great Depression, or, in this case, the COVID-19 pandemic,” says Dupra. “It rewires your brain a little bit, and you don’t approach things the exact same way ever again.”</p> \n<p>In the current day, that translates to consumers focusing on the intersection of affordable yet high-quality options for home renovations. “There’s a home movement around green renovating, repurposing, and architectural salvage,” says Leung. “It’s a trick to save so much money.”</p> \n<p>That’s where Feldman’s Renovation Angel comes in. The company takes gently used high-end kitchens that are slated for demolition or dumping (their former owners get to claim a pretty hefty tax write-off for donating), then sells them at a friendlier price point to homeowners who might not otherwise have been able to afford custom kitchen pieces and top-of-the-line appliances. In doing so, the 16-year-old company has saved 43 million pounds of waste from entering landfills, allowing customers to feel extra good about their purchase.</p> \n<p>These kinds of home trends, both in wellness and sustainability, aren’t likely just a pandemic fad. There’s a good chance they’re here for the foreseeable future.</p> \n<p>“I can see that buying trends are gravitating towards higher quality, longer-lasting, more sustainable materials,” says Dupra. “People are no longer seeing their house as a place to crash and keep their stuff. They’re seeing it as an extension of themselves.

That same graceful aesthetic informs the selection of products at her shop, like <a href=\"https://www.domainbylaurahodgesstudio.com/s/search?q=%22Heather%20Kirtland%22\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\">paintings by Maryland Institute College of Art graduate Heather Kirtland</a>, <a href=\"https://www.domainbylaurahodgesstudio.com/product/12-inch-Large-Opal-Gray-Geo-Round-Basket/1355\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\">handmade Ugandan baskets</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://www.domainbylaurahodgesstudio.com/product/Lavender-Lemongrass-Body-Butter-by-Earth-Elements/792\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\">Earth Elements bath products</a>; her favorite products at the shop, she says, are the jewelry, like <a href=\"https://www.domainbylaurahodgesstudio.com/product/Citrine-Drops-by-Wild-Sol-Jewelry/670\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\">citrine drop earrings by Wild Sol</a> and <a href=\"https://www.domainbylaurahodgesstudio.com/product/Custom-Leather-Earrings-by-Lenehan-Studios/554\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\">handmade leather earrings by Deanne Lenehan</a>.</p> \n<p>Here, we speak to Hodges about the city that finds most inspiration (spoiler: it’s Paris) and the vacation the British-born designer will take once international travel is again a good idea: “We actually had a trip for my family last summer to go to England to show my kids where I grew up, and hopefully we’ll do that sometime soon.” She also discusses the space in our homes that are most primed for a new style: “I’m really excited for home gyms because they’re usually that space that people kind of don’t really get too excited about,” she says. “We’re hoping to make sure that this year we can make them really usable —&nbsp;and then people actually want to use them. I’m really excited to bring in some more, really cool design elements and make them more interesting.”</p> \n<p>Take a peek inside <a href=\"https://www.laurahodgesstudio.com/baltimore-residence\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">this Baltimore Loft project</a> by Laura Hodges Studio:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=445294\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-445294\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-445294\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/laura-hodges-studio-baltimore-loft-3-810x540.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"810\" height=\"540\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/laura-hodges-studio-baltimore-loft-3-810x540.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/laura-hodges-studio-baltimore-loft-3-800x533.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/laura-hodges-studio-baltimore-loft-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/laura-hodges-studio-baltimore-loft-3.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=445295\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-445295\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-445295\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/laura-hodges-studio-baltimore-loft-4-810x540.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"810\" height=\"540\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/laura-hodges-studio-baltimore-loft-4-810x540.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/laura-hodges-studio-baltimore-loft-4-800x533.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/laura-hodges-studio-baltimore-loft-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/laura-hodges-studio-baltimore-loft-4.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=445296\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-445296\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-445296\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/laura-hodges-studio-baltimore-loft-5-810x540.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"810\" height=\"540\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/laura-hodges-studio-baltimore-loft-5-810x540.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/laura-hodges-studio-baltimore-loft-5-800x533.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/laura-hodges-studio-baltimore-loft-5-768x512.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/laura-hodges-studio-baltimore-loft-5.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=445293\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-445293\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-445293\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/laura-hodges-studio-baltimore-loft-2-810x540.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"810\" height=\"540\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/laura-hodges-studio-baltimore-loft-2-810x540.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/laura-hodges-studio-baltimore-loft-2-800x533.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/laura-hodges-studio-baltimore-loft-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/laura-hodges-studio-baltimore-loft-2.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=445292\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-445292\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-445292\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/laura-hodges-studio-baltimore-loft-1-810x608.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"810\" height=\"608\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/laura-hodges-studio-baltimore-loft-1-810x608.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/laura-hodges-studio-baltimore-loft-1-800x600.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/laura-hodges-studio-baltimore-loft-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2021/03/laura-hodges-studio-baltimore-loft-1.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p> \n<p><em>Diana Ostrom, who has written for Wallpaper, Interior Design, ID, The Wall Street Journal, and other outlets, is also the author of <a href=\"http://farawayplaces.co/newsletter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Faraway Places</a>, a newsletter about travel.</em></p> \n<p><em><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/tag/DMTV-Milkshake/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Milkshake</a>, DMTV (Design Milk TV)’s first regular series, shakes up the traditional interview format by asking designers, creatives, educators and industry professionals to select interview questions at random from their favorite bowl or vessel.

Tucker, founder of <a href=\"https://theaestheticunion.com/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\">The Aesthetic Union</a>, a letterpress print shop in San Francisco specializing in original work and custom editions, this month’s desktop is actually a close-up of an ink swipe, which is a small card James makes and uses on the daily to test or mix inks before doing a large run on the press. In his opinion, these “acts of spontaneous creation” are beautiful little treasures that people who don’t print, don’t know about. Instead of discarding them, you can purchase these cards to send out your next batch of snail mail.

slowly transitioning back to being in the office, workspaces need to be more adaptable and flexible than ever. This latest collaboration between <a href=\"https://www.frameryacoustics.com/en/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\">Framery</a> and Helsinki-based design studio <a href=\"https://ultra.fi/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\">Ultra</a> will help make that transition easier. Framery, known for their soundproof private spaces for open offices, tapped on Ultra’s designers to work with Framery’s R&amp;D in creating the newest, high-tech iteration of their office pods, called Framery One.</p> \n<p>Over 14 concepts were created to get to this final design, which incorporates leading sound insulation standards, echo-free acoustics, and the latest technology. Nearly all the components of the Framery One pod are exclusively custom-made. These office pods, which have been used by leading companies like Microsoft, Puma, and Tesla, are now available globally to all companies.</p> \n<p><a

A built-in handle also makes it easy to move around a home as needed. IKEA notes the FÖRNUFTIG is optimized for smaller spaces around 108 square feet, which makes it best equipped to clean interior air in spaces like the home office and bedroom. Noting its portability, it could also be situated in or near the kitchen to “reduce unpleasant odors from smoking and cooking.”</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=445311\"
