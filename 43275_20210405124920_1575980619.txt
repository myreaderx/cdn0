I work out alone, mostly in my office on our 3rd floor, and I just really need my clothes to serve whatever work out I have planned that day.</p>\n<p>Like all things, I have my favorites so I&#8217;m going to share a few of those with you today!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-81913\" src=\"http://www.thesmallthingsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/BlogGraphics_AthleticFavorites-02.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"7993\" height=\"9531\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https://rstyle.me/+4yeir4t8snlYX1TPi4nlhw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">One.</a>    <a href=\"https://rstyle.me/+iWW4mUCFR6kip1YIoTAO9A\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Two.</a>    <a href=\"https://rstyle.me/+SkSpCEHC-rc1COZ3kjNZsQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Three.</a>    <a href=\"https://rstyle.me/+-xcxtrzOi2waOz7bAGtRFQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Four.</a>    <a href=\"https://rstyle.me/+EiNXogdls56OHX-ZcGgfQA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Five.</a>    <a href=\"https://rstyle.me/+vaf4GDXLOmrX22Z0vJTEvQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Six.</a>    <a href=\"https://rstyle.me/+sjwFIUkF1eT1ZgSlmSKOwQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Seven.</a>    <a href=\"https://rstyle.me/+zDu90qEhuVWkAHPooVJ4KQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Eight.</a>    <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3rYSxTo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nine.</a>    <a href=\"https://rstyle.me/+sOp38z0OhNyWjffx68eyIA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ten.</a>    <a href=\"https://rstyle.me/+ro5yD3uusfTmLTPuL293Cw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Eleven.</a></em></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://rstyle.me/+4yeir4t8snlYX1TPi4nlhw\">One.</a> These shorts from Athleta were a discovery last year. I love the leopard print! I&#8217;ve run in them or just used them for training. I love that they don&#8217;t feel too short on me!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://rstyle.me/+iWW4mUCFR6kip1YIoTAO9A\">Two.</a> The Invigorate High Rise tight is a no-fuss tight that I&#8217;ve used for running, strength training, or walking. It doesn&#8217;t budge thanks to the internal drawstring, and the pocket is a nice feature as well!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://rstyle.me/+SkSpCEHC-rc1COZ3kjNZsQ\">Three.</a> I have a bunch of these weights!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://rstyle.me/+-xcxtrzOi2waOz7bAGtRFQ\">Four.</a> I don&#8217;t often wear a tank when I&#8217;m working out inside, so this Ebb to Train bra is perfect for support and a little bit more coverage on a chilly morning.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://rstyle.me/+EiNXogdls56OHX-ZcGgfQA\">Five.</a> The Wunder Train High-Rise Tight is my favorite for training. The fabric is breathable and I love the smooth finish of the legs (minimal seams, no pockets, etc)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://rstyle.me/+vaf4GDXLOmrX22Z0vJTEvQ\">Six.</a> These Spanx bike shorts are my absolute favorite. They are thin, compressing without feeling too tight, and perform beautifully for a sweaty bike ride.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://rstyle.me/+sjwFIUkF1eT1ZgSlmSKOwQ\">Seven.</a> I love the Invigorate bra for a simple sports bra with medium support. The mesh fabric in the back is nice too for some air flow!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://rstyle.me/+zDu90qEhuVWkAHPooVJ4KQ\">Eight.</a> The Nike Flyknit sneakers are becoming my most worn sneaker, both for lifestyle and for weight training. I prefer a sneaker with laces for running, but I used these for pretty much everything else!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3rYSxTo\">Nine.</a> This bra from Amazon is perfect for light/medium support and I like that it has a longer line to it so it feels like a crop top.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://rstyle.me/+sOp38z0OhNyWjffx68eyIA\">Ten.</a> These are my favorite socks. There are little grippers around the edges of the bottoms and they keep you from slipping and sliding when you aren&#8217;t wearing shoes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://rstyle.me/+ro5yD3uusfTmLTPuL293Cw\">Eleven.</a> I love this bra for low-impact workouts. It feels very comfortable, offers light support, and the criss-cross back is really pretty.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 20 Mar 2021 11:00:11 +0000","feedId":43275,"bgimg":"http://www.thesmallthingsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/BlogGraphics_AthleticFavorites-02.jpg","linkMd5":"cd45905a349e8ba6a30272ea87f2eda8","author":"Amanda Lenweaver","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://www.thesmallthingsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/BlogGraphics_AthleticFavorites-02.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn6@2020_6/2021/04/05/12-49-16-515_7e5bbfadbc9fd01b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617626715170}],"record":{"createdTime":"2021-04-05 20:45:15","updatedTime":"2021-04-05 20:45:15","feedId":43275,"fetchDate":"Mon, 05 Apr 2021 12:45:15 +0000","fetchMs":114,"handleMs":24,"totalMs":245865,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"c95099efafc17f9e0beaf843cecd5c56","hostName":"us-001*","requestId":"0c1a8fcb7d414c0f8b9e579ad3433b9e_43275","contentType":"application/rss+xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":901296,"bgimgsTotal":1,"bgimgsGithubTotal":0,"articlesImgsTotal":1,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":1,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx31":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 03:30:31","updatedTime":"2020-09-07 05:47:52","id":43275,"name":"The Small Things Blog","url":"http://www.thesmallthingsblog.com/feed/","subscriber":74,"website":null,"icon":"http://www.thesmallthingsblog.com/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx65/cdn12@2020_6/2020/09/06/21-47-48-816_ec2099647aefc8f1.jpg","description":"","weekly":null,"link":null},"noPictureArticleList":[{"createdTime":"2021-04-05 20:49:20","updatedTime":"2021-04-05 20:49:20","id":null,"feedId":43275,"linkMd5":"cd45905a349e8ba6a30272ea87f2eda8"}],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":901296,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1617626715006,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":140,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":24,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":118352,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"},{"spend":122164,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":1,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"}]},"extra5":1,"extra6":1,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[null,null,null,null,null],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[{"code":1,"isDone":false,"source":"http://www.thesmallthingsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/BlogGraphics_AthleticFavorites-02.jpg","sourceStatusCode":200,"destWidth":7993,"destHeight":9531,"fixedGithubDest":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn6@2020_6/2021/04/05/12-49-16-515_7e5bbfadbc9fd01b.webp","sourceBytes":7805726,"destBytes":901296,"targetWebpQuality":52,"feedId":43275,"totalSpendMs":57440,"convertSpendMs":56601,"createdTime":"2021-04-05 20:48:19","host":"us-015*","referer":"http://www.thesmallthingsblog.com/?p=81931","linkMd5ListStr":"cd45905a349e8ba6a30272ea87f2eda8,cd45905a349e8ba6a30272ea87f2eda8","githubUser":"myreaderx31","githubHttpCode":201,"extra22GetBytesInfo":"1、没有Referer字段","extra23historyStatusCode":[200],"sourceSize":"7.4 MB","destSize":"880.2 KB","compressRate":"11.5%"}],"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx31":1},"failGithubMap":{}}
