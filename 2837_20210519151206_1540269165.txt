And, lags in productivity means project delays, which typically costs everyone involved more time and more money.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a number of larger players in the space (think Procore, PlanGrid and Autodesk) that are tackling the problems from the perspective of the general contractor. But when it comes to the subcontractors that are hired by the general contractor to do 95% of the work, the pickings are few and far between.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enter </span><a href=\"https://www.assignar.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Assignar</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a cloud-based construction tech startup that was originally born in Australia and is now based in Denver, Colorado. Co-founder and CEO Sean McCreanor was a contractor himself for many years, and grew frustrated with the lack of offerings available to him. So, as in the case of many founders, he set out to create the technology he wished existed.</span></p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And today, Assignar has raised $20 million in a Series B funding round led by real estate tech-focused venture firm Fifth Wall. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Existing backer Tola Capital and new investor Ironspring Ventures also put money in the round, which brings Assignar’s total raised since its 2014 inception to $31 million.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I had 100 crews and workers out in the field, lots of heavy equipment and project work, and was running the entire business on spreadsheets and whiteboards,” McCreanor recalls. “With Assignar, we essentially help the office connect to the field and vice versa.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a nutshell, Assignar’s operations platform is designed for use by “self-perform general and subcontractors” on public and private infrastructure projects. The company’s goal is to make the whole process smoother for large general contractors, developers and real estate owner-operators by providing a “real-time snapshot of granular field activity.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Specifically, Assignar aims to streamline operations and schedules, track crews and equipment, and improve quality and safety, as well as measure and monitor productivity and progress with data on all projects. For example, it claims to be able to help match up the best crews and equipment for a specific job &#8220;more efficiently.&#8221; </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The startup says it has hundreds of international customers working on multibillion-dollar projects in infrastructure, road, rail, heavy civil, utilities and other construction disciplines. Those customers range from specialist contractors with as few as five crews to multi-national, multibillion-dollar companies. Projects include things such as bridges and roads, for example.</span></p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2154435\" style=\"width: 3061px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2154435\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2154435 size-full\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Assignar-Dashboard.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"3051\" height=\"1884\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Assignar-Dashboard.jpg 3051w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Assignar-Dashboard.jpg?resize=150,93 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Assignar-Dashboard.jpg?resize=300,185 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Assignar-Dashboard.jpg?resize=768,474 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Assignar-Dashboard.jpg?resize=680,420 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Assignar-Dashboard.jpg?resize=1536,948 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Assignar-Dashboard.jpg?resize=2048,1265 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Assignar-Dashboard.jpg?resize=50,31 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3051px) 100vw, 3051px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-2154435\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Assignar</p></div></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Assignar historically has “more than doubled” its revenue every year since inception and in 2020, saw revenue increase by 75%.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We could have grown faster but wanted to manage cash flow,” McCreanor told TechCrunch.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Assignar’s focus is particularly significant these days considering that the Biden administration&#8217;s Infrastructure Bill is nearing agreement, likely signaling an investment in infrastructure for communities across the U.S. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The heavy civil and horizontal construction industry has long lacked a well-designed and ubiquitous operations platform, according to Fifth Wall Partner Vik Chawla.</span></p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Q7tKh43oej\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/construction-tech-startups-are-poised-to-shake-up-a-1-3-trillion-dollar-industry/\">Construction tech startups are poised to shake up a $1.3-trillion-dollar industry</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Construction tech startups are poised to shake up a $1.3-trillion-dollar industry&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/construction-tech-startups-are-poised-to-shake-up-a-1-3-trillion-dollar-industry/embed/#?secret=Q7tKh43oej\" data-secret=\"Q7tKh43oej\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Assignar&#8217;s cloud-based software offers a detailed view on when and where different types of field activities are being performed,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It streamlines communications between headquarters and the field, allows for a reduction in paperwork, and brings time and cost savings to an industry where much of the planning, tracking and reporting are still done by hand, in Excel or on white boards.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Assignar plans to use its new capital to grow its business in North America (which currently makes up about 25% of its revenue) and double its 65-person team by hiring for roles across all departments. The company also plans to invest in R&#38;D and product development to further build out its core platform. Among the features it’s planning to develop is a contractor hub and a schedule recommendation engine that McCreanor says will leverage data, AI and machine learning “to support planning and execution processes.”</span></p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/techcrunch/startups/~4/dJQveuxXRho\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 19 May 2021 15:02:41 +0000","feedId":2837,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Assignar-Dashboard.jpg","linkMd5":"c5a638856e577641458809fe2e583c61","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn76@2020_2/2021/05/19/15-12-05-582_0b938a0cff33edb0.webp","destWidth":3051,"destHeight":1884,"sourceBytes":656488,"destBytes":183350,"author":"Mary Ann Azevedo","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Assignar-Dashboard.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn76@2020_2/2021/05/19/15-12-05-582_0b938a0cff33edb0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/techcrunch/startups/~4/dJQveuxXRho":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn98@2020_3/2021/05/19/15-12-05-973_296e98cd8a7ac5a7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1621437092888}],"record":{"createdTime":"2021-05-19 23:11:32","updatedTime":"2021-05-19 23:11:32","feedId":2837,"fetchDate":"Wed, 19 May 2021 15:11:32 +0000","fetchMs":25,"handleMs":20,"totalMs":33525,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":20,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"af6ca12eefe249e94a3f077d15d7c168","hostName":"europe63*","requestId":"8f764bc08fef407694bddead3d31cf7b_2837","contentType":"text/xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":183422,"bgimgsTotal":1,"bgimgsGithubTotal":1,"articlesImgsTotal":2,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":2,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx33":1,"myreaderx19":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 21:31:45","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 10:16:10","id":2837,"name":"Startups – TechCrunch","url":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/techcrunch/startups","subscriber":null,"website":null,"icon":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/cropped-cropped-favicon-gradient.png?w=32","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx61/cdn27@2020_6/2020/09/01/02-15-54-239_b680563909a34e61.webp","description":"Startup and Technology News","weekly":null,"link":null},"noPictureArticleList":[],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":183350,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":72,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1621437092823,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":47,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":20,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":0,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"},{"spend":420,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"}]},"extra5":2,"extra6":2,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[null],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{"http://europe68.herokuapp.com/":{"failCount":0,"successCount":1,"resultList":[200]}},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[{"code":1,"isDone":false,"source":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Assignar-Dashboard.jpg","sourceStatusCode":200,"destWidth":3051,"destHeight":1884,"fixedGithubDest":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn76@2020_2/2021/05/19/15-12-05-582_0b938a0cff33edb0.webp","sourceBytes":656488,"destBytes":183350,"targetWebpQuality":75,"feedId":2837,"totalSpendMs":651,"convertSpendMs":117,"createdTime":"2021-05-19 23:12:05","host":"us-022*","referer":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2154421","linkMd5ListStr":"c5a638856e577641458809fe2e583c61,c5a638856e577641458809fe2e583c61","githubUser":"myreaderx33","githubHttpCode":201,"extra22GetBytesInfo":"1、没有Referer字段","extra23historyStatusCode":[200],"sourceSize":"641.1 KB","destSize":"179.1 KB","compressRate":"27.9%"},{"code":1,"isDone":false,"source":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/techcrunch/startups/~4/dJQveuxXRho","sourceStatusCode":200,"destWidth":1,"destHeight":1,"fixedGithubDest":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn98@2020_3/2021/05/19/15-12-05-973_296e98cd8a7ac5a7.webp","sourceBytes":43,"destBytes":72,"targetWebpQuality":75,"feedId":2837,"totalSpendMs":397,"convertSpendMs":1,"createdTime":"2021-05-19 23:12:05","host":"europe68*","referer":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2154421","linkMd5ListStr":"c5a638856e577641458809fe2e583c61","githubUser":"myreaderx19","githubHttpCode":201,"extra22GetBytesInfo":"1、没有Referer字段","extra23historyStatusCode":[200],"sourceSize":"43 B","destSize":"72 B","compressRate":"167.4%"}],"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx33":1,"myreaderx19":1},"failGithubMap":{}}
