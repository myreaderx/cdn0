In today’s article, we’ve got a little bit of news to look at about a game making its way back to the eShop in a fresh new form. We’ve also got summaries of today’s new releases, including such notables as<em> Star Wars Republic Commando</em> and <em>Lost Words: Beyond the Page</em>. We finish things up with all of the incoming and outgoing sales for the day. Let’s get to business!</p> \n<h3><strong>News</strong></h3> \n<p><strong>‘Save me Mr Tako: Definitive Edition’ Announced for May 5th Release</strong></p> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-279135\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/savememrtakobanner.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/savememrtakobanner.jpg 620w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/savememrtakobanner-300x169.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" /></p> \n<p>After some serious issues with its previous publisher, <em>Save me Mr Tako</em> will be getting a whole bunch of fixes and improvements in a brand new Definitive Edition due to release on May 5th. Naturally, it’s coming via a new publisher, and that unfortunately means that if you owned the previous version you’ll have to pay again to get the Definitive Edition. The list of improvements and additions is substantial, however. Better physics, improved level designs, a new hint system, new visual options, rebalanced enemies, and more. I rather liked the game even in its original form, but it was easy to see room for improvements. While this isn’t the ideal way to see those come about, I’m glad the developer is able to finally present the game as it was meant to be.</p> \n<h3><strong>New Releases</strong></h3> \n<h3><strong>Star Wars Republic Commando ($14.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-279136\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/starwarsrepubliccommando.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/starwarsrepubliccommando.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/starwarsrepubliccommando-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/starwarsrepubliccommando-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/starwarsrepubliccommando-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p><strong>SwitchArcade Highlight!</strong></p> \n<p>Another classic <em>Star Wars</em> game makes its return thanks to the good folks at Aspyr. This time it’s the well-loved <em>Star Wars Republic Commando</em>. Come on friends, bring those <em>Knights of the Old Republic</em> games to Switch. You know we want them. That’s not to say that we <em>don’t</em> want this, mind you. Some people think this is the finest <em>Star Wars</em> game of them all, and I could see it. Unfortunately, this Switch version is missing the multiplayer component that was such a big part of that evaluation for most people. The single-player campaign is quite satisfying in its own right, but I know some are going to be disappointed that they won’t be able to engage in some vintage squad-based <em>Star Wars</em> action with their buddies. I’ll have a review of this one soon.</p> \n<h3><strong>Lost Words: Beyond the Page ($14.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-279137\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/lostwordsbeyondthepage.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/lostwordsbeyondthepage.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/lostwordsbeyondthepage-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/lostwordsbeyondthepage-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/lostwordsbeyondthepage-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p><strong>SwitchArcade Highlight!</strong></p> \n<p>This has been out for a while on Stadia, so it’s not an entirely unknown quantity. This narrative-heavy game has a story written by Rhianna Pratchett, whose work you may be familiar with through titles like<em> Mirror’s Edge</em>, the recent <em>Tomb Raider</em> games, and early PlayStation 3 title <em>Heavenly Sword</em>. It’s a four-to-five hour adventure with platforming elements that sees you exploring a fantasy world. There’s a heavy emphasis on grief and how we learn to cope with loss, which isn’t exactly the newest or freshest of concepts for this kind of affair. The main gameplay gimmick involves using words to shape the environment and create a safe path forward. I’ll have a review of this one very soon, but for now I’ll say: worth it if you like “experience\" games, not so much if you’re more focused on gameplay mechanics.</p> \n<h3><strong>Breathedge ($24.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-279138\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/breathedge.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/breathedge.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/breathedge-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/breathedge-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/breathedge-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p>You’ve played survival crafting games on islands. You’ve played survival crafting games on snowy mountains. You’ve played survival crafting games in deserts. You’ve probably played a few on alien worlds. But have you played one in space? Oh, you have? Hm. Well, uh, here’s another one then. Opinions on this one are all over the board. Some people think it’s great. Some people think it’s awful. Anyway, you’re in a spaceship wreck and need to survive through whatever means possible. Gather materials, craft them into stuff you need, and try not to die. It’s trying really hard to be funny, and while I firmly believe humor is subjective, I feel like it’s not exactly succeeding in its efforts. Well, you probably know if you’re into this kind of thing or not.</p> \n<h3><strong>Stacks on Stacks (On Stacks) ($12.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-279139\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/stacksonstacksonstacks.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/stacksonstacksonstacks.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/stacksonstacksonstacks-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/stacksonstacksonstacks-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/stacksonstacksonstacks-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p>Cute title. Well done on that. Anyway, the idea behind this one is that you need to stack things on other things, and then stack more on top of that stack. That’s the basic idea, anyway. The specific goals change from stage to stage, and there a ton of elements I can only describe as random. Like… <em>weirdly</em> random. I’m not sure if it makes for a good game, but it sure makes for a <em>funny</em> one. There are 36 stages in all, which is a decent amount given how long they tend to take to finish. You can play with a second player locally, either cooperatively or competitively. The whole thing is wrapped up in a colorful, silly presentation that should appeal to kids and kids-at-heart.</p> \n<h3><strong>Sales</strong></h3> \n<p><em><strong>(North American eShop, US Prices)</strong></em></p> \n<p>An interesting selection today, I suppose. A couple of new games had their launch sales kick in, as usual. Aside from that, there’s a nice deal on <em>Wrestling Empire</em>, as well as some regular games that are nevertheless worth grabbing like<em> Galaxy Champions TV</em> and <em>Rise: Race the Future</em>. The outbox is rather large today, with titles like <em>Blue Fire, Embracelet, Kuukiyomi 3</em>, and<em> Adventures of Chris</em> worth considering before they finish their discounts. Have a careful look, as always.</p> \n<p><strong>Select New Games on Sale</strong></p> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-276245\"

Over the months, Microsoft has added more and more games to the cloud on Xbox Game Pass and a <a href=\"https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/04/06/coming-soon-xbox-game-pass-april-2021/\">new announcement</a> reveals more than 50 of the games in the service now get touch controls. For those unaware, xCloud has touch control options for certain games and Microsoft showcased this with <em><a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2020/09/14/xbox-project-xcloud-launch-games-list-minecraft-dungeons-touch-controls-android/\">Minecraft Dungeons</a></em>. The new announcement reveals <em><a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2019/10/14/switcharcade-round-up-dragon-quest-xi-s-review-mini-views-including-a-knights-quest-and-more-undertale-dlc-in-taiko-no-tatsujin-and-the-latest-sales-info/\">Dragon Quest XI S</a></em>, <em>Gears 5</em>, <em>Slay the Spire</em> and more as new titles with touch control support on xCloud.

Today’s highlight is <em>GTA V</em> returning to Xbox Game Pass on April 8th but with xCloud support. The amazing <em><a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2018/08/03/switcharcade-roundup-octopath-traveler-crosses-1000000-threshold-dragon-ball-fighterz-beta-news-and-the-game-of-the-day/\">Octopath Traveler</a></em> that debuted on Nintendo Switch before seeing a PC and eventually Xbox release is also cloud supported now. For those wondering why xCloud isn’t on iOS in any form yet, Apple’s <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2020/09/11/apple-updates-guidelines-regarding-game-streaming-services/\">own restrictions and rules</a> are the reason for the delay. After a <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2020/10/09/xcloud-ios-early-2021-release-web-browser-xbox-game-pass-microsoft-report/\">previous report</a> revealed that Microsoft is bringing xCloud to iOS through the mobile browser, <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2020/12/09/xcloud-ios-release-confirmed-2021-spring-browser-free-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-pc-date/\">Microsoft confirmed</a> that the cloud gaming (beta) which we all know as xCloud for iOS is coming soon. Check out how an early build looks <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2021/02/15/xcloud-browser-screenshot-interface-internal-test-microsoft-iphone-ipad/\">here</a>. </p> \n<p> \n <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div> \n <div class=\"video-responsive\"> \n  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DE3nXtnfVpU\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n </div> </p> \n<p>Once this is available, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members will be able to play and access their own library (supported titles) across Xbox consoles, PC, Android, and iOS devices. As of now, you’re better off <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2020/09/15/xbox-game-pass-xcloud-game-streaming-iphone-ipad-android/\">buying an Android device</a> if you really want to stream Xbox games to your phone immediately.

Watch the <em>Hearthstone</em> Book of Mercenaries Rokara teaser video below:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"525\" data-dnt=\"true\"> \n <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Rokara the young Frostwolf orc and new Horde recruit takes on the challenges of the Barrens head on! 🪓</p> \n <p>Complete the first Book of Mercenaries to earn a Warrior Pack! <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/1f64c.png\" alt=\"🙌\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> <a href=\"https://t.co/Ji36o1oKZA\">pic.twitter.com/Ji36o1oKZA</a></p> \n <p>— Hearthstone (@PlayHearthstone) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PlayHearthstone/status/1379479138176806914?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 6, 2021</a></p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p> \n<p>Rokara is a young orc born in the land of Alterac Valley. She is a new horde recruit taking on the Barrens’ challenges while in search of a magical artifact. Rokara’s chapter features eight fights with preset decks. You can access it from the <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2021/02/22/hearthstone-blizzcon-2021-announcements-mercenaries-mode-forged-in-barrens-preorder-price-ios-android-free/\">Book of Mercenaries</a> part of the Solo Adventures in the <em>Hearthstone</em> menu. Successfully completing it will net you one Warrior Card Pack. It is always great to see more PvE content in <em>Hearthstone</em> and I can’t wait to get back to Rokara’s chapter and to see what Blizzard brings to the game for the rest of the year as I continue to revisit decks from <em>Hearthstone</em>‘s first year. Have you been playing it often or did you jump back in with <em>Hearthstone</em>‘s Classic Format?</p> \n<p></p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 06 Apr 2021 18:17:45 +0000","feedId":84,"bgimg":"https://toucharcade.com/wp-content/images/app/625257520/100x100bb.jpg","linkMd5":"4e4e4e7380c9f60694c03c2c72c2663a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn15@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-38-26-922_804587f059804db2.webp","destWidth":100,"destHeight":100,"sourceBytes":4612,"destBytes":4612,"author":"Mikhail Madnani","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://toucharcade.com/wp-content/images/app/625257520/100x100bb.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn15@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-38-26-922_804587f059804db2.webp","https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/1f64c.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn75@2020_5/2021/04/07/17-38-49-888_5dfa689a6d6602d7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617817105446},{"createdTime":"2021-04-08 01:38:25","updatedTime":"2021-04-08 01:38:25","title":"PvP Strategy Survival Game ‘The Walking Dead: Survivors’ for iOS and Android Releases Next Week Worldwide","link":"https://toucharcade.com/?p=279142","description":"<p><a class=\"app-icon\" href=\"https://toucharcade.com/games/the-walking-dead-survivors\" style=\"float:left; margin-top:4px; margin-right:10px;\"><img style=\"border-radius:20px;\" src=\"https://toucharcade.com/wp-content/images/app/1514546586/100x100bb.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a> Last month, Elex and Skybound <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2021/03/16/the-walking-dead-survivors-release-date-ios-android-preregistration-elex-skybound/\">revealed</a> <em>The Walking Dead: Survivors</em> <a href=\"http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1514546586?mt=8\">()</a> which is a PvP strategy survival tower defense game based on <em>The Walking Dead</em> featuring characters from the comics set for iOS and Android. <em>The Walking Dead: Survivors</em> has you trying to defend your town from other players and hordes as you build it up.

We’ve got a few new releases to look at today, and they really run the gamut in terms of quality. There’s also a Mini-View of <em>Vaporum: Lockdown</em>, a challenging but satisfying dungeon crawler. The most exciting thing going on today is the list of new sales, with Bethesda running discounts across the board. Yes, even for <em>Skyrim</em> and <em>DOOM Eternal</em>. We’ve got lists of both incoming and outgoing sales, so do give them a look. Let’s go!</p> \n<h3><strong>Mini-Views</strong></h3> \n<h3><strong>Vaporum: Lockdown ($21.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-278615\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vaporumlockdown.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vaporumlockdown.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vaporumlockdown-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vaporumlockdown-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vaporumlockdown-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p><em>Vaporum: Lockdown</em> is a prequel that by and large is content to follow in the footsteps of the previous game. Generally speaking, that’s not a bad thing. <em>Vaporum</em>‘s gameplay mechanics were sound, the level designs were solid, and its unusual choice of theme helped it stand out a bit. And there certainly are some improvements here. The text is actually readable in handheld mode, for starters. Enemy encounters are a bit more interesting, though still not spectacular. On a similar note, the environments have somewhat more variety than what we saw in the first game. Given that the Switch isn’t exactly overflowing with <em>Dungeon Master</em>-style games, another title in that milieu of similar quality to <em>Vaporum</em> is more than welcome.</p> \n<p>The biggest difference, I would say, is in how difficult the puzzles are. This game really doesn’t fool around, especially in its back half. For some of you, that’s going to be something that gets your engine running. And yes, if you love challenging puzzles, some of which feel like you need to be reading the developer’s brain to figure out, you’ll have a field day here. But I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t frustrating sometimes. Hidden breakable walls become so hard to spot that you start whacking every surface you come across. Logical leaps that probably made sense to someone during development but don’t work out so well for a player trying to figure things out. It can be utterly <em>exasperating</em>. But I still kept on playing it until I reached the end, which I think speaks to the underlying appeal of this game.</p> \n<p><strong>SwitchArcade Score: 3.5/5</strong></p> \n<h3><strong>New Releases</strong></h3> \n<h3><strong>CyberTaxi ($9.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-279099\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cybertaxi.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cybertaxi.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cybertaxi-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cybertaxi-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cybertaxi-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p>My first thought when I saw this game in action was that it had some serious mid-90s PC demo disc energy. Taking a closer look, this is a very heavy homage to the 1994 cult classic <em>Quarantine</em>. Wow, good job, first thought! You drive your taxi through a post-apocalyptic city, picking up passengers and blasting away anything that stands in your way. Naturally, it is a bit on the violent side. I wouldn’t call it the greatest of games, but neither was <em>Quarantine</em>. If you’re in the right mood, however, it is pretty fun. And if you have happy memories of <em>Quarantine</em>, by all means. This hovers somewhere between a remake and an homage, but I can at least say that if you liked the game it is<i> clearly</i> based on<i>,&nbsp;</i>you’ll almost certainly enjoy this.</p> \n<h3><strong>Castle Heroes ($2.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-279100\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/castleheroes.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/castleheroes.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/castleheroes-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/castleheroes-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/castleheroes-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p>You know, I might rag on Piotr Skalski from time to time, but if it comes down to a battle between the shovelware developers, his stuff tends to float to the top. The games are short on fresh ideas, but they’re functional, offer a reasonable amount of content, and are generally cheap. And hey, that describes<em> Castle Heroes</em> quite well. This is a very straightforward take on side-scrolling castle defense games like <em>Swords &amp; Soldiers</em>. There are more than 100 stages to play, 17 different types of units to deploy, and a simple upgrade system. Note that this game is playable only in handheld mode for whatever reason.</p> \n<h3><strong>Brick Bat Crazy ($2.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-279101\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/brickbatcrazy.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/brickbatcrazy.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/brickbatcrazy-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/brickbatcrazy-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/brickbatcrazy-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p>The title plus a single screenshot probably tells you most of what you need to know about this game. It’s another <em>Breakout</em>-style brick-breaker, with ten stages and an assortment of power-ups to use. There are three difficulty settings for each stage, and you can play alone or with a second player via local multiplayer. It’s only a few bucks, but even at that price it feels a bit light on ideas and content. There are probably worse ways to spend your money on the eShop, especially if you enjoy brick-breakers, but I don’t think your Switch would miss this game if you opted to pass on it.</p> \n<h3><strong>Fly The Bird ($2.49)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-279102\" src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/flythebird.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/flythebird.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/flythebird-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/flythebird-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/flythebird-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p>Unlike Mr. Skalski, Pix Arts-san’s stuff does <em>not</em> rise to the top of the shovelware. Indeed, it is the bottom. Where all the fish poop goes. Take the controls of a very awkward bird and try to fly through the rings. All the fun of <em>Superman 64</em> without that pesky license. There are lots of better games about flying on the Switch, like <em>Feather</em> or <em>Aery</em>. If you catch them on sale, they don’t even cost much more than this. No need to scoop the poop.</p> \n<h3><strong>Sales</strong></h3> \n<p><em><strong>(North American eShop, US Prices)</strong></em></p> \n<p>Lots of good stuff in the mix today, friends. Bethesda is having a sale on pretty much everything in its library, including<em> DOOM Eternal</em>. Aside from that, <em>Ori &amp; the Blind Forest, Gunman Clive HD Collection, Disney Classic Games: Aladdin &amp; The Lion King</em>, and <em>Human: Fall Flat</em> are all worth considering. Not too much going on in the outbox, but if you want to get <em>RetroMania Wrestling</em> at its launch-discounted price, you need to get on it soon.</p> \n<p><strong>Select New Games on

This update follows the previous one that brought in the IGA’s Back DLC that was priced at $0.99. Today, Zangetsu has arrived in <em>Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night</em> on mobile for free adding in a new way to play the game.

Zangetsu doesn’t use shards like Miriam and has his blade to deal with enemies as shown in the trailer above. You can download Zangetsu in-game for free.

Seriously, at least once or twice a month since the game’s launch just about two years ago there’s been some sort of new update with a new season or event, new items or features. It’s bananas how well-supported this game is, and that’s reflected in the passion and appreciation shown by the game’s community. For an expert breakdown of what the Season of Assembly entails, I’ll point you towards the developer video below where thatgamecompany’s Nick Ouejian literally climbs a tree and wears a pot on his head while explaining the new season in just about two minute’s time. Following that is the official launch trailer for the Season of Assembly update, which is just darn pretty so I’m including it as well.</p> \n<p> \n <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div> \n <div class=\"video-responsive\"> \n  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xaUrgrr982k\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n </div> </p> \n<p> \n <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div> \n <div class=\"video-responsive\"> \n  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tq0hZMlJDBU\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n </div> </p> \n<p>The Season of Assembly update arrives on the heels of <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2021/03/17/sky-children-of-the-light-daily-light-candles-season-of-assembly-preorder-ios-android-nintendo-switch/\">last month’s Days of Bloom update</a> which did something extremely out of character for a popular free to play game: It introduced a new mechanic that tried to actually <strong>reduce</strong> the amount of grinding in the game. <em>Sky’s</em> entire ethos is built around being a social game where you get to interact with and spend time with other real human beings by way of this incredible digital world. The team felt that people were so worried about “the grind\" for light that they implemented the new Daily Light system to help the daily grind for candles “feel better and less repetitive.\" That’s pretty cool.

The game’s announcement included a teaser showcasing the gameplay and a new <em>Wizardry VA</em> teaser has been revealed today. Watch the trailer below:</p> \n<p> \n <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div> \n <div class=\"video-responsive\"> \n  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-HD2vcSg-yE\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n </div> </p> \n<p>Going by the previous teaser, <em>Wizardry VA</em> will likely be a portrait game. More information about <em>Wizardry VA</em> isn’t available right now but it is being developed with new features on top of everything <em>Wizardry</em> is known for. The trailer is definitely an early look because it has some technical issues. I can’t wait to see some direct feed gameplay footage for it in the future as we get closer to its release date in 2022 globally on iOS and Android. Have you played a <em>Wizardry</em> game and what is your favourite dungeon RPG on mobile or Nintendo Switch?</p> \n<p>[Source: <a href=\"https://www.gematsu.com/2021/04/wizardry-va-launches-in-2022-teaser-trailer\">Gematsu</a>]</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 06 Apr 2021 15:10:37 +0000","feedId":84,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"285c715a42b32e2b7e79e47937b82578","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Mikhail Madnani","publishedOrCreatedDate":1617817105465},{"createdTime":"2021-04-08 01:38:25","updatedTime":"2021-04-08 01:38:25","title":"‘Final Fantasy VIII Remastered’ Review – I Dreamt I Was a Mobile Port","link":"https://toucharcade.com/?p=279015","description":"<p><a class=\"app-icon\" href=\"https://toucharcade.com/games/final-fantasy-viii-remastered\" style=\"float:left; margin-top:4px; margin-right:10px;\"><img style=\"border-radius:20px;\" src=\"https://toucharcade.com/wp-content/images/app/1326740784/100x100bb.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a>Square Enix has made some tasty salad of porting its <em>Final Fantasy</em> games to mobile for a very long time now. It’s been roughly eleven years since the first two games in the series dropped on iOS, and as the years passed the others came. In 2011, <em>Final Fantasy 3</em>. In 2012, <em>Final Fantasy 4</em>. 2013 and 2014 saw the fifth and sixth games arrive, bringing us to the edge of the PlayStation era of the series. In 2015, the big moment arrived: <em>Final Fantasy 7</em> came, albeit with fewer changes than the previous iOS releases. Indeed, it felt like something running in an emulator, but it was still cool to see such a huge game hit our little screens.</p> \n<p>Following this pattern, it would seem logical to think that <em>Final Fantasy 8</em> would arrive in 2016. Well, we <em>did</em> get a<em> Final Fantasy</em> game that year, but it was the rather impressive port of<em> Final Fantasy 9</em>. Unlike the previous game, this felt like it was rebuilt for the hardware. Perhaps <em>that</em> was the hold-up with <em>Final Fantasy 8</em>? At the time, I thought we’d see the eighth game arrive in 2017. Instead, we got the original title<em> Final Fantasy Dimensions 2</em>. Hm, maybe in 2018? No, that ended up being<em> Final Fantasy 15 Pocket Edition</em>. Oh, I see! 2019 is the 20th anniversary of <em>Final Fantasy 8</em>! Square Enix, you <em>sly</em> dogs. But no, no such luck on mobile that year. It <em>did</em> come to <em>other</em> platforms. Perhaps it was just a bit behind on mobile?</p> \n<p>2020 passes, nothing. I’ll level with you, friends. I thought Square Enix wasn’t going to do it for whatever reason. Then last week, I’m checking the App Store for the new releases and, pow, <em>Final Fantasy 8 Remastered</em> <a href=\"http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1326740784?mt=8\">($20.99)</a> is sitting right there. Well, okay. Better late than never, right? I wonder how long we’ll have to wait for <em>Final Fantasy 10</em>? A question for another time. I had already gone through this remaster when it hit the Nintendo Switch a year and a half ago, so this run through the mobile version was more of a check to see how it made the transition than anything else.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/626x0w-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"462\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-279125\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/626x0w-2.png 1000w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/626x0w-2-300x139.png 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/626x0w-2-768x355.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p>So let’s get to that part right away. <em>Final Fantasy 8 Remastered</em> is more like <em>Final Fantasy 7</em> mobile than <em>Final Fantasy 9</em> mobile, I’m afraid. Basically, it feels like the game is running in an emulator shell. You have your button overlays, and everything is done through those virtual buttons. A pause button brings up a menu with a few features you can tweak, including the cheats, the color and opacity of the control overlays, and a choice between an analog stick or eight-directional dpad for your virtual movement. There’s an auto-save feature, and… well, that’s about it.</p> \n<p>It’s not that this is a <em>bad</em> thing, but it does feel a bit underwhelming after the extra care put into <em>Final Fantasy 9</em>. The way the virtual buttons are laid out also makes some<em> Final Fantasy 8</em>-specific elements more awkward. Squall’s gunblade involves a well-timed R2 press to deal extra damage. A trifle when it’s on a shoulder button, but less intuitive when it’s a virtual button sitting up in the corner of the screen. Anytime the shoulder buttons come into play, this approach shows its disadvantages. At the moment, you have no choice but to deal with it. Things like controller and iCloud support are apparently on the way, but as of right now you have to use the somewhat careless touch controls.</p> \n<p>Otherwise, this port fares well. Indeed, the noticeable difference between the higher-resolution characters and the backgrounds is that much less noticeable on the smaller screens of most mobile devices. It looks good and it runs well, falling somewhere between<em> Final Fantasy 7</em>‘s largely untouched visuals and <em>Final Fantasy 9</em>‘s extensive work. If you got on fine with <em>Final Fantasy 7</em>‘s mobile version in particular, you’ll probably be fine with<em> Final Fantasy 8</em> <em>Remastered</em>. Given the price being asked, I do wish Square Enix would have handled things a bit more elegantly at launch, regardless of update plans.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/626x0w.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"462\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-279126\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/626x0w.png 1000w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/626x0w-300x139.png 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/626x0w-768x355.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></p> \n<p>Getting beyond the port quality to the game itself, <em>Final Fantasy 8</em> has found itself as one of the black sheep of the series for a number of reasons. Like the other black sheep (<em>Final Fantasy 2</em> and<em> Final Fantasy 13</em>), it’s both easy to understand its reputation and nevertheless love the game. It makes some decisions with its plot that I personally don’t really care for, but I could make that argument for most<em> Final Fantasy</em> games. The cast is a bit smaller than the installments sandwiching it, and their more grounded nature (there’s no one like Cait Sith or Quina in this lot) ends up pushing a lot of the character work into pure coming-of-age drama stuff. The main character is intentionally obnoxious in the first half of the game, and that’s an aspect of the plot that often doesn’t sit well with people.</p> \n<p>Perhaps more troublesome than its plot is its unusual mechanics, however. <em>Final Fantasy 8</em> actually has a lot of interesting, quirky systems, but it’s not very good at explaining to players about the best way to use them. Even worse, if you try to play this like any other <em>Final Fantasy</em> game, you’ll have the least-pleasant possible time you could with it. Enemy levels scale with your party’s, so grinding up levels can actually bite you in the hindquarters. You can use your summons quite often, but there are so many better ways to deal damage that don’t involve sitting through unskippable animations. There’s a great card game here that you might be tempted to ignore, but its rewards are tremendously useful.</p> \n<p>You can brute force your way through, albeit perhaps not as easily as in other games in the series. But the true joy of <em>Final Fantasy 8</em> comes in taking advantage of its mechanics (specifically the junction system that boosts your stats) and breaking the thing over your knee. Leveling up should be avoided where possible, but don’t worry too much about that. As long as you’re using and abusing that junction system, things will work out fairly well for you. Oh, and don’t neglect any of your party members. There’s a pretty strong chance you’ll need even your least-favorite of the bunch at a very inconvenient time. Trust me.</p> \n<p> \n <div style=\"clear:both;\"></div> \n <div class=\"video-responsive\"> \n  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dvw7KimpLQI\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n </div> </p> \n<p>I’m wandering into guide-like tips here, but there’s a reason I’m doing that. I used to hate<em> Final Fantasy 8</em>. The characters annoyed me. One of the big plot twists felt stupid to me. Some of the character development came off unearned. But the backdrop behind all of that, and the likely reason why these things annoyed me so much more than usual, is that I failed to understand the game’s mechanics. Once I learned that conventional tactics were not the best way to proceed, that I had to approach the game on its terms rather than my own, I ended up loving it. It takes a bit of work to enjoy <em>Final Fantasy 8</em> properly. I’m not sure if that’s a good thing or not, but it’s absolutely something you should know if you’re wading in for the first time.</p> \n<p><em>Final Fantasy 8 Remastered</em> took its time coming to mobile platforms. The port isn’t optimal but it is adequate. Certainly well-done enough that you should be able to enjoy the game for what it is. Now, whether or not that game is going to be to your tastes is another matter entirely. It’s an odd duck, but it has a devoted following for a reason. If you’ve got an open mind for a JRPG that wanders off the beaten path in more ways than one, and not always in a good way, you might end up a fan yourself. I’m not sure it was the right follow-up to <em>Final Fantasy 7</em>‘s blockbuster success, but there’s plenty to love about <em>Final Fantasy 8</em>‘s unique charms.</p>
