Adding to the list of vegan ice cream cookbooks, I'd like to point my dear readers to <a href=\"http://bittersweetblog.wordpress.com/2009/07/12/a-la-mode/\">À La Mode</a>, an e-book from the author of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0979128617?ie=UTF8&tag=aveiccrpa-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0979128617\">My Sweet Vegan</a><img src=\"http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=aveiccrpa-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0979128617\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\"/>. <br /><br />For five bucks you get 13 recipes, plus variations and whatnot. All I have to say about the book is: <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Buttered Popcorn Ice Cream</span>. Seriously, this woman is a freaking genius. Buttered (or, rather, Earth Balance'd) popcorn is <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">my favorite snack ever</span>, and now I can have it with ice cream. In ice cream. <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">As ice cream</span>.<br /><br />And since I'm not producing any recipes (Lyme disease really sucks, FYI) to share, this is a great treasure trove to get you through the hot summer months. Be sure to make the White-Peach Rosemary Ice Cream recipe for me. I've been wanting to develop a Lavender-Rosemary Ice Cream (and infusing some vodka too) for ages, and this sounds equally delicious.<br /><br />If that's not enough for you, then let me just say again: Buttered Popcorn Ice Cream. What isn't to love?","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 21 Jul 2009 04:04:00 +0000","feedId":49511,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"38b00809c37bdfba5ea863f4baca70e3","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"The Girl With The Sun In Her Head","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=aveiccrpa-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0979128617":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647254791381}],"record":{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 18:46:31","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 18:46:31","feedId":49511,"fetchDate":"Mon, 14 Mar 2022 10:46:31 +0000","fetchMs":398,"handleMs":7,"totalMs":123129,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":25,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"bc1eecef1292254c09de6c1e66b750f3","hostName":"europe-22*","requestId":"ac62c0816cf943ba95253174f23c470c_49511","contentType":"application/atom+xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":0,"bgimgsTotal":0,"bgimgsGithubTotal":0,"articlesImgsTotal":1,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":0,"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 03:53:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-07 06:11:10","id":49511,"name":"A Vegan Ice Cream Paradise","url":"http://veganicecream.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default","subscriber":64,"website":null,"icon":"http://veganicecream.blogspot.com/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx62/cdn3@2020_5/2020/09/06/22-11-07-140_dbf86e3e13d15411.ico","description":"All the vegan ice cream recipes you could want.","weekly":null,"link":null},"noPictureArticleList":[{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 18:48:34","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 18:48:34","id":null,"feedId":49511,"linkMd5":"38b00809c37bdfba5ea863f4baca70e3"}],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1647254790901,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":473,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":7,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":0,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"},{"spend":122649,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"}]},"extra5":1,"extra6":0,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[null,null],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{"http://us-006.herokuapp.com/":{"failCount":1,"successCount":0,"resultList":[null]},"http://us-022.herokuapp.com/":{"failCount":1,"successCount":0,"resultList":[null]}},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[],"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}}
