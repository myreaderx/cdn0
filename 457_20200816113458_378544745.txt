While phone functionality and design can enhance the user experience, security is fundamental and foundational to our relationship with our phones.There are multiple ways to build trust around the security capabilities that a device provides and we continue to invest in verifiable ways to do just that. </p><p><strong>Pixel 4a ioXt certification</strong></p><p>Today we are happy to announce that the <a href=\"https://store.google.com/product/pixel_4\">Pixel 4/4 XL</a> and the <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/pixel/pixel4a-new-helpful-google-phone/\">newly launched Pixel 4a </a>are the first Android smartphones to go through <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200810005108/en/Google-T-Mobile-Silicon-Labs-Major-Manufacturers-Partner\">ioXt certification</a> against the <a href=\"https://www.ioxtalliance.org/s/ioXt_Android_Profile_100_C-05-01-01.pdf\">Android Profile.</a>  </p><p>The <a href=\"http://ioxtalliance.org\">Internet of Secure Things Alliance (ioXt)</a> manages a security compliance assessment program for connected devices. ioXt has over 200 members across various industries, including Google, Amazon, Facebook, T-Mobile, Comcast, Zigbee Alliance, Z-Wave Alliance, Legrand, Resideo, Schneider Electric, and many others. With so many companies involved, ioXt covers a wide range of device types, including smart lighting, smart speakers, webcams, and Android smartphones. </p><p>The core focus of ioXt is “to set security standards that bring <strong>security, upgradability</strong> and <strong>transparency</strong> to the market and directly into the hands of consumers.” This is accomplished by assessing devices against a <a href=\"https://www.ioxtalliance.org/the-pledge\">baseline set of requirements</a> and relying on publicly available evidence. The goal of ioXt’s approach is to enable users, enterprises, regulators, and other stakeholders to understand the security in connected products to drive better awareness towards how these products are protecting the security and privacy of users. </p><p>ioXt’s baseline security requirements are tailored for product classes, and the <a href=\"https://www.ioxtalliance.org/s/ioXt_Android_Profile_100_C-05-01-01.pdf\">ioXt Android Profile</a> enables smartphone manufacturers to differentiate security capabilities, including biometric authentication strength, security update frequency, length of security support lifetime commitment, vulnerability disclosure program quality, and preloaded app risk minimization. </p><p>We believe that using a widely known industry consortium standard for Pixel certification provides increased trust in the security claims we make to our users. <a href=\"https://www.nccgroup.com/us/\">NCC Group</a> has published an audit report that can be downloaded <a href=\"https://research.nccgroup.com/2020/08/10/public-report-pixel-4-4xl-and-pixel-4a-ioxt-audit/\">here</a>. The report documents the evaluation of <a href=\"https://compliance.ioxtalliance.org/product/43\">Pixel 4</a>/<a href=\"https://compliance.ioxtalliance.org/product/44\">4 XL</a> and <a href=\"https://compliance.ioxtalliance.org/product/45\">Pixel 4a</a> against the ioXt Android Profile.  </p><p><strong>Security by Default</strong> is one of the most important criteria used in the ioXt Android profile. Security by Default rates devices by cumulatively scoring the risk for all preloads on a particular device. For this particular measurement, we worked with a team of university experts from the University of Cambridge, University of Strathclyde, and Johannes Kepler University in Linz to create a formula that considers the risk of platform signed apps, pregranted permissions on preloaded apps, and apps communicating using cleartext traffic. </p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-o5l5u31jNMk/Xy3Zpx3nMKI/AAAAAAAAC6w/z1sknqkVkdwYCBLYClaEkMJvn7fpq9EDQCNcBGAsYHQ/s1494/Nr9QD6WuaMG.png\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0px;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"840\" data-original-width=\"1494\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-o5l5u31jNMk/Xy3Zpx3nMKI/AAAAAAAAC6w/z1sknqkVkdwYCBLYClaEkMJvn7fpq9EDQCNcBGAsYHQ/s640/Nr9QD6WuaMG.png\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><p style=\"text-align: center;\">Screenshot of the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxkbyyl-9b8&amp;t=865s\">presentation</a> of the <a href=\"https://www.android-device-security.org/\">Android Device Security Database</a> at the <a href=\"https://android.ins.jku.at/symposium/\">Android Security Symposium 2020</a></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In partnership with those teams, Google created <a href=\"https://github.com/android/security-certification-resources/tree/master/ioXt/uraniborg\">Uraniborg</a>, an open source tool that collects necessary attributes from the device and runs it through this formula to come up with a raw score.

Android 11 continues to make important strides in these areas, and this week we’ll be sharing a series of updates and resources about Android privacy and security. But first, let’s take a quick look at some of the most important changes we’ve made in Android 11 to protect user privacy and make the platform more secure. </p><p>As shared in the “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5w5h_UdIiqs\">All things privacy in Android 11</a>” video, we’re giving users even more control over sensitive permissions. Throughout the development of this release, we have engaged deeply and frequently with our developer community to design these features in a balanced way - amplifying user privacy while minimizing developer impact. Let’s go over some of these features: </p><p><strong>One-time permission</strong>: In Android 10, we introduced a granular location permission that allows users to limit access to location only when an app is in use (aka foreground only). When presented with the new runtime permissions options, users choose foreground only location more than 50% of the time. This demonstrated to us that users really wanted finer controls for permissions. So in Android 11, we’ve introduced <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/preview/privacy/permissions#one-time\">one time permissions</a> that let users give an app access to the device microphone, camera, or location, just that one time. As an app developer, there are no changes that you need to make to your app for it to work with one time permissions, and the app can request permissions again the next time the app is used. Learn more about building privacy-friendly apps with these new changes <a href=\"https://youtu.be/MXlVj-EYgIQ\">in this video</a>. </p><p><strong>Background location:</strong> In Android 10 we added a background location usage reminder so users can see how apps are using this sensitive data on a regular basis. Users who interacted with the reminder either downgraded or denied the location permission over 75% of the time. In addition, we have done extensive research and believe that there are very few legitimate use cases for apps to require access to location in the background.  </p><p>In Android 11, background location will no longer be a permission that a user can grant via a run time prompt and it will require a more deliberate action. If your app needs background location, the system will ensure that the app first asks for foreground location. The app can then broaden its access to background location through a separate permission request, which will cause the system to take the user to Settings in order to complete the permission grant. </p><p>In February, we <a href=\"https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9799150\">announced</a> that Google Play developers will need to get approval to access background location in their app to prevent misuse. We're giving developers more time to make changes and won't be enforcing the policy for existing apps until 2021. Check out this helpful video <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTVeFJZQ28c&feature=youtu.be\">to find possible background location usage in your code</a>. </p><p><strong>Permissions auto-reset: </strong>Most users tend to download and install over 60 apps on their device but interact with only a third of these apps on a regular basis. If users haven’t used an app that targets Android 11 for an extended period of time, the system will “<a href=\"https://developer.android.com/preview/privacy/permissions#auto-reset\">auto-reset</a>” all of the granted runtime permissions associated with the app and notify the user. The app can request the permissions again the next time the app is used. If you have an app that has a legitimate need to retain permissions, you can prompt users to turn this feature OFF for your app in Settings. </p><p><strong>Data access auditing APIs: </strong>Android encourages developers to limit their access to sensitive data, even if they have been granted permission to do so. In Android 11, developers will have access to <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/preview/privacy/data-access-auditing\">new APIs</a> that will give them more transparency into their app’s usage of private and protected data. The APIs will enable apps to track when the system records the app’s access to private user data. </p><p><strong>Scoped Storage: </strong>In Android 10, we introduced <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage#scoped-storage\">scoped storage</a> which provides a filtered view into external storage, giving access to app-specific files and media collections. This change protects user privacy by limiting broad access to shared storage in many ways including changing the storage permission to only give read access to photos, videos and music and improving app storage attribution. Since Android 10, we’ve incorporated developer feedback and made many improvements to help developers adopt scoped storage, including: updated permission UI to enhance user experience, direct file path access to media to improve compatibility with existing libraries, updated APIs for modifying media, <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/preview/privacy/storage#all-files-access\">Manage External Storage</a> permission to enable select use cases that need broad files access, and protected external app directories. In Android 11, scoped storage will be mandatory for all apps that target API level 30. Learn more in this <a href=\"https://youtu.be/RjyYCUW-9tY\">video</a> and check out the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/preview/privacy/storage\">developer documentation</a> for further details.  </p><p><strong>Google Play system updates: </strong>Google Play system updates were introduced with Android 10 as part of <a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2019/05/fresher-os-with-projects-treble-and-mainline.html\">Project Mainline</a>. Their main benefit is to increase the modularity and granularity of platform subsystems within Android so we can update core OS components without needing a full OTA update from your phone manufacturer. Earlier this year, thanks to Project Mainline, we were able to quickly fix a critical vulnerability in the media decoding subsystem. Android 11 adds new modules, and maintains the security properties of existing ones. For example, Conscrypt, which provides cryptographic primitives, maintained its FIPS validation in Android 11 as well. </p><p><strong>BiometricPrompt API:</strong> Developers can now use the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/preview/features#biometric-auth\">BiometricPrompt API</a> to specify the biometric authenticator strength required by their app to unlock or access sensitive parts of the app. We are planning to add this to the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/biometric\">Jetpack Biometric library</a> to allow for backward compatibility and will share further updates on this work as it progresses.  </p><p><strong>Identity Credential API: </strong>This will unlock new use cases such as mobile drivers licences, National ID, and Digital ID. It’s being built by our security team to ensure this information is stored safely, using security hardware to secure and control access to the data, in a way that <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/techstream/privacy-preserving-credentials-for-smartphones-are-coming/\">enhances user privacy</a> as compared to traditional physical documents. We’re working with various government agencies and industry partners to make sure that Android 11 is ready for such digital-first identity experiences. </p><p>Thank you for your flexibility and feedback as we continue to build an increasingly more private and secure platform.

The goal of FuzzBench is to make it painless to rigorously evaluate fuzzing research and make fuzzing research easier for the community to adopt. <br /><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing\">Fuzzing</a> is an important bug finding technique. At Google, we’ve found tens of thousands of bugs (<a href=\"https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/list?q=-label%3AInfra%20-status%3AWontFix%2Cstatus%3ADuplicate%20Type%3DBug%2CType%3DBug-Security&amp;can=1\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list?q=-label%3AInfra%20-status%3AWontFix%2Cstatus%3ADuplicate%20Type%3DBug%2CType%3DBug-Security%20label%3AClusterFuzz&amp;can=1\">2</a>) with fuzzers like libFuzzer and AFL. There are numerous research papers that either improve upon these tools (e.g. MOpt-AFL, AFLFast, etc) or introduce new techniques (e.g. Driller, QSYM, etc) for bug finding. However, it is hard to know how well these new tools and techniques generalize on a large set of real world programs. Though research normally includes evaluations, these <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3243734.3243804\">often have shortcomings</a>—they don't use a large and diverse set of real world benchmarks, use few trials, use short trials, or lack statistical tests to illustrate if findings are significant. This is understandable since full scale experiments can be prohibitively expensive for researchers. For example, a 24-hour, 10-trial, 10 fuzzer, 20 benchmark experiment would require 2,000 CPUs to complete in a day. <br />To help solve these issues the OSS-Fuzz team is launching FuzzBench, a fully automated, open source, free service. FuzzBench provides a framework for painlessly evaluating fuzzers in a reproducible way. To use FuzzBench, researchers can simply integrate a fuzzer and FuzzBench will run an experiment for 24 hours with many trials and real world benchmarks. Based on data from this experiment, FuzzBench will produce a report comparing the performance of the fuzzer to others and give insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each fuzzer. This should allow researchers to focus more of their time on perfecting techniques and less time setting up evaluations and dealing with existing fuzzers. <br />Integrating a fuzzer with FuzzBench is simple as most integrations are less than 50 lines of code (<a href=\"https://github.com/google/fuzzbench/blob/master/fuzzers/mopt\">example</a>). Once a fuzzer is integrated, it can fuzz almost all 250+ <a href=\"https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/tree/master/projects\">OSS-Fuzz projects</a> out of the box. We have already integrated <a href=\"https://github.com/google/fuzzbench/tree/master/fuzzers\">ten fuzzers</a>, including AFL, LibFuzzer, Honggfuzz, and several academic projects such as QSYM and Eclipser. <br />Reports include statistical tests to give an idea how likely it is that performance differences between fuzzers are simply due to chance, as well as the raw data so researchers can do their own analysis. Performance is determined by the amount of covered program edges, though we plan on adding crashes as a performance metric. You can view a sample report <a href=\"https://github.com/google/fuzzbench#sample-report\">here</a>. <br /><strong>How to Participate</strong><br />Our goal is to develop FuzzBench with community contributions and input so that it becomes the gold standard for fuzzer evaluation. We invite members of the fuzzing research community to contribute their fuzzers and techniques, even while they are in development. Better evaluations will lead to more adoption and greater impact for fuzzing research. <br />We also encourage contributions of better ideas and techniques for evaluating fuzzers. Though we have made some progress on this problem, we have not solved it and we need the community’s help in developing these best practices. <br />Please join us by contributing to the <a href=\"https://github.com/google/fuzzbench\">FuzzBench repo</a> on GitHub. <div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?a=kHbvRs77psc:XHUdmYZezw0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?a=kHbvRs77psc:XHUdmYZezw0:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?i=kHbvRs77psc:XHUdmYZezw0:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog/~4/kHbvRs77psc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 02 Mar 2020 18:00:00 +0000","feedId":457,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA","linkMd5":"beaaebd473dac49a5de24e51bf533bd4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn86@2020_6/2020/08/16/11-34-53-486_682730ff2cb46673.webp","destWidth":62,"destHeight":24,"author":"Scott Westover","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn33@2020_2/2020/08/16/11-34-49-689_682730ff2cb46673.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?i=kHbvRs77psc:XHUdmYZezw0:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn42@2020_3/2020/08/16/11-34-48-970_89164306366d58ca.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog/~4/kHbvRs77psc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn46@2020_3/2020/08/16/11-34-48-867_ef6ce65eacd82ec0.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 19:34:39","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 19:34:39","title":"Vulnerability Reward Program: 2019 Year in Review","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog/~3/6HMF5UyScWs/vulnerability-reward-program-2019-year.html","description":"<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Natasha Pabrai, Jan Keller, Jessica Lin, Anna Hupa, and Adam Bacchus, Vulnerability Reward Programs at Google</span><br /><br />Our Vulnerability Reward Programs were created to reward researchers for protecting users by telling us about the security bugs they find.

We enjoy being a part of the community and we want to give back in new ways. As part of this effort, we are excited to announce an expansion of our <a href=\"https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/reward-program/index.html\">Google Vulnerability Rewards Program (VRP)</a> to cover all the critical open-source dependencies of <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine\">Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)</a>. We have designed this expansion with the goal of incentivizing the security community to work even more closely with open source projects, supporting the maintainers whose work we all rely on.<br /><br />The CNCF, in partnership with Google, recently <a href=\"https://security.googleblog.com/2020/01/securing-open-source-how-google.html\">announced</a> a bug bounty program <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/01/14/kubernetes-bug-bounty-announcement/\">for Kubernetes</a> that pays up to $10,000 for vulnerabilities discovered within the project. And today, in addition to that, we are expanding the scope of the Google VRP program to also include privilege escalation bugs in a hardened GKE lab cluster we've set up for this purpose. This will cover exploitable vulnerabilities in all dependencies that can lead to a node compromise, such as privilege escalation bugs in the Linux kernel, as well as in the underlying hardware or other components of our infrastructure that could allow for privilege escalation inside a GKE cluster.<br /><div><b><br /></b></div><div><b>How it works</b><br />We have <a href=\"https://google.github.io/kctf/vrp\">set up a lab environment</a> on GKE based on an open-source Kubernetes-based Capture-the-Flag (CTF) project called <a href=\"https://github.com/google/kctf\">kCTF</a>. Participants will be required to:<br /><div><ul><li>Break out of a containerized environment running on a Kubernetes pod and,</li><li>Read one of two secret flags: One flag is on the same pod, and the other one is in another Kubernetes pod in a different namespace.</li></ul>Flags will be changed often, and participants need to submit the secret flag as proof of successful exploitation. The lab environment does not store any data (such as the commands or files used to exploit it), so participants need the flags to demonstrate they were able to compromise it.</div><div><br /></div>The rewards will work in the following way:<br /><ul><li>Bugs that affect the lab GKE environment that can lead to stealing both flags will be rewarded up to 10,000 USD, but we will review each report on a case-by-case basis. Any vulnerabilities are in scope, regardless of where they are: Linux, Kubernetes, kCTF, Google, or any other dependency. Instructions on how to submit the flags and exploits are available <a href=\"https://google.github.io/kctf/vrp\">here</a>.</li><li>Bugs that are 100% in Google code, qualify for an additional Google VRP reward.</li><li>Bugs that are 100% in Kubernetes code, qualify for an additional CNCF Kubernetes reward.</li></ul>Any vulnerabilities found outside of GKE (like <a href=\"https://github.com/google/kctf/blob/master/SECURITY.md\">Kubernetes or the Linux kernel</a>) should be reported to the corresponding upstream project security teams. To make this program expansion as efficient as possible for the maintainers, we will only reward vulnerabilities shown to be exploitable by stealing a flag. If your exploit relies on something in upstream Kubernetes, the Linux Kernel, or any other dependency, you need to report it there first, get it resolved, and then report it to Google.&nbsp;See instructions <a href=\"https://github.com/google/kctf/blob/master/docs/vrp.md#flags\">here</a>.<br /><br />The GKE lab environment is built on top of a CTF infrastructure that we just open-sourced on <a href=\"https://github.com/google/kctf\">GitHub</a>. The infrastructure is new, and we are looking forward to receiving feedback from the community before it can be actively used in CTF competitions. By including the CTF infrastructure in the scope of the Google VRP, we want to incentivise the community to help us secure not just the CTF competitions that will use it, but also GKE and the broader Kubernetes ecosystems.<br /><br />In March 2020, we announced <a href=\"https://security.googleblog.com/2020/03/announcing-our-first-gcp-vrp-prize.html\">the winner for the first Google Cloud Platform (GCP) VRP Prize</a> and since then we have seen increased interest and research happening on Google Cloud. With this new initiative, we hope to bring even more awareness to Google Cloud  by experienced security researchers, so we can all work together to secure our shared open-source foundations.</div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?a=nOosoG_mHLs:jFO-8pMWHDM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?a=nOosoG_mHLs:jFO-8pMWHDM:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?i=nOosoG_mHLs:jFO-8pMWHDM:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog/~4/nOosoG_mHLs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 28 May 2020 13:30:00 +0000","feedId":457,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA","linkMd5":"42f86544afa1c1979899433a3edb50df","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn86@2020_6/2020/08/16/11-34-53-486_682730ff2cb46673.webp","destWidth":62,"destHeight":24,"author":"Sarah O'Rourke","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn33@2020_2/2020/08/16/11-34-49-689_682730ff2cb46673.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?i=nOosoG_mHLs:jFO-8pMWHDM:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn47@2020_4/2020/08/16/11-34-47-645_1980d779dcb59e81.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog/~4/nOosoG_mHLs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn46@2020_6/2020/08/16/11-34-48-587_866ce6ce4ce9c9b6.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 19:34:39","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 19:34:39","title":" Introducing portability of Google Authenticator 2SV codes across Android devices","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog/~3/Kzum4njTIcs/introducing-portability-of-google.html","description":"<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Dongjing He, Software Engineer; Teddy Katz, Software Engineer; Christiaan Brand, Product Manager</span><br /><span class=\"byline-author\"><br /></span>Today is World Password Day, and we found it fitting to release an update that'll make it even easier for users to manage Google Authenticator&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.google.com/landing/2step/\">2-Step Verification</a>&nbsp;(2SV)&nbsp;codes across multiple devices.

With these mechanisms, users verify their identity through their password and an additional proof of identity, such as a security key or a passcode. <br /><br />Google Authenticator makes it easy to use 2SV on accounts. In addition to supplying only a password when logging in, a user also enters a code generated by the Google Authenticator app on their phone. This is a safer alternative, used by millions of users, compared to passcodes via text message.<br /><br />Users place their trust in Google Authenticator to keep their accounts safe. As a result, security is always a high priority. We made several explicit design decisions to minimize the attack surface while increasing the overall usability of the app.&nbsp;<ul><li>We ensured that no data is sent to Google’s servers during the transfer -- communication is directly between your two devices. Your 2SV secrets can’t be accessed without having physical access to your phone and the ability to unlock it.</li><li>We implemented a variety of alerting mechanisms and in-app logs to make sure users are aware when the transfer function has been used.</li></ul><br />You can find more information about the Google Authenticator and its usage guide <a href=\"https://support.google.com/accounts/?p=transfer_codes\">here</a>.</div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?a=Kzum4njTIcs:f4j3tGRlc7c:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?a=Kzum4njTIcs:f4j3tGRlc7c:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?i=Kzum4njTIcs:f4j3tGRlc7c:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog/~4/Kzum4njTIcs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 07 May 2020 23:31:00 +0000","feedId":457,"bgimg":"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xHj2tPSVXx8/XrSaA73vDBI/AAAAAAAAB3M/vM3OK082G34kN8ekmoNAp2p65Cm__2T4ACNcBGAsYHQ/s320/authenticator.gif","linkMd5":"8aff502e884c2d2c69a9f34808d98da8","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn58@2020_5/2020/08/16/11-34-49-121_1764683970543960.webp","destWidth":320,"destHeight":220,"author":"Sarah O'Rourke","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xHj2tPSVXx8/XrSaA73vDBI/AAAAAAAAB3M/vM3OK082G34kN8ekmoNAp2p65Cm__2T4ACNcBGAsYHQ/s320/authenticator.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn42@2020_1/2020/08/16/11-34-52-015_1764683970543960.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn33@2020_2/2020/08/16/11-34-49-689_682730ff2cb46673.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?i=Kzum4njTIcs:f4j3tGRlc7c:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn37@2020_5/2020/08/16/11-34-49-727_f08cbf75505353e4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog/~4/Kzum4njTIcs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn70@2020_3/2020/08/16/11-34-49-445_6ce7061bc58b4a0f.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 19:34:39","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 19:34:39","title":"Towards native security defenses for the web ecosystem","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog/~3/EjZMQmnAAFY/towards-native-security-defenses-for.html","description":"<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Artur Janc and Lukas Weichselbaum, Information Security Engineers</span><br /><br /><i>With the recent launch of Chrome 83, and the upcoming release of Mozilla Firefox 79, web developers are gaining powerful new security mechanisms to protect their applications from common web vulnerabilities. In this post we share how our Information Security Engineering team is deploying <a href=\"https://web.dev/trusted-types/\">Trusted Types</a>, <a href=\"https://security.googleblog.com/2016/09/reshaping-web-defenses-with-strict.html\">Content Security Policy</a>, <a href=\"https://web.dev/fetch-metadata\">Fetch Metadata Request Headers</a> and the <a href=\"https://web.dev/coop-coep/\">Cross-Origin Opener Policy</a> across Google to help guide and inspire other developers to similarly adopt these features to protect their applications.</i><br /><i><br /></i><b>History</b><br /><br />Since the advent of modern web applications, such as email clients or document editors accessible in your browser, developers have been dealing with common web vulnerabilities which may allow user data to fall prey to attackers. While the web platform provides robust isolation for the underlying operating system, the isolation between web applications themselves is a different story. Issues such as <a href=\"https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/learning/xss/\">XSS</a>, <a href=\"https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf\">CSRF</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/xsleaks/xsleaks/wiki/Browser-Side-Channels\">cross-site leaks</a> have become unfortunate facets of web development, affecting almost every website at some point in time.<br /><br />These vulnerabilities are unintended consequences of some of the web's most wonderful characteristics: composability, openness, and ease of development. Simply put, the original vision of the web as a <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html\">mesh of interconnected documents</a> did not anticipate the creation of a vibrant ecosystem of web applications handling private data for billions of people across the globe. Consequently, the security capabilities of the web platform meant to help developers safeguard their users' data have evolved slowly and provided only partial protections from common flaws.<br /><br />Web developers have traditionally compensated for the platform's shortcomings by building additional security engineering tools and processes to protect their applications from common flaws; such infrastructure has often proven costly to develop and maintain. As the web continues to change to offer developers more impressive capabilities, and web applications become more critical to our lives, we find ourselves in increasing need of more powerful, all-encompassing security mechanisms built directly into the web platform.<br /><br />Over the past two years, browser makers and security engineers from Google and other companies have collaborated on the design and implementation of several major security features to defend against common web flaws. These mechanisms, which we focus on in this post, protect against injections and offer isolation capabilities, addressing two major, long-standing sources of insecurity on the web.<br /><br /><b>Injection Vulnerabilities</b><br /><b><br /></b>In the design of systems, mixing code and data is one of the canonical security anti-patterns, causing software vulnerabilities <a href=\"https://spaf.cerias.purdue.edu/tech-reps/823.pdf\">as far back as in the 1980s</a>. It is the root cause of vulnerabilities such as <a href=\"https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection\">SQL injection</a> and <a href=\"https://portswigger.net/web-security/os-command-injection\">command injection</a>, allowing the compromise of databases and application servers.<br /><br />On the web, application code has historically been intertwined with page data. HTML markup such as <span style=\"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;\">&lt;script&gt;</span> elements or event handler attributes (<span style=\"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;\">onclick</span> or <span style=\"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;\">onload</span>) allow <span style=\"font-family: inherit;\">JavaScript</span> execution; even the familiar URL can carry code and result in script execution when navigating to a <span style=\"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;\">javascript</span>: link. While sometimes convenient, the upshot of this design is that – unless the application takes care to protect itself – data used to compose an HTML page can easily inject unwanted scripts and take control of the application in the user's browser.<br /><br />Addressing this problem in a principled manner requires allowing the application to separate its data from code; this can be done by enabling two new security features: Trusted Types and Content Security Policy based on script nonces.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MBL1pBjLzv4/Xxe5sxpxSlI/AAAAAAAAAwM/xnh57nNVa4o053lQPtYJss4_HIaDldNZACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/image1.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"117\" data-original-width=\"1103\" height=\"65\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MBL1pBjLzv4/Xxe5sxpxSlI/AAAAAAAAAwM/xnh57nNVa4o053lQPtYJss4_HIaDldNZACLcBGAsYHQ/s640/image1.png\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><br /><b>Trusted Types</b><br /><i>Main article: <a href=\"http://web.dev/trusted-types\">web.dev/trusted-types</a> by <a href=\"https://web.dev/authors/koto/\">Krzysztof Kotowicz</a></i><br /><br />JavaScript functions used by developers to build web applications often rely on parsing arbitrary structure out of strings. A string which seems to contain data can be turned directly into code when passed to a common API, such as <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/innerHTML\">innerHTML</a>. This is the root cause of most <a href=\"https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/dom-based\">DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities</a>.<br /><br />Trusted Types make JavaScript code safe-by-default by restricting risky operations, such as generating HTML or creating scripts, to require a special object – a Trusted Type. The browser will ensure that any use of dangerous DOM functions is allowed only if the right object is provided to the function. As long as an application produces these objects safely in a central <a href=\"https://web.dev/trusted-types/#create-a-trusted-type-policy\">Trusted Types policy</a>, it will be free of DOM-based XSS bugs.<br /><br />You can enable Trusted Types by setting the following response header:<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1Lbp1EgYnP4/XxiV4lWhCvI/AAAAAAAAAxw/ymtCz2ptL_c_7-AewJTeRVxS2dLXvyoEgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/content%2Bsecurty%2Bpolicy%2Bimage.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"76\" data-original-width=\"1112\" height=\"41\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1Lbp1EgYnP4/XxiV4lWhCvI/AAAAAAAAAxw/ymtCz2ptL_c_7-AewJTeRVxS2dLXvyoEgCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/content%2Bsecurty%2Bpolicy%2Bimage.png\" width=\"640\" /></a></div>We have recently launched Trusted Types for all users of <a href=\"https://myactivity.google.com/\">My Google Activity</a> and are working with dozens of product teams across Google as well as JavaScript framework owners to make their code support this important safety mechanism.<br /><br />Trusted Types are supported in Chrome 83 and other Chromium-based browsers, and a <a href=\"https://github.com/w3c/webappsec-trusted-types#polyfill\">polyfill</a> is available for other user agents.<br /><br /><b>Content Security Policy based on script nonces</b><br /><i>Main article: <a href=\"https://security.googleblog.com/2016/09/reshaping-web-defenses-with-strict.html\">Reshaping web defenses with strict Content Security Policy</a></i><br /><br />Content Security Policy (CSP) allows developers to require every &lt;script&gt; on the page to contain a secret value unknown to attackers. The script <i>nonce</i> attribute, set to an unpredictable number for every page load, acts as a guarantee that a given script is under the control of the application: even if part of the page is injected by an attacker, the browser will refuse to execute any injected script which doesn't identify itself with the correct nonce. This mitigates the impact of any server-side injection bugs, such as <a href=\"https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/reflected\">reflected XSS</a> and <a href=\"https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/stored\">stored XSS</a>.<br /><br />CSP can be enabled by setting the following HTTP response header:<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nmp93SJsFjM/XxiWNieNmTI/AAAAAAAAAx4/muzJFIlTZeMazwauR5CzuMg-Gwu0Ua9nQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/randomvalue.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"72\" data-original-width=\"1158\" height=\"36\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nmp93SJsFjM/XxiWNieNmTI/AAAAAAAAAx4/muzJFIlTZeMazwauR5CzuMg-Gwu0Ua9nQCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/randomvalue.png\" width=\"640\" /></a></div>This header requires all scripts in your HTML templating system to include a nonce attribute with a value matching the one in the response header:<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GJfbRu89r6o/XxiVAHanaSI/AAAAAAAAAxk/VQ1NkvtH7NI_RyGHBvBVb8RUIWh_XUw0gCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/script%2Bnonce.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"39\" data-original-width=\"558\" height=\"27\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GJfbRu89r6o/XxiVAHanaSI/AAAAAAAAAxk/VQ1NkvtH7NI_RyGHBvBVb8RUIWh_XUw0gCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/script%2Bnonce.png\" width=\"400\" /></a></div>Our <a href=\"http://csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com/\">CSP Evaluator tool</a> can help you configure a strong policy.

CSP has mitigated the exploitation of over 30 high-risk XSS flaws across Google in the past two years.<br /><br />Nonce-based CSP is supported in Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge and other Chromium-based browsers. Partial support for this variant of CSP is also available in Safari.<br /><br /><b>Isolation Capabilities</b><br /><b><br /></b>Many kinds of web flaws are exploited by an attacker's site forcing an unwanted interaction with another web application. Preventing these issues requires browsers to offer new mechanisms to allow applications to restrict such behaviors. <i>Fetch Metadata Request Headers</i> enable building server-side restrictions when processing incoming HTTP requests; the <i>Cross-Origin Opener Policy</i> is a client-side mechanism which protects the application's windows from unwanted DOM interactions.<br /><br /><b>Fetch Metadata Request Headers</b><br /><i>Main article: <a href=\"http://web.dev/fetch-metadata\">web.dev/fetch-metadata</a> by <a href=\"https://web.dev/authors/lwe/\">Lukas Weichselbaum</a></i><br /><br />A common cause of web security problems is that applications don't receive information about the source of a given HTTP request, and thus aren't able to distinguish benign self-initiated web traffic from unwanted requests sent by other websites. This leads to vulnerabilities such as cross-site request forgery (<a href=\"https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf\">CSRF</a>) and web-based information leaks (<a href=\"https://github.com/xsleaks/xsleaks/wiki/Browser-Side-Channels\">XS-leaks</a>).<br /><br />Fetch Metadata headers, which the browser attaches to outgoing HTTP requests, solve this problem by providing the application with trustworthy information about the provenance of requests sent to the server: the source of the request, its type (for example, whether it's a navigation or resource request), and other security-relevant metadata.<br /><br />By checking the values of these new HTTP headers (Sec-Fetch-Site, Sec-Fetch-Mode and Sec-Fetch-Dest), applications can build flexible server-side logic to reject untrusted requests, similar to the following:<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HUhGp7lZ2Hg/XxfDgI8SdEI/AAAAAAAAAws/6RznPrLzhvE6ojOxhu6DxSLoESlIZVDHACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/image2.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"544\" data-original-width=\"805\" height=\"432\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HUhGp7lZ2Hg/XxfDgI8SdEI/AAAAAAAAAws/6RznPrLzhvE6ojOxhu6DxSLoESlIZVDHACLcBGAsYHQ/s640/image2.png\" width=\"640\" /></a></div>We provided a detailed explanation of this logic and adoption considerations at <a href=\"http://web.dev/fetch-metadata\">web.dev/fetch-metadata</a>. Importantly, Fetch Metadata can both complement and facilitate the adoption of <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cross-Origin_Resource_Policy_(CORP)\">Cross-Origin Resource Policy</a> which offers client-side protection against unexpected subresource loads; this header is described in detail at <a href=\"http://resourcepolicy.fyi/\">resourcepolicy.fyi</a>.<br /><br />At Google, we've enabled restrictions using Fetch Metadata headers in several major products such as Google Photos, and are following up with a large-scale rollout across our application ecosystem.<br /><br />Fetch Metadata headers are currently sent by Chrome and Chromium-based browsers and are available in development versions of Firefox.<br /><br /><b>Cross-Origin Opener Policy</b><br /><i>Main article: <a href=\"http://web.dev/coop-coep\">web.dev/coop-coep</a> by <a href=\"https://web.dev/authors/agektmr/\">Eiji Kitamura</a></i><br /><br />By default, the web permits some interactions with browser windows belonging to another application: any site can open a pop-up to your webmail client and send it messages via the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage\">postMessage</a> API, navigate it to another URL, or <a href=\"https://github.com/xsleaks/xsleaks/wiki/Browser-Side-Channels#frame-count\">obtain information about its frames</a>. All of these capabilities can lead to information leak vulnerabilities:<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xkdFeJw2kig/XxfEpuxsu9I/AAAAAAAAAw4/WoM8pW_H6qY0RR0nNyh-Mx9pKmJX62r9ACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/image3.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"490\" data-original-width=\"1171\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xkdFeJw2kig/XxfEpuxsu9I/AAAAAAAAAw4/WoM8pW_H6qY0RR0nNyh-Mx9pKmJX62r9ACLcBGAsYHQ/s640/image3.png\" width=\"640\" /></a></div>Cross-Origin Opener Policy (COOP) allows you to lock down your application to prevent such interactions.

Adding security mechanisms to the web platform – building them directly into browsers – is an important step forward for the ecosystem: browsers can help developers understand and control aspects of their sites which affect their security posture. As users update to recent versions of their favorite browsers, they will gain protections from many of the security flaws that have affected web applications in the past.<br /><br />While the security features described in this post are not a panacea, they offer fundamental building blocks that help developers build secure web applications. We're excited about the continued deployment of these mechanisms across Google, and we're looking forward to collaborating with browser makers and the web standards community to improve them in the future.<br /><br /><i>For more information about web security mechanisms and the bugs they prevent, see the <a href=\"https://speakerdeck.com/lweichselbaum/o-securing-web-apps-with-modern-platform-features\">Securing Web Apps with Modern Platform Features</a> Google I/O talk (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDtM9caQ97I\">video</a>).</i><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?a=EjZMQmnAAFY:09xH11mBL1w:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?a=EjZMQmnAAFY:09xH11mBL1w:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?i=EjZMQmnAAFY:09xH11mBL1w:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog/~4/EjZMQmnAAFY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 22 Jul 2020 20:52:00 +0000","feedId":457,"bgimg":"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MBL1pBjLzv4/Xxe5sxpxSlI/AAAAAAAAAwM/xnh57nNVa4o053lQPtYJss4_HIaDldNZACLcBGAsYHQ/w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu/image1.png","linkMd5":"9b89c1dc3204cab0c3b92ab7996b606e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn87@2020_5/2020/08/16/11-34-53-494_abb4b9be262e445a.webp","metaImg":"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MBL1pBjLzv4/Xxe5sxpxSlI/AAAAAAAAAwM/xnh57nNVa4o053lQPtYJss4_HIaDldNZACLcBGAsYHQ/w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu/image1.png","destWidth":223,"destHeight":117,"author":"Google Security PR","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MBL1pBjLzv4/Xxe5sxpxSlI/AAAAAAAAAwM/xnh57nNVa4o053lQPtYJss4_HIaDldNZACLcBGAsYHQ/s640/image1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn50@2020_4/2020/08/16/11-34-48-920_9a394dd39644c6ad.webp","https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1Lbp1EgYnP4/XxiV4lWhCvI/AAAAAAAAAxw/ymtCz2ptL_c_7-AewJTeRVxS2dLXvyoEgCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/content%2Bsecurty%2Bpolicy%2Bimage.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn30@2020_1/2020/08/16/11-34-49-621_12402039ac9e712d.webp","https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nmp93SJsFjM/XxiWNieNmTI/AAAAAAAAAx4/muzJFIlTZeMazwauR5CzuMg-Gwu0Ua9nQCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/randomvalue.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn37@2020_3/2020/08/16/11-34-48-582_ff622d5a3b626c16.webp","https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GJfbRu89r6o/XxiVAHanaSI/AAAAAAAAAxk/VQ1NkvtH7NI_RyGHBvBVb8RUIWh_XUw0gCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/script%2Bnonce.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx17/cdn98@2020_6/2020/08/16/11-34-49-554_283f1c72778d4f3d.webp","https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HUhGp7lZ2Hg/XxfDgI8SdEI/AAAAAAAAAws/6RznPrLzhvE6ojOxhu6DxSLoESlIZVDHACLcBGAsYHQ/s640/image2.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn1@2020_2/2020/08/16/11-34-48-639_cb6a5af6271632f0.webp","https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xkdFeJw2kig/XxfEpuxsu9I/AAAAAAAAAw4/WoM8pW_H6qY0RR0nNyh-Mx9pKmJX62r9ACLcBGAsYHQ/s640/image3.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn93@2020_4/2020/08/16/11-34-49-518_4a86edadc5a91dc3.webp","https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hr8Ix2S5gOE/XxiUTDXNtyI/AAAAAAAAAxU/9Y2kMBz5q2Uhc70Fn2b6R6hr8txDCLcpQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/image3%2Bfor%2Bblog.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn70@2020_1/2020/08/16/11-34-48-513_c7a4a67047e25006.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn33@2020_2/2020/08/16/11-34-49-689_682730ff2cb46673.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?i=EjZMQmnAAFY:09xH11mBL1w:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn30@2020_2/2020/08/16/11-34-48-508_ef9ab7d020f5d5d6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog/~4/EjZMQmnAAFY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn14@2020_6/2020/08/16/11-34-48-419_3ee4f4416e52e157.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 19:34:39","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 19:34:39","title":"Enhanced Safe Browsing Protection now available in Chrome","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog/~3/KrELfzzt1jg/enhanced-safe-browsing-protection-now.html","description":"<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Nathan Parker, Varun Khaneja, Eric Mill and Kiran C Nair - Chrome Safe Browsing team </span><p>Over the past few years we’ve seen threats on the web becoming increasingly sophisticated. Phishing sites rotate domains very quickly to avoid being blocked, and malware campaigns are directly targeting at-risk users. We’ve realized that to combat these most effectively, security cannot be one-size-fits-all anymore: That’s why today we are announcing Enhanced Safe Browsing protection in Chrome, a new option for users who require or want a more advanced level of security while browsing the web. </p><p>Turning on Enhanced Safe Browsing will substantially increase protection from dangerous websites and downloads. By sharing real-time data with Google Safe Browsing, Chrome can proactively protect you against dangerous sites. If you’re signed in, Chrome and other Google apps you use (Gmail, Drive, etc) will be able to provide improved protection based on a holistic view of threats you encounter on the web and attacks against your Google Account. In other words, we’re bringing the intelligence of Google’s cutting-edge security tools directly into your browser.   </p><p>Over the next year, we’ll be adding even more protections to this mode, including tailored warnings for phishing sites and file downloads and cross-product alerts.  </p><p><strong>Building upon Safe Browsing</strong></p><p>Safe Browsing’s blocklist API is an existing security protocol that protects billions of devices worldwide. Every day, Safe Browsing discovers thousands of new unsafe sites and adds them to the blocklist API that is shared with the web industry. Chrome checks the URL of each site you visit or file you download against a local list, which is updated approximately every 30 minutes. Increasingly, some sophisticated phishing sites slip through that 30-minute refresh window by switching domains very quickly.  </p><p>This protocol is designed so that Google cannot determine the actual URL Chrome visited from this information, and thus by necessity the same verdict is returned regardless of the user’s situation. This means Chrome can’t adjust protection based on what kinds of threats a particular user is seeing or the type of sites they normally visit. So while the Safe Browsing blocklist API remains very powerful and will continue to protect users, we’ve been looking for ways to provide more proactive and tailored protections.  </p><p><strong>How Enhanced Safe Browsing works</strong></p><p>When you switch to Enhanced Safe Browsing, Chrome will share additional security data directly with Google Safe Browsing to enable more accurate threat assessments. For example, Chrome will check uncommon URLs in real time to detect whether the site you are about to visit may be a phishing site. Chrome will also send a small sample of pages and suspicious downloads to help discover new threats against you and other Chrome users. </p><p>If you are signed in to Chrome, this data is temporarily linked to your Google Account. We do this so that when an attack is detected against your browser or account, Safe Browsing can tailor its protections to your situation. In this way, we can provide the most precise protection without unnecessary warnings. After a short period, Safe Browsing anonymizes this data so it is no longer connected to your account. </p><p>You can opt in to this mode by visiting Privacy and Security settings > Security > and selecting the “Enhanced protection” mode under Safe Browsing. It will be rolled out gradually in M83 on desktop platforms, with Android support coming in a future release. Enterprise administrators can control this setting via the SafeBrowsingProtectionLevel policy.  </p><p><strong>Tailored protections</strong></p><p>Chrome’s billions of users are incredibly diverse, with a full spectrum of needs and perspectives in security and privacy. We will continue to invest in both Standard and Enhanced Safe Browsing with the goal to expand Chrome’s security offerings to cover all users. <div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?a=KrELfzzt1jg:yxUkvwWfJDw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?a=KrELfzzt1jg:yxUkvwWfJDw:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?i=KrELfzzt1jg:yxUkvwWfJDw:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog/~4/KrELfzzt1jg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 19 May 2020 16:00:00 +0000","feedId":457,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA","linkMd5":"2ab81386131dad3314b8b16a965800a3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn86@2020_6/2020/08/16/11-34-53-486_682730ff2cb46673.webp","destWidth":62,"destHeight":24,"author":"Scott Westover","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn33@2020_2/2020/08/16/11-34-49-689_682730ff2cb46673.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?i=KrELfzzt1jg:yxUkvwWfJDw:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn30@2020_4/2020/08/16/11-34-48-850_4e89d17aa5c4a80c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog/~4/KrELfzzt1jg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn86@2020_3/2020/08/16/11-34-49-453_ae712bd7235eb9d3.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 19:34:39","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 19:34:39","title":"Improving Malicious Document Detection in Gmail with Deep Learning","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog/~3/yMjB493_fJk/improving-malicious-document-detection.html","description":"<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Elie Bursztein, Security &amp; Anti-Abuse Research Lead; David Tao, Software Engineer; Neil Kumaran, Product Manager, Gmail Security&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><br />Gmail protects your incoming mail against spam, phishing attempts, and malware.

The document analyzers are responsible for parsing the document, identifying common attack patterns, extracting macros, deobfuscating content, and performing feature extraction.</div><div><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"667\" data-original-width=\"1115\" height=\"382\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-F6plwyrX2Ps/XmfY128PsVI/AAAAAAAABA4/wro0asmcBdg6PgOtau_c4iuhdO4q5M6IQCNcBGAsYHQ/s640/malware-blocked-by-gmail-breakdown.PNG\" width=\"640\" /></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><br /></div></div><div>Strengthening our document detection capabilities is one of our key focus areas, as malicious documents represent 58% of the malware targeting Gmail users.

We have moved to safer default settings, migrated to a hardened memory allocator, and expanded the use of compiler mitigations that defend against classes of vulnerabilities and frustrate exploitation techniques. </p><h2>Initializing memory</h2><p>We’ve enabled forms of automatic memory initialization in both Android 11’s userspace and the Linux kernel. Uninitialized memory bugs occur in C/C++ when memory is used without having first been initialized to a known safe value. These types of bugs can be confusing, and even the term “uninitialized” is misleading. Uninitialized may seem to imply that a variable has a random value.  In reality it isn’t random. It has whatever value was previously placed there. This value may be predictable or even attacker controlled. Unfortunately this behavior can result in a serious vulnerability such as information disclosure bugs like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization\">ASLR</a> bypasses, or control flow hijacking via a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_spraying\">stack or heap spray</a>. Another possible side effect of using uninitialized values is advanced compiler optimizations may transform the code unpredictably, as this is considered <a href=\"http://blog.llvm.org/2011/05/what-every-c-programmer-should-know.html\">undefined behavior</a> by the relevant C standards. </p><p>In practice, uses of uninitialized memory are difficult to detect. Such errors may sit in the codebase unnoticed for years if the memory happens to be initialized with some \"safe\" value most of the time. When uninitialized memory results in a bug, it is often challenging to identify the source of the error, particularly if it is rarely triggered.<br><br>Eliminating an entire class of such bugs is a lot more effective than hunting them down individually. Automatic stack variable initialization relies on a feature in the Clang compiler which allows choosing initializing local variables with either zeros or a pattern.<br><br>Initializing to zero provides safer defaults for strings, pointers, indexes, and sizes. The downsides of zero init are less-safe defaults for return values, and exposing fewer bugs where the underlying code relies on zero initialization. Pattern initialization tends to expose more bugs and is generally safer for return values and less safe for strings, pointers, indexes, and sizes. </p><h2>Initializing Userspace:</h2><p>Automatic stack variable initialization is enabled throughout the entire Android userspace. During the development of Android 11, we initially selected pattern in order to uncover bugs relying on zero init and then moved to zero-init after a few months for increased safety. Platform OS developers can build with <code>`AUTO_PATTERN_INITIALIZE=true m`</code> if they want help uncovering bugs relying on zero init. </p><h2>Initializing the Kernel:</h2><p>Automatic <a href=\"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=709a972efb01efaeb97cad1adc87fe400119c8ab\">stack</a> and <a href=\"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=6471384af2a6530696fc0203bafe4de41a23c9ef\">heap</a> initialization were recently merged in the upstream Linux kernel. We have made these features available on earlier versions of Android’s kernel including <a href=\"https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/common/+/refs/heads/android-4.14-q/security/Kconfig.hardening#3\">4.14</a>, <a href=\"https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/common/+/refs/heads/android-4.19/security/Kconfig.hardening#20\">4.19</a>, and <a href=\"https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/common/+/refs/heads/android-5.4/security/Kconfig.hardening#20\">5.4</a>. These features enforce initialization of local variables and heap allocations with known values that cannot be controlled by attackers and are useless when leaked. Both features result in a performance overhead, but also prevent undefined behavior improving both stability and security. </p><p>For kernel stack initialization we adopted the <code>CONFIG_INIT_STACK_ALL</code> from upstream Linux. It currently relies on Clang pattern initialization for stack variables, although this is subject to change in the future.  </p><p>Heap initialization is controlled by two boot-time flags, init_on_alloc and init_on_free, with the former wiping freshly allocated heap objects with zeroes (think <code>s/kmalloc/kzalloc</code> in the whole kernel) and the latter doing the same before the objects are freed (this helps to reduce the lifetime of security-sensitive data). <code>init_on_alloc</code> is a lot more cache-friendly and has smaller performance impact (within 2%), therefore it has been chosen to protect Android kernels. </p><h2>Scudo is now Android's default native allocator</h2> <p>In Android 11, Scudo replaces jemalloc as the default native allocator for Android. Scudo is a hardened memory allocator designed to help detect and mitigate memory corruption bugs in the heap, such as: </p><ul> <li><a href=\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/415.html\">Double free</a>,  <li><a href=\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/590.html\">Arbitrary free</a>,  <li><a href=\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/122.html\">Heap-based buffer overflow</a>,  <li><a href=\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/416.html\">Use-after-free</a></li></ul><p>Scudo does not fully prevent exploitation but it does add a number of sanity checks which are effective at strengthening the heap against some memory corruption bugs. </p><p>It also proactively organizes the heap in a way that makes exploitation of memory corruption more difficult, by reducing the predictability of the allocation patterns, and separating allocations by sizes.  </p><p>In our internal testing, Scudo has already proven its worth by surfacing security and stability bugs that were previously undetected. </p><h2>Finding Heap Memory Safety Bugs in the Wild (GWP-ASan)</h2><p>Android 11 introduces GWP-ASan, an in-production heap memory safety bug detection tool that's integrated directly into the native allocator Scudo. GWP-ASan probabilistically detects and provides actionable reports for heap memory safety bugs when they occur, works on 32-bit and 64-bit processes, and is enabled by default for system processes and system apps. </p><p>GWP-ASan is also <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/gwp-asan\">available for developer applications</a> via a one line opt-in in an app's AndroidManifest.xml, with no complicated build support or recompilation of prebuilt libraries necessary. </p><h2>Software Tag-Based KASAN</h2><p>Continuing work on <a href=\"https://security.googleblog.com/2019/08/adopting-arm-memory-tagging-extension.html\">adopting the Arm Memory Tagging Extension</a> (MTE) in Android, Android 11 includes support for kernel <a href=\"https://clang.llvm.org/docs/HardwareAssistedAddressSanitizerDesign.html\">HWASAN</a>, also known as <a href=\"https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/dev-tools/kasan.html#software-tag-based-kasan\">Software Tag-Based KASAN</a>. Userspace <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/hwasan\">HWASAN</a> is supported since Android 10. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/dev-tools/kasan.html\">KernelAddressSANitizer</a> (KASAN) is a dynamic memory error detector designed to find out-of-bound and use-after-free bugs in the Linux kernel. Its <a href=\"https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/dev-tools/kasan.html#software-tag-based-kasan\">Software Tag-Based mode</a> is a software implementation of the memory tagging concept for the kernel. Software Tag-Based KASAN is available in 4.14, 4.19 and 5.4 Android kernels, and can be enabled with the CONFIG_KASAN_SW_TAGS kernel configuration option. Currently Tag-Based KASAN only supports tagging of slab memory; support for other types of memory (such as stack and globals) will be added in the future. </p><p>Compared to <a href=\"https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/dev-tools/kasan.html#generic-kasan\">Generic KASAN</a>, Tag-Based KASAN has significantly lower memory requirements (see <a href=\"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=0116523cfffa62aeb5aa3b85ce7419f3dae0c1b8\">this kernel commit</a> for details), which makes it usable on dog food testing devices. Another use case for Software Tag-Based KASAN is checking the existing kernel code for compatibility with memory tagging. As Tag-Based KASAN is based on similar concepts as the future in-kernel MTE support, making sure that kernel code works with Tag-Based KASAN will ease in-kernel MTE integration in the future. </p><h2>Expanding existing compiler mitigations</h2><p>We’ve continued to expand the compiler mitigations that have been rolled out in <a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2018/06/compiler-based-security-mitigations-in.html\">prior</a> <a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2019/05/queue-hardening-enhancements.html\">releases</a> as well. This includes adding both integer and bounds sanitizers to some core libraries that were lacking them. For example, the libminikin fonts library and the libui rendering library are now bounds sanitized. We’ve hardened the NFC stack by implementing both integer overflow sanitizer and bounds sanitizer in those components. </p><p>In addition to the hard mitigations like sanitizers, we also continue to expand our use of <a href=\"https://source.android.com/devices/tech/debug/cfi\">CFI</a> as an exploit mitigation. CFI has been enabled in Android’s <a href=\"https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/system/netd/+/1208864/\">networking daemon</a>, <a href=\"https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/packages/modules/DnsResolver/+/1207886/\">DNS resolver</a>, and more of our core javascript libraries like libv8 and the PacProcessor. </p><h2>The effectiveness of our software codec sandbox</h2>Prior to the Release of Android 10 we <a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2019/05/queue-hardening-enhancements.html\">announced a new constrained sandbox for software codecs</a>. We’re really pleased with the results. Thus far, Android 10 is the first Android release since the infamous stagefright vulnerabilities in Android 5.0  with zero critical-severity vulnerabilities in the media frameworks.  <p><i>Thank you to Jeff Vander Stoep, Alexander Potapenko, Stephen Hines, Andrey Konovalov, Mitch Phillips, Ivan Lozano, Kostya Kortchinsky, Christopher Ferris, Cindy Zhou, Evgenii Stepanov, Kevin Deus, Peter Collingbourne, Elliott Hughes, Kees Cook and Ken Chen for their contributions to this post.</i></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?a=3-61oQAFT4o:IEkAxfEY9kk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?a=3-61oQAFT4o:IEkAxfEY9kk:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?i=3-61oQAFT4o:IEkAxfEY9kk:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog/~4/3-61oQAFT4o\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 30 Jun 2020 17:02:00 +0000","feedId":457,"bgimg":"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Cu08WoRm1eM/Xvo4mTKDbUI/AAAAAAAAJDM/ZKDhbnisbToohEu7C0O0HENnjtOantdxQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/158244028__30318964__148018.png","linkMd5":"8d69862c118f43195f6dbba0b063a9f6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn62@2020_3/2020/08/16/11-34-47-731_5f219d10bf9a6141.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":512,"author":"Scott Westover","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Cu08WoRm1eM/Xvo4mTKDbUI/AAAAAAAAJDM/ZKDhbnisbToohEu7C0O0HENnjtOantdxQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/158244028__30318964__148018.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn74@2020_2/2020/08/16/11-34-48-672_5f219d10bf9a6141.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn33@2020_2/2020/08/16/11-34-49-689_682730ff2cb46673.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?i=3-61oQAFT4o:IEkAxfEY9kk:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn25@2020_2/2020/08/16/11-34-48-500_1eb7322e48e954de.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog/~4/3-61oQAFT4o":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn82@2020_2/2020/08/16/11-34-47-597_e25e8a798218dd43.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 19:34:39","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 19:34:39","title":"How Google Play Protect kept users safe in 2019","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog/~3/JyGaBQG4BzU/how-google-play-protect-kept-users-safe.html","description":"<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Rahul Mishra, Program Manager, Android Security and Privacy Team</span><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1pDHseHzdk4/XmfJO3FUBBI/AAAAAAAACFY/nzHP1jr6A8ssnFRKAwC7icRGtRmCD8juQCNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/howGppKeptUsersSafe.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"763\" data-original-width=\"1366\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1pDHseHzdk4/XmfJO3FUBBI/AAAAAAAACFY/nzHP1jr6A8ssnFRKAwC7icRGtRmCD8juQCNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/howGppKeptUsersSafe.png\" /></a></div><span class=\"byline-author\"><br /></span>Through 2019, Google Play Protect continued to improve the security for 2.5 billion Android devices.

Since October 2019, Play Protect issued 380,000 warnings for install attempts using this system. <br /><strong>Warnings for apps targeting lower Android versions</strong><br />Malware developers intentionally target devices running long outdated versions of Android to abuse exploits that have recently been patched. In 2018, Google Play started requiring new apps and app updates be built for new versions of the <a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2019/02/expanding-target-api-level-requirements.html\">Android OS</a>. This strategy ensures that users downloading apps from Google Play recieve apps that take advantage of the latest privacy and security improvements in the OS. <br />In 2019, we improved on this strategy with warnings to the user. Play Protect now notifies users when they install an app that is designed for outdated versions. The user can then make an informed decision to proceed with the installation or stop the app from being installed so they can look for an alternative that target the most current version of Android. <br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-j6_n53NG-zk/XmfJeZqTmhI/AAAAAAAACFc/FfA981dYtakpY5k64tyRIhAFuh3KuUclQCNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/app-blocked.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1079\" data-original-width=\"566\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-j6_n53NG-zk/XmfJeZqTmhI/AAAAAAAACFc/FfA981dYtakpY5k64tyRIhAFuh3KuUclQCNcBGAsYHQ/s640/app-blocked.png\" width=\"334\" /></a></div><strong>Uploading rare apps for scanning</strong><br />The Android app ecosystem is growing at an exponential rate. Millions of new app versions are created and shared outside of Google Play daily posing a unique scaling challenge. Knowledge of new and rare apps is essential to provide the best protection possible. <br />We added a new feature that lets users help the fight against malware by sending apps Play Protect hasn't seen before for scanning during installation. The upload to Google’s scanning services preserves the privacy of the user and enables Play Protect to improve the protection for all users.  <br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-boOhs4h0IGM/XmfJzGI_XeI/AAAAAAAACFo/IqAiCvpVcQAVA96oeINqaZp8kOd98VdUQCNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/app-scanning.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1079\" data-original-width=\"566\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-boOhs4h0IGM/XmfJzGI_XeI/AAAAAAAACFo/IqAiCvpVcQAVA96oeINqaZp8kOd98VdUQCNcBGAsYHQ/s640/app-scanning.png\" width=\"334\" /></a></div><strong>Integration with Google’s Files app</strong><br /><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.nbu.files&amp;hl=en_US\">Google’s Files app</a> is used by hundreds of millions of people every month to manage the storage on their device, share files safely, and clean up clutter and duplicate files.

Such a thriving ecosystem can only be achieved and sustained when trust and safety is one of its key foundations. Over the last few years we’ve made the trust and safety of Google Play a top priority, and have continued our investments and improvements in our abuse detection systems, policies, and teams to fight against bad apps and malicious actors. <br /> In 2019, we continued to strengthen our policies (especially to <a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2019/08/committed-to-safer-google-play-for.html\">better protect kids and families</a>), continued to improve <a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2019/04/improving-update-process-with-your.html#my_anchor\">our developer approval process</a>, initiated a deeper collaboration with security industry partners through the <a href=\"https://security.googleblog.com/2019/11/the-app-defense-alliance-bringing.html\">App Defense Alliance</a>, enhanced our machine learning detection systems analyzing an app’s code, metadata, and user engagement signals for any suspicious content or behaviors, as well as scaling the number and the depth of manual reviews. The combination of these efforts have resulted in a much cleaner Play Store: <br /> <ul><li>Google Play released a <a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2018/10/providing-safe-and-secure-experience.html\">new policy</a> in 2018 to stop apps from unnecessarily accessing privacy-sensitive SMS and Call Log data. We saw a <strong>significant, 98% decrease in apps accessing SMS and Call Log data</strong> as developers partnered with us to update their apps and protect users. The remaining 2% are comprised of apps that require SMS and Call Log data to perform their core function.  </li><li>One of the best ways to protect users from bad apps is to keep those apps out of the Play Store in the first place. Our improved vetting mechanisms <strong>stopped over 790,000 policy-violating app submissions before they were ever published to the Play Store</strong>.  </li><li>Similarly to our SMS and Call Log policy, we also enacted a <a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2019/05/building-safer-google-play-for-kids.html\">policy</a> to better protect families in May 2019. After putting this in place, we worked with developers to <strong>update or remove tens of thousands of apps, </strong>making the Play Store a safer place for everyone. </li></ul>In addition we’ve launched a refreshed <a href=\"https://www.android.com/play-protect/\">Google Play Protect</a> experience, our built-in malware protection for Android devices. Google Play Protect scans over 100B apps everyday, providing users with information about potential security issues and actions they can take to keep their devices safe and secure. Last year, Google Play Protect also prevented more than 1.9B malware installs from non-Google Play sources. <br /> While we are proud of what we were able to achieve in partnership with our developer community, we know there is more work to be done. Adversarial bad actors will continue to devise new ways to evade our detection systems and put users in harm's way for their own gains. Our commitment in building the world's safest and most helpful app platform will continue in 2020, and we will continue to invest in the key app safety areas mentioned in last year’s <a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2019/02/how-we-fought-bad-apps-and-malicious.html\">blog post</a>: <br /> <ul><li>Strengthening app safety policies to protect user privacy  </li><li>Faster detection of bad actors and blocking repeat offenders  </li><li>Detecting and removing apps with harmful content and behaviors </li></ul>Our teams of passionate product managers, engineers, policy experts, and operations leaders will continue to work with the developer community to accelerate the pace of innovation, and deliver a safer app store to billions of Android users worldwide. <br /> <br /><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?a=7nXscNqjOnA:pGrEpcVTD9M:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?a=7nXscNqjOnA:pGrEpcVTD9M:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?i=7nXscNqjOnA:pGrEpcVTD9M:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog/~4/7nXscNqjOnA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 11 Feb 2020 18:00:00 +0000","feedId":457,"bgimg":"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tV79Ie4almg/XkHforVZe_I/AAAAAAAAODY/k1GOj2riId4Z9Yvdx0i7gFr6EXq8Vv7UACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/fightingBadAppsHero.png","linkMd5":"b93640e9e8b31fae941307dc56cabc2f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn10@2020_2/2020/08/16/11-34-47-950_ff25b80455629c7b.webp","destWidth":1365,"destHeight":768,"author":"Scott Westover","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tV79Ie4almg/XkHforVZe_I/AAAAAAAAODY/k1GOj2riId4Z9Yvdx0i7gFr6EXq8Vv7UACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/fightingBadAppsHero.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx17/cdn42@2020_3/2020/08/16/11-34-48-641_ff25b80455629c7b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn33@2020_2/2020/08/16/11-34-49-689_682730ff2cb46673.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?i=7nXscNqjOnA:pGrEpcVTD9M:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn18@2020_2/2020/08/16/11-34-49-831_e022f845e63ea6fb.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog/~4/7nXscNqjOnA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn61@2020_5/2020/08/16/11-34-48-666_9278f7526fc02c22.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 19:34:39","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 19:34:39","title":"Say hello to OpenSK: a fully open-source security key implementation","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog/~3/rHM7PgY6L5c/say-hello-to-opensk-fully-open-source.html","description":"<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Elie Bursztein, Security &amp; Anti-abuse Research Lead, and Jean-Michel Picod, Software Engineer, Google&nbsp;</span><br /><span class=\"byline-author\"><br /></span><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div><br /> Today, <a href=\"https://fidoalliance.org/how-fido-works/\">FIDO</a> security keys are reshaping the way online accounts are protected by providing an easy, phishing-resistant form of two-factor authentication (2FA) that is trusted by a growing number of websites, including Google, social networks, cloud providers, and many others.

To support our community of security researchers and to help protect our users around the world during COVID-19, we are announcing a temporary expansion of our <a href=\"https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/research-grants/\">Vulnerability Research Grant</a> efforts. <br /><br />In light of new challenges caused by the coronavirus outbreak, we are expanding this initiative by&nbsp; creating a COVID-19 grant fund. As of today, every Google VRP Bug Hunter who submitted at least two remunerated reports from 2018 through April 2020  will be eligible for a $1,337 research grant. We are dedicating these grants to support our researchers during this time. We are committed to protecting our users and we want to encourage the research community to help us identify threats and to prevent potential vulnerabilities in our products.<br /><br />We understand the individual challenges COVID-19 has placed on the research community are different for everyone and we hope that these grants will allow us to support our Bug Hunters during these uncertain times. Even though our grants are intended to recognize the efforts of our frequent researchers regardless of their results, as always, bugs found during the grant are eligible for regular rewards per the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/reward-program/index.html\">Vulnerability Reward Program (VRP) rules</a>. We are aware that some of our partners might not be interested in monetary grants. In such cases, we will offer the option to donate the grant to an established COVID-19 related charity and within our discretion, will monetarily match these charitable donations.<br /><br />For those of you who recently joined us or are planning to start, it’s never too late. We are committed to continue the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/research-grants/\">Vulnerability Research Grant</a> program throughout 2020, so stay tuned for future announcements and follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GoogleVRP\">@GoogleVRP</a>!<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?a=OMSQXrAQrxM:iR0dqVDrFxE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?a=OMSQXrAQrxM:iR0dqVDrFxE:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?i=OMSQXrAQrxM:iR0dqVDrFxE:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog/~4/OMSQXrAQrxM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 20 Apr 2020 14:30:00 +0000","feedId":457,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA","linkMd5":"fb66702cf08cacde1f5d25f5ca39ef75","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn86@2020_6/2020/08/16/11-34-53-486_682730ff2cb46673.webp","destWidth":62,"destHeight":24,"author":"Sarah O'Rourke","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn33@2020_2/2020/08/16/11-34-49-689_682730ff2cb46673.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?i=OMSQXrAQrxM:iR0dqVDrFxE:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn29@2020_4/2020/08/16/11-34-47-637_8643741f8f058bab.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog/~4/OMSQXrAQrxM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn85@2020_6/2020/08/16/11-34-47-605_d4ccd6c3923d6fa2.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 19:34:39","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 19:34:39","title":"How Google does certificate lifecycle management","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog/~3/_nQ6uZPSoTM/how-google-does-certificate-lifecycle.html","description":"<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Siddharth Bhai and Ryan Hurst, Product Managers, Google Cloud&nbsp;</span><br /><span class=\"byline-author\"><br /></span>Over the last few years, we’ve seen the use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) on the web increase to more than 96% of all traffic seen by a Chrome browser on Chrome OS.

The maximum certificate validity for public certificates has gone from 5 years to 2 years (<a href=\"https://cabforum.org/2017/03/17/ballot-193-825-day-certificate-lifetimes/\">CA/Browser Forum</a>), and that will drop to 1 year in the near future. To reduce the number of outages caused by manual certificate enrollments, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has standardized Automatic Certificate Management Environment (<a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8555\">ACME</a>). ACME enables Certificate Authorities (CAs) to offer TLS certificates for the public web in an automated and interoperable way.&nbsp;<div><br />As we round off this exciting tour of <a href=\"https://www.feistyduck.com/ssl-tls-and-pki-history/\">recent TLS history</a>, we’d be remiss if we didn’t mention <a href=\"https://letsencrypt.org/\">Let’s Encrypt</a> - the first publicly trusted non-profit CA. Their focus on automation and TLS by default has been foundational to this massive increase in TLS usage. In fact, Let’s Encrypt just issued their billionth (!) certificate. Google has been an active supporter of Let’s Encrypt because we believe the work they do to make TLS accessible is important for the security and resilience of the Internet's infrastructure. Keep rocking, Let’s Encrypt!</div><div><br /></div><b>Simplifying certificate lifecycle management for Google’s users</b><div><b><br /></b></div>These are important strides we are making collectively in the security community. At the same time, these efforts mean we are moving to shorter-lived keys to improve security, which in-turn requires more frequent certificate renewals. Further, infrastructure deployments are getting more heterogeneous. Web traffic is served from multiple datacenters, often from different providers. This makes it hard to manually keep tabs on which certificates need renewing and ensuring new certificates are deployed correctly. So what is the way forward?&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>With the adoption numbers cited above, it’s clear that TLS, Web PKI, and certificate lifecycle management are foundational to every product we and our customers build and deploy. This is why we have been expanding significant effort to enable TLS by default for our products and services, while also automating certificate renewals to make certificate lifecycle management more reliable, globally scalable, and trustworthy for our customers. Our goal is simple: We want to ensure TLS just works out of the box regardless of which Google service you use.</div><div><br /></div><div>In support of that goal, we have enabled automatic management of TLS certificates for Google services using an internal-only ACME service, <a href=\"https://security.googleblog.com/2017/01/the-foundation-of-more-secure-web.html\">Google Trust Services</a>. This applies to our own products and services, as well as for our customers across Alphabet and Google Cloud. As a result, our users no longer need to worry about things like certificate expiration, because we automatically refresh the certificates for our customers. Some implementation highlights include:</div><br /><ul><li>All Blogger blogs, Google Sites, and Google My Business sites now get HTTPS by default for their custom domains.</li><li>Google Cloud customers get the benefits of Managed TLS on their domains. So: </li><ul><li>Developers building with Firebase, Cloud Run, and AppEngine automatically get HTTPS for their applications.</li><li>When deploying applications with Google Kubernetes Engine or behind Google Cloud Load Balancing (GCLB), certificate management is taken care of if customers choose to use Google-managed certificates. This also makes TLS use with these products easy and reliable.</li></ul></ul>Performance, scalability, and reliability are foundational requirements for Google services. We have established our own publicly trusted CA, Google Trust Services to ensure we can meet those criteria for our products and services. At the same time, we believe in user choice. So even as we make it easier for you to use Google Trust Services, we have also made it possible across Google’s products and services to use Let’s Encrypt. This choice can be made easily through the <a href=\"https://letsencrypt.org/docs/caa/\">creation of a CAA record</a> indicating your preference.<div><br /></div><div>While everyone appreciates TLS working out of the box, we also know power users have specialized needs. This is why we have provided rich capabilities in <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/use-ssl-policies\">Google Cloud Load Balancing</a> to let customers control policies around TLS termination.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>In addition, through our work on <a href=\"https://www.certificate-transparency.org/what-is-ct\">Certificate Transparency</a> in collaboration with other organizations, we have made it easier for our customers to protect their and their customers’ brands by monitoring the WebPKI ecosystem for certificates issued for their domains or those that look similar to their domains, so they can take proactive measures to stop any abuse before it becomes an issue. For example, Facebook used Certificate Transparency Logs to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/notes/protect-the-graph/detecting-phishing-domains-using-certificate-transparency/2037453483161459/\">catch</a> a number of phishing websites that tried to impersonate their services.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>We recognize how important security, privacy, and reliability are to you and have been investing across our product portfolio to ensure that when it comes to TLS, you have the tools you need to deploy with confidence. Going forward, we look forward to a continued partnership to make the Internet a safer place together.</div></div></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?a=_nQ6uZPSoTM:GszrbJXy8us:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?a=_nQ6uZPSoTM:GszrbJXy8us:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?i=_nQ6uZPSoTM:GszrbJXy8us:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog/~4/_nQ6uZPSoTM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 10 Mar 2020 16:00:00 +0000","feedId":457,"bgimg":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/uOIkSv_2R5_4z4HdARZ51f3XIh1YHXcn8_zbPu61_RVTPVGXcOtbvBj2H4_1Ebqq7Cv9y81O1qjz51fyKSRHwiTRwWF5pabeXm7ZRPK8f4AfiOirlhIzbZLyPlAXFf94yVb8RvX1","linkMd5":"97b516463211a8c52d48bd55c219103f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn80@2020_5/2020/08/16/11-34-47-675_cb636c7282ba9657.webp","destWidth":1600,"destHeight":809,"author":"Sarah O'Rourke","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/uOIkSv_2R5_4z4HdARZ51f3XIh1YHXcn8_zbPu61_RVTPVGXcOtbvBj2H4_1Ebqq7Cv9y81O1qjz51fyKSRHwiTRwWF5pabeXm7ZRPK8f4AfiOirlhIzbZLyPlAXFf94yVb8RvX1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn46@2020_2/2020/08/16/11-34-49-856_cb636c7282ba9657.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn33@2020_2/2020/08/16/11-34-49-689_682730ff2cb46673.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?i=_nQ6uZPSoTM:GszrbJXy8us:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn13@2020_3/2020/08/16/11-34-49-599_1eef6f9ce676e099.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog/~4/_nQ6uZPSoTM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn21@2020_6/2020/08/16/11-34-48-464_ea812764ce3a51ef.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 19:34:39","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 19:34:39","title":"Helping Developers with Permission Requests","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog/~3/YubwiPLNdqU/helping-developers-with-permission.html","description":"<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Sai Teja Peddinti, Nina Taft and Igor Bilogrevic from PDPO Applied Privacy Research, and Pauline Anthonysamy from Android Security and Privacy.</span> <br />User trust is critical to the success of developers of every size. On the Google Play Store, we aim to help developers boost the trust of their users, by surfacing signals in the Developer Console about how to improve their privacy posture. Towards this aim, we surface a message to developers when we think their app is asking for permission that is likely unnecessary.  <br />This is important because numerous studies have shown that user trust can be affected when the purpose of a permission is not clear.<sup>1</sup> In addition, research has shown that when users are given a choice between similar apps, and one of them requests fewer permissions than the other, they choose the app with fewer permissions.<sup>2</sup>  <br />Determining whether or not a permission request is necessary can be challenging. Android developers request permissions in their apps for many reasons - some related to core functionality, and others related to personalization, testing, advertising, and other factors. To do this, we identify a peer set of apps with similar functionality and compare a developer’s permission requests to that of their peers. If a very large percentage of these similar apps are not asking for a permission, and the developer is, we then let the developer know that their permission request is unusual compared to their peers. Our determination of the peer set is more involved than simply using Play Store categories. Our algorithm combines multiple signals that feed Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning technology to determine this set. A full explanation of our method is outlined in our recent publication, entitled “<em>Reducing Permissions Requests in Mobile Apps</em>” that appeared in the Internet Measurement Conference (IMC) in October 2019.<sup>3</sup> (Note that the threshold for surfacing the warning signal, as stated in this paper, is subject to change.) <br />We surface this information to developers in the Play Console and we let the developer make the final call as to whether or not the permission is truly necessary. It is possible that the developer has a feature unlike all of its peers. Once a developer removes a permission, they won’t see the warning any longer. Note that the warning is based on our computation of the set of peer apps similar to the developers. This is an evolving set, frequently recomputed, so the message may go away if there is an underlying change to the set of peers apps and their behavior. Similarly, even if a developer is not currently seeing a warning about a permission, they might in the future if the underlying peer set and its behavior changes. An example warning is depicted below. <br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7w0iwnnM8YY/XldGN6fto2I/AAAAAAAAB_M/C0r1LZLc89kXAItDgEekHxAKueVo75N8gCNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Anomalous%2Bpermission%2Bwarning%2B%2528modified%2B2%2529.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"562\" data-original-width=\"974\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7w0iwnnM8YY/XldGN6fto2I/AAAAAAAAB_M/C0r1LZLc89kXAItDgEekHxAKueVo75N8gCNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Anomalous%2Bpermission%2Bwarning%2B%2528modified%2B2%2529.png\" /></a></div><br />This warning also helps to remind developers that they are not obligated to include all of the permission requests occurring within the libraries they include inside their apps. We are pleased to say that in the first year after deployment of this advice signal nearly 60% of warned apps removed permissions. Moreover, this occurred across all Play Store categories and all app popularity levels. The breadth of this developer response impacted over 55 billion app installs.<sup>3</sup> This warning is one component of Google’s larger strategy to help protect users and help developers achieve good security and privacy practices, such as <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/technology/safety-security/project-strobe/\">Project Strobe</a>, <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/training/permissions/usage-notes\">our guidelines on permissions best practices</a>, and <a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2019/12/an-update-on-android-tls-adoption.html\">our requirements around safe traffic handling</a>. <br /><em>Acknowledgements</em><br /><em>Giles Hogben, Android Play Dashboard and Pre-Launch Report teams</em><br /><h2><em>References</em></h2><em>[1] Modeling Users’ Mobile App Privacy Preferences: Restoring Usability in a Sea of Permission Settings, by J.

As a developer, you want to keep data safe, and in the hands of the party intended to use. But if you’re like most Android developers, you don’t have a dedicated security team to help encrypt your app’s data properly. By searching the web to learn how to encrypt data, you might get answers that are several years out of date and provide incorrect examples. </p><p>The <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/topic/security/data.md\">Jetpack Security</a> (JetSec) crypto library provides abstractions for encrypting Files and SharedPreferences objects. The library promotes the use of the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/training/articles/keystore\">AndroidKeyStore</a> while using safe and well-known <a href=\"https://github.com/google/tink/blob/master/docs/PRIMITIVES.md\">cryptographic primitives</a>. Using EncryptedFile and EncryptedSharedPreferences allows you to locally protect files that may contain sensitive data, API keys, OAuth tokens, and other types of secrets.  </p><p>Why would you want to encrypt data in your app? Doesn’t Android, since 5.0, <a href=\"https://source.android.com/security/encryption\">encrypt the contents of the user's data partition</a> by default? It certainly does, but there are some use cases where you may want an extra level of protection. If your app uses <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/shared\">shared storage</a>, you should encrypt the data. In the app home directory, your app should encrypt data if your app handles sensitive information including but not limited to personally identifiable information (PII), health records, financial details, or enterprise data. When possible, we recommend that you tie this information to biometrics for an extra level of protection.  </p><p>Jetpack Security is based on <a href=\"https://github.com/google/tink\">Tink</a>, an open-source, cross-platform security project from Google. Tink might be appropriate if you need general encryption, hybrid encryption, or something similar. Jetpack Security data structures are fully compatible with Tink. </p><h2>Key Generation</h2>  <p>Before we jump into encrypting your data, it’s important to understand how your encryption keys will be kept safe. Jetpack Security uses a <em>master key</em>, which encrypts all subkeys that are used for each cryptographic operation. JetSec provides a recommended default master key in the MasterKeys class. This class uses a basic AES256-GCM key which is generated and stored in the AndroidKeyStore. The AndroidKeyStore is a container which stores cryptographic keys in the TEE or StrongBox, making them hard to extract. Subkeys are stored in a configurable  SharedPreferences object.  </p><p>Primarily, we use the AES256_GCM_SPEC specification in Jetpack Security, which is recommended for general use cases. AES256-GCM is symmetric and generally fast on modern devices.  </p><pre><br />val keyAlias = MasterKeys.getOrCreate(MasterKeys.AES256_GCM_SPEC)<br /></pre> <p>For apps that require more configuration, or handle very sensitive data, it’s recommended to build your <code>KeyGenParameterSpec</code>, choosing options that make sense for your use. Time-bound keys with <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/biometric\">BiometricPrompt</a> can provide an extra level of protection against rooted or compromised devices. </p><p>Important options: </p><ul> <li><code>userAuthenticationRequired()</code> and <code>userAuthenticationValiditySeconds()</code> can be used to create a time-bound key. Time-bound keys require authorization using <code>BiometricPrompt</code> for both encryption and decryption of symmetric keys.   <li><code>unlockedDeviceRequired()</code> sets a flag that helps ensure key access cannot happen if the device is not unlocked. This flag is available on Android Pie and higher.  <li>Use <code>setIsStrongBoxBacked()</code>, to run crypto operations on a stronger separate chip. This has a slight performance impact, but is more secure. It’s available on some devices that run Android Pie or higher. </li></ul><p><strong>Note:</strong> If your app needs to encrypt data in the background, you should not use time-bound keys or require that the device is unlocked, as you will not be able to accomplish this without a user present. </p><pre><br />// Custom Advanced Master Key<br />val advancedSpec = KeyGenParameterSpec.Builder(<br />    \"master_key\",<br />    KeyProperties.PURPOSE_ENCRYPT or KeyProperties.PURPOSE_DECRYPT<br />).apply {<br />    setBlockModes(KeyProperties.BLOCK_MODE_GCM)<br />    setEncryptionPaddings(KeyProperties.ENCRYPTION_PADDING_NONE)<br />    setKeySize(256)<br />    setUserAuthenticationRequired(true)<br />    setUserAuthenticationValidityDurationSeconds(15) // must be larger than 0<br />    if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.P) {<br />        setUnlockedDeviceRequired(true)<br />        setIsStrongBoxBacked(true)<br />    }<br />}.build()<br /><br />val advancedKeyAlias = MasterKeys.getOrCreate(advancedSpec)<br /></pre> <h3>Unlocking time-bound keys</h3>  <p>You must use BiometricPrompt to authorize the device if your key was created with the following options: </p><ul> <li><code>userAuthenticationRequired</code> is true  <li><code>userAuthenticationValiditySeconds </code>> 0 </li></ul><p>After the user authenticates, the keys are unlocked for the amount of time set in the validity seconds field. The AndroidKeystore does not have an API to query key settings, so your app  must keep track of these settings. You should build your BiometricPrompt instance in the <code>onCreate()</code> method of the activity where you present the dialog to the user. </p><p>BiometricPrompt code to unlock time-bound keys </p><pre>// Activity.onCreate<br /><br />val promptInfo = PromptInfo.Builder()<br />    .setTitle(\"Unlock?\")<br />    .setDescription(\"Would you like to unlock this key?\")<br />    .setDeviceCredentialAllowed(true)<br />    .build()<br /><br />val biometricPrompt = BiometricPrompt(<br />    this, // Activity<br />    ContextCompat.getMainExecutor(this),<br />    authenticationCallback<br />)<br /><br />private val authenticationCallback = object : AuthenticationCallback() {<br />        override fun onAuthenticationSucceeded(<br />            result: AuthenticationResult<br />        ) {<br />            super.onAuthenticationSucceeded(result)<br />            // Unlocked -- do work here.<br />        }<br />        override fun onAuthenticationError(<br />            errorCode: Int, errString: CharSequence<br />        ) {<br />            super.onAuthenticationError(errorCode, errString)<br />            // Handle error.<br />        }<br />    }<br /><br />To use:<br />biometricPrompt.authenticate(promptInfo)<br /></pre><h2>Encrypt Files</h2>  <p>Jetpack Security includes an EncryptedFile class, which removes the challenges of encrypting file data. Similar to File, EncryptedFile provides a FileInputStream object for reading and a FileOutputStream object for writing. Files are encrypted using <a href=\"https://github.com/google/tink/blob/master/docs/PRIMITIVES.md#streaming-authenticated-encryption-with-associated-data\">Streaming AEAD, which follows the OAE2 definition</a>. The data is divided into chunks and encrypted using AES256-GCM in such a way that it's not possible to reorder. </p><pre>val secretFile = File(filesDir, \"super_secret\")<br />val encryptedFile = EncryptedFile.Builder(<br />    secretFile,<br />    applicationContext,<br />    advancedKeyAlias,<br />    FileEncryptionScheme.AES256_GCM_HKDF_4KB)<br />    .setKeysetAlias(\"file_key\") // optional<br />    .setKeysetPrefName(\"secret_shared_prefs\") // optional<br />    .build()<br /><br />encryptedFile.openFileOutput().use { outputStream -><br />    // Write data to your encrypted file<br />}<br /><br />encryptedFile.openFileInput().use { inputStream -><br />    // Read data from your encrypted file<br />}<br /></pre> <h2>Encrypt SharedPreferences</h2>  <p>If your application needs to save Key-value pairs - such as API keys - JetSec provides the EncryptedSharedPreferences class, which uses the same SharedPreferences interface that you’re used to. </p><p>Both keys and values are encrypted. Keys are encrypted using <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5297\">AES256-SIV-CMAC</a>, which provides a deterministic cipher text; values are encrypted with AES256-GCM and are bound to the encrypted key. This scheme allows the key data to be encrypted safely, while still allowing lookups. </p><pre>EncryptedSharedPreferences.create(<br />    \"my_secret_prefs\",<br />    advancedKeyAlias,<br />    applicationContext,<br />    PrefKeyEncryptionScheme.AES256_SIV,<br />    PrefValueEncryptionScheme.AES256_GCM<br />).edit {<br />    // Update secret values<br />}<br /></pre><h2>More Resources</h2>  <p><a href=\"https://github.com/android/security-samples/tree/master/FileLocker\">FileLocker</a> is a sample app on the Android Security GitHub samples page.

Since their publication, I’ve often admired and recommended the Google Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) books—so I was thrilled to find that a book focused on security and reliability was already underway when I arrived at Google. Ever since I began working in the tech industry, across organizations of varying sizes, I’ve seen people struggling with the question of how security should be organized: Should it be centralized or federated? Independent or embedded? Operational or consultative? Technical or governing? The list goes on and on.<div><br /></div>Both SRE and security have strong dependencies on classic software engineering teams. Yet both differ from classic software engineering teams in fundamental ways:<ul><li>Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) and security engineers tend to break and fix, as well as build.</li><li>Their work encompasses operations, in addition to development.</li><li>SREs and security engineers are specialists, rather than classic software engineers.</li><li>They are often viewed as roadblocks, rather than enablers.</li><li>They are frequently siloed, rather than integrated in product teams.</li></ul>For many years, my colleagues and I have argued that security should be a first-class and embedded quality of software. I believe that embracing an SRE- inspired approach is a logical step in that direction. As my understanding of the intersection between security and SRE has deepened, I’ve become even more certain that it’s important to more thoroughly integrate security practices into the full lifecycle of software and data services. The nature of the modern hybrid cloud—much of which is based on open source software frameworks that offer interconnected data and microservices—makes tightly integrated security and resilience capabilities even more important.<br /><br />At the same time, enterprises are at a critical point where cloud computing, various forms of machine learning, and a complicated cybersecurity landscape are together determining where an increasingly digital world is going, how quickly it will get there, and what risks are involved.<div><br /></div>The operational and organizational approaches to security in large enterprises have varied dramatically over the past 20 years. The most prominent instantiations include fully centralized chief information security officers and core infrastructure operations that encompass firewalls, directory services, proxies, and much more—teams that have grown to hundreds or thousands of employees. On the other end of the spectrum, federated business information security teams have either the line of business or technical expertise required to support or govern a named list of functions or business operations. Somewhere in the middle, committees, metrics, and regulatory requirements might govern security policies, and embedded Security Champions might either play a relationship management role or track issues for a named organizational unit. Recently, I’ve seen teams riffing on the SRE model by evolving the embedded role into something like a site security engineer, or into a specific Agile scrum role for specialist security teams.<div><br /></div>For good reasons, enterprise security teams have largely focused on confidentiality. However, organizations often recognize data integrity and availability to be equally important, and address these areas with different teams and different controls. The SRE function is a best-in-class approach to reliability. However, it also plays a role in the real-time detection of and response to technical issues—including security- related attacks on privileged access or sensitive data. Ultimately, while engineering teams are often organizationally separated according to specialized skill sets, they have a common goal: ensuring the quality and safety of the system or application.<br /><br />In a world that is becoming more dependent upon technology every year, a book about approaches to security and reliability drawn from experiences at Google and across the industry is an important contribution to the evolution of software development, systems management, and data protection. As the threat landscape evolves, a dynamic and integrated approach to defense is now a basic necessity. In my previous roles, I looked for a more formal exploration of these questions; I hope that a variety of teams inside and outside of security organizations find this discussion useful as approaches and tools evolve. This project has reinforced my belief that the topics it covers are worth discussing and promoting in the industry—particularly as more organizations adopt DevOps, DevSecOps, SRE, and hybrid cloud architectures along with their associated operating models. At a minimum, this book is another step in the evolution and enhancement of system and data security in an increasingly digital world.<div><br />The new book can be downloaded for free from the Google SRE <a href=\"https://landing.google.com/sre/books/\">website</a>, or purchased as a physical copy from your preferred retailer. </div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?a=gDahjiLHxK4:caxUGNpviiQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?a=gDahjiLHxK4:caxUGNpviiQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?i=gDahjiLHxK4:caxUGNpviiQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog/~4/gDahjiLHxK4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 08 Apr 2020 16:00:00 +0000","feedId":457,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA","linkMd5":"dfc2ae10293bc39227df35b72480d5e0","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn86@2020_6/2020/08/16/11-34-53-486_682730ff2cb46673.webp","destWidth":62,"destHeight":24,"author":"Sarah O'Rourke","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn33@2020_2/2020/08/16/11-34-49-689_682730ff2cb46673.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?i=gDahjiLHxK4:caxUGNpviiQ:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn57@2020_3/2020/08/16/11-34-49-270_79480e012a14bfda.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog/~4/gDahjiLHxK4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn34@2020_2/2020/08/16/11-34-49-022_9a8bb2fe95189486.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 19:34:39","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 19:34:39","title":"Disruptive ads enforcement and our new approach","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog/~3/6VuyDPAXCT0/disruptive-ads-enforcement-and-our-new.html","description":"<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Per Bjorke, Senior Product Manager, Ad Traffic Quality</span><br />As part of our ongoing efforts — along with help from newly developed technologies — today we’re announcing nearly 600 apps have been removed from the Google Play Store and banned from our ad monetization platforms, Google AdMob and Google Ad Manager, for violating our <a href=\"https://play.google.com/about/monetization-ads/ads/#!?zippy_activeEl=disruptive#disruptive\">disruptive ads policy</a> and <a href=\"https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6201362?hl=en\">disallowed interstitial policy</a>.  <br />Mobile ad fraud is an industry-wide challenge that can appear in many different forms with a variety of methods, and it has the potential to harm users, advertisers and publishers. At Google, we have dedicated teams focused on detecting and stopping malicious developers that attempt to defraud the mobile ecosystem. As part of these efforts we take action against those who create seemingly innocuous apps, but which actually violate our ads policies. <br />We define disruptive ads as ads that are displayed to users in unexpected ways, including impairing or interfering with the usability of device functions. While they can occur in-app, one form of disruptive ads we’ve seen on the rise is something we call out-of-context ads, which is when malicious developers serve ads on a mobile device when the user is not actually active in their app.  <br />This is an invasive maneuver that results in poor user experiences that often disrupt key device functions and this approach can lead to unintentional ad clicks that waste advertiser spend. For example, imagine being unexpectedly served a full-screen ad when you attempt to make a phone call, unlock your phone, or while using your favorite map app’s turn-by-turn navigation. <br />Malicious developers continue to become more savvy in deploying and masking disruptive ads, but we’ve developed new technologies of our own to protect against this behavior. We recently developed an innovative machine-learning based approach to detect when apps show out-of-context ads, which led to the enforcement we’re announcing today. <br />As we move forward, we will continue to invest in new technologies to detect and prevent emerging threats that can generate invalid traffic, including disruptive ads, and to find more ways to adapt and evolve our platform and ecosystem policies to ensure that users and advertisers are protected from bad behavior. <div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?a=6VuyDPAXCT0:njdR4zDXI74:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?a=6VuyDPAXCT0:njdR4zDXI74:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?i=6VuyDPAXCT0:njdR4zDXI74:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog/~4/6VuyDPAXCT0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 20 Feb 2020 16:00:00 +0000","feedId":457,"bgimg":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA","linkMd5":"5895974119baebeeeab0cbf233b782de","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn86@2020_6/2020/08/16/11-34-53-486_682730ff2cb46673.webp","destWidth":62,"destHeight":24,"author":"Scott Westover","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn33@2020_2/2020/08/16/11-34-49-689_682730ff2cb46673.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog?i=6VuyDPAXCT0:njdR4zDXI74:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn78@2020_2/2020/08/16/11-34-48-605_bdcb03fce20a0367.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog/~4/6VuyDPAXCT0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn64@2020_3/2020/08/16/11-34-48-620_1b1f9f0aa33285f4.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-16 19:34:39","updatedTime":"2020-08-16 19:34:39","title":"Titan Security Keys - now available in Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, Switzerland, and the UK ","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog/~3/6fVvupPCw8U/titan-security-keys-now-available-in.html","description":"<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Christiaan Brand, Product Manager, Google Cloud&nbsp;</span><br /><br />Security keys provide the <a href=\"https://security.googleblog.com/2019/05/new-research-how-effective-is-basic.html\">strongest</a> protection against phishing attacks.

These warnings, as well as subsequent blocking, will be delayed by at least two releases. Console warnings on mixed downloads will begin as scheduled in Chrome 81.</em></p>\n<p><em>At this time, we expect to start user-visible warnings in Chrome 84. The <a href=\"https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5691978677223424\">Chrome Platform Status</a> entry will be kept up-to-date as timing is finalized. Developers who are otherwise able to do so are encouraged to transition to secure downloads as soon as possible to avoid future disruption.</em></p>\n<br />Today we’re announcing that Chrome will gradually ensure that secure (HTTPS) pages only download secure files. In a series of steps outlined below, we’ll start blocking \"mixed content downloads\" (non-HTTPS downloads started on secure pages). This move follows a \n<a href=\"https://blog.chromium.org/2019/10/no-more-mixed-messages-about-https.html\">plan we announced last year</a> to start blocking all insecure subresources on secure pages. \n<br />Insecurely-downloaded files are a risk to users' security and privacy. For instance, insecurely-downloaded programs can be swapped out for malware by attackers, and eavesdroppers can read users' insecurely-downloaded bank statements. To address these risks, we plan to eventually remove support for insecure downloads in Chrome. \n<br />As a first step, we are focusing on insecure downloads started on secure pages. These cases are especially concerning because Chrome currently gives no indication to the user that their privacy and security are at risk. \n<br />Starting in Chrome 82 (to be released April 2020), Chrome will gradually start warning on, and later blocking, these mixed content downloads. File types that pose the most risk to users (e.g., executables) will be impacted first, with subsequent releases covering more file types. This gradual rollout is designed to mitigate the worst risks quickly, provide developers an opportunity to update sites, and minimize how many warnings Chrome users have to see. \n<br />We plan to roll out restrictions on mixed content downloads on desktop platforms (Windows, macOS, Chrome OS and Linux) first. Our plan for desktop platforms is as follows: \n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uc2I5k26oGg/XjtFJgTu7mI/AAAAAAAABs0/X0mfxT5mWEoga8htBqBXpUDwQZO-7xK9gCNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/mix_dl_table.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"512\" data-original-width=\"1530\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uc2I5k26oGg/XjtFJgTu7mI/AAAAAAAABs0/X0mfxT5mWEoga8htBqBXpUDwQZO-7xK9gCNcBGAsYHQ/s1600/mix_dl_table.png\" /></a>\n</div>\n<br />\n<ul>\n <li>In Chrome 81 (released March 2020) and later: \n  <ul>\n   <li>Chrome will print a <strong>console message</strong> warning about all mixed content downloads. </li>\n  </ul></li>\n <li>In Chrome 82 (released April 2020): \n  <ul>\n   <li>Chrome will <strong>warn</strong> on mixed content downloads of<strong> executables</strong> (e.g. .exe). </li>\n  </ul></li>\n <li>In Chrome 83 (released June 2020): \n  <ul>\n   <li>Chrome will <strong>block</strong> mixed content <strong>executables</strong> </li>\n   <li>Chrome will <strong>warn</strong> on mixed content <strong>archives</strong> (.zip) and <strong>disk images</strong> (.iso). </li>\n  </ul></li>\n <li>In Chrome 84 (released August 2020): \n  <ul>\n   <li>Chrome will <strong>block </strong>mixed content <strong>executables, archives and disk images</strong> </li>\n   <li>Chrome will <strong>warn on all other mixed content downloads</strong> except image, audio, video and text formats. </li>\n  </ul></li>\n <li>In Chrome 85 (released September 2020): \n  <ul>\n   <li>Chrome will <strong>warn</strong> on mixed content downloads of <strong>images, audio, video, and text</strong> </li>\n   <li>Chrome will <strong>block all other mixed content downloads</strong></li>\n  </ul></li>\n <li>In Chrome 86 (released October 2020) and beyond, Chrome will block all mixed content downloads. </li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n <span id=\"docs-internal-guid-21e2c42a-7fff-1bb5-63de-983bc43018c6\"><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><span style=\"border: 1pt solid #cccccc; display: inline-block; height: 162px; overflow: hidden; width: 373px;\"><img height=\"213.4111349036402\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/7VoXAcrd9RpJ0mMeP26IilFMeepkst8sF8EAohoKCfA0Rqbrh7N8_VSXhMmsb2MNZyD2sNEBWzDJ43aDpyFuAHmAV6TPgSXErAp9huOfUmv4Tz19mfoWGImTe6XfOzobf6JD1LdJ\" style=\"margin-left: -8.511409395973153px; margin-top: -16.705567451820116px;\" width=\"418.108430271014\" /></span></span></span>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n <em>Example of a potential warning</em>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">\n Chrome will delay the rollout for Android and iOS users by one release, starting warnings in Chrome 83. Mobile platforms have better native protection against malicious files, and this delay will give developers a head-start towards updating their sites before impacting mobile users. \n <br />Developers can prevent users from ever seeing a download warning by ensuring that downloads only use HTTPS. In the current version of Chrome Canary, or in Chrome 81 once released, developers can activate a warning on all mixed content downloads for testing by enabling the \"Treat risky downloads over insecure connections as active mixed content\" flag at \n <code>chrome://flags/#treat-unsafe-downloads-as-active-content</code>. \n <br />Enterprise and education customers can disable blocking on a per-site basis via the existing&nbsp;\n <code>InsecureContentAllowedForUrls</code> policy by adding a pattern matching the page requesting the download. \n <br />In the future, we expect to further restrict insecure downloads in Chrome.
