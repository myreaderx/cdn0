They didn‚Äôt stop after announcing major updates to their software with iOS 14, iPadOS 14, and macOS Big Sur. They‚Äôre also launching a new generation of gadgets, accompanied by an all-new services bundle.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">These introduce several improvements to the iOS user interface that once again look to fundamentally change the way users interact with mobile apps. Here‚Äôs a quick round-up of the enhancements available to users when they upgrade their operating system and the Zoho Sign app to the latest updates with iOS 14 and iPadOS 14.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>SignForms</strong><br /> You can now access and manage your SignForms on the Zoho Sign mobile app. From there, you can enable or disable SignForms, change names, modify response limits, enforce authentication, share public URLs, and monitor responses.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-76282 aligncenter\" src=\"https://blog.zoho.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/signform.gif\" alt=\"SignForms\" width=\"799\" height=\"450\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>App Clips</strong><br /> With the help of App Clips, any iOS 14 user can access and sign documents digitally via SignForms, even if they don‚Äôt have the Zoho Sign app. This lets you share policies, agreements, and forms via NFC tags, QR codes, iMessage, and other methods. After that, the recipient can quickly sign them via a lightweight workflow powered by the Zoho Sign app directly from the App Store.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For example, let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre hosting a PR event with an open invitation to all influencers, journalists, and analysts. With App Clips, it‚Äôs easy to incorporate the registration form and any associated paperwork directly into your promotions. You can simply include the QR code for the event registration SignForm in your collateral, both print and digital. Interested parties can scan it on their phone to fill out the form and sign the accompanying documents. This makes e-signing documents quick and accessible. It also offers users a glimpse of what they can do with the Zoho Sign app, without needing to install it from the App Store.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-76289\" src=\"https://blog.zoho.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Appclip.gif\" alt=\"App Clips\" width=\"281\" height=\"500\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Widgets</strong><br /> Apple is finally treating users to widgets on their home screen in iOS 14. Of course, we wanted to let Zoho Sign users make the most of them. You can now track and manage your paperwork with a tap of your fingers by adding Zoho Sign widgets to your home screen. These widgets help you perform common actions, such as signing documents, sending documents for signatures, and tracking document progress, all without having to open the Zoho Sign app.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-76295\" src=\"https://blog.zoho.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Widget.gif\" alt=\"Widgets\" width=\"281\" height=\"500\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Scribble with Apple Pencil</strong><br /> With <a href=\"https://help.zoho.com/portal/en/community/topic/zoho-sign-in-ios-13-whats-new\">iPadOS 13</a>, you could use your Apple Pencil to create your e-signature for signing documents using Zoho Sign. With the latest round of updates, you can now use it to write on text fields when signing documents or sending them out for signatures. Then, just let iPadOS 14‚Äôs built-in OCR work its magic. This is our way of letting you enjoy pen-and-paper nostalgia, while continuing to operate paperless. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f609.png\" alt=\"üòâ\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-76301 aligncenter\" src=\"https://blog.zoho.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Scribble.gif\" alt=\"Scribble with Apple Pencil\" width=\"799\" height=\"450\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Besides these cool features, we have also updated the Zoho Sign app to support other new interface components such as the sleek menus, the photo picker, and the date picker to ensure we leave no stone unturned in offering our users the complete iOS 14 experience.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Update to iOS 14 and iPadOS 14 today for an updated digital signature experience with Zoho Sign.
