In this edition, we look at what you can expect from (and where you can watch), the COVID-inspired apocalypse movie How It Ends.</i></p>\n<hr />\n<p>For some people, the pandemic has been a time of serious creative block and near-catastrophic lethargy. For others, it&#8217;s been a period of inspiration. Married couple and creative power-duo <strong>Daryl</strong> <strong>Wein</strong> and <strong>Zoe Lister-Jones</strong>, who have been working together since 2009 and had already partnered on six feature films and two shorts pre-COVID (including <i>Lola Versus</i> and <i>Band Aid</i>), are among the lucky ones in that second group.</p>\n<p>Two years after their last creative team-up (the 2019 TV pilot <em>Awokened</em>), the pair are back with their latest movie, a quirky comedy called <strong><i>How It Ends</i></strong>, which is fittingly about the end of the world. Written and shot by Wein and Lister-Jones during the pandemic, the feature made its debut at Sundance earlier this year (<a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/how-it-ends-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">see our review</a>) and then captivated crowds at South by Southwest a couple of months later. Now, it’s everyone else&#8217;s turn to watch it.</p>\n<p>Here’s everything you need to know about the movie&#8217;s imminent release.</p>\n<h2>How It Ends Release Date (and Where to Watch)</h2>\n<p>In May, American International Pictures snagged distribution rights for the movie <i>How it Ends</i>. It is now slated to be released simultaneously in theaters courtesy of United Artists and on VOD via MGM on July 20th.</p>\n<h2>How It Ends Cast</h2>\n<p>In addition to being one-half of the pair that wrote, directed, and produced the movie, Zoe Lister-Jones also stars as Liza, the protagonist of <em>How It Ends</em>. <i>Mare of Easttown</i>’s <strong>Cailee</strong> <strong>Spaeny</strong>, whom Lister-Jones previously directed in last year&#8217;s <em>The Craft: Legacy</em>, plays Liza’s younger self, who accompanies her on her heartfelt journey through the apocalypse.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But there are many more names in the cast. When it comes to an abundance of celebrity cameos, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How It Ends</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> joins the ranks with such movies as </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (1963) and </span><a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/this-is-the-end-commentary-with-seth-rogen/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This Is the End </span></i></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(2013). The film’s guest appearances include <strong>Olivia Wilde</strong>, <strong>Fred Armisen</strong>, <strong>Colin Hanks</strong>, <strong>Bradley Whitford</strong>, <strong>Sharon Van Etten</strong>, <strong>Helen Hunt</strong>, <strong>Whitney Cummings</strong>, <strong>Charlie Day</strong>, <strong>Finn Wolfhard</strong>, <strong>Nick Kroll</strong>, <strong>Logan Marshall-Green</strong>, <strong>Pauly Shore</strong>, <strong>Paul Sheer</strong>, and <strong>Glenn Howerton</strong>. Phew. </span></p>\n<h2>How It Ends Plot</h2>\n<p>When you get word of a new end-of-the-world movie, you might expect to see something dark and thrilling like <i>The Day After Tomorrow </i>(2004) or <i>The Road </i>(2009), but <i>How It Ends</i> has a different take on what the apocalypse looks like.</p>\n<p>The movie follows Liza, accompanied by her imaginary friend: her teen self. The two are on their way to a last-day-on-earth party after receiving unfortunate intel that a meteor is on its way to decimate the planet. But the pilgrimage to her final rager doesn’t go as planned, and Liza starts to realize what is really important to her in the face of death. So, she makes it her life’s final mission to make amends with friends and family she’s had falling outs with.</p>\n<h2>How It Ends Movie Trailer</h2>\n<p>At the beginning of the movie trailer for <i>How It Ends</i>, a character played by Fred Armisen pretends to impale himself on a spiked fence. And that pretty much tells you everything you need to know about the movie&#8217;s upbeat, quirky tone. Check out the trailer below. (Bonus points if you can spot more than five celebrity cameos.)</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"How It Ends | Official Trailer | MGM Studios\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/t84FHuWMs2I?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<h2>How did COVID Inspire the Movie How It Ends?</h2>\n<p>If you’ve been looking for a COVID-19 silver lining, here it is: the movie <i>How It Ends</i> most likely wouldn’t have happened without the pandemic. Lister-Jones <a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/snyde/ny-how-it-ends-comedy-film-zoe-lister-jones-cailee-spaeny-20210618-gw2n6gbrp5dndew4tjjhaxz6mq-story.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">told the <i>Daily News</i></a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“In quarantine especially, we were all facing our most vulnerable selves, or our younger selves. So I started to do more research into inner-child work with my therapist. Daryl was doing some of that, too. Cailee was doing that, too. We were all trying to figure out how to quell these deep anxieties and fears that we were feeling at this time, and a lot of that had something to do with how we talk to the younger person inside of us. So that spawned the idea. And because of the existential nature of the movie, we liked the idea of there being a metaphysical representation of Younger Self that we could play with, in the dialogue.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>So, if you’re all about apocalypse movies, or you’re trying to get more in touch with your inner child, or you’re simply looking for some humor to alleviate the tumult of the past year and a half, mark your calendar and get ready to see <em>How It Ends</em> on July 20th.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/QTSAPzufTGA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Jul 2021 16:16:42 +0000","feedId":24,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"9f6a5c2590c7fac055e902dbd3185fdc","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Aurora Amidon","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/QTSAPzufTGA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn15@2020_6/2021/07/12/18-35-34-411_3d438b25fab3bebd.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626114917573},{"createdTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:17","updatedTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:17","title":"A Tale of Two Auteurs: the Myth of Bad Behavior as Artistic Process","link":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/?p=366262","description":"<p><em>Welcome to <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/the-queue/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Queue</a> &#8212; your daily distraction of curated video content sourced from across the web.

Both films offer tense portraits of domestic violence perpetrated by frustrated, volatile men.

Today, we discuss the buzz around Leos Carax&#8217;s new film Annette and its titillating oral sex scene.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>Have you heard the news? In<strong> Leos Carax</strong>’s new film, <em><strong>Annette</strong></em>, there&#8217;s a scene in which <strong><a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/adam-driver-filmography/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Adam Driver</a></strong> sings while simulating cunnilingus on <strong>Marion Cotillard</strong>. Yes, you read that right. In a musical first, oral sex and the act of crooning have been combined into one fascinating cinematic experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carax, who previously directed the dazzling fever dream <em>Holy Motors</em>, is back after almost a decade with a comedy-drama musical that he made in collaboration with <strong>Sparks</strong>, the very same band that is the topic of Edgar Wright’s new documentary, <em><a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/the-sparks-brothers-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Sparks Brothers</a></em>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Annette</em> is about a stand-up comedian (Driver) and his opera-singer wife (Cotillard) who have a two-year-old daughter, the titular Annette, with a strange gift. And that gift, as revealed at its Cannes-opener premiere, is that she is a marionette puppet who can sing like an adult.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even with the label of musical being placed on the film, Carax stays true to his particular brand of cinematic madness, all while supporting the musical talents of Sparks. Even the trailer for <em>Annette</em> is an epic journey that involves a lot of dramatic stage performances, Driver looking very stoic, Cotillard with a variety of strange hairstyles, and chanting crowds crazy for Annette.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Annette - Official Trailer | Prime Video\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/l_EaNpL16SU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the musical aspect of <em>Annette</em>, in an interview included in the press notes at the film festival (<a href=\"https://www.insider.com/marion-cotillard-adam-driver-singing-stimulating-oral-sex-annette-2021-7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">shared by Insider</a>), Cotillard reveals that all of the singing was done live on set rather than dubbed over with studio recordings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It added to the complexity of the set: we found ourselves singing in very complicated positions, doing back-crawling or mimicking cunnilingus,&#8221; she says, &#8220;acrobatic positions that technically modify your song.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just very casually dropping in an interview that Driver sang live while going down on her. However, importantly, it has been clarified that in <em>Annette</em>, Driver is not in fact singing and performing the oral sex act on Cotillard simultaneously. Instead, he pauses his singing to do the deed.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such a scene is rather unusual in movie musicals, as explicit sexual scenarios are often teased but never fully shown. Cotillard touched on this in her interview. &#8220;We strangely never see people f&#8212;ing or doing trivial things in musical comedies,&#8221; she acknowledges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With <em>Annette</em>, Carax and Sparks want to challenge the expectations of the movie musical, and they clearly do just that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The initial reception of <em>Annette </em>out of Cannes, <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/annette-film-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">including the review by FSR’s own Luke Hicks</a>, is overall positive while also addressing problems such as its too-long runtime, its own self-indulgence, and a lack of utilizing Cotillard’s talents in favor of Driver’s own mad performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Annette opens theatrically in limited release on August 6th before making its streaming debut on Amazon Prime Video on August 20th.</em></strong></p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/1QgnRalrJBg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 10 Jul 2021 20:16:00 +0000","feedId":24,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"b59242380e51ebd622b0db8d782174b2","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Mary Beth McAndrews","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/1QgnRalrJBg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn97@2020_1/2021/07/12/18-35-34-397_72e4ec1c0c04316f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626114917572},{"createdTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:17","updatedTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:17","title":"That’s Some ‘Pig’: A Big-Hearted Debut of Trauma and Truffles","link":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/?p=366331","description":"<p>Uncynical movies feel very rare these days. Earnestly advocating for kindness and care isn’t always marketable. But that is, ultimately, the whole-hearted charm of <strong><em>Pig</em></strong>, a movie that marks the feature film debut of writer/director <strong>Michael Sarnoski</strong>. For all the hooting and hollering over <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4nRpdONaAA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">its trailer</a> promising <em>John Wick</em> meets <em>Chef</em>, its appetite is unexpectedly simple, and all the more powerful for it.</p>\n<p>Robin (<strong>Nicolas Cage</strong>) lives off the grid in the dense brush of Oregon. His life is small, humble, and free from modern trappings. It&#8217;s an idyllic neo-frontier daydream of cast iron, weather-worn leather jackets, and rugged bare necessities. He doesn’t even have a watch. The most sophisticated piece of technology he owns is a battery-powered cassette player &#8212; an auditory portal to the past that drove him into the woods all those years ago.</p>\n<p>He forages for truffles with his unnamed pig, a ruddy-colored angel &#8212; there’s no other word for her. She is a clear beacon of warmth and love in his life. And as much a work partner as a therapeutic companion with an ever-attentive ear. You immediately understand why she matters so much to him.</p>\n<p>Despite the inferred tragedy that clearly still weighs heavy on Robin’s shoulders, it’s clear that he has carved out a space for himself that brings him peace and purpose, however modest. So when two masked figures burst through his cabin in the dead of night, knocking him cold and bagging the shrieking pig, the stakes are clear and unambiguous. He has to go get that pig back.</p>\n<p>Robin’s quest forces him back into the world he severed ties with: a cutthroat restaurant scene where his name, somehow, still has power. Accompanied by Amir (<strong>Alex Wolff</strong>), his young reputation-obsessed truffle buyer turned reluctant chauffeur, Robin follows the trail through the city’s culinary underground &#8212; at times literally &#8212; digging through the mire of the scene’s moral rot with a singular purpose.</p>\n<p>It is very easy to lean on Cage’s infamous wild-eyed machinations as a crutch, but even a five-course meal comprised entirely of five-hour energy drinks invariably grows stale. As Robin, the actor is gentle, tender, and tired. He&#8217;s an out-of-place soul contending with the cruelty and lack of care that colors the modern world.</p>\n<p>An apocalyptic cloud hangs over Robin&#8217;s head. But his attitude towards the inevitable earthquake that will plunge much of the Pacific Northwest into the sea is more resigned than fearful. His past and future are marred with loss. Rather than lash out in anger, he has tried his best to cherish beautiful, lovable things.</p>\n<p>I expect many reviews of <em>Pig</em> to resurrect <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/the-art-of-overacting/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cage’s career-best turn in <em>Mandy</em></a>, wherein the actor, at least for the first half, appears unexpectedly soft-spoken and gentle. Apart from sharing an editor in the temperate, steady-handed <strong>Brett W. Bachman</strong>, I think comparisons to <em>Mandy</em> should stop there. The two movies have very different and indeed polar stances on the appropriate response to loss, but as far as underlining how magnificent, touching, and grounded Cage is in <em>Pig</em>, the resonance rings true.</p>\n<p>And ultimately, the emotional journey of <em>Pig</em> is not Robin’s but Amir’s. His abrasive, big city callousness softens through exposure to Robin&#8217;s crystalline philosophy. Working in the shadow of his father (<strong>Adam Arkin</strong>), Amir is defined by superficial success markers and an anxious obsession with reputation and class.</p>\n<p>Wolff often comes across as insubstantial compared to Cage. Whether this is by design or otherwise is hard to tell. Winning an audience over to a character initially introduced as annoying and crass isn’t easy. Amir shines more brightly in the movie&#8217;s latter moments. Ultimately, he endears himself when he begins to align himself to Robin’s frequencies.</p>\n<p>A word of warning to those expecting <em>Pig</em> to trot to the beat of exploitation cinema: this is not a revenge movie. It contains some delightfully strange wrinkles that keep it in a bizarre space. Robin spends much of the time looking like he got hit by a truck. Seeing him wander through hoity-toity restaurants looking like the ghost of Christmas carnage is surreal and deeply funny.</p>\n<p>However, due to its strange gait, I am not entirely sure for whom <em>Pig</em> is intended. I worry that genre geeks and Cage fans will be caught off guard by its whole-heartedness and humble scale. For everyone else, what will they make of the subterranean fight club for restaurant workers to let off steam?</p>\n<p>All told, <em>Pig</em> marks a promising and impressive debut for Sarnoski, who will certainly be a creative voice worth keeping an eye on in the future. Praise is also due to <strong>Alexis Grapsas</strong> and <strong>Philip Klein</strong>’s score, which is filled with tenebrous strings and melancholic guitars that endow the movie with an understated neo-Western undercurrent.</p>\n<p>And yet for all its flirtations with more furious genre spaces, there is nothing triumphant or vindictive about <em>Pig</em>. This is a very small-feeling movie, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. One of its recurring themes is the transformative power of simple things made with love.</p>\n<p>The movie is a lot like Robin&#8217;s cooking: slow, unpretentious, and mindful. It’s about finding authentic things worth caring about and doing your very best not to lose them. Of knowing what’s real and what isn’t. I can’t say that <em>Pig</em> is going to be to everyone’s taste, but those with an appetite for sweetness would do well to seek this movie out.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/yARsi8h9PRs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 12 Jul 2021 13:16:07 +0000","feedId":24,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"4153a3eaffda2d00cf9eaa73487c94ca","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Meg Shields","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/yARsi8h9PRs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn7@2020_3/2021/07/12/18-35-34-379_32f29d551979259c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626114917570},{"createdTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:17","updatedTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:17","title":"The Weird and Wild History of Zack Snyder’s Needle Drops","link":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/?p=366165","description":"\n<p><strong>Zack Snyder</strong> is a king of excess with such a distinct filmmaking style that you could spot one of his movies from a mile away. His visuals rely on bright contrasting colors, slo-mo fight sequences, and huge action set pieces that, regardless of the film’s quality, are quite impressive. Another key component of a Snyder movie is <strong><a href=\"https://youtu.be/EJ4b0yM6MKE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the needle drop</a></strong>, which he employs to make his big action scenes more effective.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He doesn’t typically use the original version of the song, though. Snyder really loves covers. While this may have started due to the lower cost of licensing the redo, they&#8217;ve become such a Snyder staple at this point that they define his work just as much as his over-the-top scripts and chaotic cinematography. Whether a cover or original recording, though, Zack Snyder&#8217;s music choices are such a crucial tone-setting tool that they can truly make or break his movies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While there are some exceptions &#8212; <em>Man of Steel</em>,<em> Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice</em>, and<em> Legends of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga’Hoole</em> (no, the Owl City song does not count as it was written specifically for the movie) &#8212; Snyder tends to include at least one needle drop per film where the song choice is about as subtle as a hammer to the face.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zack Snyder began developing this music trademark with his 2004 debut feature, <em><strong>Dawn of the Dead</strong></em>, a remake of George A. Romero’s 1978 film of the same name in which a group of survivors hunkers down in an abandoned mall during the zombie apocalypse. While hoping to be saved, the group “befriends” another survivor trapped in his gun store across a parking lot, communicating with whiteboards and a pair of binoculars.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During a montage of the characters&#8217; daily routines, a cover of <strong>Disturbed</strong>’s “Down With the Sickness” as performed by <strong>Richard Cheese</strong> plays on the soundtrack. Cheese is a lounge singer, so instead of the hard rock intensity of the original recording, Cheese’s version is relaxed and smooth. It’s happy, which is a term not often applied to the heavy metal music of Disturbed. This needle drop is an example of Zack Snyder’s use of music for comedic effect. Accompanying shots of zombies swarming in the parking lot, the song makes the horrifying situation feel normal, just part of the characters&#8217; everyday lives, like their rooftop conversations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then came <em><strong>Watchmen</strong></em>, Snyder’s adaptation of Alan Moore’s classic graphic novel. This is when the filmmaker really started playing with needle drops of both covers and original music, using lyrics to really pack an emotional punch from beginning to end. First, we have <strong>Nat King Cole</strong> crooning “Unforgettable” while the vigilante called the Comedian fights an unknown assailant. The smooth voice and romantic vibe of the song are placed in stark contrast with the intense violence on screen as blood slowly flies across the screen and bones pop out of skin. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not long after that, Snyder pairs <strong>Bob Dylan</strong>’s “The Times Are A-Changing” with a fantastic opening sequence that establishes the context of the vigilante hero group known as the Watchmen and how this world exists in an alternate version of America. The song choice is quite literal as the history of the Watchmen is shown changing in front of the viewer&#8217;s eyes, but Dylan’s lyrics and unique voice still make this a perfect pair; the combination creates a sense of nostalgia for an unknown past. It’s all such impressive use of existing music to play with the film’s atmosphere. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Times They Are a-Changin&#039;, by Bob Dylan - Watchmen\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nZj43rtoEp4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But that comes crashing down with Snyder’s decision to use <strong>Leonard Cohen</strong>’s “Hallelujah” over a graphic sex scene between vigilantes Night Owl and Silk Spectre. Cohen’s gravelly voice is synced up with each thrust of Night Owl’s hips in the most uncomfortable way that removes any and all eroticism. Perhaps Jeff Buckley&#8217;s cover would have made more sense, as it better suits the intimacy but also the sadness behind this moment. Snyder almost hit a needle drop homerun but truly struck out at the last minute. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He does almost recover with his use of “All Along The Watchtower” by <strong>The Jimi Hendrix Experience</strong> at the film’s climax, but nothing can truly help the movie come back after the “Hallelujah” scene.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That didn’t keep Snyder down, though. He continued to layer needle drop on top of needle drop in his 2011 movie <em><strong>Suckerpunch</strong></em>, to the point that it becomes excessive. Sure, it’s great for the audience to hear a song they might know, but there comes a time when the music becomes a crutch &#8212; as if Zack Snyder doesn’t have enough faith in the story and its action to excite the viewer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He has <strong>Bjork</strong> singing “Army of Me,” he has a mash-up of <strong>Queen</strong>&#8216;s &#8220;I Want It All&#8221; and “We Will Rock You,” and he has not one, not two, but seven covers, redoing songs by <strong>Jefferson Airplane</strong>, <strong>The Smiths</strong>, <strong>The Stooges</strong>, <strong>The Beatles</strong>, and others. The soundtrack only has nine songs. The music becomes distracting and clashes with the large set pieces in <em>Suckerpunch</em>, which include a dragon-guarded castle and a snow-covered dojo. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two most notable covers are performed by the film’s lead actress, <strong>Emily Browning</strong>: “Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)” by <strong>Eurythmic</strong>s and “Where Is My Mind” by <strong>Pixies</strong>. Both of Browning’s renditions are haunting versions of the original songs, and therefore better match the overall tone of the film. The use of “Where Is My Mind” is incredibly on the nose. The slow acoustic guitar and the melancholy voice of Browning play over a scene of her character, Babydoll, being admitted to a mental institution. The words “where is my mind” drift over a shot of her being brought into the hospital, dwarfed by two massive guards in white. It offers a very literal interpretation of the events at hand.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Sucker Punch - Where is My Mind\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/O913fmUGgt0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The cover of “Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)” is used as Babydoll dissociates to escape her harsh reality, entering her own version of a dream. In this context, the slowed-down version of the dance song feels right while the character floats through different realities in which she is being used and abused by men in positions of power. Browning’s voice echoes the pain in Babydoll’s eyes as she tries to find a place where she can feel safe inside her own mind. The music then swells with the booming tones of an organ that echoes a brief moment of catharsis as she settles into a new time and place of her own creation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sadly, when Snyder started making superhero movies in what would become known as the DC Extended Universe franchise, his directing style did a one-eighty as his use of color faded and the needle drops were few and far between. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is until the &#8220;<a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/zack-snyders-justice-league-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Snyder Cut</a>,&#8221; his four-hour version of <em><strong>Justice League</strong></em>. There&#8217;s one during the introduction of Aquaman as he chugs a bottle of liquor and walks down a sea wall in the middle of a storm as waves crash around him. The epic nature of the scene and its kinetic energy is countered with <strong>Nick Cave</strong>’s melancholy “There Is A Kingdom,” making this feel like Aquaman’s own inner soundtrack to his loneliness. It’s an odd visual and aural pairing, but it does work in establishing the character as more than just muscles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interestingly enough, this same scene in the original cut of <em>Justice League</em> instead features <strong>The White Stripes</strong>’ “Icky Thump,&#8221; which creates an entirely different tone. With the pounding drums and guitar riffs, the song’s energy better matches the chaos around Aquaman, and instead of reflecting any interiority of the hero, it builds him up to be all the more badass. With Zack Snyder’s music change, he’s trying to give more depth to his characters than was seen in the original film. While not ultimately successful, it is fascinating to watch how Snyder sees outside music as just as important as the score for creating an emotional connection to his characters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With his latest movie,<em> <strong><a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/army-of-the-dead-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Army of the Dead</a></strong></em>, Snyder goes back to his over-the-top roots with an absolutely ridiculous story about breeding zombies, a number of massive set pieces, and a needle drop that is the cherry on top of one wild ride. As the credits start to roll and the future looks uncertain, <strong>The Cranberries</strong>’ “Zombie” starts to play, and that snaps the tension of the bittersweet ending in half. Snyder again proves to be the king of literal interpretations. It is eye-roll-inducing because it is such a painfully obvious choice, but it’s also so on-brand that it’s impressive.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Army of the Dead (2021) - The Cranberries - Zombie\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fZlco3uQk3M?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, such a choice did spark some controversy given that the song is actually about IRA bombings in Northern Ireland. It is an extremely political tune used as a punchline for a movie about, well, zombies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just as Zack Snyder plays with color to create striking visuals, he plays with existing music to shape the emotional impact of individual scenes and the movies overall. While his use of needle drops is often silly and very obvious, they are a part of Snyder’s charm as a filmmaker who isn’t afraid to take risks. As he continues to make movies (an <em>Army of the Dead</em> sequel and an adaptation of <em><a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/zack-snyder-says-his-next-movie-is-the-fountainhead/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Fountainhead</a> </em>are in the works), one hopes Snyder stays true to what makes him stand out: a sense of humor and a degree of self-seriousness that can only be described as oddly charming.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/HsOYvA7E7F4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 10 Jul 2021 23:16:00 +0000","feedId":24,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"f42e503f1d0af88fe7134c22a5c44b43","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Mary Beth McAndrews","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/HsOYvA7E7F4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn52@2020_4/2021/07/12/18-35-34-307_81e93d140789a9bc.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626114917570},{"createdTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:17","updatedTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:17","title":"Shot by Shot with Marvel’s ‘What If…?’ Trailer","link":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/?p=366299","description":"<p><em>Welcome to <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/shot-by-shot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Shot by Shot</strong></a>, our ongoing series of movie and TV trailer breakdowns.

In this entry, we tumble into the multiverse and consider what answers lie within the What If…? trailer.</em></p> \n<hr /> \n<p>Friends, this is not one of those cartoons you can afford to ignore. Marvel Studios’ <strong><em>What If…?</em></strong> is very much part of Phase Four, and <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/loki-episode-5/\">the more we learn from <em>Loki</em></a>, the more crucial this series becomes. The Multiverse is real. The one-true timeline is the lie, or at least no more (we eagerly await answers within next week’s Disney+ finale).</p> \n<p>While the live-action Doctor Strange is expected to tackle this <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/mcu-multiverse-horror/\">Multiverse of Madness</a> in his sequel, next month, we’re going to get a proper peek beyond the looking glass. A myriad of alternate realities exist, and we’ll meet several throughout <em>What…If?</em>‘s ten episodes. Found within will be recognizable characters, slightly shifted, but voiced by our Marvel performers. <strong>Tom Hiddleston</strong>, <strong>Michael B. Jordan</strong>, <strong>Hayley Atwell</strong>, and a whole lot more, including <strong>Chadwick Boseman</strong> in his final T’Challa performance, are scheduled to return. And looming over them is reality’s most noncommital peeper, <strong>Jeffrey Wright</strong> as the Watcher.</p> \n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Marvel Studios' What If...? | Official Trailer | Disney+\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/x9D0uUKJ5KI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/what-if-marvel-studios/\">The <em>What If…?</em> comic book series</a> is a playground where writers and artists run amuck with Marvel’s characters, and they do so free from an exhausted continuity. These stories are thought experiments where we can imagine Peter Parker living happily ever after with Gwen Stacy instead of mourning her Green Goblin-snapped neck. It asks, what if Conan the Barbarian traveled to modern-day New York City? A <em>What If…?</em> fantasy that is currently a reality in the latest <a href=\"https://www.marvel.com/comics/series/26594/savage_avengers_2019_-_present\"><em>Savage Avengers</em> ongoing series</a>.</p> \n<p>Now that there are twenty-four feature films and three television shows in our rearview, the Marvel Cinematic Universe is ripe for experimentation. And as you can see in the trailer above, <strong>Kevin Feige</strong>‘s crew, spearheaded by <em>Trollhunters</em>‘ <strong>A</strong>.<strong>C</strong>. <strong>Bradley</strong>, is chopping up the franchise we love and letting the bits mix and match in new, unique ways.</p> \n<p>It’s easy to dismiss these aberrations as larks, but in <em>Loki</em>‘s wake, we must consider how a Captain Carter could eventually interact with our Captain America or how a zombie Iron Man might lumber into&nbsp;the upcoming <em>Ant</em>–<em>Man</em> <em>and the Wasp</em> movie. In this Shot by Shot, we’re pulling out a few key moments from the trailer and examining how they twist the thing we love. Can something better be achieved?</p> \n<hr /> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-366300\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Shot-by-Shot-What-If-Killmonger.jpg\" alt=\"Shot By Shot What If Killmonger\" width=\"800\" height=\"362\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Shot-by-Shot-What-If-Killmonger.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Shot-by-Shot-What-If-Killmonger-768x348.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p> \n<p>The trailer begins where the MCU begins: Tony Stark, on his way back from selling weapons in Afghanistan, is intercepted by the Ten Rings terrorist cell. Instead of shrapnel tearing into the billionaire’s heart, <em>Black Panther</em>‘s Erik Killmonger propels the deadly rocket with Stark’s name on it into the sky. Rescued, a friendship is formed, and a dastardly different realm is created. Imagine Killmonger’s Wakandan rage sharpened by Stark’s brains.</p> \n<hr /> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-366301\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Tchalla-Guardians-of-the-Galaxy.jpg\" alt=\"Tchalla Guardians Of The Galaxy\" width=\"800\" height=\"361\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Tchalla-Guardians-of-the-Galaxy.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Tchalla-Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-768x347.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p> \n<p>In another reality, T’Challa is lifted off Earth by Yondu’s Ravagers instead of Peter Quill. Neglecting <a href=\"https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Bast\">Bast’s call</a>, the Wakandan leader becomes Star-Lord and a bizarre Avengers forms around him. Intercut with the squad shot we know so well from Joss Whedon’s film, we meet a new arrangement of mighty heroes. Killmonger wears his Black Panther duds, Gamora wields Thanos’ <em>Endgame</em> double-edged sword, and a tattooed Thor twirls a familiar-looking Mjölnir.</p> \n<hr /> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-366302\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/What-If-Howard-the-Duck.jpg\" alt=\"What If Howard The Duck\" width=\"800\" height=\"362\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/What-If-Howard-the-Duck.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/What-If-Howard-the-Duck-768x348.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p> \n<p>Ever since his cameo in James Gunn’s <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>, Howard the Duck has slowly evolved beyond the cinematic lemon from the eighties (which is actually <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/howard-the-duck-is-a-great-marvel-comics-superhero/\">not as bad as you remember or believe</a>). Here’s hoping that <em>What If…?</em> continues to massage our appreciation for the character. As we see him here, Howard still appears as a member of the Collector’s collection, but based on some shots later on down this list, he may get out quicker and happier than before.</p> \n<hr /> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-366303\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Captain-Carter.jpg\" alt=\"Captain Carter\" width=\"800\" height=\"362\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Captain-Carter.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Captain-Carter-768x348.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p> \n<p>Captain Carter is <em>What If…?</em>‘s star as far as I’m concerned. Having earned Dr. Erskine’s formula instead of skinny Steve Rogers, Peggy dons the Captain Britain mantle and terrorizes more than just nazis. We see her rip through German tanks and ride an Iron Monger-like suit built by Howard Stark. Based on previous glimpses, her chum Steve Rogers pilots the sky-tank. Armin Zola quivers in awe and fear of her, and Peggy gets chatty with Doctor Strange. Huh, that’s anachronistic. What’s the doc doin’ in World War II?</p> \n<hr /> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-366316 size-full\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Peggy-Carter-Captain-Britain.jpg\" alt=\"Peggy Carter Captain Britain What If Trailer\" width=\"800\" height=\"362\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Peggy-Carter-Captain-Britain.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Peggy-Carter-Captain-Britain-768x348.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p> \n<p>While Peggy Carter holds a significant place within the comic books, her niece Sharon Carter previously enjoyed more popularity. However, Hayley Atwell’s success in the movies and her <em>Agent Carter</em> television show forced the comic book side of the company to reconsider her role. Captain Carter made her first appearance as Captain America in <a href=\"https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Exiles_Vol_3_3\"><em>Exiles</em>&nbsp;volume 3, issue 3</a>. Her <em>What If…?</em> iteration appears slightly different, embracing the Union Jack on her chest instead of the Stars and Stripes. There is also a Captain Britain in the comics, historically it’s Brian Braddock, but it’s currently Betsy Braddock in the X-Men spin-off book,&nbsp;<em>Excalibur</em>.</p> \n<hr /> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-366304\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Marvel-Zombies-Iron-Man.jpg\" alt=\"Marvel Zombies Iron Man\" width=\"800\" height=\"358\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Marvel-Zombies-Iron-Man.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Marvel-Zombies-Iron-Man-768x344.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.marvel.com/comics/characters/1011002/marvel_zombies\"><em>Marvel Zombies</em></a> is one of the most popular what-if storylines that didn’t actually originate with the <em>What If…?</em> comic book. In 2007, just as <strong>Robert Kirkman</strong> and Charlie Adlard’s <em>The Walking Dead</em> gained serious steam, Marvel Comics approached the writer to put his undead spin on their universe. With artist <strong>Sean Phillips</strong>, Kirkman infected all our favorite heroes with the zombie bug, and they took to their ravenous appetites with gleeful, disturbing enthusiasm. Except for poor Peter Parker. He didn’t want to eat Mary Jane and Aunt May, but they were just too, too tasty. The Marvel zombies we see in What If…? look ultra scary, choosing to embrace fear rather than Kirkman’s sadistic humor.</p> \n<hr /> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-366305\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Shot-by-Shot-What-If-Ego.jpg\" alt=\"Shot By Shot What If Ego\" width=\"800\" height=\"361\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Shot-by-Shot-What-If-Ego.jpg 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Shot-by-Shot-What-If-Ego-768x347.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p> \n<p>You can’t have a Star-Lord without an Ego.

This time, we look at the ending and post-credits scene of Black Widow. Yes, prepare for spoilers.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>While not as originally intended, Phase Four of the Marvel Cinematic Universe began on Disney+ with the TV show <em>WandaVision</em>, followed by two more episodic series: <em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em> and <em>Loki</em>. So, already this age of the franchise feels structurally different from what came before. However, even if <strong><em>Black Widow</em></strong>, Phase Four&#8217;s first feature film, had actually kicked things off as planned, this new era would still unfurl somewhat strangely.</p>\n<p>And, no, I&#8217;m not talking about its prequel nature. I&#8217;m simply referring to the opening credits sequence and how it robs the audience of the usual mid-credits stinger. Director <strong>Cate Shortland</strong> provides an MCU spin on <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/black-widow-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the <em>Jason Bourne</em> spy thriller</a>, going so far as to supply a traditional title intro complete with blurry government documents and pixilated street camera footage. This bit would normally fall after the film&#8217;s climax, issuing its audience some breathing room before plopping one more scene to ease us into Marvel&#8217;s next tantalizing chapter.</p>\n<p>Instead, <em>Black Widow</em> cuts to black at the end, and the long list of names starts to scroll. The eager-beaver Marvel fan catches their breath &#8212; are we not going to get a setup here? Ten minutes later, and finally, thankfully, blessedly, a stinger arrives, and it falls in line with what the Disney+ shows have already established. A storm is brewing for our leftover Avengers.</p>\n<p>While those watching are firmly aware of the fate of Natasha Romanov (<strong>Scarlett Johansson</strong>) in <em>Avengers</em>: <em>Endgame</em>, the majority of <em>Black</em> <em>Widow</em> doesn&#8217;t want to bother with such dread. For most of its two-hour-plus runtime, the movie only concerns itself with establishing the previously unspoken family that helped get Nat to the Avengers. While not related by blood, she had a mother (<strong>Rachel Weisz</strong>), a father (<strong>David Harbour</strong>), and a sister (<strong>Florence Pugh</strong>).</p>\n<p>Nat&#8217;s clan is highly skilled and highly dysfunctional. They work together and demolish the Red Room once and for all. <em>Black Widow</em> concludes with Nat standing amongst the rubble awaiting arrest from General Ross (<strong>William Hurt</strong>) while her sister Yelena escorts the rescued and disenchanted Widow assassins to greener pastures.</p>\n<p>Only after we complete the long crawl to the post-credits scene does <em>Black Widow</em> acknowledge Natasha&#8217;s end. Yelena arrives at Nat&#8217;s grave, and we have to wonder: what lurks below the dirt? Was her corpse somehow retrieved from the bottom of that Vormir cliff? Or is this tombstone just an empty ceremonial spot for friends, family, and fans to gather?</p>\n<p>And gather they have. Yelena brushes debris from the grave, tidying the mementos that others left behind. She&#8217;s got a puppy with her, the dog she previously told Nat that she always wanted. Yelena does not break down with emotion, but her stride appears heavy, and grief sits inside her.</p>\n<p>The reflective moment is interrupted by a snarl-layered clearing of someone&#8217;s nasal passage. Yelena doesn&#8217;t turn to meet the schnoz&#8217;s owner, but we spot Contessa Valentina Allegra de la Fontaine (<strong>Julia Louis-Dreyfus</strong>). She blames her allergies, rubbing her lack of care in Yelena&#8217;s face.</p>\n<p>We <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/falcon-and-winter-soldier-episode-5-explained/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">last saw Val in <em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em></a>. She had her sights on John Walker (<strong>Wyatt Russell</strong>) in that series, pulling the failed Captain America under her wing. She knew the right words to stroke his ego, dismissing the uncaring public and the political suits who were too pleased to cast him off after he went a little berserk on the Flag-Smashers.</p>\n<p>Whatever she&#8217;s planning, Walker&#8217;s super-soldier rage is an easy instrument to manipulate. And now, standing next to Yelena at the end of <em>Black Widow</em>, it appears she has persuaded another living weapon to join her cause. Based on their interaction, it&#8217;s clear that this is not their first meeting, and when Val hands Yelena her next assignment, a mutual understanding seems clear.</p>\n<p>In the big reveal of the <em>Black Widow </em>post-credit scene, Val plops Clint Barton&#8217;s photo in Yelena&#8217;s mitt. She explains that Hawkeye (<strong>Jeremy Renner</strong>) is responsible for Natasha&#8217;s death. And while she&#8217;s not wrong, she&#8217;s not right either.</p>\n<p>In <em>Endgame</em>, Clint and Nat were sent to Vormir to retrieve the Soul Stone. Unfortunately, the Infinity Stone could not be collected simply. As explained by its guardian, the Red Skull, the Soul Stone could only trade its soul for another.</p>\n<p>The two Avengers exchanged blows via a seemingly never-ending slow-motion sequence, but eventually, Nat reached the cliff first. And she begged Clint to let her go so that the Avengers could reverse Thanos&#8217; genocidal terror. Nat explained that Clint had a family to live for, and she had no one. A lie that allowed Clint&#8217;s hand to release her.</p>\n<p>The ending of <em>Black Widow</em> establishes that there were more than Avengers who cared for her at the time, and most significantly amongst the bunch is her assigned sister, Yelena. Her fake mom and dad might have experienced some significant pain at Nat&#8217;s passing, but after recently reuniting for their Red Room adventure, Yelena must have crumpled in sorrow upon learning of Nat&#8217;s demise.</p>\n<p>As Val exploited Walker&#8217;s rage, she exploits Yelena&#8217;s devastation. Why would the Contessa want to eradicate Hawkeye? He&#8217;s clearly the easiest Avenger to murder. All he&#8217;s got are some arrows to defend himself. If you&#8217;re forming your own anti-Avengers team, you start killing small and work your way up to Hulk assassination.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/the-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier-comic-books/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">In the comic books</a>, Val was a Soviet sleeper agent who snuck into S.H.I.E.L.D. ranks before graduating to Hydra&#8217;s supreme leader. She&#8217;s a vicious threat who could turn Steve Rogers against Nick Fury with the flick of an eyelash. Think of her as Fury&#8217;s opposite, skulking in the shadows, craving global domination rather than protection.</p>\n<p>In the Disney+ shows, several superpowered villains have been carefully placed in stasis. Along with John Walker, there&#8217;s <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/sharon-carter-skrull/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a very Skrully Sharon Carter</a> selling national secrets, Baron Zemo <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/the-falcon-and-winter-soldier-finale-explained/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ordering car bombs</a> from his cell, and Agatha Harkness <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wandavision-episode-9-explained/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">magically restrained</a> to the suburbs. We assumed that <em>Black Widow</em> would pass the torch from Natasha to Yelena at the end, but maybe it&#8217;s actually a villain origin story.</p>\n<p>Now that it&#8217;s been set up by the <em>Black Widow </em>post-credits scene, Yelena and Clint&#8217;s confrontation is scheduled to go down in the upcoming <strong><em>Hawkeye</em></strong> series for Disney+ (release date: TBA). It&#8217;s going to take more than a conversation for Clint to explain what occurred on Vormir. And that explanation might matter very little to Yelena&#8217;s heartache.</p>\n<p>Sitting on the sidelines will be Val, probably with a big bag of popcorn on her lap.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong><em>Black Widow</em> is now playing in theaters and streaming on <a href=\"https://www.disneyplus.com/movies/black-widow/3VfTap90rwZC\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Disney+ with Premier Access</a></strong>.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/3rVlww9veIg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Jul 2021 14:16:27 +0000","feedId":24,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"5a6b6a73279474d207f04cc76cebf5d6","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Brad Gullickson","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/3rVlww9veIg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn80@2020_3/2021/07/12/18-35-34-403_e7112534237c7b8b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626114917574},{"createdTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:17","updatedTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:17","title":"The ‘Black Widow’ Box Office Could Be the New Normal for the MCU","link":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/?p=366349","description":"<p><em>Welcome to our <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/box-office/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">weekly box office report</a>, which we do a little differently. Rather than focusing on the money, FSR senior editor <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/christopher/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Christopher Campbell</a> is more interested in the estimated attendance — or number of tickets sold. Because the value of money changes over the years, but the value of actual moviegoers remains the same. This week, we look at the opening box office attendance numbers for Marvel&#8217;s Black Widow.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Imagine there was no pandemic. No, forget that. It&#8217;s not easy to do. And it&#8217;s insensitive to speculate what the movie industry would be like had a virus not spread around the world. Leave the &#8220;what ifs&#8221; to <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/what-if-trailer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Marvel&#8217;s other property</a>. For <em><strong>Black Widow</strong></em> and the facts about its opening weekend, there was only one series of events. And they do involve the COVID-19 pandemic. They also involve alternative distribution solutions in a time of ongoing concerns combined with a certain level of recovery. It&#8217;s possible they involve a new normal for Hollywood and movie fans. We know as much about the future as we do about what would have been a different past.</p>\n<p>All we know is that <em>Black Widow</em>, the twenty-fourth feature installment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, was released on July 9th in the US and other parts of the globe. The movie&#8217;s (estimated*) domestic gross for the weekend was $80 million. That translates to about 8.7 million tickets sold**. Which is a bit more than half the attendance of the MCU&#8217;s previous solo superhero effort, <em>Captain Marvel</em>, which sold 16.8 million tickets two years ago. But slightly above the installment prior to that, <em>Ant-Man and the Wasp</em>, which sold 8.3 million tickets during its first weekend in 2018. Other MCU movies <em>Black Widow</em> outsold at the box office in their debut include <em>The Incredible Hulk</em> (7.7 million in 2008), <em>Thor</em> (8.3 million in 2011), <em>Captain America: The First Avenger</em> (8.2 million in 2011), and <em>Ant-Man</em> (6.8 million in 2015). That makes its opening the eighteenth best of the franchise.</p>\n<h2>Black Widow Box Office vs. Disney+ Premier Access</h2>\n<p>Disney also reports <em>Black Widow</em> made around $60 million worldwide from its option to view the movie <a href=\"https://www.disneyplus.com/movies/black-widow/3VfTap90rwZC\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">on its streaming service</a> with an extra charge for &#8220;Premier Access.&#8221; At the going rate of $29.99 in the US (the price point is said to be equivalent in foreign territories where available), that&#8217;s about two million subscribers. How many actual people tuned in is unknown. Some of those two million Premiere Access purchases could have been for solo viewings. Others could have been for couples, or families of four or ten, or parties of many more. And I say purchases rather than rentals because subscribers have access to the movie as long as they have Disney+.</p>\n<p>We also don&#8217;t know how many of those subscribers were in the US. Or how many of them would have added to the ticket sales had the at-home option not been available. How many of them could have gone to the theater at this time? We don&#8217;t know how many of them <em>would</em> have gone to the theater at this time. There are plenty of people who just don&#8217;t like to go to the movie theater anyway, pandemic or no pandemic. A lot of those people also make up the illegal downloader group and would not have paid for the Premier Access on Disney+ anyway. The only thing we do know is what Disney claims as the &#8220;consumer spend&#8221; on that option and that it&#8217;s not part of the <em>Black Widow</em> box office gross.</p>\n<h2>Everyone&#8217;s Happy?</h2>\n<p>Did the streaming option have an impact on the movie&#8217;s ticket sales? That isn&#8217;t as important as the fact that there are now two separate ways for people to see a big movie during its opening weekend. And this could very well become the new normal. At least with the optics of <em>Black Widow</em>&#8216;s debut, movie theater owners are happy that another movie opened bigger than <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/f9-box-office/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the last big movie</a>. They have no idea how much more they would have made in other circumstances. Right now, they&#8217;re just glad to be getting some of that $80 million. I really hope cinemas are getting better opening weekend percentages on the gross than they used to for any movies simultaneously released on VOD or streaming. The latter of which gives the studio as much as the entire amount earned.</p>\n<p>And obviously, Disney is happy to have managed a significant worldwide opening gross ($158 million) plus the Disney+ money. It&#8217;s no <em>Captain Marvel</em> ($457 million worldwide opening gross), which actually had the seventh-best global debut of all time (third-best for the MCU). But if we imagine that the studio gets half the gross in all territories and the total Premier Access amount, that&#8217;s $139 million in their bank from <em>Black Widow</em>. Double <em>that </em>figure and you&#8217;d have the equivalent of the 35th <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_openings_for_films#Biggest_worldwide_openings_on_record\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">best worldwide opening gross ever</a>, which currently belongs to <em>Justice League</em>. But I&#8217;m getting back in the weeds of speculation. This data is impossible to know without Disney sharing more financial information than they&#8217;d ever likely make public.</p>\n<h2>Black Widow Box Office vs. Expectations</h2>\n<p>As it is at any time and under any circumstances, the most noteworthy comparison for a movie&#8217;s debut is against itself. That is, against what experts predicted beforehand based on buzz and studio expectations. On June 18th, <a href=\"https://www.boxofficepro.com/long-range-box-office-forecast-black-widow/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Box Office Pro&#8217;s long-range forecast</a> put <em>Black Widow</em> as selling an equivalent of somewhere between 7.1 million and 9.8 million, with a pinpointed prediction equivalent to 8.4 million. And the actual figure exceeded that potential. However, they updated their forecast on July 2nd for a range equal to 8.7 million to 12 million, and it just barely made the lowest number in that window. Box Office Pro held onto that range in <a href=\"https://www.boxofficepro.com/weekend-box-office-forecast-black-widow-setting-sights-on-80m-pandemic-era-record-debut-in-north-america/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">their pre-opening forecast last week</a>, though their pinpointed prediction was equal to 10.2 million tickets &#8212; too high.</p>\n<p>Another factor that might have contributed to the <em>Black Widow</em> box office, for better and worse, is its critical reception, which falls on the lower end for the franchise (our own <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/black-widow-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">review of <em>Black Widow</em></a> is relatively positive). With an 80% on Rotten Tomatoes, its overall reviews are tied with those of <em>Captain America: The First Avenger</em> for sixteenth best <a href=\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/franchise/marvel_cinematic_universe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">out of the twenty-four movies</a>. The Metacritic score, averaging a fewer amount of higher-profile outlets, is 68 and tied with <em>Avengers: Infinity War</em> for the thirteenth best of the franchise (and tied for seventeenth among <a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/pictures/marvel-films-ranked-worst-to-best\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">all Marvel Comics adaptations</a>). And moviegoers are responding similarly, going by the grade given to <em>Black Widow</em> by opening-night attendees <a href=\"https://www.cinemascore.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">via Cinemascore</a>. It&#8217;s tied for nineteenth best with four other movies. Only <em>Thor</em> ranks lower.</p>\n<h4 style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><strong>Cinemascore Grades for the MCU:</strong></h4>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>The Avengers</em>, <em>Avengers: Endgame</em>, <em>Black Panther</em> &#8212; <strong>A+</strong></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Ant-Man</em>, <em>Avengers: Age of Ultron</em>, <em>Avengers: Infinity War</em>, <em>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</em>, <em>Captain America: Civil War</em>, <em>Captain Marvel</em>, <em>Doctor Strange</em>, <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>, <em>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2</em>, <em>Iron Man</em>, <em>Iron Man 2</em>, <em>Iron Man 3</em>, <em>Spider-Man: Homecoming</em>, <em>Spider-Man: Far From Home</em>, <em>Thor: Ragnarok</em> &#8212; <strong>A</strong></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Ant-Man and the Wasp</em>, <strong><em>Black Widow</em></strong>, <em>Captain America: The First Avenger</em>, <em>The Incredible Hulk</em>, <em>Thor: The Dark World</em> &#8212; <strong>A-</strong></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Thor</em> &#8212; <strong>B+</strong></p>\n<p>Cinemascore&#8217;s polling is really about measuring the audience&#8217;s immediate response to a movie. And that tends to depend on their expectations. It&#8217;s been two years since the last MCU installment on the big screen. And a long wait for a superhero blockbuster in general since theaters closed last year. So fans of all levels were likely anticipating something impossibly satisfying. (I feel like just being in a theater again seeing anything on the big screen is as satisfying as can be). It&#8217;s not like the movie received a terribly low grade, however, and <em>Black Widow</em>&#8216;s Audience Score on Rotten Tomatoes (92%) is currently tied for the second-highest of the MCU. Still, word of mouth on it being essential will be relatively lower than it has been for Marvel movies.</p>\n<h2>The New Normal for Box Office Analysis?</h2>\n<p>Who knows how much longer the pandemic will be deemed a threat or concern for millions of would-be moviegoers? Will Disney see the streaming option as a convenience (for the consumer) and financial benefit (for themselves) regardless? How long will theater owners allow that option if it goes beyond this time of necessity? Will this be a new normal for the industry, or will it just continue temporarily? Whatever the case, the <em>Black Widow</em> box office and streaming numbers are the new marker for success for the MCU and summer blockbusters overall going forward, for however long.</p>\n<p>Hopefully, Disney continues to be transparent by sharing Premier Access earnings for <em>Jungle Cruise</em> when it opens at the end of this month, even though it&#8217;s likely to be a smaller figure. The only summer 2021 movie that could top <em>Black Widow</em> is <em>The Suicide Squad</em>, but Warner Bros. won&#8217;t be able to make a similar claim about add-on money as the DC comic book movie will debut on HBO Max simultaneously but not for an extra charge. The only apt comparisons might be to Marvel&#8217;s own <em>Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings</em> in early September and <em>Eternals</em> in November if they&#8217;re given the Disney+ streaming option.

There’s <strong>Nine Inch Nails</strong>, <strong>Radiohead</strong>, <strong>Garbage</strong>, and more, all working alongside Janiak and Phil Graziadei&#8217;s script to create <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/fear-street-1994-review-netflix/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the millennial’s dream slasher</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With nineteen songs from a golden era of alt-rock, the <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/81325689\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Netflix movie</a> pays homage to the teen comedies of the &#8217;90s that are chock full of then-hits. Nothing gets you more excited than the opening notes to a song you know and love. And don’t worry, <em>Fear Street Part 1 </em>knows that. Perhaps a little too well; the movie sometimes goes overboard in its attempt to evoke that alt-rock vibe with back-to-back songs that feel a bit too on-the-nose for the scene at hand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve ranked all of the needle drops on the <em>Fear Street Part 1</em> soundtrack, not on the quality of the song but on how well they function within their scene. What does it add to your experience of the movie? While each of these songs has a special place in my heart, some choices are more inspired than others, akin to a record scratch. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-19-thursday-by-99-tales\">19. &#8220;Thursday&#8221; by 99 Tales</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This first needle drop doesn&#8217;t have that nostalgia factor since the song was released just this year. While 99 Tales does embody that ‘90s grunge, alt-rock vibe, it doesn’t pack the same punch as the other moments on this list. It also plays so quietly under Deena speaking with her ex-girlfriend’s mother that it doesn’t add much to the moment other than soft ambient sound. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-18-creep-by-radiohead\">18. &#8220;Creep&#8221; by Radiohead</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Radiohead is a great band! The song “Creep,” while overused, is also great, especially when you’re feeling exceptionally moody. But here, when Deena puts on her headphones, presses play on her Walkman, and lays down on the green vinyl seat of a school bus, it is extremely on the nose. She is contemplating how much of an outcast she is, not only socially but economically, too. While such a moment of introspection makes sense here, especially as the Shadyside students head to the wealthy town of Sunnyvale, it feels a bit trite. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-17-insane-in-the-brain-by-cypress-hill\">17. &#8220;Insane in the Brain&#8221; by Cypress Hill</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The lyrics “insane in the membrane” blare as Deena is boarding the bus to a football game in Sunnyvale, decked out in a flamboyant band uniform, complete with a giant hat. The tone of this song, especially paired with the quick transition to “Creep,” is pretty jarring, but still pretty exciting. It matches the energy of the bus full of excited football players, cheerleaders, and band members, but it plays so quickly that the viewer gets whiplash. This is one of those moments in <em>Fear Street Part 1 </em>where the soundtrack feels a little over-the-top and unnecessary, like as many songs were crammed into the film as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-16-the-day-i-tried-to-live-by-soundgarden\">16. &#8220;The Day I Tried To Live&#8221; by Soundgarden</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This particular needle drop doesn&#8217;t stand out on the first watch of the movie. It seems like just another opportunity to play a song from the &#8217;90s while also providing some diegetic music in the background as Josh types in a chatroom, a scene that echoes the first time we meet him at the film’s start. However, it does indicate a quick tone shift from Deena being stabbed to Josh’s obliviousness to the situation at hand, adding in a dash of unexpected comedy. This speaks to the film’s tone as a whole where Janiak wants to balance the gore and violence with moments of humor that keep <em>Fear Street Part 1 </em>from falling into something too serious.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-15-you-always-hurt-the-one-you-love-by-the-mills-brothers\">15. &#8220;You Always Hurt The One You Love&#8221; by The Mills Brothers</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As Ruby, one of the supernatural serial killers stalking the group, approaches her victim, she starts to creepily sing “You Always Hurt The One You Love.” It’s so incredibly off-putting and hair-raising. But when she attacks Simon for the first time, her singing transitions to the original version by The Mills Brothers. While not as creepy as Ruby’s own acapella rendition, it adds a melancholy yet slightly more upbeat vibe that matches the scene’s terrifying tone.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-14-sweet-jane-by-cowboy-junkies\">14. &#8220;Sweet Jane&#8221; by Cowboy Junkies</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The first and only intimate scene of <em>Fear Street Part 1</em> is actually three scenes spliced into one as Deena and Sam make out, Josh and Kate kiss, and Simon masturbates in the bathroom. While “Sweet Jane” matches the quieter, more romantic vibes of the two kissing sequences, it is incredibly jarring, yet hilarious, as Simon examines himself in the mirror and reaches down his pants. That moment, in fact, is when the needle drops, which makes these other tender moments feel comical instead of genuine. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-13-school-s-out-by-alice-cooper\">13. &#8220;School’s Out&#8221; by Alice Cooper</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While this one isn’t necessarily part of the film proper, it does play over the teaser for the next installment, <em><a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/fear-street-1978-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Fear Street Part 2: 1978</strong></a></em>. If a particular needle drop higher up on this list can set the tone of the first movie, “School’s Out” sure sets the vibe for the sequel. It captures both that excitement of summer vacation and going to camp, while also adding in that grungy, intense vibe that doesn’t feel so innocent.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-12-killing-me-softly-with-his-song-by-roberta-flack\">12. &#8220;Killing Me Softly with His Song&#8221; by Roberta Flack</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The melodramatic “Killing Me Softly With His Song” plays in the halls of the dingy and dilapidated Shadyside hospital over tinny speakers. As Deena tries to get the attention of a bored nurse, the soulful tones of Roberta Flack drift through the awkward silence. These two elements stand in such stark contrast to one another and make for a phenomenal comedic moment and release in the midst of tension and horror.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-11-hey-by-pixies\">11. &#8220;Hey&#8221; by Pixies </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When Deena finally gives Sam the mixtape and they finally press play, Pixies’ “Hey” begins with its deep bassline and Black Francis’ raw vocals. While this is a moment when the two can finally be intimate, the lyrics of the song feel a little less than romantic. The line “there must be a devil between us” also, unfortunately, foreshadows that very situation as Deena learns that Sam is in fact possessed by the ghost of Sarah Fier. It’s one of the cool needle drops on the <em>Fear Street Part 1</em> soundtrack that seems like an odd choice but slowly reveals itself to make sense as the scene unfolds.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/fear-street-soundtrack-songs-ranked/2\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"364\" height=\"99\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/next-page.jpg\" alt=\"Next Page\" class=\"wp-image-361222\"/></a></figure>\n\n\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/-t3_QI8oRv4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 09 Jul 2021 20:16:00 +0000","feedId":24,"bgimg":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/next-page.jpg","linkMd5":"6dfbab6a7cf3ac5126cf739aaf6d9f2b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn44@2020_4/2021/07/12/18-35-17-661_2c5bdadceaa70996.webp","destWidth":364,"destHeight":99,"sourceBytes":4953,"destBytes":4110,"author":"Mary Beth McAndrews","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/next-page.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn44@2020_4/2021/07/12/18-35-17-661_2c5bdadceaa70996.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/-t3_QI8oRv4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn93@2020_2/2021/07/12/18-35-34-422_12d87b4961431dee.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1626114917570},{"createdTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:17","updatedTime":"2021-07-13 02:35:17","title":"Two Iconic Guest Stars Bring Joy and Sorrow into ‘The Bad Batch’","link":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/?p=366294","description":"<p><em>Welcome to <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/the-bad-batch-explained\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Bad Batch Explained</a>, our weekly column dedicated to those rough and tumble Clone Wars leftovers and their march through a bold, new galaxy far, far away. In this entry, we’re charging into Star Wars: The Bad Batch Episode 11 (“Devil&#8217;s Deal”) and considering how resistance forms rebellion.</em><em> So yes, there are spoilers here.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Clone Force 99 slinks into the shadows this week, appearing in only one scene of <strong><em>Star Wars</em></strong>: <strong><em>The Bad Batch </em></strong>Episode 11 (&#8220;Devil&#8217;s Deal&#8221;), which is instead primarily concerned with tracking the burgeoning rebellion breeding on Ryloth. Last week, in <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/bad-batch-episode-10-explained/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>The Bad Batch</em> Episode 10</a>, we observed how one lone senator resisted Imperial occupation. Now we witness what happens when a senator with far less noble characteristics hands his people and his planet to the Empire willingly.</p>\n<p>Senator <strong>Orn Free Taa</strong> was a frequent face in <strong><em><a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/best-star-wars-the-clone-wars-episodes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Star Wars: The Clone Wars</a></em></strong><em>. </em>The greedy Twi’lek was one of the first politicians to throw in with Chancellor Palpatine, and he was standing next to the dictator when he declared himself Emperor in <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/the-phantom-greatness-of-star-wars-episode-iii-revenge-of-the-sith-a0bde775412f/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><em>Revenge of the Sith</em></strong></a>. It was <a href=\"https://www.starwars.com/video/so-this-is-how-liberty-dies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Taa&#8217;s applause that killed liberty</a>.</p>\n<p>In <em>The Bad Batch </em>Episode 11, Orn Free Taa remains a glutenous creature, eagerly encouraging his people to lay down their arms and accept Imperial rule. The Twi’leks gather at his balcony and meet Taa&#8217;s words with hisses, but they silence when General Cham Syndulla appears by his side. Cham was a Clone Wars hero, and his actions always supported his vow. If he tells the people to lay down their arms, they will.</p>\n<p>We know that making nice with the Empire will only last so long. <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/31-things-we-learned-from-the-star-wars-commentary-bd6df301cf1a/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><em>A New Hope</em></strong></a> is on the horizon, and Ryloth will be one of the first Outer Rim planets to resist Palpatine&#8217;s galactic grip. In <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/star-wars-rebels-new-nostalgia-strikes-back/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><em>Star Wars</em>: <em>Rebels</em></strong></a>, the animated series that bridges the prequels to the original trilogy, we learn that Cham and his wife, Eleni, ignited this rebellion against the Empire. And in the process, Eleni died, forever altering Cham&#8217;s relationship with his daughter <strong>Hera</strong>.</p>\n<p>But in <em>The Bad Batch</em> Episode 11, this dark history is their unstoppable future. We, their audience, can do nothing but watch and whimper. For most of &#8220;Devil&#8217;s Deal,&#8221; Cham goes along with Orn Free Taa and Admiral Rampart. He can sense a terrible fate, and considering they just survived a nightmare, he&#8217;s not eager to jumpstart another one.</p>\n<p>What he can&#8217;t know is that it&#8217;s not a case of one nightmare leading into another. It&#8217;s all one long nightmare, carefully plotted by Palpatine. Cham is too entrenched. He can&#8217;t see what little options he has. The former &#8220;<a href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/The_Hammer_of_Ryloth\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hammer of Ryloth</a>&#8221; reluctantly sheds his legendary war-born status.</p>\n<p>Hera, however, charges forward with youthful zeal. The <em>Rebels</em> heroine has a destiny too. And she knows it and does not fear it. She sides with her uncle, who recognizes her desire to pilot starships as a skill to harness. Alongside <strong>Chopper</strong>, another <em>Rebels</em> icon, Hera gathers intelligence regarding the Imperial refinery scarring the Ryloth landscape.</p>\n<p>Watching Hera and Chopper collaborate in <em>The Bad Batch</em> Episode 11 is a dang delight. Cats like Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia will walk in their footsteps. These two refuse to fall in line and allow fear and its mongers to set their path. Right now in <em>The Bad Batch</em>, they&#8217;re locked on Ryloth, but her starship, the <em>Ghost</em>, awaits.</p>\n<p>Eventually, a small band of resistance fighters will form around them. The <em>Ghost</em> will carry Kanan Jarrus, the Jedi padawan who escaped Order 66 as seen in <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/the-bad-batch-premiere-explained/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>The Bad Batch</em> Episode 1</a>. She and Kanan will grow close, fall in love, and sire a son, Jacen Syndulla. Their romance is bound by Grand Admiral Thrawn&#8217;s downfall, equally tied to the Empire&#8217;s destruction.</p>\n<p>On the <em>Ghost</em>, Hera will also inspire Ezra Bridger, the young Jedi who vanishes into hyperspace with Thrawn and a half-dozen space-whales during <em>Rebels</em>&#8216; climax. And, <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/the-mandalorian-chapter-13/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">as we learn in <strong><em>The Mandalorian</em></strong></a>, Ahsoka Tano is hunting Thrawn, probably hoping to reunite with Bridger. Countless soldiers fight the war between the Dark Side and the Light Side, one resistance fighter inspiring the next.</p>\n<p>The <em>Star Wars</em> prequels reveal how heroes (and villains) stand on the shoulders of many. Teenage Hera senses Imperial injustice. Her parents wish her no harm, but when her mom learns of her refinery spying, she encourages Hera to tell all. Eleni&#8217;s strength in the face of tyranny emboldens Hera, which plants her on her uncle&#8217;s military supply run, where she comes face-to-face with Clone Force 99 and their kid sidekick, Omega.</p>\n<p>Hera and Omega&#8217;s meeting is the highlight of <em>The Bad Batch </em>Episode 11. The two younglings are both so eager to prove their worth. Hera&#8217;s immense jealously over Omega&#8217;s starship-living is adorable and telling. Hera will get there soon; she&#8217;ll house her own bad batch aboard her <em>Ghost</em>. In Omega, she catches a glimpse of what&#8217;s to come. It&#8217;s a future married with happiness and tragedy. We can&#8217;t help but be both excited and sorrowful for her to reach that destination.</p>\n<p><em>The Bad Batch</em> Episode 11 ends with her uncle&#8217;s supply run being foiled by Clone Force 99&#8217;s ex-comrade, Crosshair. Admiral Rampart puts Hera in chains, forcing her father to draw against the Empire. His insurgence is ignited, a road that leads to his wife&#8217;s murder and his daughter&#8217;s estrangement. And that estrangement puts her on the <em>Ghost</em>, leading the resistance fighters who achieve what Cham never could.</p>\n<p>The credits hit on a cliffhanger, but it&#8217;s easy to infer what&#8217;s coming next, in <em>The Bad Batch </em>Episode 12. Hera once mentioned in <em>Rebels</em> how Clones saved her life. We never got the details of that story, but we can bet that those clones were Clone Force 99. Next week, it will be Omega and Hunter to the rescue.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong><em>Star Wars: The Bad Batch</em> Episode 11 is now <a
