The hydroxyl group in GO plays a key role in covalently bonding the siloxane groups to the PG surface.\n\n\n</p>\n<br/>\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The present work elucidates the successful attempts toward the development of a highly transparent, flexible, and superhydrophobic (HTFS) film. The HTFS film is obtained by introducing graphene oxide (GO) into micropillar‐patterned poly(urethane acrylate) (PUA), followed by siloxane functionalization via chemical vapor deposition. The fabricated SPG<sub>2</sub> film (siloxane‐functionalized PUA incorporated with 0.1 wt% of GO) exhibits a water advancing contact angle, water receding contact angle, and sliding angle of 155.5 ± 0.3°, 143.4 ± 0.6°, and 9 ± 0.4°, respectively. The SPG<sub>2</sub> film also exhibits an optical transmittance of ≈84% at 550 nm. Mechanical wearable tests demonstrate no significant degradation in the self‐cleaning properties and optical transparency. The fabricated HTFS film (SPG<sub>2</sub>) is used as a protective layer for a solar module. This solar module shows improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) compared to that of a bare solar module owing to the high optical transparency and light‐trapping effect of the fabricated film that reduce the light reflectance. Furthermore, the SPG<sub>2</sub>‐protected solar cell demonstrates superior PCE under different surface contamination conditions comparing to other cells. The fabricated micropatterned SPG<sub>2</sub> film can be used for various outdoor applications that require high optical transparency, flexibility, and superior self‐cleaning performance.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 12 Oct 2020 08:15:27 +0000","feedId":23834,"bgimg":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/8241a8b5-01b6-474e-a7a4-7609b195372c/mame202000292-gra-0001-m.png","linkMd5":"8279daf0b34ac95785f0693c3596a018","destWidth":400,"destHeight":331,"sourceBytes":199220,"destBytes":21386,"author":"\nTian‐Feng Hou, \nArunkumar Shanmugasundaram, \nDong‐Su Kim, \nDong‐Weon Lee\n","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/8241a8b5-01b6-474e-a7a4-7609b195372c/mame202000292-gra-0001-m.png":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603166197709}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-10-20 11:56:37","updatedTime":"2020-10-20 11:56:37","feedId":23834,"fetchDate":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 03:56:37 +0000","fetchMs":183,"handleMs":35,"totalMs":60604,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":50,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"540163a0102fe53e04316a15a93523d0","hostName":"us-001*","requestId":"75f139a0ae4b494cbef5e35c48f6359f_23834","contentType":"application/xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":0,"bgimgsTotal":1,"bgimgsGithubTotal":0,"articlesImgsTotal":1,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":0,"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{"myreaderx14":1}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 02:31:29","updatedTime":"2020-09-07 04:24:44","id":23834,"name":"Wiley: Macromolecular Materials and Engineering: Table of Contents","url":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/rss/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)1439-2054","subscriber":138,"website":null,"icon":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/pb-assets/journal-banners/14392054.jpg","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx61/cdn22@2020_4/2020/09/06/20-24-43-242_1c40b79214e0d113.jpg","description":"Table of Contents for Macromolecular Materials and Engineering.
