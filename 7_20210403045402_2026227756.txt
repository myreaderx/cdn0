Over the years, millions of students at all different levels have consumed our learning content and worked through courses and codelabs to advance their skills. We continue to update and release new content as the ever-changing industry continues to evolve. </p> <p> As demand for skilled Android developers increases in the job marketplace, there is an even greater need for educators to train the next generation of Android developers. That is why we created these resources to help support and empower educators. </p> <p> <strong>New Android Development with Kotlin instructor-led curriculum</strong> </p> <p> Today we’re announcing the launch of our new instructor-led curriculum for<a href=\"http://d.android.com/teach\"> Android Development with Kotlin</a>. This is for classroom learning (virtual or in-person) with an instructor delivering lectures on important Android concepts, and students receiving hands-on practice through codelabs. The official course materials are now available and can be freely modified by instructors to adapt to their students’ needs. </p> <p> This is a major update to the curriculum we released in 2018. The updates account for the most recent changes in the Android platform, from the release of the <a href=\"http://d.android.com/jetpack\">Android Jetpack libraries</a> to Android development becoming Kotlin-first. The <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/kotlin\">Kotlin programming language</a> helps developers become more productive with more concise syntax and improved code safety. Over 60% of professional Android developers already use Kotlin, and it’s Google’s recommended programming language for new developers building Android apps. While instructors do not need Android or Kotlin experience to teach the curriculum, prior programming experience is recommended. </p> <p> We’ve partnered with universities and skilling partners in India such as Shivaji University, I. K. Gujral Punjab Technical University, Chandigarh University, Ganpat University, Telangana Academy for Skill and Knowledge (TASK), and Information and Communication Technology Academy of Kerala, who will be some of the first to offer this curriculum to their students in the Spring, with more universities to follow in the Fall and coming semesters. With the curriculum now available publicly, educators are welcome to start teaching Android development. </p> <p> <em>“As it’s mostly a hands-on course, students learn implementations which helps them in their placements in Mobile app companies.” -Dr. Kavita S. Oza, Shivaji University</em> </p> <p> <strong>Android Study Jams content now available for all developers</strong> </p> <p> Outside a formal classroom, learning in a peer group has also been shown as an effective way to learn Android. That is why we’re also making the<a href=\"http://d.android.com/teach#for-facilitators-leading-a-community-group\"> Android Study Jams program</a> available to all developers today. Android Study Jams enables a group of people to come together and learn Android development through hands-on codelabs in an online curriculum. An instructor is not needed to deliver lectures, but it is recommended to have a facilitator to organize the group meetings. No programming experience is needed to get started. Over 38,000 students in Google Developer Student Clubs around the globe have already participated in this program. </p> <p> <em>“Introducing people to Kotlin and being by their side at this first step which could touch their lives created great happiness and excitement for us.” - Ceren Tunay and Serkan Alc, Developer Student Club Turkey</em> </p> <p> With many paths to learning, it is always interesting to see the different journeys of students who become Android developers, and exciting to see the resulting personal success, innovative apps, and entrepreneurial pursuits they have. The following video highlights two developers and how learning Android development has shaped their careers. </p> \n  <center>\n   <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DZ-rEgAWFkQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n  </center> <p> For more details on these new offerings, check out the <a href=\"http://d.android.com/teach\">Android Development Resources for Educators</a>. </p> <p> For independent learners, we also offer <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/kotlin/campaign/learn\">self-paced learning content</a>, <a href=\"https://www.udacity.com/courses/all?skill=Android&amp;skill=Android+Development\">Udacity courses and Nanodegrees</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/androiddevelopers\">YouTube videos</a>, and more resources on <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/guide\">developer.android.com</a>.

Oboe's support of high-performance, low-latency audio across the widest range of Android devices is the right choice for most game developers.</em> </p> <p> <strong><em>Single API</em></strong> </p> <p> <em>On Android devices running Android 8.1 (API level 27) and higher, Oboe takes advantage of the improved performance and features of AAudio while maintaining backward compatibility (using OpenSL ES) with Android 4.1 (API level 16) and higher. Oboe also adds key features on top of the platform APIs to improve the audio developer experience, such as resampling, format conversion, and dynamic latency tuning. It performs audio data transformations, such as channel count conversion, when necessary to improve performance on selected devices, and has workarounds for other device-specific behaviors that improve the robustness of your audio code. In short, Oboe is now the recommended way to write audio code in C/C++ on Android.</em> </p> <p> <strong><em>Integrating Oboe</em></strong> </p> <p> There are two primary ways to incorporate Oboe library prebuilts into your project. If you're using the Android Gradle plugin version 4.1.0 or higher along with CMake, and are using or can enable shared STL, enabling Oboe is as easy as adding Oboe to your Gradle dependencies, enabling prefabs, and adding a few lines to your CMakeLists file. </p> <p> You can also integrate Oboe by statically linking using the Android Game SDK. Begin by <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/games/sdk#download\">downloading the library</a> and checking it into your source control system. You need to be using minSdkVersion of 16 or higher with NDK release 18 or higher. Then, to specify the version of the game SDK to link in that's been compiled for the given ABI, API level, NDK, and STL combination, add a compiler include path in this form: </p> <pre class=\"prettyprint\">gamesdk/libs/[architecture]_API[apiLevel]_NDK[ndkVersion]_[stlVersion]_Release\nExample: gamesdk/libs/arm64-v8a_API24_NDK18_cpp_static_Release</pre> <p> Then add <code>-loboe_static</code> to your linker command. Since you don't need to bundle the liboboe.so shared library, static linking gives you a smaller code footprint. If the ABI, API level, NDK, and STL combination doesn't have a precompiled version available for your settings, you can alternately link against the shared library. We have more guidance, including how to configure CMake for static libraries, in our <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/games/sdk/oboe/update-build-settings\">developer documentation</a>. </p> <p> <strong>Oboe Basics</strong> </p> <p> To output audio, you begin by creating a stream with the required properties, including a callback that is used when the stream requires new data. </p> <pre class=\"prettyprint\">oboe::AudioStreamBuilder builder;\nbuilder.setPerformanceMode(oboe::PerformanceMode::LowLatency)\n  -&gt;setSharingMode(oboe::SharingMode::Exclusive)\n  -&gt;setDataCallback(myCallback)\n  -&gt;setFormat(oboe::AudioFormat::Float);</pre> <p> You'll then populate the audio data inside of the callback. If the stream creates successfully, that means you got the requested stream type. If you didn't specify these types, you'll have to query to see what format was returned. </p> <pre class=\"prettyprint\">class MyCallback : public oboe::AudioStreamDataCallback {\npublic:\n    oboe::DataCallbackResult\n    onAudioReady(oboe::AudioStream *audioStream, void *audioData, int32_t numFrames) {\n        // We requested AudioFormat::Float\n        auto *outputData = static_cast&lt;float *&gt;(audioData);\n        // TODO: populate audioData here\n        return oboe::DataCallbackResult::Continue;\n    }\n};</pre> <p> For full details on using Oboe, <em>check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/google/oboe/blob/master/docs/GettingStarted.md\">documentation</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/google/oboe/tree/master/samples\">code samples</a> and <a href=\"https://google.github.io/oboe/reference/namespaceoboe.html\">API reference</a>.

I got an internship in a startup named GreenAppleSolutions. There I got a chance to work on an Android project from scratch and luckily my first project went live on the Play Store. During this whole internship, I found Android so interesting because everything you code, you can see the results live in front of you on your device.

I started working with mobile on iOS, in 2010, but then in 2011 my college final project was an app for civil construction and nobody on the team had a Mac, so we did it for Android (We got a 10, btw!)! At that time I was teaching technology to some government people and wasn’t into coding that much, but then after project in 2011 I got my first job as Junior Android Developer and it got me so hooked on the platform that I couldn’t leave!</em></p> <p><em>I was able to work with Java on Eclipse + ADT, Holo, ActionBarSherlock, the beginnings of Material Design and was attending Google I/O ’13 when Google announced Android Studio, which was a very humbling but insightful experience to me, not only because of the learning but also the people I met that helped me a lot as well!</em></p> <p><em>Since then, I’ve been working with mobile and, mostly, with Android for more than 10 years now, helping a lot of Brazilian tech companies and unicorns with their Android projects and since 2016 I’m one of the <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/programs/experts/directory/\">Google Developer Experts</a> for Android around here.</em></p> <p><em>Also, I love development and design communities, so I try to be involved with that as much as I can.

Seems silly, but this shortcut helps me so much to get going on my code, especially when it comes to refactoring. I use it everyday! </em></p> <p> <strong>What's the one piece of advice you wish someone would have given you when you started on your journey?</strong> </p> <p> <p><em>I think I would resume my advice in two words: learn and share. </em><p> <p><em>Learn as much as you can, not only with the amazing content available on official documentation, and from the community, but also learn from your own mistakes through consistent practice. There’s a lot of content available for free on the internet, and also both Google and GDEs (Google Developer Experts) like me can get you going, so keep practicing and get your knowledge online!</em></p> <p><em>And once you learn, share with other people! If I’m where I am today is because I was able to share what I couldn’t find when I was learning, so please, share your knowledge! The Android community is amazing and super helpful, you can reach literally the creators of the APIs and libraries you use on Twitter, Reddit and many other places.

I couldn’t afford to go back to school, so I decided to try my hand at starting a business instead. I launched a web application, but my customers insisted on having a native app for their needs as well. I originally looked for someone with more experience, but ultimately decided to just teach myself how to build an Android app. Fast forward to 2017, and my cofounder Christian and I launched the Android app for our company, <a href=\"https://qoins.io/\">Qoins</a>, on the Google Play Store.

At that time, I was a college student and writing my personal application with JavaFX, so I had experience and familiarity with Java. Then I soon started to port my app to Android. After graduation I worked at a software company and wanted to develop Android apps as my job. But there seemed no opportunity at that company. So I created my own small company that is the agency to develop Android apps.</em> </p> <p> <strong> What’s one Android development shortcut, tip, or hack you can’t live without?</strong> </p> <p> <em>There are many. If I had to pick one, it would be Android Studio. I always appreciate the awesomeness of Android Studio because I started Android app development with Eclipse.

However, that did not interest me, and I kept looking for something great to do with my Java knowledge. I bought my first phone, a Nokia, and saw apps in the phone and wondered how they made those apps. I researched and learned that apps were actually written in Java, and that's how my journey began. </em> </p> <p> <em>I recall building my first application, Simple Math, with only activities since fragments were not there; what an improvement we've had over the years. Simple Math had 500 downloads with a 4.5 rating, and this really motivated me to build more applications. I later won the Grow With Google Scholarship (2018), which boosted my career. During this one-year scholarship, I launched my second application, <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.madonasyombua.budgetbuddy&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US\">Budgeting Buddy</a>, on the Google Play Store and has a 4.5 rating with over five thousand downloads.

best when it helps developers create apps that people love. That’s why we are dedicated to providing useful APIs like <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/location-context/activity-recognition\">Activity Recognition</a> which, with the user’s permission, can detect user’s activities (such as whether a user is biking or walking) to help apps provide contextually aware experiences. </p> <p> So much of what we do relies on a good night's rest. Our phones have become great tools for making more informed decisions about our sleep. And by being informed about sleep habits, people can make better decisions throughout the day about sleep, which affects things like concentration and mental health. </p> <p> In an effort to help our users stay informed about their sleep, we are making our Sleep API publicly available. </p> <h2>What is the Sleep API?</h2> <p> The Sleep API is an Android Activity Recognition API that surfaces information about the user’s sleep. It can be used to power features like the <a href=\"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/digital-wellbeing/improve-your-sleep/\">Bedtime mode in Clock</a>. </p> <p> This sleeping information is reported in two ways: </p> \n  <ol> \n   <li>A ‘sleep confidence’, which is reported at a regular interval (up to 10 minutes) <li>A daily sleep segment which is reported after a wakeup is detected </li> </li>\n  </ol> <p> The API uses an on-device artificial intelligence model that uses the device’s light and motion sensors as inputs. </p> <p> As with all of our Activity Recognition APIs, the app must be granted the Physical Activity Recognition runtime permission from the user to detect sleep. </p> <h2>Why is this important for developers?</h2> <p> Developers spend valuable engineering time to combine sensor signals to determine when the user has started or ended activities like sleep. These detection algorithms are inconsistent between apps and when multiple apps independently and continuously check for changes in user activity, battery life suffers. </p> <p> The Sleep API is a simple API that centralizes sleep detection processing in a battery-efficient manner. For this launch, we are proud to collaborate with Urbandroid, the developer of the popular alarm app, <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.sleep&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US\">Sleep As Android</a> </p> \n  <div> \n   <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4uX0okdxdFk/YDUpibS2ZbI/AAAAAAAAQIQ/u_EpNo3KYvso4iu9cQhXfXQHQ9u63VETQCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/ic_launcher.1024.png\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; \"><img id=\"floatLeft\" style=\"width:30%; padding:0 1em 1em 0;\" alt=\"Android logo sleeping\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"225\" data-original-width=\"225\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4uX0okdxdFk/YDUpibS2ZbI/AAAAAAAAQIQ/u_EpNo3KYvso4iu9cQhXfXQHQ9u63VETQCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/ic_launcher.1024.png\" /></a> \n   <blockquote>\n    <em>Sleep as Android is a swiss army knife for getting a better night’s rest. It tracks sleep duration, regularity, phases, snoring, and more. Sleep Duration is one of the most important parameters to watch for ensuring a good night’s rest.

I'd been in that role for 11 years, building web apps for students and teachers. However, in 2012 the government decided that contractors were expensive and let us all go. So while in my hand-over period I'd read about some kids who were writing Android apps and making lots of money doing so. The Android Market was new and so any app uploaded got a large audience, and since I already knew Java it seemed like switching from a web developer to a mobile developer might be a smart career move. So I purchased a new phone, the HTC Legend and spent the next 2 weeks learning everything I could about Android apps. It was the first time I could run software I'd written on a device made by someone else that I could carry around with me. It was a very exciting time where any app idea seemed possible.</em> </p> <p> <em> When my contract finally ended, I managed to get a new job working for a mobile development agency and started working on Android apps for their clients. In order to learn more about Android app development, I started to attend the local Android meetups and Google Developer Group events, listening to speakers (mostly from Google) and trying to improve my skills as an Android developer.</em> </p> <p> <em> In 2013 I was offered the opportunity to become the organiser of the Sydney GDG and it was that year that I also attended my first Google I/O (I've been every year since). One of the hard parts about being a GDG organiser is finding speakers, so occasionally if there were no speakers, or if a speaker dropped out at the last minute, I would step in and give a talk instead. 2013 was also the year I decided to move on from the mobile agency I was working at, and I spent the next 5 years working as a freelance contractor, working with clients such as eBay, the Sydney Opera House, and one of the large banks in Australia. Being the organiser of GDG Sydney and a regular speaker at the meetups meant finding work was quite easy.</em> </p> <p> <em> In 2016 because of all the speaking I was doing I was approached to join the Google Developer Experts program, at this time I was doing regular talks at both the GDG Sydney and Android meetup events every couple of months. When I joined the GDE program, I handed over my GDG responsibilities to some friends, who still run it to this day. As part of the GDE program I've been lucky enough to attend many Google I/O events, and I've also had the opportunity to speak at conferences all over the world, including DroidCon Boston, Mobile Era in Oslo, DevFest Melbourne, DroidCon Singapore, Chicago Roboto and many others. Having the chance to speak to so many people all over the world has been very rewarding, and I've made many friends.</em> </p> <p> <em> In 2019 I joined the company where I work today - mx51, I'm the lead Android developer designing and building apps that run on payment terminals, which also integrate with Point of Sales systems. I'm still a GDE but with the 2020 madness the ability to speak at in-person events was severely hindered. I hope that in-person events will start again soon and that I can continue my journey as a GDE.</em> </p> <p> <strong>What’s one shortcut, tip, or hack you can’t live without?</strong> </p> <p> <em>Android development is constantly changing and advancing, so there is always something new to learn. My tip would be to always be learning, there are lots of ways to do this, subscribe to the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVHFbqXqoYvEWM1Ddxl0QDg\">Android Developers YouTube channels</a> and <a href=\"https://medium.com/androiddevelopers\">Medium publications</a>. Follow Googlers and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/googledevexpert\">Google Developer Experts</a> on Twitter for new tips and posts. Subscribe to the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/subscribe\">Android Weekly newsletter</a> for an overview of new libraries and blog posts, and attend your local <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/community/gdg\">GDG chapter and Meetups</a>. Not only are these great ways to learn new aspects of Android development, but with meetups they're a great place to meet other Android developers, share successes, and ask for advice on problems.</em> </p> <p> <strong>What's the one piece of advice you wish someone would have given you when you started on your journey?</strong> </p> <p> <em>When I started out as an Android developer, I could never have dreamed about being a Google Developer Expert, travelling the world and speaking at large events. It took me a long time to learn that it's ok not to know the answers to people's questions. If at an event someone asks something you don't know, it's ok to say so. You can always say that you'll find out later and get back to them. There is no need to make up a wrong answer on the spot and lead someone off course. People are often scared that a topic they're presenting might not be the best or greatest way to do something, and they fear looking stupid. If a person in the audience suggests a better way that shouldn't be a worry, 1) you learnt something, 2) everyone else learnt something and 3) there may be scenarios where your solution is better and a discussion can be had. So my advice would be, when speaking don't fear questions but embrace the opportunity to help someone immediately, or later, or perhaps discover something new yourself.</em> </p> \n  <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\">\n   <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mO2K76oUO_k/YDlS3oLBHFI/AAAAAAAAQLM/oNLQdR61aYEdu_D3ewtafLAKmc0v5Zw3QCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/ADJ_twitter_Dominguez.jpg\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; \"><img style=\"width:100%\" alt=\"Amanda Hinchman-Dominguez\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"675\" data-original-width=\"1200\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mO2K76oUO_k/YDlS3oLBHFI/AAAAAAAAQLM/oNLQdR61aYEdu_D3ewtafLAKmc0v5Zw3QCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/ADJ_twitter_Dominguez.jpg\" /></a>\n  </div> <h2>Amanda Hinchman-Dominguez</h2> <p> <strong>Tell me about your journey to becoming an Android Developer and how you got started.</strong> </p> <p> <em>I dabbled in Android development in college with the student mobile development group, but it wasn't until I was a few years in web development I made the real switch over.

As a kid, I was obsessed with robots. I remember my dad bought me a Lego set called Lego Mindstorm, which was basically a robotics set with sensors and motors, plus it was also programmable. After graduating high school, I enrolled in the US Army as an Aviation Maintenance Repairer. After 6 years, I was honorably discharged then enrolled in college at Fordham University. In 2014, I received a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. About 2 years later, I met my now wife, and together we started building EatOkra as a way for us to find black-owned restaurants in Brooklyn, NY. As we introduced the application to new people, they shared it with their network; before we knew it, many people were asking us to cover more areas in the south. </em> </p> <p> <strong>What’s one shortcut, tip, or hack you can’t live without?</strong> </p> <p> <em>Learn how to ask the right questions.</em> </p> <p> <strong>What's the one piece of advice you wish someone would have given you when you started on your journey?</strong> </p> <p> <em>One piece of advice I wish I took more seriously was to not build an application using beta technology. EatOkra's MVP was created using a beta version of a software framework. It started out good but then as they made updates, at times, I ended up having to wait months for certain issues to get fixed. I also had to completely stop and restart the app with an entirely new code base because the company decided to change how they architected the code.

There was no nano degree back in the day. So once I saw it, I started building some apps for myself. From there, I applied for my first job as a junior developer in a big consulting firm. Then I started seeing more courses and started following a lot of people at Twitter, like Sam Edwards and Joe Birch (both GDE). The community made me grow and learn. A couple of years later I got my first team and I began delivering speeches at conferences and keeping up my Medium blog on the side. The community offers me feedback and knowledge, and especially a place to learn. My first conference was with WomenWhoCode.org here in Mexico. They opened a place for me without any experience. The same happened with Google Developers Groups here in Mexico City. </em> </p> <p> <em>I became a Lead Engineer during my second job and I began doing worldwide conferences. I asked for feedback from Sam Edwards and Carlos Muñoz (also GDEs in Colombia) and they told me not to worry because I would amazingly and they encouraged me to keep doing it. </em> </p> <p> <em>I got a really nice offer to start from scratch here as a Mobile Platform engineer in Mexico City with a huge fintech Startup (Konfio.mx). This is my current job, which means I am in the architectural office where we choose new ideas and new processes and pretty much service all the areas in the company.</em> </p> <p> <em>I started creating a group of series to teach people some specific topics that I noticed were not deeply addressed.

Helping developers build sustainable businesses is a core part of Google Play’s mission. We work with partners every day to understand the challenges they face and help them bring their innovative ideas to life. Getting a new app off the ground and into orbit is not easy! To aid their quest for growth we provide a broad range of support, from powerful <a href=\"https://play.google.com/console/about/grow-your-audience/\">marketing tools</a> and <a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/03/google-play-console-powers-better.html\">actionable data in the Play Console</a>, education via <a href=\"https://playacademy.exceedlms.com/student/catalog\">Play Academy</a>,<a href=\"https://medium.com/googleplaydev\n\"> best practices</a> and <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/podcasts/apps-games-insights\">thought leadership</a> resources, programs such as the <a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/07/the-winners-of-google-play-indie-games.html\">Indie Games Festival</a>, <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/editorial_collection/promotion_topic_b000054_games_indie_corner_tp?hl=en_GB&amp;gl=US\">Indie Corner</a>, and <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/community/accelerators\">accelerator programs</a> around the world. We’re always looking for new ways to give them an added boost. </p> <p> Starting on July 1, 2021 we are reducing the service fee Google Play receives when a developer sells digital goods or services to 15% for the first $1M (USD) of revenue every developer earns each year. With this change, 99% of developers globally that sell digital goods and services with Play will see a 50% reduction in fees. These are funds that can help developers scale up at a critical phase of their growth by hiring more engineers, adding to their marketing staff, increasing server capacity, and more. </p> <p> While these investments are most critical when developers are in the earlier stages of growth, scaling an app doesn’t stop once a partner has reached $1M in revenue — we’ve heard from our partners making $2M, $5M and even $10M a year that their services are still on a path to self-sustaining orbit. This is why we are making this reduced fee on the first $1M of total revenue earned each year available to every Play developer, regardless of size. We believe this is a fair approach that aligns with Google’s broader mission to help all developers succeed. We look forward to sharing full details in the coming months. </p> <p> As a platform we do not succeed unless our partners succeed. Android and Google Play have always listened to our developer partners from around the world and we continue to take their input into account as we build and run the ecosystem. We look forward to seeing more businesses scale to new heights on Android, and to further discussions with our developer community to find new ways to support them technically and economically as they build their businesses. </p>\n    <div class=\"feedflare\"> \n     <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?a=ywEhT974TuU:tyXo_Mihayk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n     <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?a=ywEhT974TuU:tyXo_Mihayk:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?i=ywEhT974TuU:tyXo_Mihayk:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n    </div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/hsDu/~4/ywEhT974TuU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" /></p></p></img>\n</meta>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 16 Mar 2021 15:00:00 +0000","feedId":7,"bgimg":"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AVwnqEsxp7Y/YEwHMnaKYkI/AAAAAAAAQPk/XB6r-ApAW9oHD78jB4P8JejVYbjLDKnEACLcBGAsYHQ/s0/play%2Blogo.png","linkMd5":"fc44349aec26e4e3e6d5ad9dc5a25b62","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn43@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-52-32-490_c7300c93e0a3a9cc.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":512,"sourceBytes":39244,"destBytes":18656,"author":"Android Developers","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AVwnqEsxp7Y/YEwHMnaKYkI/AAAAAAAAQPk/XB6r-ApAW9oHD78jB4P8JejVYbjLDKnEACLcBGAsYHQ/s0/play%2Blogo.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn43@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-52-32-490_c7300c93e0a3a9cc.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn85@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-52-34-976_e6aa4d73b74f71ed.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?i=ywEhT974TuU:tyXo_Mihayk:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn10@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-52-34-949_7ae5dd9b5670a06b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/hsDu/~4/ywEhT974TuU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn8@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-52-35-578_fd18225e84ff7dad.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425543970},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:52:23","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:52:23","title":"MAD Skills WorkManager : Wrap-Up","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/hsDu/~3/59ER6GIBJQM/mad-skills-workmanager-wrap-up.html","description":"<meta name=\"twitter:image\" content=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xFLQ0zP3yeo/YGYmkWcHhYI/AAAAAAAAQTk/Nrk53fSAIises462o-RgP5rbZAe-XevyQCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/Untitled%2B%25282%2529.jpeg \"> \n <img style=\"display:none\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xFLQ0zP3yeo/YGYmkWcHhYI/AAAAAAAAQTk/Nrk53fSAIises462o-RgP5rbZAe-XevyQCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/Untitled%2B%25282%2529.jpeg \"> <p><em>Posted by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/calren24?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Caren Chang</a>, Developer Relations Engineer </em><p> \n    <center> \n     <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\">\n      <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xFLQ0zP3yeo/YGYmkWcHhYI/AAAAAAAAQTk/Nrk53fSAIises462o-RgP5rbZAe-XevyQCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/Untitled%2B%25282%2529.jpeg\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; \"><img style=\"width:100%\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"480\" data-original-width=\"1600\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xFLQ0zP3yeo/YGYmkWcHhYI/AAAAAAAAQTk/Nrk53fSAIises462o-RgP5rbZAe-XevyQCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/Untitled%2B%25282%2529.jpeg\" /></a>\n     </div>\n    </center> <p> In case you missed it, we’ve just finished a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtpgWjiXEfg&amp;list=PLWz5rJ2EKKc_J88-h0PhCO_aV0HIAs9Qk\">MAD Skills series on WorkManager</a>. We started by introducing WorkManager for those new to the library and then proceeded to talk more about advanced usages including how to test and debug your WorkManager code. The series ended with an episode on how to migrate your old code from GCMNetworkManager and FirebaseJobDispatcher to use WorkManager instead. </p> <p> Here’s a quick summary of what we covered. </p> <h2>Episode 1: WorkManager: Basics</h2> <p> In our first episode, we explored the basics of WorkManager through the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/codelabs/android-workmanager\">WorkManager codelab</a>. We started by understanding how to define work we want done, and how to schedule the work. We then moved on to implementing different types of work: unique and periodic. Finally, we ended the episode by taking a look at <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/appstandby\">app standby buckets</a> to better understand how WorkManager schedules work. </p> <p> \n     <center> \n      <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_SQM-10TB4k\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n     </center> <p> If you’re new to WorkManager, we also recommend taking a look at the following articles: </p> \n     <ul> \n      <li><a href=\"https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/introducing-workmanager-2083bcfc4712\">Introducing WorkManager</a> <li><a href=\"https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/workmanager-basics-beba51e94048\">WorkManager Basics</a> </li> </li>\n     </ul> <h2>Episode 2: WorkManager: Working in the background</h2> <p> The series continued with Ben giving a more in-depth look at how WorkManager deals with multi-threading. When working with threads, you have the option of using Executors, coroutines or RxJava, and Ben demonstrated each of these approaches with WorkManager. The episode concluded by demonstrating how to return a result when the work is completed so that the UI can be updated. </p> \n     <center> \n      <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kpuMD2P7s5M\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n     </center> If you’re interested in using WorkManager with coroutines, we also recommend this article from Florina: <a href=\"https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/workmanager-kotlin-apis-a0fb9dfbfeb6\">WorkManager - Kotlin APIs</a> </p> <h2>Episode 3: WorkManager: Advanced configuration and testing</h2> <p> In episode 3, we took a look at how to customize the initialization of WorkManager and support apps that span multiple processes. We’ve gotten a lot of questions from developers around testing and debugging, so Ben also dove into how to test your Workers, and useful debugging techniques. </p> \n    <center> \n     <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nGtLtmZe6do\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n    </center> <h2>Episode 4: Migrating from GCM NetworkManager and FirebaseJobDispatcher to WorkManager</h2> <p> In episode 4, we focused on how to migrate from old job scheduling libraries (GCMNetworkManager and FirebaseJobDispatcher) to WorkManager. Once your app starts targeting API level 30 and above, GCM NetworkManager and FirebaseJobDispatcher will no longer work on devices running Android Marshmallow (6.0) and above. If your app is still using either of those libraries, now is the time to update your apps to use WorkManager instead! </p> \n    <center> \n     <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5siAia1sb8w\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n    </center> <h2>Episode 5: WorkManager with Hugo</h2> <p> Android GDE <a href=\"https://twitter.com/botteaap\">Hugo Visser</a> talked about why he chose to use WorkManager in a health app he recently worked on and how the library has helped his development process. </p> \n    <center> \n     <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CEUnCHnc5aA\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n    </center> <h2>Episode 6: Live Q&amp;A</h2> <p> The series wrapped up with a live Q&amp;A session where we answered your WorkManager related questions. Watch the recording to see all your questions answered, including future plans for WorkManager, handling duplicate work, retrying failed work, and more! </p> \n    <center> \n     <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/y6bEQ84PHH0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n    </center> \n    <div class=\"feedflare\"> \n     <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?a=59ER6GIBJQM:T8QaA267-0E:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n     <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?a=59ER6GIBJQM:T8QaA267-0E:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?i=59ER6GIBJQM:T8QaA267-0E:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n    </div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/hsDu/~4/59ER6GIBJQM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" /></p></p></img>\n</meta>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 02 Apr 2021 15:16:00 +0000","feedId":7,"bgimg":"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xFLQ0zP3yeo/YGYmkWcHhYI/AAAAAAAAQTk/Nrk53fSAIises462o-RgP5rbZAe-XevyQCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/Untitled%2B%25282%2529.jpeg ","linkMd5":"bdebc66d23b17ba105c81b8b1baa9d9c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn6@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-52-32-634_9e760bd9fbafec76.webp","destWidth":1600,"destHeight":480,"sourceBytes":42417,"destBytes":19178,"author":"Android Developers","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xFLQ0zP3yeo/YGYmkWcHhYI/AAAAAAAAQTk/Nrk53fSAIises462o-RgP5rbZAe-XevyQCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/Untitled%2B%25282%2529.jpeg ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn6@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-52-32-634_9e760bd9fbafec76.webp","https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xFLQ0zP3yeo/YGYmkWcHhYI/AAAAAAAAQTk/Nrk53fSAIises462o-RgP5rbZAe-XevyQCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/Untitled%2B%25282%2529.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn35@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-52-36-466_f91ca0ed94fa01c7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn85@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-52-34-976_e6aa4d73b74f71ed.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?i=59ER6GIBJQM:T8QaA267-0E:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn3@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-52-36-937_c1e36fab8d9d0394.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/hsDu/~4/59ER6GIBJQM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn75@2020_2/2021/04/03/04-52-35-551_7f0daa533c168eb2.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425543961},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:52:23","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:52:23","title":"Android Auto Apps Powered by Jetpack","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/hsDu/~3/fWRU5Dbe5TY/android-auto-apps-powered-by-jetpack.html","description":"<meta name=\"twitter:image\" content=\" https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0pJ9Ne9DIdQ/YDk5B36zbeI/AAAAAAAAQKs/UBQNCPnDTnEQDMfUIn-hug1uzG9eSCj5gCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/ChargemapAndroidAuto.gif \"> \n <img style=\"display:none\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/ https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0pJ9Ne9DIdQ/YDk5B36zbeI/AAAAAAAAQKs/UBQNCPnDTnEQDMfUIn-hug1uzG9eSCj5gCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/ChargemapAndroidAuto.gif\"> <p><em>Posted by Eric Bahna, Product Manager </em><p> <p> In January, we <a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/01/expanding-reach-of-your-android-auto.html\">enabled the Google Play Store to accept open testing submissions</a> of navigation, parking, and charging apps.

We’ve updated the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/training/cars/navigation\">developer guide</a> and <a href=\"https://developers.android.com/training/cars/Android%20for%20Cars%20Jetpack%20Library%20design%20guidelines.pdf\">design guidelines</a> to cover <code>androidx.car.app</code>. Test your app with Android Auto 6.1, or later, then you can publish your app to open testing in the Google Play Store. <code>androidx.car.app</code> includes all functionality of the closed source library (<code>com.google.android.libraries.car</code>), and then some! For example, we added a new <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/car/app/model/GridTemplate\">GridTemplate</a>, which is useful when users rely primarily on images to make their selections. \n     <center> \n      <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MLpA7kPaK4I/YDk5t4cv-PI/AAAAAAAAQK0/m_pIhXTAbgQWSwYODMpM0qdm8fYPU1nGgCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/Screen%2BShot%2B2021-02-26%2Bat%2B1.06.08%2BPM.png\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img style=\"width:100%\" id=\"imgFull\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MLpA7kPaK4I/YDk5t4cv-PI/AAAAAAAAQK0/m_pIhXTAbgQWSwYODMpM0qdm8fYPU1nGgCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/Screen%2BShot%2B2021-02-26%2Bat%2B1.06.08%2BPM.png\" data-original-width=\"1058\" data-original-height=\"714\" /></a> \n     </center> <p id=\"imgCaption\"> <em>Examples of the new GridTemplate in <code>androidx.car.app</code></em> </p> <p> On September 1, 2021, the closed source Android for Cars App Library (<code>com.google.android.libraries.car.app</code>) will no longer be available and the Google Play Store will not accept submissions that use <code>com.google.android.libraries.car.app</code>. Our development focus from now, including new features, is on <code>androidx.car.app</code>. We encourage you to migrate now and we’ve created a <a href=\"https://developers.android.com/training/cars/jetpack-migration\">migration guide</a> that makes it easy. Migration usually takes less than a day, in our experience with early access partners. </p> <p> We’re working hard to stabilize <code>androidx.car.app</code> and prepare the Google Play Store for production submissions.

KSP offers similar functionality to <a href=\"https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/kapt.html\">KAPT</a>, however it’s up to 2x faster, offers direct access to Kotlin compiler features, and is being developed with multiplatform compatibility in mind. </p> <p> KSP is compatible with the Kotlin 1.4.30 release and onwards. You can check out the open source code and documentation in the <a href=\"http://goo.gle/ksp\">KSP GitHub repository</a>. </p> <h2>Why KSP?</h2> <p> The #1 request we hear from Kotlin developers is to make build speeds faster. Many developers iterate on and deploy apps dozens of times a day, so having to sit around waiting for a slow build can be very time consuming. One of the biggest challenges with compiling Kotlin code is that Kotlin doesn’t have a native annotation processing system. Annotation processors like <a href=\"http://d.android.com/room\">Room</a> are ubiquitous on Android and rely on Java annotation processing compatibility through the Kotlin Annotation Processing Tool (KAPT). KAPT can be slow to run, though, since it requires generating intermediate Java stubs that can then be ingested by the Java annotation processing system. </p> <p> When designing KSP, we thought about what annotation processing would look like for Kotlin if we built it from the ground up. KSP offers a powerful and yet simple API for parsing Kotlin code directly, dramatically reducing the build speed tax imposed by KAPT’s stub generation. Indeed, initial benchmarks with the Room library show that KSP is approximately 2x faster than KAPT. </p> <h2>Getting started</h2> <p> To see what KSP looks like in action, download the <a href=\"https://github.com/google/ksp/releases/download/1.4.30-1.0.0-alpha02/playground.zip\">KSP playground project</a> from GitHub. In it you’ll find: </p> \n    <ul> \n     <li><strong>Library: </strong>A toy <code>test-processor</code> library that implements the builder pattern as a KSP processor <li><strong>Consuming project: </strong>A <code>workload</code> directory that shows how to use the builder processor in a real-world Kotlin project </li> </li> \n    </ul> <p> All of the logic for implementing the builder is in <code>test-processor</code> — for the consumer (<code>workload</code>), the only difference between using KAPT and KSP is a two-line build file change: </p> \n    <center> \n     <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WSEWZfQjV0w/YCLCf32fz4I/AAAAAAAAQEE/jz_02cOCV7kA4OzvSEknvLFDM_GE4x5_ACLcBGAsYHQ/s0/Screen%2BShot%2B2021-02-09%2Bat%2B12.11.52%2BPM.png\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img style=\"width:100%\" id=\"imgFull\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WSEWZfQjV0w/YCLCf32fz4I/AAAAAAAAQEE/jz_02cOCV7kA4OzvSEknvLFDM_GE4x5_ACLcBGAsYHQ/s0/Screen%2BShot%2B2021-02-09%2Bat%2B12.11.52%2BPM.png\" data-original-width=\"1058\" data-original-height=\"714\" /></a> \n    </center> <p> This is the goal of KSP: most Android app developers don’t need to worry about its internals; other than this one line change, a library that supports KSP looks just like a normal annotation processor, only it’s up to 2x faster. That said, using KAPT and KSP in the same module will likely slow down your build initially, so during this alpha period, it is best to use KSP and KAPT in separate modules. </p> <p> As more annotation processors adopt KSP, we expect most of your modules to be able to use KSP as a near drop-in replacement for KAPT. For now, you can check out which annotation processors offer KSP support in <a href=\"https://github.com/google/ksp#supported-libraries\">this table</a>. If a library that supports or is&nbsp;implementing support for KSP is missing from the table, please submit a pull request with your suggestion! </p> <p> If you are an author of a library that currently uses annotation processing, you can find more information on how to make your library compatible with KSP in the <a href=\"https://github.com/google/ksp/blob/master/docs/quickstart.md\">quickstart</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/google/ksp#how-ksp-looks-at-source-files\">README</a> guides. </p> <p> For library authors, now that KSP is in alpha, it’s a great time to start looking closely at it and giving us feedback on the API in the <a href=\"https://github.com/google/ksp/issues\">KSP issue tracker</a>. In addition, we regularly post release updates in the #ksp channel on <a href=\"https://surveys.jetbrains.com/s3/kotlin-slack-sign-up?_ga=2.48535333.2098599687.1609969960-1527966202.1605648568&amp;_gac=1.146918085.1607395508.CjwKCAiAwrf-BRA9EiwAUWwKXktnCOQy3WhM7Xq-xLGrdg9gTJK3LnofgXHZtq2PsbzL8O5j1uSw2hoC33wQAvD_BwE\">Kotlin Slack</a>.

In these types of cases, how do you know if your app or game’s performance is <em>good</em> and where you can be better? </p> <p> <strong>With this launch, we’re here to help all developers better contextualize and understand their performance. Here’s what’s new:</strong> </p> <p> <strong>New engagement and monetization metrics</strong> </p> <p> In partnership with experts in mobile apps and games growth, we’ve introduced a new set of engagement and monetization metrics based on best practices in evaluating app and game performance. These include: </p> \n    <ul> \n     <li><strong>DAU/MAU</strong><br>The ratio of users who open your app each day vs. each month (28-day rolling period). This is a key measure of “stickiness.” It tells you if you’re driving regular, habitual use. <li><strong>28-day returning users</strong><br>The percentage of your daily users who have also used your app in the previous 28 days. This can help you judge if you’re building a loyal audience. <li><strong>DAU</strong> and <strong>MAU</strong> <strong>growth rates</strong><br>How quickly you’re growing the number of users who open your app daily and at least once in 28 days. These are your fundamental audience-growth measurements. <li><strong>ARPDAU<br /></strong>Average Revenue Per Daily Active User. This is your daily revenue divided by your DAU, which measures your success in driving revenue from your users. <li><strong>Average purchase value<br /></strong>How much you make on average from each transaction. This is useful for pricing optimization decisions. <li><strong>Purchases per buyer </strong>and <strong>User-buyer ratios<br /></strong>The number of times buyers transact with you, and the percentage of your DAUs and MAUs who become buyers. Especially helpful if you’re looking to see if there’s growth opportunity in increasing how many people purchase or how often. </li> </li></li></br></li></br></li></br></li>\n    </ul> <p> In total, we’re launching <a href=\"https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/139628#install\">15 new normalized metrics</a> with benchmarks, and making the absolute numerators and denominators available to query, too. They can all be found in the new “Compare to peers” tab in the <a href=\"https://play.google.com/console/app/statistics?tab=COMPARE_TO_PEERS\">Statistics page*</a>. For convenience, we’ve included other key normalized metrics, like store listing conversions, here too. </p> <p> <strong>Track your performance with peerset comparison</strong> </p> <p> To power your decision-making and help you discover areas of opportunity, all of these new normalized metrics are launching with peerset comparison performance as standard. You’ll be able to track your metrics over time and compare up to 250 different types of apps and games such as “Match-3 games,” “Audiobooks,” or “Comics.” </p> <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--xDtUROQ700/YD0a4G-PzSI/AAAAAAAAQME/9y3qyQqpwLM7xuJn0I8XeCi7HEdG7lyQgCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/Stats%2Bpage%2Bcropped.png\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img id=\"imgFull\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--xDtUROQ700/YD0a4G-PzSI/AAAAAAAAQME/9y3qyQqpwLM7xuJn0I8XeCi7HEdG7lyQgCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/Stats%2Bpage%2Bcropped.png\" data-original-width=\"1058\" data-original-height=\"714\" /></a> <p id=\"imgCaption\"> Compare your performance to peers on the Statistics page in Google Play Console. </p> <p> Country filters allow you to customise these insights to suit your business needs. For instance, you’ll be able to see if games similar to yours are driving more revenue from users in Japan, or if your team’s latest feature drop means that you’re outperforming other similar apps in terms of loyalty in India. </p> <p> During our development process, we tested this suite of new insights with select partners. As well as useful in shaping our approach, their feedback has been positive: </p> <p> \n     <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\">\n      <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LOLfTYfuatM/YD1dKuDVrNI/AAAAAAAAQNM/C8Sf6JDNoUgaoRW_LVqZeVfjyoVaVi7AACLcBGAsYHQ/s0/Screen%2BShot%2B2021-03-01%2Bat%2B4.30.11%2BPM.png\" style=\"display: block; padding: -10em; text-align: center; \"><img style=\"width:150px\" id=\"floatRight\" alt=\"Plarium logo\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"784\" data-original-width=\"784\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LOLfTYfuatM/YD1dKuDVrNI/AAAAAAAAQNM/C8Sf6JDNoUgaoRW_LVqZeVfjyoVaVi7AACLcBGAsYHQ/s0/Screen%2BShot%2B2021-03-01%2Bat%2B4.30.11%2BPM.png\" /></a>\n     </div> <em>\"These new metrics and comparisons help drive our decision-making. Not just around what we should do with our games right now, but also strategic decisions about upcoming games. For us, it's already one of the most valuable features on the Play Console.\"</em> </p> <p> <strong>Guy Ulmer, <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=5766366711041032164&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US\">Plarium Global Ltd.</a> </strong> </p> <p> To help you make the most of these new metrics and insights, we’ve launched a new course on <a href=\"http://g.co/playacademy/metrics\">Play Academy</a> to get you up to speed. You can also check out our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWz5rJ2EKKc9nK58h74i2L_jetju1Hmo8&amp;app=desktop\">masterclass webinars</a> about super-powering your growth. </p> <p> <strong>Strong privacy protections for users and developers</strong> </p> <p> The data powering these new metrics comes from users who have agreed to share their app activity with Google, and is modeled to better represent the whole population. The data simply records if an app is opened in the foreground. Users have control over their data and can opt out of sharing it, or delete individual events, in <a href=\"http://myactivity.google.com\">myactivity.google.com</a>. </p> <p> Additionally, these new developer metrics are our first to use differential privacy - an advanced technique that provides increased privacy protections across datasets. You can find out more about this approach <a href=\"https://developers.googleblog.com/2021/01/how-were-helping-developers-with-differential-privacy.html\">in our technical blog</a>. </p> <p> Just like previous benchmark launches, all of the peer comparison metrics come with protections for developer privacy. The data is generated from a large number of apps and games, and the peer groups, driven by Play Store’s advanced tagging system, do not share the performance of individual apps. So although you can find high-quality, reliable, useful peerset comparisons we've worked to obscure the performance of any individual competitor’s app from the peersets you see, and obscure your apps' performance in peersets too. </p> <p> <strong>More to come</strong> </p> <p> This is the first launch of a multi-year project to bring more helpful insights and active recommendations to Google Play Console. The largest mobile app developers often use growth consultants to help inform their long-term strategic product decisions. We’re dedicated to bringing this kind of help and expertise to <em>all</em> Play developers via the console. So look out for more launches over next year! </p> <br> <p> <small> <i>*Please note you need a Google Play Console account to access these links.</i> </small> <p> <br> \n        <center> \n         <p> How useful did you find this blog post? </p> \n         <p> <a href=\" \" style=\"color: gold;\">★</a> <a href=\" \" style=\"color: gold;\">★</a> <a href=\" \" style=\"color: gold;\">★</a> <a href=\" \" style=\"color: gold;\">★</a> <a href=\" \" style=\"color: gold;\">★</a> </p> \n         <p> <a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1LBva3U1LCI/W6kL2pl9ZYI/AAAAAAAAFys/grkBZRKkAWE1eLAh6DPffThJ7gP__SREACLcBGAs/s1600/play_logo_16_9%2B%25285%2529.png\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img id=\"imgHalf\" style=\"width:40%;\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1LBva3U1LCI/W6kL2pl9ZYI/AAAAAAAAFys/grkBZRKkAWE1eLAh6DPffThJ7gP__SREACLcBGAs/s1600/play_logo_16_9%2B%25285%2529.png\" data-original-width=\"499\" data-original-height=\"281\" /></a> </p> \n        </center> \n        <div class=\"feedflare\"> \n         <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?a=-_INzOIq1Cg:zBOEjpBQ-rk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n         <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?a=-_INzOIq1Cg:zBOEjpBQ-rk:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?i=-_INzOIq1Cg:zBOEjpBQ-rk:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n        </div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/hsDu/~4/-_INzOIq1Cg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" /></br></p></p></br></p></p></img>\n</meta>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 02 Mar 2021 16:22:00 +0000","feedId":7,"bgimg":"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rWkGuip_YZE/YD5KIgm9lGI/AAAAAAAAQNk/O7k9AkpFLEUcccq09LGwN1-D1JL1DqWbQCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/google-play-engagement-metrics-launch.png","linkMd5":"ed81f62acb1d63467fc6acfd74427623","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn93@2020_4/2021/04/03/04-52-32-365_30fc54ce43b24653.webp","destWidth":2048,"destHeight":1024,"sourceBytes":107470,"destBytes":39486,"author":"Android Developers","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rWkGuip_YZE/YD5KIgm9lGI/AAAAAAAAQNk/O7k9AkpFLEUcccq09LGwN1-D1JL1DqWbQCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/google-play-engagement-metrics-launch.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn93@2020_4/2021/04/03/04-52-32-365_30fc54ce43b24653.webp","https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--xDtUROQ700/YD0a4G-PzSI/AAAAAAAAQME/9y3qyQqpwLM7xuJn0I8XeCi7HEdG7lyQgCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/Stats%2Bpage%2Bcropped.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn81@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-52-35-091_952c744730342ccb.webp","https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LOLfTYfuatM/YD1dKuDVrNI/AAAAAAAAQNM/C8Sf6JDNoUgaoRW_LVqZeVfjyoVaVi7AACLcBGAsYHQ/s0/Screen%2BShot%2B2021-03-01%2Bat%2B4.30.11%2BPM.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn15@2020_2/2021/04/03/04-52-35-786_491ad9fb33ebf44d.webp","https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1LBva3U1LCI/W6kL2pl9ZYI/AAAAAAAAFys/grkBZRKkAWE1eLAh6DPffThJ7gP__SREACLcBGAs/s1600/play_logo_16_9%2B%25285%2529.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn15@2020_2/2021/04/03/04-52-36-271_536270849f70b284.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn85@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-52-34-976_e6aa4d73b74f71ed.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?i=-_INzOIq1Cg:zBOEjpBQ-rk:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn75@2020_4/2021/04/03/04-52-36-703_3bc45ba81f2d1aa0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/hsDu/~4/-_INzOIq1Cg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn45@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-52-34-917_60bc212092d633ad.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425543976},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:52:23","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:52:23","title":"An update on Android's audio latency ","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/hsDu/~3/aDcS6zs7H00/an-update-on-androids-audio-latency.html","description":"<meta content=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SoP_7OT6zGo/YEJnBCQPS1I/AAAAAAAAQN8/pRLz9614wPQRykezF7cjncWvvpFTFFiFwCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/Android-update-on-audio-latency.png\" name=\"twitter:image\" /> \n<img src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SoP_7OT6zGo/YEJnBCQPS1I/AAAAAAAAQN8/pRLz9614wPQRykezF7cjncWvvpFTFFiFwCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/Android-update-on-audio-latency.png\" style=\"display: none;\" /> \n<p><em>Posted by Don Turner - Android Developer Relations Engineer</em></p> \n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\">\n <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SoP_7OT6zGo/YEJnBCQPS1I/AAAAAAAAQN8/pRLz9614wPQRykezF7cjncWvvpFTFFiFwCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/Android-update-on-audio-latency.png\" style=\"display: block;

These kinds of apps are sensitive to \"tap-to-tone\" latency - the time taken from tapping on the screen to hearing a sound. The latency introduced by tapping <a href=\"https://github.com/google/walt/blob/master/docs/TapLatency.md\">the touch screen is anywhere from 10-35ms</a>, with 20ms being fairly typical on modern Android devices. </p> \n<p> To estimate tap-to-tone latency given round-trip latency, you can subtract the audio input latency (typically 5ms), and add the touch latency (typically 20ms). In other words, add 15ms to the round-trip latency. Given the numbers above, this means the average tap-to-tone latency of the most popular android phones is also well under that required for most real-time audio applications. </p> \n<h2>Looking to the future</h2> \n<p> Despite the significant reductions in audio latency across the Android ecosystem our work is nowhere near complete. 20ms round-tip latency is required for<a href=\"https://source.android.com/compatibility/11/android-11-cdd#5_10_professional_audio\"> Android professional audio apps</a>, and 10ms remains the long term goal. And at this time some less popular devices still have high audio latency. However, if you have been holding back on developing an Android app because of audio latency, it might be time to reconsider. </p> \n<p> To get started, check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/google/oboe/blob/master/docs/GettingStarted.md\">Oboe getting started guide</a> or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csfHAbr5ilI&amp;list=PLWz5rJ2EKKc_duWv9IPNvx9YBudNMmLSa\">video tutorials</a>. </p> \n<h2>Data sources and tools</h2> \n<p> <a href=\"https://github.com/google/oboe/tree/master/apps/OboeTester/docs\">OboeTester</a> </p> \n<p> <a href=\"https://github.com/google/walt\">WALT</a> </p> \n<p> <a href=\"http://appbrain.com\">appbrain.com</a> </p> \n<p> <a href=\"http://superpowered.com/latency\">superpowered.com/latency</a> </p> \n<p> <a href=\"http://gsmarena.com\">gsmarena.com</a> </p> \n<p> <a href=\"http://juce.com/maq\">juce.com/maq</a> </p> \n<p> various internal data sources </p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?a=aDcS6zs7H00:l00vamtWRlk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?a=aDcS6zs7H00:l00vamtWRlk:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?i=aDcS6zs7H00:l00vamtWRlk:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/hsDu/~4/aDcS6zs7H00\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 05 Mar 2021 18:00:00 +0000","feedId":7,"bgimg":"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SoP_7OT6zGo/YEJnBCQPS1I/AAAAAAAAQN8/pRLz9614wPQRykezF7cjncWvvpFTFFiFwCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/Android-update-on-audio-latency.png","linkMd5":"3de5dc7a993ad873c531eb98ccc5c841","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn82@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-52-32-840_cbc2a8079c4ed64d.webp","destWidth":3250,"destHeight":968,"sourceBytes":36547,"destBytes":48286,"author":"Android Developers","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SoP_7OT6zGo/YEJnBCQPS1I/AAAAAAAAQN8/pRLz9614wPQRykezF7cjncWvvpFTFFiFwCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/Android-update-on-audio-latency.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn82@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-52-32-840_cbc2a8079c4ed64d.webp","https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VAb0sVJS41w/YE_lpC5fwRI/AAAAAAAAQQU/ihhetZszATUCz1UuvMRDObl8Kx1T2n7_QCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/aaudio.png":null,"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VqGMk9xtzW4/YDboJ5iDsZI/AAAAAAAAQJQ/3DU5kl_c-awndCSzUwF59PDgxsMrcGmMQCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/image%2B3.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn56@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-52-36-093_8fe389353623be83.webp","https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Ic_vdBVC5HM/YDbpBT2nnAI/AAAAAAAAQJY/aPJLmTFxUX8BDA5OaiZ1MHE6YDilcP-uQCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/image%2B4.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn17@2020_2/2021/04/03/04-52-34-999_18058df0ad940929.webp","https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZycUtpkWu8I/YDbpmeIYajI/AAAAAAAAQJg/FMR0U_HG6x0jd1tFggfZDVZ2jmQw_d1wACLcBGAsYHQ/s0/image%2B5.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn84@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-52-36-792_84ab5f1fc1c80e9e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn85@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-52-34-976_e6aa4d73b74f71ed.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?i=aDcS6zs7H00:l00vamtWRlk:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn92@2020_2/2021/04/03/04-52-36-853_536a40d86ad8ca5b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/hsDu/~4/aDcS6zs7H00":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn57@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-52-34-944_d2dc1d5473b79e8a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425543974},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:52:23","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:52:23","title":"Android Dev Challenge: lift off with Jetpack Compose","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/hsDu/~3/iqqBMqCqzrs/android-dev-challenge-lift-off-with.html","description":"<meta name=\"twitter:image\" content=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6fNVuYUzbmE/YDRI8cdnkmI/AAAAAAAAQH0/2U_XEL2r4LMYeWJbRHnVHrhaA-FrjEKywCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/JCM21013_Thumbnails-03.jpg\"> \n <img style=\"display:none\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6fNVuYUzbmE/YDRI8cdnkmI/AAAAAAAAQH0/2U_XEL2r4LMYeWJbRHnVHrhaA-FrjEKywCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/JCM21013_Thumbnails-03.jpg\"> <p><em>Posted by The Jetpack Compose Team </em><p> <p> <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose\">Jetpack Compose</a> is Android’s modern toolkit for building native UI.

Today we’re bringing you the next milestone build in this year’s release, with more new features and changes for you to try with your apps. Our program of early previews is driven by our core philosophy of openness and collaboration with you, our community. Your input helps us make Android a better platform for developers and users, so keep the feedback coming! </p> <p> In Android 12 we’re making the OS smarter, easier to use, and better performing, with privacy and security at the core. We’re also working to give you new tools for building great experiences for users, whether they’re using phones, laptops, tablets, TVs, or cars. Some things to look for in today’s release include new rounded corners APIs, improved picture-in-picture APIs, better companion device management, easier effects like blur and color filter, app overlay controls, and more. </p> <p> There’s a lot to check out in Developer Preview 2 - read on for a few highlights and <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12\">visit the Android 12 developer site</a> for details and downloads for Pixel. For those already running Developer Preview 1 or 1.1, we’re also offering an over-the-air (OTA) update to today’s release. </p> <p> <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/feedback\">Let us know what you think</a>, and thank you to everyone who has shared such great feedback so far. </p> \n    <section> \n     <h2><strong>Trust and safety</strong></h2> \n     <p> We’re continuing to focus on giving users more transparency and control while keeping their devices and data secure. In today’s release, we’ve added some new features to check out and test with your apps. </p> \n     <p> <strong>App overlay controls</strong> - Android’s system alert window gives apps a way to get users’ attention for important actions by showing an overlay on top of the active app. These windows can interrupt the user, though, so we already require apps to <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW\">request permission</a> before displaying them. Now in Android 12 we’re giving you control over whether these overlays can be shown over your content. After you’ve declared <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#HIDE_OVERLAY_WINDOWS\">a new permission</a>, your app can call <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/Window#setHideOverlayWindows(boolean)\">Window#setHideOverlayWindows()</a> to indicate that all <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/WindowManager.LayoutParams#TYPE_APPLICATION_OVERLAY\">TYPE_APPLICATION_OVERLAY</a> windows should be hidden when your app’s window is visible. You might choose to do this when displaying sensitive screens, such as transaction confirmation flows. More <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/features#hide-application-overlay-windows\">here</a>. </p> \n    </section> \n    <section> \n     <p> <strong>Extended security for lockscreen notification actions</strong> - Android 12 adds finer-grained privacy and security controls for notifications displayed on the device lockscreen. You can now <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Notification.Action.Builder#setAuthenticationRequired(boolean)\">configure notification actions</a> so that when triggered from the lockscreen, they will always generate an authentication challenge. This extends the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Notification#visibility\">notification visibility</a> controls already available through the notification APIs. For example, this enables a messaging app to require authentication before deleting a message or marking it as read. More <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/features#notification-secure\">here</a>. </p> \n    </section> \n    <section> \n     <p> \n      <div class=\"container\" id=\"app-digest\"></div> <strong>Access to app digests </strong> - For apps that need to validate the integrity of app packages installed on Android devices, we’re introducing a new API that lets you query the platform directly for the checksum of an installed app. You can choose from several digest algorithms such as SHA256, SHA512, Merkle Root, and others. To request a checksum, call <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/PackageManager#requestChecksums(java.lang.String,%20boolean,%20int,%20java.util.List%3Cjava.security.cert.Certificate%3E,%20android.content.pm.PackageManager.OnChecksumsReadyListener)\">PackageManager.requestChecksums()</a> with an app’s package name, the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/Checksum\">checksum types</a> you need, the installer certs you trust, and a listener to receive the checksums. The platform returns the matching checksums, either precomputed and provided by the installer app (such as Google Play) or computed by the platform. Results are filtered based on <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/training/basics/intents/package-visibility\">package visibility</a> guidelines, so you’ll need to declare the packages of interest in your manifest. This new API provides a simpler, more efficient way to obtain checksums and gives you the stability of a standard, public API that’s optimized for speed and security. For backward compatibility, we’re working on a Jetpack library that provides the same functionality back to API 15 - watch for more details coming soon. </p> \n    </section> <p> You can read more about these and other privacy and security changes <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/behavior-changes-12\">here</a>. </p> \n    <section> \n     <h2><strong>Better user experience tools</strong></h2> \n     <p> We’re working to give you more tools to help you deliver a polished experience and better performance for users.

To deliver a great UX on these devices, developers need to account for the rounded corners and adjust any nearby UI elements to prevent them from being truncated. </p> \n     <p> To help with this, we’re introducing new APIs to let you query for rounded corners and get their details. A <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/RoundedCorner?hl=en\">RoundedCorner</a> holds the details for a corner, including its radius, centerpoint, and other data. You can call <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/Display#getRoundedCorner(int)\">Display.getRoundedCorner()</a> to get the absolute details for each rounded corner. You can also call <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/WindowInsets#getRoundedCorner(int)\">WindowInsets.getRoundedCorner(</a>) to get the corner details relative to your app’s bounds. With these, you can manage the position of UI elements and content as needed. More <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/features#rounded_corner_apis\">here</a>. </p> \n    </section> \n    <section> \n     <p> <strong>Picture in Picture (PIP) improvements</strong> - for people using gesture nav, we’ve improved how apps transition to picture-in-picture (PIP) mode on swipe up-to-home. If an app enables <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/PictureInPictureParams.Builder#setAutoEnterEnabled(boolean)\">auto-PIP</a>, the system now directly transitions the app to PIP mode on up-to-home, instead of waiting for the up-to-home animation to complete. This makes the transition smoother and improves perceived performance. We’ve also improved PIP window resizing for non-video content. Apps can now <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/PictureInPictureParams.Builder#setSeamlessResizeEnabled(boolean)\">enable seamless resize</a> to let the system resize the PIP Activity when needed. Android 12 also supports stashing the PiP window by dragging it to the left or right edge of the screen. Also, to make PIP windows easier to manipulate, we’ve updated the tap behaviors. Single-tapping now displays controls, and double-tapping toggles the PIP window size. More <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/features/pip-improvements\">here</a>. </p> \n    </section> \n    <section> \n     <p> <strong>Keeping companion device apps awake </strong>- For apps that manage companion devices like smartwatches and fitness trackers, it can be a challenge to make sure the app is running and connected whenever an associated companion device is nearby. To make this easier, we’re extending the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/companion/CompanionDeviceManager\">Companion Device Manager</a> with a new <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/companion/CompanionDeviceService\">CompanionDeviceService API</a>. Apps that manage companion devices can implement this service to let the system wake the app whenever the associated companion device is nearby. The system keeps the service bound whenever the device is nearby, and notifies the service when the device goes in and out of range or is turned off, to let the app clean up state as needed. Apps can also use a new <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/companion/AssociationRequest.Builder#setDeviceProfile(java.lang.String)\">companion device profile</a> when connecting to a watch, which simplifies enrollment by bundling related permissions into a single grant. More <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/features#keep-awake\">here</a>. </p> \n    </section> \n    <section> \n     <p> <strong>Bandwidth estimation improvements</strong> - for developers who need to know the typical bandwidth available to each user so you can tailor their experience, we now provide improved bandwidth estimation. We’ve enhanced the existing <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/11/features/5g#estimator\">bandwidth estimation APIs</a> to let you retrieve an estimate of aggregate throughput per carrier or Wi-Fi SSID, network type, and signal level, for all users on the device. The new estimation is likely to be easier and more accurate than most other estimation methods, give it a try and let us know how it works for you. </p> \n     <section> \n      <p> <strong>Easier blurs, color filters and other effects </strong>- In Android 12, we’re making it easier to apply common graphics effects to your Views and rendering hierarchies. You can use <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/RenderEffect\">RenderEffect</a> to apply blurs, color filters, and more to any <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/RenderNode\">RenderNode</a>. You can combine these effects as chain effects (which compose an inner and outer effect in order) or blend them. You can also apply effects directly to Views (leveraging the underlying RenderNode) by calling <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View#setRenderEffect(android.graphics.RenderEffect)\">View.setRenderEffect(RenderEffect)</a>. </p> \n      <pre class=\"prettyprint\">\nview.setRenderEffect(RenderEffect.createBlurEffect(radiusX, radiusY, SHADER_TILE_MODE))\n</pre> \n      <center> \n       <p id=\"imgCaption\"> Blurring a View with RenderEffect </p>\n      </center> \n      <p> This allows you to blur the contents of an <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/ImageView\">ImageView</a> without having to get the bitmap data, process the image, create a new <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Bitmap\">Bitmap</a>, and set it back into the ImageView. RenderEffect leverages the existing rendering pipeline to minimize excess calculation. </p> \n      <p> Give these a try and let use know what you think! More <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/features#rendereffect\">here</a>. </p> \n      <p> You can also create a frosted glass effect for your window background using a new <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/Window#setBackgroundBlurRadius(int)\">Window.setBackgroundBlurRadius()</a> API. With this you can set a radius to control the density and scope and the platform applies the blur to the background content within the bounds of your app’s window only. You can also use <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/WindowManager.LayoutParams#blurBehindRadius\">blurBehindRadius</a> to blur all of the content behind the window to create a depth effect for a floating window. </p> \n      <center> \n       <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-H8KalWgHCGE/YFIbLJYlxpI/AAAAAAAAQQ4/IfPpjm68v3sxN56M9KMZZfgZxRfEMNJmgCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/demo-dialog-dp2-blogpost-3.png\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img style=\"width:300px\" id=\"imgFull\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-H8KalWgHCGE/YFIbLJYlxpI/AAAAAAAAQQ4/IfPpjm68v3sxN56M9KMZZfgZxRfEMNJmgCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/demo-dialog-dp2-blogpost-3.png\" data-original-width=\"1058\" data-original-height=\"714\" /></a> \n       <p id=\"imgCaption\">A dialog window with background blur and blur behind... </p>\n      </center> \n     </section> \n     <section> \n      <h2><strong>App compatibility</strong></h2> \n      <p> We’re working to make updates faster and smoother by prioritizing app compatibility as we roll out new platform versions. In Android 12, we’ve made most app-facing changes opt-in to give you more time, and we’ve updated our tools and processes to help you get ready sooner. </p> \n      <p> With Developer Preview 2, we’re well into the release and continuing to improve overall stability, so now is the time to try the new features and changes and give us your feedback. We’re especially looking for input on our APIs, as well as details on how the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/behavior-changes-all\">platform changes</a> affect your apps.

We recommend doing the work early, so you can release a compatible update by Android 12 Beta 1. There’s no need to change your app’s targetSdkVersion at this time, but we do recommend using the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/reference/compat-framework-changes\">behavior change toggles</a> to get a preliminary idea of how your app might be affected by opt-in changes in Android 12. </p> \n      <p> As we reach <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/overview#platform_stability\">Platform Stability</a> in August 2021, all of the app-facing system behaviors, SDK/NDK APIs, and non-SDK lists will be finalized. At that point, you can wind up your final compatibility testing and release a fully compatible version of your app, SDK, or library.

As more people come to rely on the experiences you build, their expectations can rise just as fast. It’s one of the reasons we share Android releases with you early: your feedback helps us build a better platform for your apps and all of the people who use them. Today, we’re releasing the first Developer Preview of Android 12, the next version of Android, for your testing and feedback. </p> <p> With each version, we’re working to make the OS smarter, easier to use, and better performing, with privacy and security at the core. In Android 12 we’re also working to give you new tools for building great experiences for users. Starting with things like compatible media transcoding, which helps your app to work with the latest video formats if you don’t already support them, and easier copy/paste of rich content into your apps, like images and videos. We’re also adding privacy protections and optimizing performance to keep your apps responsive. </p> <p> Today’s first preview is just the start for Android 12, and we’ll have lots more to share as we move through the release. Read on for a taste of what’s new in Android 12, and visit the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12\">Android 12 developer site</a> for details on <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/download\">downloads for Pixel</a> and release <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/overview#timeline\">timeline</a>. As always, it’s crucial to get your feedback early, to help us incorporate it into the final product, so <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/feedback\">let us know what you think</a>! </p> <p> Alongside the work we’re doing in Android 12, later this month we’ll have more to share on another important tool that helps you create great user experiences more easily: Jetpack Compose, our modern toolkit for building native UI. <a href=\"http://goo.gle/TheAndroidShow\">Join us on #TheAndroidShow</a> for a behind-the-scenes look at Jetpack Compose, livestreamed on February 24 at 9AM PT, and tweet your Jetpack Compose questions using #TheAndroidShow to have them answered live on the show. </p> <h2><strong>Trust and safety</strong></h2> <p> Privacy is at the heart of everything we do, and in Android 12 we’re continuing to focus on giving users more transparency and control while keeping their devices and data secure. In today’s release we’ve added new controls over identifiers that can be used for tracking, safer defaults for app components, and more. These changes may affect your apps, so we recommend testing as soon as possible. Watch for more privacy and security features coming in later preview releases. </p> <p> <strong>Modern SameSite cookie behaviors in WebView</strong> - In line with <a href=\"https://blog.chromium.org/2020/02/samesite-cookie-changes-in-february.html\">changes to Chrome</a> and other browsers, WebView includes new SameSite cookie behaviors to provide additional security and privacy and give users more transparency and control over how cookies can be used across sites. <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/behavior-changes-12#samesite\">More here</a>. </p> <p> <strong>Restricted Netlink MAC </strong>- We’re continuing to help developers migrate to <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/training/articles/user-data-ids\">privacy-protecting resettable identifiers</a>. In a multi-release effort to ease migration of device-scoped Netlink MAC, in Android 11 we restricted access to it based on API level 30, and in Android 12 we’re applying the restriction for all apps - regardless of targetSDK level. <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/behavior-changes-all#mac-address\">More here</a>. </p> <p> <strong>Safer exporting of components - </strong>To prevent apps from inadvertently exporting activities, services, and receivers, we’re changing the default handling of the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element#exported\">android:exported</a> attribute to be more explicit. With this change, components that declare one or more intent filters must now explicitly declare an android:exported attribute. You should inspect your components in the manifest in order to avoid installation errors related to this change. <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/behavior-changes-12#exported\">More here</a>. </p> <p> <strong>Safer handling of Intents</strong> - To make handling PendingIntents more secure, Android 12 requires apps to explicitly declare a mutability flag, either <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/PendingIntent#FLAG_MUTABLE\">FLAG_MUTABLE</a> or the new <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/PendingIntent#FLAG_IMMUTABLE\">FLAG_IMMUTABLE</a>, for each PendingIntent. <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/behavior-changes-12#pending-intent-mutability\">More here</a>. </p> <p> You can read more about these and other privacy and security changes <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/behavior-changes-12\">here</a>. </p> <h2><strong>Better user experience tools</strong></h2> <p> In Android 12 we’re investing in key areas to help deliver a polished experience and better performance for users. Here are some of the updates so far. </p> <p> <strong>Compatible media transcoding</strong> - With the prevalence of HEVC hardware encoders on mobile devices, camera apps are increasingly capturing in HEVC format, which offers significant improvements in quality and compression over older codecs. Most apps should support HEVC, but for apps that can’t, we’re introducing compatible media transcoding. </p> <p> With this feature, an app that doesn’t support HEVC can have the platform automatically transcode the file into AVC, a format that is widely compatible. The transcoding process takes time, depending on the video and hardware properties of the device. As an example, a one minute 1080p video at 30fps takes around 9 seconds to transcode on a Pixel 4. You can opt-in to use the transcoding service by just declaring the media formats that your apps don't support. For developers, we strongly recommend that your apps support HEVC, and if that’s not possible, enable compatible media transcoding. The feature will be active on all devices using HEVC format for video capture. We'd love to hear your feedback on this feature. <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/features/compatible-media-transcoding\">More here</a>. </p> <p> <strong>AVIF image support</strong> - To give you higher image quality with more efficient compression, Android 12 introduces platform support for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AV1#AV1_Image_File_Format_(AVIF)\">AV1 Image File Format</a> (AVIF). AVIF is a container format for images and sequences of images encoded using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AV1\">AV1</a>. Like other modern image formats, AVIF takes advantage of the intra-frame encoded content from video compression. This dramatically improves image quality for the same file size when compared to older image formats, such as JPEG. </p> <p id=\"floatLeft\"> AVIF (18.2kB) </p> <p id=\"floatRight\"> JPEG (20.7kB) </p> \n    <div id=\"flexParent\"> \n     <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\">\n      <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bj8bL6ZacSs/YC2xpy2BjAI/AAAAAAAAQFY/lCoN7T0pPYQRiSG-KRZR9B5FgBMtOCnfACLcBGAsYHQ/s0/image4.png\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; \"><img id=\"flexImg\" alt=\"race car photo in AVIF (18.2kB)\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1080\" data-original-width=\"1920\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bj8bL6ZacSs/YC2xpy2BjAI/AAAAAAAAQFY/lCoN7T0pPYQRiSG-KRZR9B5FgBMtOCnfACLcBGAsYHQ/s0/image4.png\" /></a>\n     </div> \n     <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\">\n      <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZuSZwuWeEd8/YC2x41ZKVFI/AAAAAAAAQFc/fKV3tQUcTn47sInNKfJsEMddbUOsZogYACLcBGAsYHQ/s0/image2.png\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; \"><img id=\"flexImg\" alt=\"race car photo in JPEG (20.7kB)\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1080\" data-original-width=\"1920\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZuSZwuWeEd8/YC2x41ZKVFI/AAAAAAAAQFc/fKV3tQUcTn47sInNKfJsEMddbUOsZogYACLcBGAsYHQ/s0/image2.png\" /></a>\n     </div> \n    </div> <p id=\"imgCaption\"> Credit: <a href=\"https://jakearchibald.com/2020/avif-has-landed/demos/compare/?show=f1&amp;img=/c/f1-match-ff75e344.jpg\">Image comparison</a> from <a href=\"https://jakearchibald.com/2020/avif-has-landed/\">AVIF has landed</a> by Jake Archibald </p> <p> <strong>Foreground service optimizations</strong> - Foreground services are an important way for apps to manage certain types of user-facing tasks, but when overused they can affect performance and even lead to app kills. To ensure a better experience for users, we will be blocking foreground service starts from the background for apps that are targeting the new platform. To make it easier to transition away from this pattern, we’re introducing a new <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/job/JobParameters.html#isExpeditedJob()\">expedited job</a> in JobScheduler that gets elevated process priority, network access, and runs immediately regardless of power constraints like Battery Saver or Doze. For back-compatibility, we’ve also built expedited jobs into the latest release of <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager\">Jetpack WorkManager library</a>. Also, to reduce distraction for users, we’re now delaying the display of some foreground service notifications by up to 10 seconds. This gives short-lived tasks a chance to complete before their notifications are shown. <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/behavior-changes-12#foreground-service-launch-restrictions\">More here</a>. </p> <p> <strong>Rich content insertion </strong>- Users love images, videos and other expressive content, but inserting and moving this content in apps is not always easy. To make it simple for your apps to receive rich content, we’re introducing a new unified API that lets you accept content from any source: clipboard, keyboard, or drag and drop. You can attach a new interface, <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/OnReceiveContentListener\">OnReceiveContentListener</a>, to UI components and get a callback when content is inserted through any mechanism. This callback becomes the single place for your code to handle insertion of all content, from plain and styled text to markup, images, videos, audio files, and more. For back-compatibility, we’ve added the unified API to <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/core/view/OnReceiveContentListener\">AndroidX</a>. <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/features/unified-content-api\">More here</a>. </p> <p> <strong>Audio-coupled haptic effect</strong> - In Android 12 apps can provide audio-coupled haptic feedback through the phone's vibrator. The vibration strength and frequency are derived from an audio session, allowing you to create more immersive game and audio experiences. For example, a video calling app could use custom ringtones to identify the caller through haptic feedback, or you could simulate rough terrain in a racing game. <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/audiofx/HapticGenerator\">More here</a>. </p> \n    <!--\n<p>\n<strong>Multi-channel audio</strong> - Android 12 includes several enhancements for audio with spatial information. It adds support for MPEG-H playback in passthrough and offload mode, and the audio mixers, resamplers and effects have been optimized for up to 24 channels (the previous maximum was 8). \n</p>\n<p> --> <strong>Immersive mode API improvements for gesture nav </strong>- We’ve simplified immersive mode so that gesture navigation is easier and more consistent, for example when watching a video, reading a book, or playing a game. We’re still <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/WindowInsetsController#BEHAVIOR_SHOW_TRANSIENT_BARS_BY_SWIPE\">protecting apps from accidental gestures</a> when in full-screen experiences related to gaming, but in all other full-screen or immersive experiences (e.g. video viewers, reading, photo gallery), for apps targeting the new platform, we’re changing the default to allow users to navigate their phone with one swipe. <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/behavior-changes-12#immersive-mode-improvements\">More here</a>. </p> <p> <strong>Notification UI updates </strong>- We’re refreshing notification designs to make them more modern, easier to use, and more functional. In this first preview you’ll notice changes from the drawer and controls to the templates themselves. We’re also optimizing transitions and animations across the system to make them more smooth. As part of the updates, for apps targeting Android 12 we’re decorating notifications with custom content with icon and expand affordances to match all other notifications. <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/behavior-changes-12#custom-notifications\">More here</a>. </p> <p> <strong>Faster, more responsive notifications</strong> - When users tap a notification, they expect to jump immediately into the app - the faster the better. To meet that expectation, developers should make sure that notification taps trigger Activity starts directly, rather than using “trampolines” - an intermediary broadcast receiver or service - to start the Activity. Notification trampolines can cause significant delays and affect the user experience. To keep notifications responsive, Android 12 will block notification trampolines by preventing them from launching their target Activities, and we’re asking developers to migrate away from this pattern. The change applies only to apps targeting the new platform, but for all apps we’ll display a toast to make trampolines visible to you and to users. <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/behavior-changes-12#notification-trampolines\">More here</a>. </p> <p> <strong>Improved Binder IPC calls </strong> - As part of our work on performance, we’ve put a focus on reducing system variability. We’ve taken a look at latency and workload distribution, and made optimizations that reduce the median experience from the tail end, or 99% percentile use case. In doing so, we’ve targeted improvements to system binder calls adding lightweight caching strategies and focusing on removing lock contention to improve latency distribution. This has yielded roughly a 2x performance increase on Binder calls overall, with significant improvements in specific calls, for example a 47x improvement in <code>refContentProvider()</code>, 15x in <code>releaseWakeLock()</code>, and 7.9x in <code>JobScheduler.schedule()</code>. </p> <h2><strong>App compatibility</strong></h2> <p> We’re working to make updates faster and smoother by prioritizing app compatibility as we roll out new platform versions. In Android 12 we’ve made most app-facing changes opt-in to give you more time, and we’ve updated our tools and processes to help you get ready sooner. We’ve also added new functionality to Google Play system updates to give your apps a better environment on Android 12 devices. </p> <p> <strong>More of Android updated through Google Play </strong>- We’re continuing to expand our investment in <a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2019/05/fresher-os-with-projects-treble-and-mainline.html\">Google Play system updates</a> (Project Mainline) to give apps a more consistent, secure environment across devices. In Android 12 we’ve added the Android Runtime (ART) module that lets us push updates to the core runtime and libraries on devices running Android 12. We can improve runtime performance and correctness, manage memory more efficiently, and make Kotlin operations faster - all without requiring a full system update. We’ve also expanded the functionality of existing modules - for example, we’re delivering our compatible media transcoding feature inside an updatable module. </p> <p> <strong>Optimizing for tablets, foldables, and TVs </strong>- With more people than ever using apps on large-screen devices like foldables, tablets, and TVs, now is a great time to make sure your app or game is ready. Get started by <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/tablet-app-quality\">optimizing for tablets</a> and <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/foldables\">building apps for foldables</a>. And, for the biggest screen in the home, the first Android 12 preview for Android TV is also available. In addition to bringing the latest Android features to the TV with this preview, you will also be able to test your apps on the all-new Google TV experience. Learn more on the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/tv\">Android TV Developers</a> site and get started with your <a href=\"https://store.askey.com/adt-3.html\">ADT-3 developer kit</a>. </p> <p> <strong>Updated lists of non-SDK interfaces</strong> - We’ve restricted additional <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/non-sdk-12\">non-SDK interfaces</a>, and as always your feedback and <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/guide/app-compatibility/restrictions-non-sdk-interfaces#feature-request\">requests for public API equivalents</a> are welcome. </p> <p> <strong>Easier testing and debugging of changes</strong> - To make it easier for you to test the opt-in changes that can affect your app, we’ve made many of them toggleable.

You can get started today by <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/download\">flashing a device system image</a> to a <strong>Pixel 3 / 3 XL</strong>, <strong>Pixel 3a / 3a XL</strong>, <strong>Pixel 4 / 4 XL</strong>, <strong>Pixel 4a / 4a 5G</strong>, or <strong>Pixel 5</strong> device. If you don’t have a Pixel device, you can use the 64-bit system images with the Android Emulator in Android Studio. </p> <p> When you’re <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/setup-sdk\">set up</a>, here are some of the things you should do: </p> \n   <ul> \n    <li><strong>Try the new features and APIs</strong> - your feedback is critical during the early part of the developer preview. Report issues in our tracker or give us direct feedback by survey for selected features from the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/feedback\">feedback and requests</a> page. <li><strong>Test your current app for compatibility</strong> - the goal here is to learn whether your app is affected by default behavior changes in Android 12. Just install your current published app onto a device or emulator running Android 12 and test. <li><strong>Test your app with opt-in changes</strong> - Android 12 has opt-in behavior changes that only affect your app when it’s targeting the new platform. It’s extremely important to understand and assess these changes early. To make it easier to test, you can <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/reference/compat-framework-changes\">toggle the changes on and off individually</a>. </li> </li></li>\n   </ul> <p> We’ll update the preview system images and SDK regularly throughout the Android 12 release cycle. This initial preview release is <strong>for developers only</strong> and not intended for daily or consumer use, so we're making it available by <strong>manual download only</strong>. You can flash a factory image to your Pixel device, or you can sideload an OTA image to a Pixel device running Android 11, in which case you won’t need to unlock your bootloader or wipe data. Either way, once you’ve manually installed a preview build, you’ll automatically get future updates over-the-air for all later previews and Betas. <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/get\">More here</a>. </p> <p> As we get closer to a final product, we'll be inviting consumers to try it out as well, and we'll open up enrollments through Android Beta at that time. Stay tuned for details, but for now please note that <strong>Android Beta is not currently available for Android 12</strong>. </p> <p> For complete information, <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12\">visit the Android 12 developer site</a>. </p>\n   <div class=\"feedflare\"> \n    <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?a=W5Dy7eBfh0Q:_RZ6GTLDP4E:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n    <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?a=W5Dy7eBfh0Q:_RZ6GTLDP4E:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?i=W5Dy7eBfh0Q:_RZ6GTLDP4E:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n   </div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/hsDu/~4/W5Dy7eBfh0Q\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" /></p></img>\n</meta>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 18 Feb 2021 18:00:00 +0000","feedId":7,"bgimg":"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eRnBIDn-ZZE/YC6eGA2hC5I/AAAAAAAAQGY/bea6RxVXWcs9q5FoLEZtjuTnLZvegzY2ACLcBGAsYHQ/s0/Android%2B12_logo.png","linkMd5":"2e9235a400aa7ad86207a14b7262cb11","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn29@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-52-32-590_c425976acc580836.webp","destWidth":1921,"destHeight":1081,"sourceBytes":29024,"destBytes":19072,"author":"Android Developers","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eRnBIDn-ZZE/YC6eGA2hC5I/AAAAAAAAQGY/bea6RxVXWcs9q5FoLEZtjuTnLZvegzY2ACLcBGAsYHQ/s0/Android%2B12_logo.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn29@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-52-32-590_c425976acc580836.webp","https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2WiKDQwO6nI/YC2vlLLtUyI/AAAAAAAAQFM/lje72qqUt74m22FTZZx_0VmfFnfjODSiACLcBGAsYHQ/s0/image6.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn40@2020_1/2021/04/03/04-52-35-444_2eb7e2a2d0a78e31.webp","https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bj8bL6ZacSs/YC2xpy2BjAI/AAAAAAAAQFY/lCoN7T0pPYQRiSG-KRZR9B5FgBMtOCnfACLcBGAsYHQ/s0/image4.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn23@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-52-35-728_cc7018dd5573c953.webp","https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZuSZwuWeEd8/YC2x41ZKVFI/AAAAAAAAQFc/fKV3tQUcTn47sInNKfJsEMddbUOsZogYACLcBGAsYHQ/s0/image2.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn84@2020_4/2021/04/03/04-52-36-870_3861c5989b942be7.webp","https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OzooBPAi3i8/YC3BPS09IfI/AAAAAAAAQFs/Q2Afirbk_1cJut0YFYHqlsdpGmMv5YFhACLcBGAsYHQ/s0/image5.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn1@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-52-36-367_28848f0518f38210.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn85@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-52-34-976_e6aa4d73b74f71ed.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?i=W5Dy7eBfh0Q:_RZ6GTLDP4E:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn68@2020_3/2021/04/03/04-52-35-565_0e5f81c9628f08e3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/hsDu/~4/W5Dy7eBfh0Q":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn52@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-52-35-499_72e3120373abac0f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425543977},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:52:23","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:52:23","title":"Sub-dollar pricing expansion in 20 markets","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/hsDu/~3/Ihp8sWyowEk/sub-dollar-pricing-expansion-in-20.html","description":"<meta name=\"twitter:image\" content=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jkTn2ZC7zIU/YD_sw3mEKPI/AAAAAAAAQNs/XXGD0lIZOukqTELwRlVGkv19n2ZJkvHKgCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/google-play-sub-dollar-pricing-v3.png\"> \n <img style=\"display:none\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jkTn2ZC7zIU/YD_sw3mEKPI/AAAAAAAAQNs/XXGD0lIZOukqTELwRlVGkv19n2ZJkvHKgCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/google-play-sub-dollar-pricing-v3.png\"> <p><em>Posted by Neethi Thomas, Dafna Gal and Ashnil Dixit, Google Play </em><p> <p> At Google Play, we’re committed to giving Android developers access to the largest possible market for your apps and games. Google Play already supports free and paid apps in over 165 markets. We had previously lowered minimum prices developers can set for their products for 20 markets like India and Brazil. Today, we’re happy to announce that we have reduced the <a href=\"https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/table/3541286\">minimum price limit for products in 20 more markets</a> across Latin America, EMEA, and APAC. </p> <p> With these new lower limits, you can now set prices in the range of 10-30 cents US equivalent in most of these markets. These ultra-low price points, or “sub-dollar” prices, allow you to reach new potential buyers by adjusting your pricing to better reflect local purchasing power and demand. It also gives you more flexibility to set your global pricing strategy and gives more users the opportunity to enjoy monetized experiences in your apps and games.<br><br>The minimum price limit for paid apps, in-app products, and subscriptions has been lowered in these new markets: Bangladesh, Bulgaria, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Czech Republic, Denmark, Croatia, Hungary, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Lebanon, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Pakistan, Paraguay, Romania, Serbia, Thailand, Tanzania and Vietnam. </br></br></p> <p> Additional markets where sub-dollar pricing is available: Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey and Ukraine<br><br>To adjust your prices in Google Play Console, please see our <a href=\"https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6334373\">Help Center article</a>. The full list of price ranges can be found <a href=\"https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/table/3541286?rd=1\">here</a>. </br></br></p> <p> <strong><br>Best practices for sub-dollar pricing</br></strong> </p> <p> Since the feature was introduced in 2015, Android developers have been using sub-dollar pricing to expand their paying user base in creative ways. Here are a few ways you can use sub-dollar pricing to help grow your own business: </p> \n    <ul> \n     <li><strong>Try offering limited-time promotions. </strong>Sub-dollar pricing is a great tool to entice new users through promotions, or to reward loyal users with low-cost perks. For example, to convert more paying users of their popular game <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.igg.android.lordsmobile\">Lords Mobile</a>, developer IGG sometimes offers special bundles for only IDR 3000 (USD 0.20) that offer 2-3x more value for a limited time. Because these are special offers, it allowed them to expand their payer base without cannibalization.<br> <li><strong>Offer seasonal deals. </strong>Sub-dollar pricing is also useful for seasonal sales. Because users know they have a limited opportunity to buy these items, it makes them more attractive. Combined with the low price, it can be an attractive offer for first time buyers. Moonton offers rare skins when users make their first purchase of the season in Mobile Legends, even if it’s a sub-dollar purchase.<br> <li><strong>Try introductory pricing offers. </strong>Sub-dollar pricing can also be used to attract new paying users with introductory pricing. For example, you could offer users who have never made a purchase a valuable item at a sub-dollar price. Developer Moonton does this, offering users access to popular heroes in their game <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mobile.legends\">Mobile Legends: Bang Bang</a> when they make their first purchase. This strategy helps them reach new paying users without much impact on their overall game economy. <br> <li><strong>Reward loyalty. </strong>You can also try sub-dollar pricing in conjunction with repeat purchase events. For example, you could offer special bonuses to players making one purchase a day for seven days, without users spending more than they are comfortable with. <br> <li><strong>Offer gacha. </strong>Sub-dollar pricing works well for chance-based items, or “gacha,” which can appeal to new users. Users who aren’t willing to spend $5 on a valuable in-game item may be willing to pay $0.15 to open a treasure chest with a chance of finding the item inside. By offering gacha at sub-dollar pricing, many users may be willing to pay a token amount just to try their luck. </li> </br></li></br></li></br></li></br></li>\n    </ul> <p> <br>There are many ways to use sub-dollar and localized pricing and the suggestions listed above are just a starting point. We’re excited to see how you’ll use our features to grow your business. </br></p>\n    <div class=\"feedflare\"> \n     <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?a=Ihp8sWyowEk:k1Y6eX51ozQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n     <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?a=Ihp8sWyowEk:k1Y6eX51ozQ:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?i=Ihp8sWyowEk:k1Y6eX51ozQ:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n    </div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/hsDu/~4/Ihp8sWyowEk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" /></p></p></img>\n</meta>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 04 Mar 2021 17:59:00 +0000","feedId":7,"bgimg":"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jkTn2ZC7zIU/YD_sw3mEKPI/AAAAAAAAQNs/XXGD0lIZOukqTELwRlVGkv19n2ZJkvHKgCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/google-play-sub-dollar-pricing-v3.png","linkMd5":"296a12a2dff25e83558709ef066a77fd","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn49@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-52-32-374_a91019a9a898df19.webp","destWidth":2048,"destHeight":1024,"sourceBytes":120465,"destBytes":42750,"author":"Android Developers","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jkTn2ZC7zIU/YD_sw3mEKPI/AAAAAAAAQNs/XXGD0lIZOukqTELwRlVGkv19n2ZJkvHKgCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/google-play-sub-dollar-pricing-v3.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn49@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-52-32-374_a91019a9a898df19.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn85@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-52-34-976_e6aa4d73b74f71ed.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?i=Ihp8sWyowEk:k1Y6eX51ozQ:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn39@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-52-35-983_2b37b962efe31c3a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/hsDu/~4/Ihp8sWyowEk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn3@2020_2/2021/04/03/04-52-36-288_85c29931022aa2f2.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425543968},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:52:23","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:52:23","title":"MAD Skills Motion Layout: wrap-up","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/hsDu/~3/yVG5Fy_BgK0/mad-skills-motion-layout-wrap-up.html","description":"<meta name=\"twitter:image\" content=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ysVDIhhHhd8/YDPopYN6LSI/AAAAAAAAQG8/14pOfh_9SrQ0Wl5o9ebBdqFrTSEooZJpQCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/Untitled.jpg\"> \n <img style=\"display:none\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ysVDIhhHhd8/YDPopYN6LSI/AAAAAAAAQG8/14pOfh_9SrQ0Wl5o9ebBdqFrTSEooZJpQCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/Untitled.jpg\"> <p><em>Posted by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chethaase?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Chet Haase</a>, Developer Relations Engineer</em><p> \n    <center>\n     <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\">\n      <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ysVDIhhHhd8/YDPopYN6LSI/AAAAAAAAQG8/14pOfh_9SrQ0Wl5o9ebBdqFrTSEooZJpQCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/Untitled.jpg\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; \"><img style=\"width:100%\" alt=\"Android graphic\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"480\" data-original-width=\"1600\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ysVDIhhHhd8/YDPopYN6LSI/AAAAAAAAQG8/14pOfh_9SrQ0Wl5o9ebBdqFrTSEooZJpQCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/Untitled.jpg\" /></a>\n     </div>\n    </center> <p> We recently finished <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWz5rJ2EKKc_PEOEHNBEyy6tPX1EgtUw2\">another series of MAD Skills videos</a> - this time on Motion Layout.

And watch the live Q&amp;A episode, featuring engineers on the Motion Layout and Developer Relations teams. </p> <h2>Episode 1 - ConstraintSet Animations</h2> <p> This video explores how ConstraintSets are used to define different states of your UI that you animate between. Along the way, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/objcode?lang=en\">Sean</a> shows how to use Motion Editor in Android Studio to create and edit these transitions. </p> \n    <center> \n     <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1jE3W3_NTQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n    </center> <h2>Episode 2 - Keyframes</h2> <p> This episode shows how to use Keyframes in a MotionLayout animation to customize the animation by altering the values of various properties over time. For example, you can use keyframes to change the path an object takes between start and end, instead of following just the default linear path it would follow otherwise. </p> \n    <center>\n     <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/n_om_WcfSOM\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n    </center> <h2>Episode 3 - Multiple ConstraintSets</h2> <p> In this third episode, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/objcode?lang=en\">Sean</a> shows how you can add ConstraintSets, beyond the default two (start + end) to create more complex animations, or transitions that flow through multiple states between the start and end. </p> <p> \n     <center> \n      <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/k2HyX6fd_as\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n     </center> <h2>Episode 4 - Building a Collapsible Header</h2> <p> In the fourth episode, explains how to build a collapsible toolbar using Motion Layout, which is a common place where this API shines. Along the way, you'll learn how to animate custom attributes using MotionLayout. </p> \n     <center> \n      <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xXR9bOHJ648\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n     </center> <h2>Episode 5 - Live Q&amp;A</h2> <p> The final episode of the series was a live Q&amp;A, streamed and recorded on February 18th.

They are fast to access, convenient, and designed to provide users with swipeable access to the things they need to know and get done right from their wrist. This also gives users control over what information and actions they want to see. </p> \n<p> Today, we're excited to announce that the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/training/articles/wear-tiles\">Jetpack Tiles library</a> is in alpha.

Start by adding the Wear OS Tiles dependencies: </p> \n<pre><code>dependencies {\n  implementation \"androidx.wear:wear-tiles:1.0.0-alpha01\"\n  debugImplementation \"androidx.wear:wear-tiles-renderer:1.0.0-alpha01\"\n}</code></pre> \n<p> The first dependency includes the library you need to create a Tile, while the second dependency lets you preview the Tile in an activity. </p> \n<p>Next, provide the information to render the Tile using the <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/wear/tiles/TileProviderService\">TileProviderService</a></code>:</p> \n<pre><code>class MyTileService : TileProviderService() {\n  override fun onTileRequest(requestParams: RequestReaders.TileRequest) =\n    Futures.immediateFuture(Tile.builder()\n      .setResourcesVersion(\"1\")\n      .setTimeline(Timeline.builder().addTimelineEntry(\n         // For more information about timelines, see the docs\n         TimelineEntry.builder().setLayout(\n           Layout.builder().setRoot(\n             Text.builder().setText(\"Hello world!\")\n           )\n         )\n      )\n    ).build())\n\n  override fun onResourcesRequest(requestParams: ResourcesRequest) =\n    Futures.immediateFuture(Resources.builder()\n      .setVersion(\"1\")\n      .build()\n    )\n}</code></pre> \n<p> There are two important parts to this code: </p> \n<ul> \n <li><code>onTileRequest()</code> creates your Tile layout. This is where most of your code goes. You can use multiple <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/wear/tiles/builders/TimelineBuilders.TimelineEntry\">TimelineEntry</a></code> instances to render different layouts for <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/training/articles/wear-tiles#timebound-timeline\">different points in time</a>.<br> <li><code>onResourcesRequest()</code> passes any resources needed to render your Tile. If you decide to add any graphics, include them here. </li> </br></li>\n</ul> \n<p> Create a simple activity to preview your Tile. Add this activity in <code>src/debug</code> instead of <code>src/main</code>, as this activity is only used for debugging/previewing purposes. </p> \n<pre><code>class MainActivity : ComponentActivity() {\n  override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {\n    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)\n    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)\n    val rootLayout = findViewById&lt;FrameLayout&gt;(R.id.tile_container)\n    TileManager(\n      context = this,\n      component = ComponentName(this, MyTileService::class.java),\n      parentView = rootLayout\n    ).create()\n  }\n}</code></pre> \n<p> Now you’re ready to publish your Tile. For more information on how to do that, and to learn more about Tiles, read our <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/training/articles/wear-tiles\">new guide</a> and take a look at our <a href=\"https://github.com/android/wear-os-samples/tree/main/WearTilesKotlin\">sample Tiles</a> to see them in action. </p> \n<p> The Jetpack Tiles library is in alpha, and we want <a href=\"https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/new?component=460965&amp;template=1422653\">your feedback</a> to help us improve the API.

I used to watch advertisement animations or cricket match animations of player profiles on TV and wonder how I could create these. Later that year, when my sister purchased our home's first PC, I started learning Microsoft Paint and later Adobe Flash. I worked on Flash for about 11 years throughout high school, University, and my first three jobs in game development.</em> </p> <p> <em>Game development was and has been my first love in computer science. But, Android became something special for me. It was NOT love-at-first sight because I hated Android when I first learned about it. I still don't know why. Coming from a poor family background, I got a fully-funded scholarship through Prime Minister ICT R&amp;D Scholarship Program and enrolled in National University of Engineering &amp; Technology (NUST), SEECS Islamabad campus.</em> </p> <p> <em>In my 3rd semester, Android was at 2.2 Froyo. A company organized a workshop at our campus which was attended by high-level tech folks like CTOs, software architects, and lead engineers. University management decided to send three students to attend that workshop and I was lucky enough to be one of them. In simple words, the whole 3-days workshop was over my head. I was a newbie in C++ programming and didn't know anything about Java. And here I was trying to learn high-level Android.</em> </p> <p> <em>After the workshop, I decided that Android was not for me. However, the university announced an open programming competition for any technology. But they gave extra points for Android submissions. This was my calling. In greed of those extra points, I took up the challenge. I borrowed the only Android book \"Hello Android\" from my teacher, Sir Shamyl bin Mansoor, and tried to learn as much as I could. Somehow, I managed to submit my first Android app which I showcased on a borrowed laptop with a very slow emulator of Android 2.2. To my surprise, I won it and got Rs. 100,000 prize money. First thing I bought was an Android phone and my journey started.</em> </p> <p> <em>I started writing about it in a WordPress blog, organized workshops in different universities, made my final year project a 3D game in Adobe Flash, and AIR deployed on a Samsung Galaxy 10 tablet which had a new Android 4 Holo theme and the great Fragments.</em> </p> <p> <em>After graduation, I got an opportunity from PacktPub (a book publishing company) to write a full book on Android. This was the best achievement I ever received. I managed to co-author two worldwide published 300+ page books (Learning Android Intents &amp; Mastering Android Game Development) on Android in the following two years.</em> </p> <p> <em>Having about seven years industry hands-on experience in Android development, I spend a lot of time on writing and sharing my knowledge with the community. I mostly write on my <a href=\"https://wajahatkarim.com/\">website</a> and on <a href=\"https://wajahatkarim.medium.com/\">Medium</a>. Besides writing, I have been active in open source and have created some Android libraries like EasyFlipView, Room Explorer, etc.</em> </p> <p> <em>In 2017, I started doing public speaking again. At first, it was a little tough to manage time while working a full-time job and freelance contracts, but it was worth it. I got more and more active in speaking and gave talks at events like Google IO Extended Karachi &amp; Hyderabad in 2018 and 2019, DevFest 2019 Karachi, Pakistan's first DSC Summit, Kotlin Everywhere 2019, and other local events.</em> </p> <p> <em>From these events, Sami Kizilbash noticed me and nominated me for becoming a Google Developers Expert. It was a tough time because of a serious medical situation with my father at that time, but a year later in February 2020 I became Pakistan's first Google Developers Expert in Android. I never thought that I would be a GDE in a field like Android. It is a big honor and achievement for me, along with a feeling of responsibility to help the community in a better way now. Android development has been my life fuel, career, brought bread for me and my family and happiness in developing and delivering more than 100 apps. With more than 2.5 billion Android devices today, this is an excellent career choice with high growth and potential for upcoming students and developers.</em> </p> <p> <em>My GDE journey has been a fantastic one. I have enjoyed every moment of it, all the love I got from Google and fellow GDEs - including Joe Birch who actually inspired me to become GDE, Hasan Abid, Saurabh Arora, and Juhani Lehtimaki, and Saad Hamid who also helped me through the process. In all the chaos of 2020, it was a very talkative year for me, as I did 25+ online talks on Jetpack Compose animations concepts.</em> </p> <p> <strong>What’s one shortcut, tip, or hack you can’t live without?</strong> </p> <p> <em>I simply love how Mnemonic Bookmarks make code navigation so much faster and easier. When you are working on a large codebase, it becomes harder to remember which method was where and what was happening in another Fragment. Simply, press Ctrl + F11 and choose any number or character, let's say 1.

Because of this, I had to take sessions and help students complete a set of tasks as part of Bootcamp. In my college days I was not very good at Android, so when the opportunity came I took it upon myself to gain some knowledge of Android and then help people with their tasks. Learning to build apps that would be used by a lot of people helped me choose Android as a career. And that is how my journey to become an Android developer started.</em> </p> <p> <strong>What’s one shortcut, tip, or hack you can’t live without?</strong> </p> <p> <em>I like to use the Macro shortcut in Android Studio.</em> </p> <p> <strong>What's the one piece of advice you wish someone would have given you when you started on your journey?</strong> </p> <p> <em>As a beginner in any domain, not just Android, please keep asking questions on how to improve and learn from people in the community.

It was a collaboration between MIT and Nokia, and my university was one of the campuses that ran the program. I did not study computer science, so the program was my first exposure to software development. I learned how to build J2ME apps and got exposure to different mobile technologies at the time.</em> </p> <p> <em>Shortly after the program, I got a work-study opportunity at iQube Labs, where my mentor - James Fowe, who was building a mobile developer community in Nigeria - sent me a bunch of resources and tasks for me to learn how to build Android apps. The Android OS around 2010 was Android Froyo and that was the operating system on which I ran my “Hello world” on Android. Within the next year, I found myself building actual apps on Android Gingerbread.</em> </p> <p> <em>I have since worked as an Android Developer in different companies ranging from small to mid-sized startups with millions of users, to publicly traded companies, all across many countries. I’ve had the opportunity of working with very brilliant folks that have contributed to my growth and learning.</em> </p> <p> <em>My journey is not complete without talking about the developer community. I consider myself a product of the community and that’s why I try to give back every now and then when I have the opportunity. </em> </p> <p> <em>I started getting involved in the developer community at my university - through various student groups, including my local GDG group then co-organized by Moyinoluwa Adeyemi (an Android GDE). I attended meetups and participated in developer challenges and hackathons.</em> </p> <p> <em><br>Becoming a GDE for Android is a career milestone I never saw coming. It started in 2016 when John Kimani (Google DevRel manager for SSA) toured my office and we ran into each other at the door. I wasn’t prepared enough to become a GDE the first time my profile was reviewed, but with feedback, guidance, mentorship and hard work, I became an Android GDE in 2018.</br></em> </p> <p> <em>I’m grateful to have had the opportunity to travel to so many countries around the world and meet members of the global Android Developer community. I’ve also given talks at conferences and meetups; including DevFests, Droidcon (Nairobi, Dubai, Berlin, Boston), and 360AnDev, to mention a few, about topics I enjoy - Kotlin, Design Systems, Jetpack Compose, and Developer Productivity Engineering.</em> </p> <p> <strong>What’s one shortcut, tip, or hack you can’t live without?</strong> </p> <p> <em>That’s such a tough one, but I’ll say my favourite AndroidDev tip right now is: use the Android code search tool - <a href=\"https://cs.android.com\">https://cs.android.com</a> - and Android API documentation as often as possible. (See also: <a href=\"https://androidsrc.dev/\">https://androidsrc.dev/</a>)</em> </p> <p> <em>The two resources have helped me in answering the “why is this not working” question and understanding what’s happening under the hood. A lot of times, I need to really understand what the Framework function I’m calling does, and the answer is almost always in the documentation or in the source code.</em> </p> <p> <strong>What's the one piece of advice you wish someone would have given you when you started on your journey?</strong> </p> <p> <em>I’ll give two for the price of one:</em> </p> \n    <ol> \n     <li><em>Structure and consistency are important when learning. One can’t possibly know everything, but one can try with enough of these two ingredients. Structured learning is becoming more and more accessible these days than it was, so one should take advantage of it, consistently - through codelabs, or courses and the likes.</em> <li><em>Get used to reading official documentations and official source codes.

Programming quickly became my favourite creative outlet – it started with creating websites and apps when I was 11, mainly as a way to enhance my other passions such as drawing and making puzzles for my friends.</em> </p> <p> <em>I got my first Android phone when I was in high school and immediately knew it would open a whole new world of opportunities for me, so I picked up a few books and found a few online tutorials which got me started with code on my phone running Android 2.1 Eclair.</em> </p> <p> <em>My first app was a flashcards maker. I needed something like that to help me learn English and I couldn’t find anything online - so I made my own!</em> </p> <p> <em>Thanks to a few of my passion projects, including a flashcard maker app, I managed to quickly land a job as an Android Engineer while I was still completing my Computer Science degree at university. I then tried working across a few other areas in software engineering, but ultimately, Android was always my favourite and ended up becoming my specialty! </em> </p> <p> <strong>What’s one shortcut, tip, or hack you can’t live without?</strong> </p> <p> <em>It’s not quite a hack, but I honestly don’t know how I lived before ConstraintLayout became a thing!

There are improvements from user experience through <a href=\"https://material.io/design\">material design</a> to the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/privacy\">importance and advancement in privacy</a>. We know you want your apps to offer a great user experience. At the same time, we also know that it’s not always straightforward to know which area to tackle first. That’s why we are launching a <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/quality\">new App Quality section</a> in our developer site to help you keep up-to-date with key aspects of app quality and provide related resources. </p> \n    <center> \n     <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QxyvS1oZOUs\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n    </center> <p> In the first release, we have updated <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/core-app-quality\">the Core App Quality checklist</a> to take into account recent Android releases as well as the current trends of the app ecosystem. Here are some highlights in this update: </p> \n    <ul> \n     <li><strong>Visual Experience</strong> - We highlight the best practice of using <a href=\"https://material.io/components\">Material Design Components</a> in place of platform components such as buttons. This will give your app a modern look as well as making features such as <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/look-and-feel/darktheme\">dark theme</a> easy to implement. In addition to advice on back stack, we have expanded it to preserving the state of the app. This is becoming more important as edge-to-edge screens and gesture navigation are becoming commonplace, even in entry level phones. <li><strong>Functionality</strong> - There are three areas where we have updated our guidance. For media applications, we have updated our recommendations around the playback experience as well as support for HEVC video compression for video encoding. For sharing between apps, we highlight the importance of using the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/training/sharing/send\">Android Sharesheet</a>. This will be critical going forward as apps will <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/training/basics/intents/package-visibility-use-cases\">have limited visibility to other installed apps</a> in API level 30 by default. Lastly, we expanded our recommendations around <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/oreo/background#services\">background services</a>. Helping users to conserve battery is a priority for Android, and we will continue to share updates on this topic. <li><strong>Performance &amp; Stability</strong> - We have added tooling now available such as <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/vitals\">Android vitals</a> in the Google Play Console. One important point to highlight here is Application Not Responding (ANR). ANRs are caused by threading issues and are something developers can fixed. <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/vitals/anr\">The ANR troubleshooting guide</a> can help you diagnose and resolve any ANRs that exist in the app. <li><strong>Privacy &amp; Security</strong> - We have summarized our latest recommendations to take into account the latest safeguards from runtime permission to securely using WebView. We have also expanded to include privacy norms that users come to expect from protecting private data to not using any non-resettable hardware Ids. <li><strong>Google Play</strong> - In this section, we highlight some of the most important policies for developers and link you to more information on the guidelines. </li> </li></li></li></li>\n    </ul> <p> Going forward, we aim to update this list on a quarterly basis to make sure this is up-to-date. In addition, we will be updating the quality checklists for other form factors. </p> <p> We are working on additional tools and best practices to make it easier for you to build quality applications on Android. We can’t wait to introduce these new improvements to you.

Compose offers modern, declarative Kotlin APIs, helping you build beautiful, responsive apps with way less code. Built to integrate with existing Android apps and Jetpack libraries, you can adopt Compose at your own pace by combining Android Views and Compose. </p> <p> With this beta release, Compose is API complete and has all the features you need to build production-ready apps. Beta also means API stable, so we won’t change or remove APIs. Now is a great time to start learning Compose and begin planning for how you will use it in an upcoming project or feature once it reaches 1.0 later this year. </p> \n  <center> \n   <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vRjJAWh6JPE\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n  </center> <h2><strong>What's In Beta</strong></h2> <p> Our team has been developing Compose in the open with feedback and participation from the community. Since open sourcing development in 2019, we’ve had 30 public releases, addressed over 700 external bugs, and accepted over 200 external contributions. We love seeing what you’ve been building with Compose and have used your feedback and feature requests to refine our APIs and prioritize our work. Since the alpha release, we’ve added and improved a number of new features: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>🆕 Coroutines support <li>🆕 Accessibility support for Talkback - support for other technologies will be in Stable <li>🆕 Easy to use <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/codelabs/jetpack-compose-animation\">Animations</a>, with a completely new API since alpha. <li><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/interop\">Interoperability</a> with Views <li><a href=\"http://material.io/blog/jetpack-compose-beta\">Material UI Components</a>, all with @Sampled code <li>Lazy Lists - Jetpack Compose's take on RecyclerView <li>DSL-based <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/layout#contraintlayout\">Constraint Layout</a> <li>Modifiers <li>Testing <li>Theming and Graphics, with easy support for Dark and Light mode <li>Input and gestures <li>Text and editable text <li>Window management </li> </li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li>\n  </ul> <p> For the beta release, we’ve been focused on ensuring API completeness; that all foundational APIs are in place for us to continue to build upon for 1.0 and beyond. We’ll work on stabilizing these APIs up to our 1.0 release with particular focus on app performance and accessibility. </p> <p> Compose Beta is supported by the latest Canary of <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/studio/preview?gclid=CjwKCAiAyc2BBhAaEiwA44-wW02UxPzHservPxmOjAhKgYKMLmJF1vWR4Vvln4M6tZNIDgw2l3qDxxoCmawQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\">Android Studio Arctic Fox</a>, which features many <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/tooling\">new tools</a>: </p> <p> \n   <ul>\n     🆕 Live Literals: real time update of literals in Preview and on device or emulator \n   </ul></p> <p> 🆕 <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/animation#tooling\">Animation Preview</a>: inspect and playback animations </p> <p> 🆕 <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/studio/preview/features#compose-layout-inspector\"> Compose support in the Layout Inspector</a> </p> <p> 🆕 Interactive preview: inspect and interact with a Composable in isolation </p> <p> 🆕 Deploy Preview: to deploy a Composable on your device without needing a full app </p>  <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4sRxCjW0pv4/YDVXZXFYDPI/AAAAAAAAQIg/oAG126nEJ2Qwv6pOCGZ_aMj3TgAvk3Y5gCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/live_literal%2B%25281%2529.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img style=\"width:100%\" id=\"imgFull\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4sRxCjW0pv4/YDVXZXFYDPI/AAAAAAAAQIg/oAG126nEJ2Qwv6pOCGZ_aMj3TgAvk3Y5gCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/live_literal%2B%25281%2529.gif\" data-original-width=\"1058\" data-original-height=\"714\" /></a> <p id=\"imgCaption\">Live Literals on Android Emulator</p> <br> <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DdXJJZEujIs/YDVX7L2lTzI/AAAAAAAAQIo/5a-W1_ZGStUsOVu-hSXKcRNrf9ds91LMACLcBGAsYHQ/s0/inspector_compose_v3%2B%25281%2529.gif\" imageanchor=\"1\"><img style=\"width:100%\" id=\"imgFull\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DdXJJZEujIs/YDVX7L2lTzI/AAAAAAAAQIo/5a-W1_ZGStUsOVu-hSXKcRNrf9ds91LMACLcBGAsYHQ/s0/inspector_compose_v3%2B%25281%2529.gif\" data-original-width=\"1058\" data-original-height=\"714\" /></a> <p id=\"imgCaption\">Layout Inspector for Jetpack Compose </p> <h2><strong>Works with your existing app</strong></h2> <p> Jetpack Compose is designed to work seamlessly with Android Views, letting you adopt at your own pace. You can embed Compose UIs within Android Views and use Views within Compose. We lay out a number of adoption strategies in our <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/interop\">interoperability documentation</a>. </p> <p> In addition to View interop, we <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/libraries\">integrate with common libraries</a> to help you to add Compose to your existing applications—no need to rewrite or re-architect your app. We offer integrations with: </p> \n   <ul> \n    <li>Navigation <li>ViewModel <li>LiveData / Rx / Flow <li>Paging <li>Hilt </li> </li></li></li></li>\n   </ul> <p> The <a href=\"https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android-compose-theme-adapter\">MDC-Android Compose Theme Adapter</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/chrisbanes/accompanist\">Accompanist</a> libraries provide integrations with <a href=\"https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android-compose-theme-adapter\">Material</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/chrisbanes/accompanist/tree/main/appcompat-theme\">AppCompat</a> XML themes so you don’t need to duplicate theme definitions. Accompanist also offers wrappers for common <a href=\"https://github.com/chrisbanes/accompanist/#image-loading\">image loading libraries</a>. </p> <h2><strong>Thinking in Compose</strong></h2> <p> Jetpack Compose is a <em>declarative</em> UI toolkit, a paradigm shift from the current View system, where you describe <em>what</em> your UI should look like for a given application state, not <em>how</em> to produce it. Compose takes care of updating your UI when your app state changes, so you don’t have to manipulate your UI into the desired state which can be tedious and error prone. </p> <p> Built entirely in Kotlin, Compose takes advantage of its great <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/kotlin\">language features</a> to offer powerful, succinct, intuitive APIs. <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines\">Coroutines</a> for example enable us to write much simpler async APIs such as describing gestures, animation or scrolling. This makes it easier to write code that combines async events, like a gesture which hands off to an animation, all with cancellation and clean-up provided by structured concurrency. </p> \n   <center> \n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ef1xKWjA9E8\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n   </center> <h2><strong>Learning Compose</strong></h2> <p> To help you and your team learn all about Jetpack Compose, we’ve updated our <a href=\"http://goo.gle/compose-pathway\">learning pathway</a>; a curated list of videos, hands-on codelabs and key docs to get you started.
