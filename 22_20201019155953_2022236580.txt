The head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Robert Redfield, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/14/politics/white-house-task-force-small-gatherings/index.html\">expressed similar concerns</a> in a call with governors.</p><p>There has been an <a href=\"https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#cases_casesinlast7days\">alarming increase in COVID-19 cases</a> in most states in recent weeks, and we have seen cases rise <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/covid-college-cases-tracker.html\">in college towns</a> in particular. Colder weather means more activities are moving indoors, where <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/when-covid-19-superspreaders-are-talking-where-you-sit-in-the-room-matters-145966\">the virus can circulate</a>. And people who have been socially isolated for months feel <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/managing-stress-anxiety.html\">desperate for connection</a>.</p><p>As the holidays approach, one important question is what impact sending college students home for Thanksgiving will have on their home communities.</p><p>The Public Health Response Team at Texas A&#38;M University, which <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3nelzqkAAAAJ&hl=enl=en\">the three</a> <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gdcVdXwAAAAJ&hl=enl=en\">of us</a> <a href=\"https://temag.tamu.edu/directory/walter-t-casey/\">serve on</a>, has been documenting COVID-19 trends in Texas for the past six months and forecasting disease spread and the impacts on hospitals. With new cases ticking upward, we have been concerned about what the holidays will bring.</p><p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"400px\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/F9zYa/1/\"></iframe></p><h2>Dual hot spots</h2><p>In Texas, the most densely populated counties have a higher proportion of documented SARS-CoV-2 infections, and they contain a majority of the state's colleges and universities. The intersection of these features creates challenges for controlling COVID-19.</p><p>Many of these counties were already COVID-19 hot spots before students returned for the fall semester. In more crowded communities, the chance of random exposure to someone with COVID-19 is a lot less random and a lot more certain.</p><p>Reopening the campuses brought in an <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6939e4.htm?s_cid=mm6939e4_w\">age demographic</a> known to harbor the virus but often with only mild symptoms or no symptoms at all. This facilitated covert spread of the virus. Nationwide, many universities reported a <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6939e4.htm?s_cid=mm6939e4_w\">surge in cases</a> shortly after students returned in the fall, and some had to stop in-person classes and <a href=\"https://abc11.com/unc-covid-nc-coronavirus/7029408/\">shift back to online learning</a> when those cases got out of control.</p><p>Soon, these students will be returning to their families around the country for the holidays, and bringing with them the possibility of a souvenir no one wants — COVID-19.</p><p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"400px\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/O9Wjv/12/\"></iframe></p><h2>Cause for concern</h2><p>It's not just campus activities that raise concerns. It's also what students do when they aren't in class, including going to bars and attending off-campus parties.</p><p>In Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott recently relaxed the minimal restrictions for bars, allowing them to open at 50% capacity. This likely means that bars — chafing from being treated differently from other places where people gather in groups — will be rarin' to go. With young adults, the likelihood of <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/03/11/student-activities-risk-spread-coronavirus\">failing to remain vigilant</a> about social distancing, mask-wearing and other precautions is already a concern. Such risky behaviors would compound the risk factors, facilitating extra opportunities for the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6936a5.htm\">virus to spread</a>.</p><p>We hypothesize that factors such as <a href=\"https://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X(20)30489-4/pdf\">college drinking</a>, <a href=\"https://www.uwhealth.org/news/staying-safe-and-managing-social-pressures-during-the-pandemic-w/53464\">peer and social pressure</a> to act as if everything is normal, as well as <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/10/08/1009650/winter-will-make-the-pandemic-worse/\">seasonal changes</a> that make outdoor eating and drinking less feasible, will increase the likelihood of exposure to the coronavirus and subsequent infection.</p><p>As these young adults return home, some will probably have signs of mild illness. Some may have no discernible symptoms but will still be infectious. They could introduce the virus to communities that have had few infections so far and to the friends and family, including <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/older-adults.html\">vulnerable parents and grandparents</a>, they have been eager to reconnect with.</p><figure></figure><p>While we have been studying the dynamics of COVID-19's spread in Texas specifically, many other states with large college populations face the same combination of factors, with potentially infectious young adults heading home.</p><h2>So what can be done now?</h2><p>First, university and town officials can <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/colleges-universities/considerations.html\">prepare for these upcoming risks</a>. Efforts to contain and mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 on campuses and in surrounding communities are as important as ever.</p><p>Some campuses are planning to <a href=\"https://www.chronicle.com/article/fearing-a-second-wave-of-covid-19-some-colleges-will-end-fall-semester-early\">end the semester at Thanksgiving</a> break or shift to online classes for the final weeks to avoid additional travel that could spread the virus. Others have <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/welcome-to-college-now-get-tested-for-the-coronavirus--again-and-again/2020/09/04/2d087722-ed2f-11ea-b4bc-3a2098fc73d4_story.html\">implemented rigorous testing and contact tracing programs</a> to help stop the spread.</p><p>Second, everyone needs to take COVID-19 public health preventive practices seriously. That means avoiding large gatherings — and even smaller ones when new people are involved — wearing face masks, and following the recommended physical distancing guidelines. When going to bars or restaurants, be aware of <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/organizations/business-employers/bars-restaurants.html\">how well the customers and the businesses take precautions</a>.</p><p>Third, everyone should realize the upcoming holiday season will be different from those in years past. Students whose semester won't end until December should consider avoiding travel until the end of the year — or, if they are traveling earlier, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/fleeing-from-the-coronavirus-is-dangerous-for-you-the-people-you-encounter-along-the-way-and-wherever-you-end-up-133995\">to do it safely</a>. One strategy is to get tested before heading home and again before returning. If you aren't able to visit your grandparents and other family members in person, you can find remote ways to still connect, such as phone calls or video chats.</p><p>We wish everyone a good and safe holiday season — keeping yourself and others safe will mean knowing what the risks are and proactively taking steps to ensure many more happy family holidays to come.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag.

The two executives argued it encourages companies to sacrifice long-term progress and sustainability for short-term profits.</p><p>\"Jamie Dimon &#38; Warren Buffett's call to end quarterly guidance is an important step toward ending our nation's culture of short-termism,\" Biden <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1005469583904530432\">tweeted in response</a>.</p><p>\"America's workers &#38; investors will all be better off with a system that rewards those who build for the long-term,\" he added.</p><h2>A quiet alliance?</h2><p>Biden shares Buffett's positive view of America, his desire to raise taxes on the ultra wealthy, and his belief that a short-term focus hurts companies in the long run.</p><p>Buffett hasn't publicly endorsed Biden for president, but given their agreement on several subjects, it's easy to imagine the pair working together if the Democrat is elected.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

stories</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>The Acura TLX is a classic example of what we used to call a \"fine automobile.\"&#160;</p><p>It's the sort of well-made, conservatively-styled sedan that can be sporty, but doesn't have to be. When you throw in parent Honda's impeccable engineering and legendary reliability, the result is something quite fine, indeed.</p><p>Maybe too fine for its own good. I'm not sure you can find a better luxury midsize four-door — and I'm including traditional rivals such as the BMW 3-Series and the Audi A6. I lean German all the time, but whenever I come off some seat time in the Ohio-made Acura, I lean back toward the TLX. And when it comes to the A-Spec special editions, I've been ready to open my checkbook.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f85c264c255d800190b994f?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Acura TLX\" height=\"700\" width=\"933\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The TLX nameplate has been around since the 2015 model year.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Matthew DeBord/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>The TLX is all-new for the 2021 model year, born into a world increasingly dominated by SUVs.&#160;Acura sells those, too, but like all luxury marques, the big question these days is, \"Should we stick with the four-doors?\"</p><p>In Honda/Acura's case, the answer is clearly, \"Yes,\" and most industry observers think that the carmaker and historic foe Toyota/Lexus can continue to make sedans work. But they need to be at the tip-top of their game.</p><p>I got to see how tip-top when I sampled $49,325 TLX SH-AWD (\"super-handling all-wheel-drive\") Advance. The car started at a well-loaded $48,300 and got no extras, just an additional grand tacked on as a destination and handling fee. (The base TLX is $37,500.)</p><h2>Staggering value for a luxury four-door</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f85c28cc255d800190b9950?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Acura TLX\" height=\"1239\" width=\"1652\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The design is basically conservative, but with a lot of edges and angles.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Matthew DeBord/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>This is absolutely staggering value for a premium four-door, but then again, the TLX has offered staggering value for five years.</p><p>The TLX worked its TLX-y magic on me in less than an hour, causing me to question my allegiance to a small personal fleet of Toyota hybrids. I nearly took the plunge on a TSX, a TLX predecessor, when I lived on the West Coast, and so every time I get behind the wheel, I endure a bout of what-if lamentations. I know I said \"fine automobile,\" but for sedan connoisseurs, there might be no finer set of wheels.&#160;</p><p>If you think the TLX is a tricked-up Accord, think again. The new car has been uniquely designed, and the overall build quality is stupendous.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f848ec1c255d800190b9539?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Acura TLX\" height=\"1500\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The Acura TLX is competing in a segment that&#39;s been losing out to SUVs.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Matthew DeBord/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>My tester arrived in a sleek Modern Steel Metallic paint job with a groovy baseball-glove brown interior, and the combo was fire. The gray exterior was ideal for accentuating the TLX's angles and curves, of which there are certainly more of the former than the latter. A set of 19-inch wheels initially struck me as too small, but over a week, I decided they were just right.</p><p>One does need to have a mind for edge-work to enjoy looking at the TLX, which seems as though it's less a single, fastback shape than a concatenation of voids, tangents, tucks, and bends. It borders on Cubism, but Acura has been refining this aesthetic for a while now, and it with the 2021 TLX, the concept has reached a pleasing apotheosis.</p><h2>A soothing interior that's still a bit cramped in the back</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f848ec5c255d800190b9541?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Acura TLX\" height=\"1500\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Truck space is adequate.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Matthew DeBord/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>With the TLX, the busy exterior is soothed by a more placid, though high-tech, interior. We don't think enough about seats until they start to make us uncomfortable, and the TLX's 16-way front, heated and cooled, absolutely do not.</p><p>But they aren't recliners on wheels, either, as the TLX is supposed to offer spirited motoring in Sport mode, when the car's rotary drive selector — borrowed from the NSX supercar — is toggled in that direction.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f847e1c642e9400180b55b3?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Acura TLX\" height=\"1500\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The drive selector is taken from the NSX supercar.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Matthew DeBord/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Rearward, the legroom is ... not great. My suddenly tall teenage son would not have relished bending his knees to ride back there. But the trunk offers 13.5 cubic feet of capacity, and the interior is kinda roomy overall, so there isn't much justification for stretching the TLX to deal with the needs of adult rear-seat passengers.</p><p>Under the hood, the TLX packs a 2.0-liter, turbocharged inline four-cylinder engine, making 272 horsepower with 280 pound-feet of torque. This sucker punches above its weight big time. Even with a 10-speed automatic transmission that one might think would race toward the overdrive gears to vindicate the 21 mpg city/ 29 highway/24 combined fuel-economy rating, the TLX feels both potent and crisp, with a punchy 0-60 mph time of around six seconds.&#160;</p><h2>Handles like a champ</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f848ec2c255d800190b953b?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Acura TLX\" height=\"1500\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The interior is soothing.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Matthew DeBord/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>The handling is variable. Sport Mode encourages a brisk mood swing that welcomes harder acceleration, but the electric steering got a little too heavy for my tastes.</p><p>I ended up exploring the Individual setting, which offered the best of both worlds and still maxed out the TLX's enthusiastic yet admirably capable suspension. Like every other TLX I've driven in the past few years, the stiffness equation was perfectly calculated: My spine was thankful and I didn't have to ease off during hard cornering.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f847e1c642e9400180b55b1?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Acura TLX\" height=\"1500\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The infotainment screen rises above the dash, into the driver&#39;s line of sight.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Matthew DeBord/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>As with its luxe four-door brethren, the TLX comes with a suite of driver-assist features, and they all work as advertised. But this is a car I like to drive myself, so I made limited use of them.</p><p>In fact, I drove the TLX like I've driven some recent BMW test cars, while with Audis, Mercedes, and Lexuses, I've deferred to the adaptive cruise control option. Paddle shifters provide a manual capability, but I skipped it for the most part, allowing the computers to do a better job than I could and savoring the sonically augmented exhaust tones.</p><p>The infotainment system is a bit of a thorny issue here. Gone is the dual-screen of the previous generation, and in its place, a large central screen, with features controlled using a double trackpad, plus some buttons and knob (for audio volume).</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f847e1d642e9400180b55b4?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Acura TLX\" height=\"1500\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The touchpad controller takes some getting used to.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Matthew DeBord/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Once you get the hang of it, the setup works quite well. But you have to get the hang of it. As far as the tech itself goes, all boxes are checked: Bluetooth pairing, USB device integration, GPS navigation, wireless charging.</p><p>My tester was outfitted with Acura's sublime ELS Studio 3D audio system, a 17-speaker rig that is among the best available in the industry — and it's standard on the top-level Advance trim. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are available.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f847e1a642e9400180b55ad?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Acura TLX\" height=\"1500\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The TLX is a joy to drive, although the electric steering felt too taut at times.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Matthew DeBord/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>It should be rather obvious by now that I think the 2021 Acura TLX is a winner. But I already thought it was a winner, so more of the same, new generation.</p><p>The next question is, \"Did Acura remain tip-top with the car?\"</p><h2>Nothing missing, and the price is still very right</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f85c7e291aa9e001880b45a?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Acura TLX\" height=\"796\" width=\"1061\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The TLX remains a superb value.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Matthew DeBord/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Acura missed nothing in improving the TLX, and even gave a new infotainment system the old college try. You have to admire this obsessive commitment to ongoing excellence at a price below $50,000. As good as a lot of BMWs, better than some, and a relative bargain.</p><p>Sedan sales have been sliding in the US, and to keep cars such as then TLX in the game, carmakers like Acura have been upping prices. The new TLX is pricier than the old vehicle, but only by a few thousand bucks. I would argue that the outgoing sedan was underpriced, so at the very least, the new TLX is fairly stickered.&#160;</p><p>But the truth is that this terrific car remains a great buy. If you think about it — or drive it — I suspect you'll agree.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/review-acura-tlx-luxury-sedan-specs-photos-2020-10'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=1CRfevFZA7g:oL0eaG94S2U:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=1CRfevFZA7g:oL0eaG94S2U:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=1CRfevFZA7g:oL0eaG94S2U:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=1CRfevFZA7g:oL0eaG94S2U:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=1CRfevFZA7g:oL0eaG94S2U:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=1CRfevFZA7g:oL0eaG94S2U:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=1CRfevFZA7g:oL0eaG94S2U:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=1CRfevFZA7g:oL0eaG94S2U:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/1CRfevFZA7g\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 12:49:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f847e1b642e9400180b55b0?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"49c9f83ac0da7fd50eb451c15fd86273","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn76@2020_5/2020/10/19/15-59-07-036_30ebccbe12214206.webp","destWidth":2000,"destHeight":1500,"sourceBytes":832974,"destBytes":832974,"author":"insider@insider.com (Matthew DeBord)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5f847e1b642e9400180b55b0?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn76@2020_5/2020/10/19/15-59-07-036_30ebccbe12214206.webp","https://i.insider.com/5f85c264c255d800190b994f?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn92@2020_5/2020/10/19/15-59-40-718_7ff08fef76324c7a.webp","https://i.insider.com/5f85c28cc255d800190b9950?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn72@2020_4/2020/10/19/15-59-46-793_0b8eb9cb795a6d1a.webp","https://i.insider.com/5f848ec1c255d800190b9539?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn44@2020_5/2020/10/19/15-59-45-189_7e9a3fe47a85fa63.webp","https://i.insider.com/5f848ec5c255d800190b9541?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn20@2020_6/2020/10/19/15-59-41-094_a8644437b0d1b311.webp","https://i.insider.com/5f847e1c642e9400180b55b3?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn19@2020_3/2020/10/19/15-59-46-572_4e27f8ddd3a31685.webp","https://i.insider.com/5f848ec2c255d800190b953b?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn7@2020_2/2020/10/19/15-59-49-253_a459c53ef7e5a658.webp","https://i.insider.com/5f847e1c642e9400180b55b1?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn83@2020_4/2020/10/19/15-59-43-962_c5e5f4b877650c1a.webp","https://i.insider.com/5f847e1d642e9400180b55b4?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn15@2020_1/2020/10/19/15-59-49-446_cd3e7dd9339094c3.webp","https://i.insider.com/5f847e1a642e9400180b55ad?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn63@2020_6/2020/10/19/15-59-44-702_93c349679b860c30.webp","https://i.insider.com/5f85c7e291aa9e001880b45a?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn51@2020_1/2020/10/19/15-59-45-209_fb9a9b37485bd976.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn56@2020_5/2020/10/19/15-59-47-418_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=1CRfevFZA7g:oL0eaG94S2U:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn40@2020_4/2020/10/19/15-59-41-201_89daa67bab3b817b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=1CRfevFZA7g:oL0eaG94S2U:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn79@2020_3/2020/10/19/15-59-43-933_39485ed6e7f4d132.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn91@2020_5/2020/10/19/15-59-43-999_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=1CRfevFZA7g:oL0eaG94S2U:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn31@2020_6/2020/10/19/15-59-49-491_cc8a0740b88b48d0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/1CRfevFZA7g":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn3@2020_5/2020/10/19/15-59-46-343_066e78d8dbc27dfe.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603123146061},{"createdTime":"2020-10-19 23:59:05","updatedTime":"2020-10-19 23:59:05","title":"Most bosses think they're doing a better job leading than they actually are.

Along with the logistical issues of moving a business remote, the shift to 24/7 WFH created an even bigger challenge for managers, who now had to lead their stressed-out and struggling teams through a computer screen.&#160;</p><p>Nearly eight months into the pandemic, things haven't gotten much better. And there's a clear disconnect between how managers <em>think </em>they're doing, and employees' true feelings about their bosses.&#160;</p><p>In a survey of 750 full-time US managers and 750 employees the performance management software company <a href=\"https://www.15five.com/data-study/2020-workplace-report/?utm_source=pr&utm_medium=release&utm_campaign=release=release\">15Five</a> found that 84% of leaders reported feeling that they were doing a good job supporting employees during the pandemic, but only 69% of employees feel the same way.</p><p>The results suggest the presence of what psychologists call an <a href=\"https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/glossary/overconfidence-bias\">\"overconfidence bias,\"</a> in which people hold false beliefs about their abilities relative to objective measures. In this case, bosses believed they were better at managing and supporting employees than they actually were.</p><p>David Hassell, CEO and cofounder of 15Five, said this disconnect exists because managers have to support workers' emotional and work needs, and many companies haven't given them the tools to do so properly. Some 65% of managers in the 15Five survey said it was more difficult than usual to do their job effectively; 76% of senior level management said the same.&#160;</p><p>\"Connection is more important than ever, but it's harder to develop in this environment, especially when the structure isn't there,\" Hassell told Business Insider in an email. \"One-on-one meetings between managers and direct reports are so important now because they build a strong foundation of trust and help deepen relationships.\"&#160;</p><p>The pandemic has affected nearly everyone's mental health. A <a href=\"https://news.prudential.com/presskits/prudentials-pulse-american-worker-survey-work-in-progress.htm\">report from Prudential</a> found that 65% of American workers say the pandemic has added a great deal of stress to their lives.&#160;</p><p>Remote work also makes it surprisingly easy to skip lunch and work longer hours. It blurs the divide between work and home, which can lead to burnout.&#160;</p><p>Bosses need to be empathetic to these challenges, Rana el Kaliouby, cofounder and CEO of the software company Affectiva, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/3-ways-to-be-a-more-empathetic-leader-during-pandemic-2020-5\">wrote for Inc.</a></p><p dir=\"ltr\">\"We're all going through this pandemic, but we're not all in the same boat,\" she wrote. \"This is impacting people in all different ways, and as leaders we can't overlook that.\"</p><p>Nani Vishwanath, people team manager at Limeade, an employee experience software company, previously told Business Insider bosses need to encourage <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/paid-time-off-policies-employee-burnout-4-day-work-week-2020-8\">a healthy work-life balance</a> to ensure their employees aren't burning out. A few ways of doing this include: encouraging employees to take PTO, surveying your team, and having regular well-being check-ins.</p><p>\"When an employee finishes a demanding project or makes a big deadline, say 'You've been working really hard. Let's find a good time for you to take some time off to recharge,'\" Vishwanath told Business Insider's Marguerite Ward.&#160;</p><p>But the absolute best way to promote work-life balance is to model it yourself. If you tell employees to take their PTO, make sure you're taking it, too. Take regular breaks and encourage employees to do the same. Be understanding of workers challenges, but also be upfront when you're struggling yourself.&#160;</p><p>There's no such thing as a perfect boss and not every employee will love your management style — but there is a certain empathy that is required for leading during a time of crisis.&#160;</p><p>\"We are all leaders, be it at work, or in our families, or in our communities,\" el Kaliouby said. \"How we lead in these challenging times will have a ripple effect.\"</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

against President Donald Trump.</p><p>The latter category would put the posts under different rules, since they would count as campaigning.</p><p>Bigtent Creative told the BBC that it gets non-partisan funding, and that the creators' videos should not have had anti-Trump sentiments.</p><p>The BBC reported that TikTok removed the videos after the BBC flagged them, citing the policy

forming a \"vote chain\" — where the creators made side-by-side videos called duets that promoted a voter registration link.</p><p>But it reported that some of the creators included messages against Trump, like: \"Trump is trying to ban TikTok again... can we please vote him out?\"</p><p>That chain is still on TikTok, but other funded chains that included creators calling Trump an \"angry

accurately.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>Ahead of the 2018 midterm elections, Fox News decided to ditch the time-trodden model of using exit polls to help them call races as votes came in.</p><p>Instead, they took on a new approach: surveying upwards of 100,000 Americans ahead of Election Day to see where people are voting by mail or in person, and using that large dataset to make sense of the returns on election night.</p><p>Fox News Decision Desk Director Arnon Mishkin told Insider that the new method — the FOX News Voter Analysis system — was designed simply to call elections more accurately, not necessarily more quickly.</p><p>However, Mishkin noted that an advantage of this system during the coronavirus pandemic is its fine-tuning around mail-in voting, which is on pace to be far more widespread in 2020 than in past elections.</p><p>Below is a Q&#38;A with Mishkin where he explains how the network will approach calling the election amid rampant uncertainty and confusion around voting by mail.</p><p><em>This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.</em></p><p><strong>Jake Lahut:&#160;</strong>Could you start by walking me through what the previous system for calling elections was at Fox, and what this new one is doing differently?</p><p><strong>Arnon Mishkin:&#160;</strong>From the get-go, we were part of the National Election Pool (NEP) consortium, which basically ran the exit poll or purchased the exit poll — both the exit poll as well as the vote counts from the Associated Press. Following 2016, we were concerned about two things — and it wasn't just us, I think folks on the NEP were equally concerned. The two concerns were primarily the growth in the mail-in vote, and whether or not the exit poll was covering those people adequately enough. And the second was a tendency, for whatever reason, for there to be differential non-response — people who voted for one party seemed to be overrepresented in the sample than were represented when you actually count the vote. So there was a tendency for the results to skew.</p><p>We'd gotten sort of comfortable with realizing, well, if there's a lead here, that doesn't mean it's a lead because we know there's going to be a skew with the results. After 2016, the leadership at Fox said, \"We really need to come up with something new. The consortiums won't innovate, so we're pulling out, and you guys have to come up with something new.\"</p><p><strong>Lahut:&#160;</strong>Wow, so could you tell me what that initial meeting was like once you were tasked with coming up with a new model?</p><p><strong>Mishkin:&#160;</strong>We were sort of puzzled. Like, how are we going to do this without an exit poll? Then we met as a team here at Fox and developed what we thought would be a different way of approaching a \"voter x-ray,\" if you will — sort of understanding the voters. And we thought, let's do sort of a combination of a phone and internet poll across the country in the days before an election, which we thought would be the same tool for covering early voters, Election Day voters, and mail-in or absentee voters.</p><p>This was at a time, when we pulled out after 2016, when roughly a little over 40% of Americans were voting early or absentee. And we thought that the way the exit poll handled that was insufficient. So we developed a different approach.</p><p>We were very much told by our leadership here at Fox that we're not here to try and do something that's designed to give us a competitive advantage. We're trying to do something to improve the accuracy of the system. And we tried to explain that to our friends at NEP and at VAP. So we got the AP to join us, and we developed what we call the FoX News Voter Analysis and what they call AP VoteCast, working with the NORC (National Opinion Research Center) at the University of Chicago to come up with this combination phone and internet poll.</p><p><strong>Lahut:&#160;</strong>Could you tell me a little more about these surveys? Are they predicting the breakdown of the mail-in vote by offering a pattern of how those returns will split compared to the in-person votes?</p><p><strong>Mishkin: </strong>OK, so it's one standard tool. In every interview we find out if the voter is going to vote or has the voter voted, and also by what method they voted. So whether you're an in-person voter or a mail-in voter, you're taking the same survey. Based on that, and based on demographics of the country and various other things, it estimates — I wouldn't say predicts — what percentage are voting by mail, what percentage are voting in-person early, and what percentage are voting on Election Day. And those estimates are then also correlated with other estimates we get to make sure they're on track with what various other vendors provide on how many people have voted by mail.</p><p><strong>Lahut: </strong>Are there any rough benchmarks or circumstances where this model would allow you to call the race on election night or within 24 hours of the final votes being cast?</p><p><strong>Mishkin: </strong>The timing of the call is going to be a function of how wide the margin is between the two candidates, and not just in the presidency, but also in the various other statewide races. In the event that there's a wide margin, I think all of the networks are going to be able to make a call fairly quickly. In the event that the margin is much closer, you won't be able to make that call because you won't be able to see if there's a difference until later in the evening — and that's true in any election.&#160;</p><p>What makes this election more complex than most is that in most elections, mail-in voters differ a little from Election Day voters, but not that much in this election. For whatever reason, it has become almost an article of faith that Republicans should be voting on Election Day in person, and Democrats should be voting early or by mail. And so when you look at any or all the polls that have come out, it shows huge swings between how the mail-in vote is going to look and how the Election Day vote is going to look. That makes it far more complicated on election night, as we start seeing the vote to understand what exactly we are looking at.</p><p>We think that the combination of the three tools we'll have on election night to study the vote will give us a good idea of what's really happening, but it is much more complicated than it is historically. Those three tools, I should point out, are the Fox News Voter Analysis, the sample precincts that we'll be getting from the Associated Press, as well as the actual raw vote that you're getting county by county.</p><bi-shortcode id=\"expanded-coverage\" class=\"mceNonEditable\" data-source=\"insider-voter-guide\" data-show-header=\"true\">Expanded Coverage Module:

relationships with our bosses could lead us to make unethical decisions on their behalf, say leadership and business researchers Jennifer Jordan and Tim Vriend.</li>\n<li>People who are close to their managers are more likely to misrepresent the truth or withhold negative information about them as a sign of dedication.</li>\n<li>While great relationships at the workplace are beneficial for performance, morale, and job satisfaction, employers should always make it clear that lying, cheating, or any other unethical behavior will not be tolerated.&#160;</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>We generally believe that it is a good thing to have strong relationships with the people we work for and those we manage. Organizations and leaders do many things to cultivate this: retreats, one-on-one meetings, lunches, coaching — to name a few. But good relationships at work can also lead to unethical behavior.</p><p>In a <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01473/full\">recent study</a> with our colleagues Ramzi Said and Onne Janssen, we found that people who report stronger relationships with their bosses are more likely to engage in bad behavior on their behalf. This included things like misrepresenting the truth or withholding negative information about them to make their manager look good, even if it brought themselves no obvious or immediate benefit.</p><p>We conducted two studies. One was an experiment with more than 150 workers from the United States and the other a survey of more than 200 European employees. Across the two studies, we found that when employees believed that acting unethically helped their leader, they were more likely to do so if they had a strong relationship with them compared to when the relationship was weak.</p><p>We also discovered why this was happening. Workers acted unethically as a way to reciprocate or \"pay back\" their boss for their boss' dedication to them. This expectation was in no way made explicit by their boss. Instead, the workers were merely acting upon the universal norm of <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170911122639.htm\">unspoken reciprocity</a>: If you do something good for me, I will do something good for you in return.</p><p>Similarly, we found that if people don't have a good relationship with their boss, they will do the opposite. They are more likely to engage in unethical behavior to support themselves, potentially at the expense of their boss.</p><p>The motivation was the same. Instead of reciprocating their good relationship with their boss, here people felt the need to get their own back on their bosses for having a bad relationship with them. They would be more willing to misrepresent the truth to make themselves look good or to withhold true but negative information about themselves to others in the organization.</p><p>Previous research tells us that this kind of behavior isn't limited to people's relationship with their immediate boss, but extends to the organization as a whole. <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2011-15805-006\">Other</a> <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2010-13313-013\">researchers</a> have found that employees who strongly identified with their organization were more likely to misrepresent the truth, withhold possibly damaging information about it, even if it meant acting against a customer's interests. Again, this is all out of a sense of paying back a company that they cared deeply about.</p><p>This work also suggests that when employees identify strongly with the organization they work for they might become blinded to any wrongdoing or unethical behavior because of their positive view of their workplace.</p><h2>Benefits to be had</h2><p>Research shows there are huge benefits for both companies and individuals when employees have good relationships with their managers, including a positive effect on their physical <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267764955_Leader-member_Exchange_LMX_and_Performance_A_Meta-Analytic_Review\">and mental well-being</a>. People who have strong relationships with their bosses also tend to perform better at work, spread goodwill further across the rest of the organization, and are more supportive of their peers — not to mention experiencing greater job satisfaction and developing a higher level of commitment to their company.</p><p>So bosses must put measures in place if they want to both cultivate strong bonds with the people who work for them and ensure that they act ethically and uphold strong company values. They must make it clear that lying, cheating, or doing anything else to protect their manager is neither allowed nor appreciated. Bosses must make it clear that they, nor anyone else in the company, sees this as a positive behavior that demonstrates loyalty.</p><p>And when bosses do observe this kind of behavior (even if it's on a small scale), they must immediately bring it to the worker's attention and perhaps even accompany it with a meaningful sanction in order to demonstrate the importance of not acting that way. Employees should also realize their potential to do the wrong thing in a misguided act of loyalty towards their boss — and avoid it.</p><p>Strong workplace relationships are always beneficial, particularly in the current climate of anxiety brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. But, even so, these relationships should be the basis of more ethical, not unethical, behavior.<!-- Below is The Conversation's page counter tag. Please DO NOT REMOVE. --><!-- End of code.

In my first Thrive order, the total was $99.16 and the savings listed were $145.33.&#160;</p><p>The savings claims held up, and I technically paid off the $60 annual membership fee in my first order. The food was delicious, and I discovered new better-for-you snacks. I also found Thrive to be surprisingly cheaper for some of my favorite skincare products, like <a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/sid/biipgfbestrainjacket/https://thrivemarket.com/p/aztec-secret-indian-healing-clay\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">this Aztec Clay Mask</a>.</p><p>Thrive Market carries ethically sourced <a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/sid/biipgfbestrainjacket/https://thrivemarket.com/c/meat-seafood?filter%5Bcategories%5D=971\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">meat and seafood</a> in large bulk \"box\" options, but the options are slightly more limited than the average meat and seafood counter at a grocery store. I also don't have space in my freezer or fridge to handle $100+ worth of meat, but if&#160;you do, it could be another great place to see your savings.</p><p>My colleague, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/author/owen-burke\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Owen Burke</a>, a lifelong fisherman with a background in commercial fishing and tending oyster bars, tried out Thrive's bevy of seafood on offer, and had this to say:</p><p>\"I tried Thrive Market's Deluxe Seafood box, which runs you about $170. This is not something you'll want to buy unless you have a solid shelf of freezer space to spare, but I'll commend Thrive and call this nothing short of a feat on their part. You're getting six different species of seafood, and everything I received was wild-caught, and not in some far-flung waters using questionable methods and labor practices, something with which the industry is rife. These might not be the absolute best practices for every product, but Thrive is going leaps and bounds above your run-of-the-mill grocery store.</p><p>My favorite was the shrimp. They were superbly packed, vacuum-sealed, and packaged, which is among the most important things to do with any seafood. Mess that part up in any way (which, admittedly, is an easy thing to do), and you're fighting a losing game against oxidation and freezer burn. These shrimp still looked fresh after I thawed them and pulled them out of the packaging. They were beautifully peeled and deveined, and they had no hint of off-flavor that you sometimes get when shrimp (especially frozen shrimp) aren't handled all that well. I give them an A+ here.</p><p>The sockeye salmon was also vacuum-sealed well, and while I always appreciate skin-on salmon fillets, they often come at the cost of turned (brown) blood meat, which imparts that\"fishy\" flavor associated with frozen fish. This is per usual, though, when it comes to frozen salmon, but I recommend eating around it, if not to avoid the taste then to avoid the toxins blood meat bears. You'll also get four to five fillets, which means four to five servings (about six ounces a pop).</p><p>The lobster tails are very nicely processed, deveined, and split so you can pop them right in the oven or on the grill. They're not vacuum-sealed, but loose on a tray covered in plastic, which lends them to some freezer burn and ice buildup, but that really doesn't create the problem for lobster as it does for fish, due to the tough quality of the meat.</p><p>The scallops I received provided two servings, and while they weren't vacuum-sealed as I would have liked, they were plenty tasty. Just note that these are not your jumbo-sized U10 (under 10/pound) scallops, but they were tasty and clean (free of residual sand and mud). You can find better scallops out there, but for what you're getting for the price of this box, I'd file no complaints.</p><p>It varies depending on what you get, but in all, you're looking at 10-15 meals of fresh-frozen (that's fish that was frozen fresh, as soon as it was processed) wild-caught protein of high quality. That's something like $11-$17 dollars a dish, which is about as good as you're going to do with high-quality fresh seafood unless you've got friends at the fishing docks.\"</p><h2>The bottom line</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/https://thrivemarket.com/web/membership/welcome\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\"><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f2c3449aee6a83eca3394d9?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Thrive Market\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Thrive Market carries meat and fish to be ordered in bulk, but it isn&#39;t likely to be the average person&#39;s main source of meats.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Thrive Market/Facebook</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></a></p><p>I wish it was possible to find everything here (fresh fruit, more options for meat), but ultimately the discounts and the easy delivery make using Thrive worth it. And I wish it was free shipping always instead of just orders of $49 and up, but I typically clear that just by restocking my favorite basics. All in all, I liked using Thrive Market regularly for healthy snacks, healthy-but-fast foods, and kitchen basics like pasta sauce and olive oil.</p><p>If you need an added incentive, Thrive Market also has a program&#160;called \"<a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/sid/biipgf031418besthikingsocks/https://thrivemarket.com/giving\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Thrive Gives</a>\" which gifts a free membership to someone in need through <a href=\"https://help.thrivemarket.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001342863-How-does-Thrive-Gives-distribute-free-memberships-\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Feeding America and the Boys and Girls Club or directly through the site</a> for every paid membership.

We're human, after all, and it's our nature to feel deep emotions.</p><p>However, strong emotions such as confidence, optimism, fear, and greed can cloud our objectivity and cause us to make regrettable decisions if we're not careful.</p><h2><strong>Leave your emotions out of it</strong></h2><p>I was working with a 30-year-old client in mid-March who had just received her largest annual bonus yet. The financial plan we had devised last year was for her to defer as much of the bonus as possible to max her <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-a-401k\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Roth 401(k)</a> plan, and then invest the remainder in her taxable account.</p><p>The client had already set aside a healthy cash reserve that would cover a year's worth of expenses plus remaining <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/why-bonus-taxed-high\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">taxes on the bonus</a> that the tax withholding didn't cover. And, she was confident that she wouldn't need to spend the bonus money until years into the future.&#160;&#160;</p><p>Despite all of this cushion, the bonus was paid during the time when we were all just beginning to shelter-in-place and COVID concerns were tanking the stock market.</p><p>The client wasn't worried about losing her job, but she had many friends who were getting laid off or furloughed, which caused her concern. She was deeply afraid about the future, and the deep declines in the stock market scared her even more. She was confident that there was no way the market could recover any time soon, and she wanted to keep the bonus money on the sidelines until a more favorable investment environment presented itself.</p><p>It's emotions like these that cause investors to buy at the top of the market and sell at the lowest point. My job was to try to protect her from these emotions during a period when no one knew what the short or long-term societal and economic outcomes would be.</p><h2><strong>Look at the data and stick to your plan</strong></h2><p>The client and I had a long conversation about how long-term investors should not try to time the bottom or the top of the market. Instead, it's important to look at longer-term market history and understand why staying invested over the long-term has always proven to be the right decision.&#160;</p><p>I shared with her that over the 30 years ending December 31, 2019, an investment in the S&#38;P 500 would have achieved a 10% annualized return.&#160;Missing the 25 best single days during that period would have resulted in a 5% annualized return.&#160;And, skipping stocks entirely and investing only in Treasury bills over that time period would have resulted in a 2.7% compounded return.</p><p>Ultimately, the client decided to stick with her plan and she invested the bonus. Had she deviated from her plan she would have missed the most significant short-term market recovery from the market bottom in March.</p><p><em>Sandi Bragar is a certified financial planner and partner and managing director in planning strategy and research at Aspiriant.</em></p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/how-investors-can-avoid-emotional-decisions-expert-advice-2020-10'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=jI9S3XB4t9k:R0qeh_NU84w:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=jI9S3XB4t9k:R0qeh_NU84w:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=jI9S3XB4t9k:R0qeh_NU84w:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=jI9S3XB4t9k:R0qeh_NU84w:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=jI9S3XB4t9k:R0qeh_NU84w:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=jI9S3XB4t9k:R0qeh_NU84w:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=jI9S3XB4t9k:R0qeh_NU84w:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=jI9S3XB4t9k:R0qeh_NU84w:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/jI9S3XB4t9k\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 15:25:53 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f639b6b57b7da001ee12465?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"4e9f8902481dd663a184496e3420c9f2","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn59@2020_2/2020/10/19/15-59-12-943_5957b093fb7b43ba.webp","destWidth":1885,"destHeight":1414,"sourceBytes":197918,"destBytes":197918,"author":"insider@insider.com (Sandi Bragar)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://media.tbistatic.com/bistudios/_00/dev_edit/mym/banner/MYM_banner.png?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn23@2020_1/2020/10/19/15-59-46-529_18839599776e6e12.webp","https://i.insider.com/5f639b6b57b7da001ee12465?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn59@2020_2/2020/10/19/15-59-12-943_5957b093fb7b43ba.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn56@2020_5/2020/10/19/15-59-47-418_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=jI9S3XB4t9k:R0qeh_NU84w:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn15@2020_4/2020/10/19/15-59-44-886_437b08ced448c956.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=jI9S3XB4t9k:R0qeh_NU84w:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn88@2020_5/2020/10/19/15-59-48-393_c47f437cddf5978c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn91@2020_5/2020/10/19/15-59-43-999_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=jI9S3XB4t9k:R0qeh_NU84w:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn55@2020_1/2020/10/19/15-59-45-269_8bd661f0633ea196.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/jI9S3XB4t9k":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn64@2020_4/2020/10/19/15-59-43-687_b9c41a9a0144296d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603123145984},{"createdTime":"2020-10-19 23:59:05","updatedTime":"2020-10-19 23:59:05","title":"The best travel backpacks","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-travel-backpack","description":"<ul class=\"summary-list\"><li>A travel backpack packs like a suitcase but is small enough to wear on your back as you trudge through the airport or trek around a new city.</li><li>We tested nine of the top travel backpacks and determined that the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&mi=17145&pw=184534&ctc=&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tortugabackpacks.com%2Fproducts%2Foutbreaker-travel-backpack%3Fvariant%3D26900597257nt%3D26900597257\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Tortuga Outbreaker</a> is the best you can buy with its generous capacity, functional organizer pockets, and customizable strap system.</li><li>If you're looking for a more traditional suitcase, check out our guide to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-carry-on-bag\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the best carry-ons</a>.</li></ul><p>Before the pandemic struck, I was regularly reviewing hotels for the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/travel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Insider Reviews Travel</a> section, and what those assignments taught me — beyond how to properly assess a hotel's amenities — was how to pack for a short trip. I was often only staying one or two nights, and even a carry-on was too large. Plus, they were a pain to lug into the office the next day, and I'd often have to carry a separate bag for my laptop.</p><p>A travel backpack was the solution. Basically suitcases you can wear on your back, travel backpacks are the favorite luggage of many a digital nomad, urban explorer, and work traveler. It's a one-bag solution with plenty of room to fit all the clothes you need for a short trip plus organizer pockets for tech, accessories, and travel documents.</p><p>To find the best travel backpack, I tested nine of the most popular models on the market for capacity, packability, logical pocket placement, and carry comfort. I wanted packs that felt manageable in size and bulk but still allowed me enough room for all my usual packing needs.

Basically, you can put a lot of stuff in a lot of places, and that's why we love it. We'll start with the basics. The front-loader bag opens to reveal a main compartment flanked by zipper pockets on either side. On the opposite panel are two large mesh compartments that I utilized to pack small items like socks and underwear. I was able to fit four to five days of clothes in here. But where it really excels is in its organizer pockets.</p><p>Inside the front panel is a deep organizer pocket with wallet-like divisions for cards and pens, a mesh zipper compartment, and a solid compartment perfect for travel documents. On the exterior of the front panel, you get two more zipper pockets, and you'll find a water bottle pocket on each side of the pack &#8212; a rarity for these travel backpacks.</p><p>The tech pocket is one of the most impressive at utilizing its space. The back panel zips open and lays flat for easy screening, and it features two well-padded fleece-lined pockets &#8212; one for a tablet and one for up to a 17-inch laptop. Opposite that, you'll find three large mesh zipper pockets for storing all your chargers and accessories.</p><p>All these pockets really mean you don't have to bother with an additional purse, backpack, or bag. Tortuga's pretty much utilized every inch of space in this backpack.</p><p>The suspension system is also impressive in its adjustability. You can move the entire thing, shoulder straps and all, up or down the pack to get the perfect fit for a variety of torso heights. The hip belt is one of the widest I tested and it does a fantastic job of redistributing weight off your shoulders &#8212; though, admittedly, it's a little dorky looking. Load lifters on the shoulder straps ensure the bag won't sag off your shoulders, creating pressure points.</p><p>One downside to this pack is that the harness system isn't stowable, so you may find things get caught as you try to shove it in the overhead. This bag meets carry-on requirements, by the way.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&#38;mi=17145&#38;pw=184534&#38;ctc=&#38;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tortugabackpacks.com%2Fproducts%2Foutbreaker-travel-backpack%3Fvariant%3D26900597257\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Outbreaker</a> is the most expensive pack on this list at $269, but for all you get, I think it's worth it. But if you're not into spending so much money on a travel backpack, you should also consider the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&#38;mi=17145&#38;pw=184534&#38;ctc=&#38;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tortugabackpacks.com%2Fproducts%2Fsetout-travel-backpack%3Fvariant%3D16185333219399\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Tortuga Setout</a> which goes for $179. It's similar to the Outbreaker, but holds about a day's less gear, features fewer organizer pockets, the harness system is not as adjustable, and the laptop pocket isn't fleece-lined. You'll make some compromises, but you'll also save $90.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Incredible organizer pockets, so many pockets (did I mention the pockets), fits four-to-five days worth of gear, padded and fleece-lined tech pocket, adjustable harness system, wide hip belt, two water bottle pockets</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Harness system does not stow</p>\n\tThe best for short trips\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f8d9c999e9fe4001900a0aa?format=jpeg\" alt=\"incase eo\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Jen Gushue/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B012BOLDVM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_080217_best-travel-backpacks-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B012BOLDVM&#38;linkId=e14683cd639b710aec3dee6f11ddcc41\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Incase EO</a> is everything you'll need for short trips. Its main compartment expands to fit up to three days worth of clothes, and it can easily transition into a day pack to wear while out and about.</h3><p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B012BOLDVM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_080217_best-travel-backpacks-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B012BOLDVM&#38;linkId=e14683cd639b710aec3dee6f11ddcc41\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Incase EO</a> is the smallest bag on our list by volume, maxing out at 25 liters, but it fits much more than it lets on. It's definitely an overnighter &#8212; maybe a weekender if you push it &#8212; but it's a well organized little pack that's easily a one-bag solution for light packers and quick trips.</p><p>It's also unique among our selections in that it's compressible. Just behind the main zipper is another perimeter zipper that contracts the bag down, effectively transforming it into a day pack.</p><p>The main compartment opens front-loader-style, and while it'll fit a couple outfits, you'll also want to utilize the space in the organizer pocket to stash some additional clothes. Instead of a flat organizer pocket, you'll get a couple of inches of depth in addition to some internal flat pouches. The organizer pocket does load from the top, so be sure to load it up with your more wrinkle-resistant items. The pouches within the organizer pocket are open at the top, so anything you put in them will simply drop in. I do wish they had zipper closures for added security.</p><p>There's also a small pocket hidden under the grab handle at the top of the bag. It's so well-hidden that I used the bag multiple times before I noticed it was there. It's lined with microfleece, so it's a great place to store sunglasses or other scratchable items.</p><p>The tech pocket comprises the entire back panel, and it fully unzips to lie flat for added TSA-friendliness. The laptop pocket is lined with microfleece for extra protection and fits up to a 16-inch laptop. Opposite that is a pouch to slide chargers and other accessories into, though I wish it had a zipper closure and some more pockets to better utilize that space.</p><p>Because this pack is smaller, it doesn't come with a hip best or any way to attach one, and this pack ends up feeling pretty heavy when packed to capacity. But the shoulder straps are well-padded with air mesh, and the sternum strap has some flex to it so it doesn't cut into you while you walk.</p><p>Its small size also makes it easy to take on a plane as a carry-on.</p><p><strong>Pros:&#160;</strong>Expands to fit more clothes and contracts to be used as a day pack, lay-flat fleece-lined laptop pocket, organizer pocket has depth for additional storage, carry-on friendly</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Only fits one to three days worth of stuff, organizer pouches don't zip closed, no hip belt, feels heavy to carry</p>\n\tThe best for carrying more\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f8d9cd99e9fe4001900a0ac?format=jpeg\" alt=\"cotopaxi allpa\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Jen Gushue/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3>Three spacious compartments in the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B083TK6W33/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_080217_best-travel-backpacks-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B083TK6W33&#38;linkId=4dd4a6c3281bc4dd6e1f9c5ae8fa3fb1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Cotopaxi Allpa</a> allow you to pack more than any 35L backpack we tried, and it still manages to stay a streamlined carry.

I fit my entire five-day packing list including sneakers, a sweatshirt, and all my outfits. I didn't have to compromise or pack \"creatively\" or stick socks into pockets where socks didn't belong.</p><p>The clamshell design allows the pack to open like a book. On the right, you'll find an undivided expansive compartment. On the left, you'll find two smaller mesh pockets on the top half and a big compartment, half the side of the pack on the bottom. There's also a third compartment of the same size that can be accessed externally at the top of the pack.</p><p>A mesh pocket inside this compartment is the only externally accessible organization you'll find on this pack, so we might suggest investing in a travel wallet to store your travel documents.</p><p>Accessed by a zipper on the side of the back panel, the tech pocket has a velcro tablet pocket and enough room for a 15-inch laptop, but it lacks accessory pockets. Directly opposite that zipper is a quick-access zipper that lets you reach into the main compartment without unzipping the whole thing. Just don't mix up the tech pocket zipper with the quick-access zipper or you may have a mess on your hands.</p><p>The harness system is basic, but the contoured shoulder straps are comfortable, and the removable hip belt is streamlined and effectively distributed load weight. The sternum strap is vertically adjustable so you can get the right fit. And the entire thing is stowable within the back panel for storage and fitting into overhead compartments.</p><p>And speaking of overhead compartments, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B083TK6W33/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_080217_best-travel-backpacks-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B083TK6W33&#38;linkId=4dd4a6c3281bc4dd6e1f9c5ae8fa3fb1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Cotopaxi Allpa 35L</a> meets all but the strictest airline carry-on requirements.</p><p><strong>Pros:&#160;</strong>Easily fits five-plus days worth of gear, has room for both a 15-inch laptop and a tablet, intuitive compartment placement, meets most airline carry-on requirements, comes with a rain cover</p><p><strong>Cons:&#160;</strong>Lacks meaningful organizer pockets, no space for travel documents, tech pocket lacks space for accessories, shoulder straps are not very adjustable, hip belt may hit too high for those with longer torsos</p>\n\tThe most comfortable to carry\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f8d9d2cc21cfb0019468b97?format=jpeg\" alt=\"osprey fairview\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Jen Gushue/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07YBWM448/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_080217_best-travel-backpacks-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B07YBWM448&#38;linkId=31f7d059c46233a6c6cb5da18e9e0d39\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Osprey Fairview</a>/<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B085PQK8HV/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_080217_best-travel-backpacks-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B085PQK8HV&#38;linkId=28c15d0b2ef746d63794f9457b1284ae\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Farpoint</a> is available in two fits with two torso sizes per fit.

The Fairview is better suited for those with smaller torsos and wider hips. The Farpoint is better for taller folks with broader shoulders. I have a small torso, so I went with the Fairview.</p><p>Within each fit, there are also two different sizes &#8212; measure your torso from the base of your neck to the top of your hips to determine what size pack will suit you best. The ability to get the pack that best fits your body contributes to the comfort of your carry in a big way.</p><p>The frame sheet in the back panel is also contoured to help the back hug your lower back and shift the weight of the load away from your shoulders. The hip belt is also wider than the other packs I tested which also makes a difference in redistributing weight.</p><p>The harness system is also ergonomically designed and it's one of the few packs on our list with load lifters to keep the pack tight from sagging away from your shoulders. The entire system stows away thanks to a hidden flap that rolls up and zips over the entire thing.</p><p>As far as the pack itself, it's a front-loader with one large main packing compartment with internal compressor straps. A combination tech and organizer pocket sits in front of that. It's the only pack we tried where the tech pocket is in the front, which provides less security, but the external compressor straps affix in such a way that completely hides the external zippers so no one can get to them without some serious effort. A quick-grab pocket on the front rounds out the pack.</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Available in multiple styles for a great fit; wide hip belt, load lifters, and a contoured frame sheet make it very comfortable to carry; compressor straps hide external zippers; entire harness system hides away; carry-on compliant on most airlines; lifetime repair/replace warranty</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Not the most fashionable pack, tech pocket at the front is a bit unusual</p><h3>Osprey Farpoint</h3><div id=\"ProductCard_5f8da87dce3d6946dd3b245a\" style=\"position:relative; display:block; width: 100%\"><iframe src=\"https://produktor.businessinsider.com/productCardService?id=5f8da87dce3d6946dd3b245a&type=button&live=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"150%\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" style=\"position:absolute; top:0; left: 0\"></iframe></div><h3>Osprey Fairview</h3>\n\tThe best duffle-style travel backpack\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f8d9d82c21cfb0019468b98?format=jpeg\" alt=\"timbuk2 impulse\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Jen Gushue/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3>With one large main compartment, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07N46KCDH/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_080217_best-travel-backpacks-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B07N46KCDH&#38;linkId=4cb27b70548489baed08ac27c5f3e51e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Timbuk2 Impulse Travel Backpack Duffel</a> lets you pack a ton of stuff however you see fit, and it throws in some small side pockets and a shoe pocket to further up its utility.</h3><p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07N46KCDH/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipgf_080217_best-travel-backpacks-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B07N46KCDH&#38;linkId=4cb27b70548489baed08ac27c5f3e51e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Timbuk2 Impulse</a> is the largest backpack on our list by volume at 45 liters, and thanks to its duffle-style design, you really get to utilize all that packing space. Rather than being broken up into smaller compartments, a U-shaped zipper flap reveals one large one that you can pack however you like. On the underside of that flap, you'll find three mesh compartments for organizing your smalls.</p><p>It also offers a few friendly details that set it apart from your typical duffle. On either side of the pack &#8212; or the top and bottom if you're wearing it &#8212; are separate zippered compartments. On the bottom, you'll find a water-resistant compartment for shoes or laundry, and on top is a similarly-sized more flexible compartment. Utilizing either of these compartments will cut into the space available in your main compartment though.</p><p>The tech pocket leaves something to be desired, it's accessed by a zipper on the side of the back panel, and though it's spacious enough to fit up to a 17-inch laptop, there are no pockets for accessories, and it doesn't open to lay flat. There's a distinct lack of organizational pockets on this pack and nowhere intuitive to store travel documents, but that's what you get with a duffle-style bag like this one.</p><p>The suspension system isn't the most comfortable, but it's perfectly serviceable. I found the shoulder straps to be a bit wideset for my narrow shoulders, but someone broader than me shouldn't have an issue. The sternum strap is vertically adjustable and the hip belt helps disperse the load weight quite well. It felt lighter than some of the smaller-capacity bags I tested, even when fully packed.</p><p>The Timbuk2 Impulse is carry-on friendly with many airlines, but if you overpack it, it could easily lose its shape and put you over the limit. The bag does have built-in compression straps both externally and internally that you should absolutely utilize to help the bag stay compact. Overpacking could also lead to sticky zippers, and the zippers on this pack are stiff and the best of times.</p><p>The entire harness system can be stowed in the back panel of the pack for stowing it away, but the clips that attach the shoulder straps are dependent on a small metal clip that doesn't seem the most durable.

Despite also being a 35L pack, I was able to fit about a day's less gear than the Outbreaker. The Setout's tech pocket is less impressive and it has fewer organizational pockets than the Outbreaker. Its suspension system is also less adjustable, so you make have to live with a slightly less comfortable fit. The distinct advantage, though, is that it's $90 cheaper. You'll make some compromises to save a few bucks, but they're minor compromises at best. This is still a wonderful pack.</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&#38;mi=10248&#38;pw=184534&#38;ctc=&#38;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F174500%2Ffjallraven-splitpack%3F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Fjallraven Splitpack</a>: </strong>The Fjallraven Splitpack has a clamshell construction, but instead of the zipper being around the perimeter, it's up the middle, splitting the pack in half vertically. It's made of the brand's sturdy G-1000 Heavy Duty Eco polyester-cotton blend, and it feels like it's built to stop a speeding train. It holds a ton, but it lacks external organizer pockets and there's nowhere to safely stow a laptop. Poorly padded straps and the absence of a hip belt made it very uncomfortable to carry, and it doesn't meet airline carry-on requirements, so it was disqualified.</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=35871X943606&#38;xs=1&#38;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.speckproducts.com%2Fspeck%2Fbackpacks%2Ftravel-backpack%2FST-BPTVL.html%23\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Speck Travel Backpack</a>: </strong>Speck loaded up this pack with all the bells and whistles including an external USB port and a built-in TSA-approved lock. I was able to fit four days' worth of gear in it, so it's got an impressive capacity, but all those extra add-ons made it feel much heavier when empty than the other picks on our list, and ultimately they're not necessary.</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&#38;mi=10083&#38;pw=184534&#38;ctc=&#38;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.patagonia.com%2Fproduct%2Fblack-hole-duffel-bag-40-liters%2F49338.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Patagonia Black Hole Duffel</a>: </strong>Patagonia's reputation speaks for itself, and this duffel backpack is built to last. Insider's VP of Commerce, Breton Fischetti, has had his for over a decade, and it's still in perfect condition. But the lack of tech pocket, the barebones suspension system, and the fact that it doesn't meet airline carry-on requirements were all strikes against it.</p>\n\tThe backpack glossary\n\t\n\t<p>Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-backpack-students\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jansport you wore in middle school</a>, travel backpacks have a lot of component parts, many of which are designed to make the backpack more comfortable to carry and less strenuous to your back. But if you don't know the vocabulary, you may have a tough time understanding what you're buying. Here are a few must-know vocab words to give you a better understanding of backpack anatomy.</p><p><strong>L:&#160;</strong>Backpack capacity is often expressed in liters, so if you see a backpack advertised as 35L, that means its total capacity is approximately 35 liters in volume. While the liter measurement can give you a general idea of how much stuff your backpack will hold, the way your pack's pockets and compartments are structured ultimately play a huge role in how much you'll be able to fit. We tested 35L backpacks that maxed out at three days' worth of stuff and some that could easily hold five or more days' worth.</p><p><strong>Clamshell:</strong> A clamshell backpack features a zipper on three sides with the fourth side acting as a hinge. Clamshell packs open flat like a suitcase and have two equal compartments.</p><p><strong>Front-loading:</strong> A front-loading backpack opens similarly to a clamshell pack, but instead of the zipper being located in the middle to create two equal compartments, it's located at the front to create one large packing space.</p><p><strong>Rear-loading:</strong> A rear-loading backpack is exactly the same as a front-loading backpack, except the zipper is located at the back panel instead of the front panel.</p><p><strong>Top-loading:</strong> Your middle school Jansport was a top-loading backpack. Instead of opening fully flat, you load your items in from the top. We've found that top-loaders provide a worse experience on a large scale than clamshells or front/back-loaders, so we've chosen not to include them in this guide.</p><p><strong>Shoulder straps:</strong> These are simply the straps that go over your shoulders with which you carry your backpack. They are, in essence, what make a backpack a backpack.</p><p><strong>Hip belt:</strong> Positioned at the bottom of the pack, a hip belt wraps around your waist, just above your hips. A properly positioned hip belt helps shift the weight away from your shoulders making larger loads easier to carry.</p><p><strong>Sternum strap:</strong> A sternum strap crosses your chest and connects one shoulder strap to the other. It should sit just below your collarbone, and like the hip belt, it aids in weight distribution.</p><p><strong>Frame sheet:</strong> A frame sheet is sewn into the back panel of a backpack and helps the backpack maintain its shape once fully loaded. It may be contoured or padded for extra comfort and can also help with weight distribution.</p><p><strong>Load lifters:</strong> Load lifter straps help pull the top of your backpack closer to your shoulders. Not every pack has them, but if yours does, you'll find them coming over the top of the shoulder straps. Packs without them tend to fall away from your shoulders which adds strain.</p><p><strong>Suspension/harness system:</strong> Every entry above from shoulder straps to load lifters is part of your backpack's suspension or harness system. It's everything that contributes to how you carry your backpack and how the load's weight is distributed across your body.</p><p><strong>Compression straps:</strong> Compression straps can be located externally to help cinch down a packed backpack to make it smaller, or internally to help keep clothes in place if you haven't packed your backpack to capacity.</p>\n\tHow we test travel backpacks\n\t\n\t<p>In order to test travel backpacks, we first researched the major players in the market, searching for large-capacity, front-panel, back-panel, or clamshell backpacks that fully unzipped and opened flat like suitcases. From there, we received testing samples of our top nine choices.</p><p><strong>Packing and capacity: </strong>I tried to test backpacks with similar capacities, and most of them fell within the 35L to 40L range. A backpack with a 35L capacity was not disadvantaged for being unable to hold as much as a 40L-capacity backpack, but the configuration of pockets, compartments, and packing spaces played a key part in how easily each bag packs and how much it can hold.</p><p>I made a packing list for myself for the equivalent of a five-day trip: clothing, shoes, tech, and toiletries. I assessed how well I could fit all my essentials into the pack and how logically the compartments were placed. If I couldn't fit my full five-day haul into the pack, I noted how many days worth of gear at which the pack maxed out. The first things I ditched were extra shoes, but I always made room for toiletries and full outfits. I packed with the assumption that I would re-wear jeans, so if you plan to bring a new pair of pants for each day of your trip, the number of days worth of clothes you'll be able to pack will reduce dramatically.</p><p><strong>Carry-on capabilities:</strong> Many of these backpacks can quickly exceed airline carry-on size requirements, especially if you overpack them in a way that distorts their shape. Our top five picks all meet most airline carry-on requirements when fully packed, though there's no guarantee you'll get away with overstuffing them.</p><p><strong>Carry comfort</strong>: Because I tested these travel backpacks amidst the pandemic, I wasn't doing much actual traveling, so I did my best to simulate a travel experience. I fully packed each suitcase as outlined above, strapped the backpack onto my back, and walked around the block &#8212; half a mile &#8212; and up and down the stairs in my apartment building to test how comfortable the packs were to carry.</p><p><strong>Durability: </strong>To test durability, I pushed each fully packed backpack (sans my laptop) down a flight of stairs three times &#8212; forwards, backwards, and sideways. I noted any scuffs, scratches, tears, or broken hardware. I also tugged on the zippers in every direction to test their strength and how well they could withstand stress.</p><p><strong>Long-term testing</strong>: Though our initial testing period lasted roughly four months, we acknowledge that other issues could crop up with long-term use. We are continuing to test each of our top picks and we will update this guide with any issues we encounter.</p><h3>My five-day packing list:</h3><p>Socks x6<br />Underwear x6<br />Bras x2<br />Jeans

hours.</p><p><strong>Nagendra Raina</strong>: It's yoga for your mind.</p><p><strong>Narrator</strong>: And all 3 million puzzles in this factory could mean 45 million hours of staying busy. And that return on investment is why there's been a resurgence in puzzling among younger generations and people stuck at home during the pandemic.</p><p><strong>Nagendra</strong>: Category of jigsaw puzzles has grown at a rate of about 25% over the last five years. And Buffalo Games has shouldered 80% of those growth dollars.</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> That's Nagendra, the CEO of Buffalo Games, the largest puzzle maker in North America.</p><p><strong>Nagendra:</strong> We sell in over 30,000 locations across US and Canada, and we're selling to Walmart, Target, Amazon, Barnes and Noble, Kroger, and others.</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> But this whole process only got harder during the pandemic. Because puzzling wasn't considered an essential service, the New York state mandate closed this factory in March, and Nagendra had to furlough some manufacturing personnel.</p><p><strong>Nagendra:</strong> We were shut down for two excruciating months. Given our agility, given that we are a nimble business, we were able to modify some of our supply chain, and we started getting product from overseas.</p><p><strong>Narrator</strong>: But the team was able to continue designing puzzles from home. So when the Buffalo factory was given the green light to start manufacturing again...</p><p><strong>Nagendra:</strong> We were humming from day one.</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> Today, due to the coronavirus, Buffalo Games is facing the largest demand spike it's ever seen. The company went from selling 1 million to 2 million puzzles a month. So how do they make sure no tiny piece falls through the cracks?</p><p>Well, it all starts with the puzzle design. Buffalo Games has six full-time designers. Some of the puzzles start as sketches in-house, which are then digitized. For other puzzles, designers build upon famous works of art, like this one from artist Charles Wysocki. Here's the artist's original image.</p><p><strong>Rebecca Carden:</strong> So, if you move across, you can see some of the things that we've added. We've added this anchor. We've added a beautiful sailing ship in the background. We're definitely not trying to change the original intent that Wysocki had for his piece. What we're trying to do is create a more engaging puzzling experiencing and to give those puzzlers those incremental victories.</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> Once they've got a design, the team will print it out and overlay a cut pattern on top.</p><p><strong>John Bell:</strong> To see how the image is gonna break into individual pieces.</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> They're looking to make sure there's no, say, giant unsolvable sections of blue.</p><p><strong>John:</strong> You don't want to have an important element of the image cut off at the wrong spot.</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> And it's not an easy task.</p><p><strong>John:</strong> 1,000-piece puzzle, all 1,000 of those pieces would be unique. Our teams will look at each of those cuts just to make sure that it's got the right, the width and the angles to really give you that satisfying snap. You can actually pick up our puzzle, and the pieces will hold together when you complete it.</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> This team created 500 new puzzle designs in a matter of months to meet the demand during the pandemic.</p><p><strong>Nagendra:</strong> And that's about two to three times of what we would have done in a normal year.</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> Once a puzzle design is approved, it heads to manufacturing. Here, everything from 250-piece classic images to 2,000-piece \"Star Wars\" characters are cut up. The biggest puzzles can take about 30 hours to make, from an uncut image all the way to a finished puzzle.</p><p>First, that uncut puzzle image comes in from the printing company in Canada.</p><p><strong>David Rice</strong>: This is about a week's worth of puzzle board.</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> That puzzle image is glued to a cardboard backing so it's sturdy.</p><p><strong>David:</strong> The mounted images are put aside until the glue is fully cured, usually a few days, before they're forwarded on to the cutting presses.</p><p><strong>Narrator</strong>: Then it's time for the puzzle images to be cut.</p><p><strong>David</strong>: This is one of our cutting workstations. We take our puzzle mount images that are ready to be cut, they'll feed through the other side of the machine, get cut into 1,000 pieces. We trim away the scrap automatically.</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> That scrap is launched from this machine into a recycling bin. What's left are thousands of puzzle pieces. They get blown apart and dropped into an awaiting box underneath. That box is folded together on the other side of the factory.</p><p><strong>David:</strong> This cutter cuts boxboard into box planks, the main component of the puzzle boxes.</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> So, how does Buffalo Games make sure no piece gets lost?</p><p><strong>David:</strong> Each puzzle, after it's cut, goes through an automatic inspection system. Cameras are placed on the discharge of the cutting press to make sure every single piece has been cut clean and available for packaging. This is the finished puzzle on the discharge of the cutting press.</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> All of those puzzle boxes are sealed up, stacked, and packaged together.</p><p><strong>David:</strong> This machine is our automatic case packer. Automatically sorts the different images into the corrugated case, getting it ready for shipment.</p><p><strong>Narrator</strong>: Then they're sent across the street to the warehouse to await delivery.</p><p><strong>David:</strong> This is about 400,000 puzzles in the facility. That's a couple weeks' worth of shipments. These are put in our warehouse and then packed out to our customers. Health screen all people visiting and entering the facility. We had to make modifications to our production schedules. I also had to redesign a few work centers to maximize social distancing throughout the workplace.</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> Even with all the pivots, Buffalo Games couldn't work fast enough to meet the demand of millennials and pandemic puzzlers.</p><p><strong>David:</strong> With the increase in demand this year, we've been running the factory the full year, both before and after COVID, at 100% capacity.</p><p><strong>Nagendra:</strong> We wish we had the product, because we think the actual demand would have been about tenfold.</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> And even with a two-month shutdown, Nagendra says the company will still double its sales for 2020.</p><p><strong>Nagendra</strong>: As a result of COVID, we believe there's been a massive influx of new customers into the category. I'm talking about families that may have puzzled 10 years ago, but there are people that have never puzzled in their lives. But I think there's going to be a robust demand for these products for a long time to come.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

We've heard every excuse under the sun. Procrastination is a habit, and if you understand how it shows up for you, you can replace it with a better one.</p><p>Here are two clients' examples:</p><p>Brian called in to his weekly accountability call one morning exhausted and disappointed. He had gotten everything he committed to done. But he'd stayed up all night to do it. Although this habit worked well when he was single and doing contract work on his own schedule, now as a successful consultant, husband, and father, he was ready to make a change.&#160;</p><p>Our client Melinda is at the top of her game: accomplished, polished, and the CEO of a successful marketing company. While she would never claim the title of procrastinator, she had shiny object syndrome and couldn't finish a project without starting a new one.</p><p>How can highly-driven and accomplished people <em>still</em> be such procrastinators?&#160;</p><p>Let's be real: We can all fall into this trap. As accountability coaches we've learned that what works for Brian doesn't necessarily work for Melinda.&#160;</p><p>In our experience, everyone has a favorite avoidance archetype. The key to defeating delay is figuring out which group you fall into so you can break out of your holding pattern and get the project done <em>early</em>, for once.&#160;</p><p>Here's a breakdown of the procrastination personality types and how to retrain your brain to finally get <em>any </em>dreaded task done.</p><h2><strong>1. The performer who says, \"I work well under pressure\"</strong></h2><p>This procrastinator forces themselves to focus by shrinking the time they have to tackle a task. For many of our clients, the real reason behind this is perfectionism. If you're tight on time, there's no way the task can be done to your unreasonably high standards anyway, right? For others, the issue is simply falling back into old patterns and beliefs that we have about our 11th-hour saves. No matter what, being in the habit of putting pressure on yourself is not sustainable.</p><p><strong>Your biggest challenge:</strong> Getting started.</p><p><strong>Your solution</strong>: Flip the script and set a start date. When you focus on when you're going to begin a task — and not when you hope to end it — you'll take a tremendous amount of pressure off of yourself.</p><h2><strong>2. The self-deprecator who says, \"I am so lazy right now\"</strong><strong><br></strong></h2><p>This procrastinator is the opposite of lazy, so when they don't do something they are extra hard on themselves. We see this a lot with our male clients. They tend to blame inaction on laziness or stubbornness rather than admit they are tired. What they <em>really</em> need is to be more compassionate with themselves.&#160;</p><p><strong>Your biggest challenge:</strong> Taking a break. We already know you are going to say you don't have time to rest.&#160;</p><p><strong>Your solution:</strong> Recharge. Try taking a walk to give yourself space and to begin to rebuild your energy.&#160;</p><h2><strong>3. The overbooker who says, \"I'm so busy\"</strong></h2><p>This procrastinator is a pro at filling up their calendar and is often overwhelmed. \"I'm so busy\" is probably the excuse we hear most often. Interestingly, some of the busiest people we work with get the most done. When busy-ness comes up as an excuse for not doing something, it's usually an indication of avoidance. Rather than facing a challenge head on or admitting they don't want to do something, it's easier to place the blame on having other important things to do.&#160;</p><p><strong>Your biggest challenge:</strong> Creating chaos to avoid facing what you know you need to face right now (typically this is not a task).</p><p><strong>Your solution:</strong> Take a moment of introspection. Ask yourself: W<em>hat am I really avoiding?</em></p><h2><strong>4. The novelty seeker who says, \"I just had the best idea!\"</strong></h2><p>This procrastinator has a terminal case of Shiny Object Syndrome. They're constantly coming up with new projects to take on — and then getting bored with them a week later. They're intrigued by the latest trend and will be quick to implement but not follow through.&#160;</p><p>They are great at making decisions and taking action. However, they end up inadvertently losing a lot of time and burning out because they don't take consistent action in one direction long enough to see results. Many of our entrepreneurial clients fit into this category.&#160;</p><p><strong>Your biggest challenge:</strong> Completion.</p><p><strong>Your solution:</strong> Make it stick. Literally.

In 2020 alone, ecommerce is expected to grow by nearly 20%.</p><p>While the idea of launching an&#160;<a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/e-commerce\" data-ga-category=\"autotag-linking\" data-ga-label=\"ai-metadata\" data-ga-action=\"/topic/e-commerce\">ecommerce</a>&#160;<a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/business\" data-ga-category=\"autotag-linking\" data-ga-label=\"ai-metadata\" data-ga-action=\"/topic/business\">business</a>&#160;is exciting, there is a lot to consider. Following these five tips, you'll be able to optimize your customers'&#160;<a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/online-shopping\" data-ga-category=\"autotag-linking\" data-ga-label=\"ai-metadata\" data-ga-action=\"/topic/online-shopping\">online shopping</a> experience and, consequently, boost customer acquisition, retention, and conversion.&#160;</p><h2>Maximize user experience&#160;</h2><p>Maximize your resources on providing quality user experience (UX). With new features rolling out periodically on social and other platforms, consumers are creating new online buying habits. A constant UX maintenance is a must.</p><p>Getting customers to your store requires a lot of effort, and the customer journey must be seamless. Streamline user experience for all steps of customer journey.&#160;<a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/354111\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"follow\">Twenty-eight percent of customers</a>&#160;don't follow through the purchase when the checkout process is too long or confusing. Visit your store and click around as if it's your first time. Are your best sellers easy to access with just a few clicks? Conduct analyses on keyword search and pages. Which keywords bring customers to your store? What are the most visited pages? Quality UX will increase retention and conversion rates for your business.&#160;</p><h2>A picture is worth a thousand words</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/search-engine-optimization\" data-ga-category=\"autotag-linking\" data-ga-label=\"ai-metadata\" data-ga-action=\"/topic/search-engine-optimization\">Search engine optimization</a>&#160;(SEO) is crucial for any ecommerce operation. Often, what sets apart one seller from the other is a great cover photo, especially when your product or service is competitive on the e-commerce platform.</p><p>Product imagery is a big trend now that social channels offer in-app shopping features, such as <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/instagram\" data-ga-category=\"autotag-linking\" data-ga-label=\"ai-metadata\" data-ga-action=\"/topic/instagram\">Instagram</a>&#160;Shopping.&#160;<a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/pinterest\" data-ga-category=\"autotag-linking\" data-ga-label=\"ai-metadata\" data-ga-action=\"/topic/pinterest\">Pinterest</a>'s visual search tool allows consumers to find a product from a picture.&#160;</p><p>Businesses need product-only images for catalogs and product-related images for the website and&#160;<a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/marketing\" data-ga-category=\"autotag-linking\" data-ga-label=\"ai-metadata\" data-ga-action=\"/topic/marketing\">marketing</a>&#160;campaigns. These pictures are a great investment as you can use them across multiple&#160;<a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/sales\" data-ga-category=\"autotag-linking\" data-ga-label=\"ai-metadata\" data-ga-action=\"/topic/sales\">sales</a>&#160;channels. You could hire a professional or learn&#160;<a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/354875\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"follow\">ecommerce product photography</a>&#160;on your own. Whichever option you take, have some basic knowledge about the essential tools<strong>&#160;</strong>for product photography.</p><h2>Encourage social buying to diversify storefronts&#160;</h2><p>Since March, stay-at-home orders have been on the rise, and so has social buying. Consumers discuss products on forum sites and vouch for services to their social followers.</p><p>Connect with fans on social channels to encourage social buying and diversify your storefronts. Fans will discover your business and make a purchase on social, sometimes without even visiting your shop at all.&#160;</p><p>Social platforms are a great place to promote your brand. It's where new products and services are discovered daily. A healthy amount of social followers and search engine optimized contents will help your brand shine in the long run.</p><p>When delegating tasks, ensure a close collaboration between the marketing or PR team that manages social accounts and the&#160;<a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/customer-service\" data-ga-category=\"autotag-linking\" data-ga-label=\"ai-metadata\" data-ga-action=\"/topic/customer-service\">customer service</a> team. Streamline communications so that the questions, concerns, and complaints collected by the marketing team are addressed by the customer experience team.</p><h2>Get creative with cutting-edge technology&#160;</h2><p>Retailers could consider providing Augmented Reality (AR) based try-on tools.&#160;<a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/sephora\" data-ga-category=\"autotag-linking\" data-ga-label=\"ai-metadata\" data-ga-action=\"/topic/sephora\">Sephora</a>'s AR tool allows you to try on multiple shades of lipstick.&#160;<a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/ikea\" data-ga-category=\"autotag-linking\" data-ga-label=\"ai-metadata\" data-ga-action=\"/topic/ikea\">IKEA</a>&#160;lets you preview furniture in your space on your smartphone.</p><p>Virtual Reality (VR) store visits and&#160;<a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/qr-codes\" data-ga-category=\"autotag-linking\" data-ga-label=\"ai-metadata\" data-ga-action=\"/topic/qr-codes\">QR codes</a>&#160;are other options. When shipping products to customers, send along a QR code which introduces more about the product, such as product updates or customer-sourced content about your service.</p><h2>Create and build content for your business</h2><p>A good content marketing strategy will drive traffic, lower the cost of acquisition, and provide valuable evergreen content that will be read for years to come. Unlike pay per click search ads or display ads, creating quality content doesn't cost anything.

After all, you never know what sort of internal battles someone might be fighting.</p><p>Additionally, on the surface, some of the behaviors <a href=\"https://amymorinlcsw.com/mentally-strong-people-podcast/\">mentally strong people</a> exhibit might get confused for weakness, rather than strength. In fact, some of their choices might even seem counterintuitive at first glance. But here's the reason behind some of those choices they make.</p><h2><strong style=\"color: #000000;\">1. They alter their environment</strong></h2><p>When you see someone hide the candy dish at their desk, your first thought might be, \"They must not have any willpower.\" But the truth is, resources like willpower are in limited supply no matter how strong you are.</p><p>Mentally strong people want to reserve those resources for the most important battles in life. They set their lives up in a way that ensures they won't have to constantly fight temptation all day long.</p><p>Mental strength isn't about being able to tolerate pain and endure extreme discomfort without flinching. Instead, it's often about choosing which battles you want to fight.</p><h2><strong style=\"color: #000000;\">2. They carve out time to reflect</strong></h2><p>You might imagine a strong person doesn't need to take time to think — after all, they're busy doing important things.</p><p>But mentally strong people know their mindset matters. Whether they're reflecting on their mistakes so they can learn from them, or they're creating new career goals for themselves, they set aside time to think.</p><p>No matter how busy they are, they make time to reflect on their lives. In fact, the busier they are, the more time they may need to think about how to ensure their priorities are in line with their values.</p><h2><strong style=\"color: #000000;\">3. They quit</strong></h2><p>People who don't understand mental strength sometimes say things like, \"mentally strong people never give up.\" That's not true though.</p><p>People who are acting tough might finish a race on a broken ankle. But strong people know when to quit. They set aside their egos and throw in the towel quite often.</p><p>When they discover that the effort to reach a goal isn't in line with their values, they might abandon their goal. For example, if family's a top priority, they might quit a side hustle that interferes with family time.</p><p>Or, if they realize a goal is going to require 100% of their attention and that goal is third on the priority list, they might quit. Then, they have even more energy to focus on their main priorities and other goals.</p><p>They know they're strong enough to handle any criticism they might get for \"quitting\" and they are open-minded enough to change their opinions.</p><h2><strong style=\"color: #000000;\">4. They ask for help</strong></h2><p>Mentally strong people know they don't have all the answers. They aren't concerned with trying to prove to everyone that they're completely self-reliant all the time.</p><p>They ask for help when they need it. Whether that means going to therapy before work to ensure they're taking care of their mental health or it means asking a friend for some financial or job advice, they recognize that other people have skills, knowledge, and resources that can help them. And they don't feel insecure acknowledging that.</p><h2><strong style=\"color: #000000;\">5. They embrace their emotions</strong></h2><p>You might hear someone say something like, \"She's so strong. She didn't even cry at the funeral.\" But emotional suppression isn't a sign of strength. After all, it takes more strength to acknowledge and express your emotions than it does to mask them.</p><p>Mentally strong people embrace emotions — even the uncomfortable ones. They know it's okay to feel sad, angry, and scared. Rather than escape those emotions, they turn to healthy coping skills to manage them.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

The analyst, who has a reputation for reporting accurate details on upcoming Apple product launches, shared his findings in a research note reported by <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2020/10/19/iphone-12-preorders/\">9to5Mac</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/19/iphone-12-pre-orders-sales-exceed-iphone-11-top-analyst-says.html\">CNBC</a>, and <a href=\"https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/10/19/initial-iphone-12-and-iphone-12-pro-pre-order-results-best-iphone-11-kuo-says\">Apple Insider</a>.</p><p>Apple sold between 1.7 million and 2 million iPhone 12 units during the phone's first day of preorders on October 16, according to Kuo. The iPhone 11, by comparison, sold between 500,000 and 800,000 units in the same time period. Apple <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-stop-disclosing-iphone-ipad-mac-unit-sales-quarter-2018-11?r=UK\">stopped reporting iPhone sales numbers</a> in late 2018.&#160;</p><p>For the full weekend, however, Kuo predicted that iPhone 12 preorders fell slightly lower at around 9 million units compared to the iPhone 11's 12 million, as CNBC noted. But Apple is also launching the iPhone 12 in two new sizes next month.&#160;</p><p>Kuo also reported that the more premium iPhone 12 Pro model saw higher demand than expected. The iPhone 12 Pro, which starts at $1,000, comes with a few extra features not found on the standard iPhone 12, such as a telephoto camera lens, a LiDAR sensor for detecting depth, options for additional storage, and the ability to shoot portrait shots in Night Mode among other differences.&#160;</p><p>Preorders for the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro began on October 16, with general availability coming on October 23. The iPhone 12 Mini and iPhone 12 Pro Max are up for preorder starting November 6 and officially launch on November 13.</p><p>The iPhone 12, which Apple <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/watch-apple-event-october-live-blog-iphone-12-homepod-announcements-2020-10\">unveiled on October 13</a>, comes with a refreshed design with flat edges, support for 5G, an improved camera that should be better at taking photos in the dark, new color options, and a faster processor. Apple also launched a new magnetic MagSafe wireless charger for its new iPhone 12 lineup.&#160;</p><p>The iPhone 12 is expected to represent a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-iphone-12-release-most-important-product-launch-in-years-2020-10\">\"supercycle\" of upgrades for Apple,</a> which has grappled with slowing iPhone sales in recent years. The combination of 5G support, the notion that many active iPhones in use are now several years old, and new size options could incentivize consumers to upgrade, analysts have said.</p><p>Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives has previously said he expects the iPhone 12 launch to be the most significant iPhone launch cycle for Apple since the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus debuted in 2014.</p><p>Those phones, however, <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-receives-record-pre-orders-130255260.html\">reached 4 million in preorders</a> in their first 24 hours of availability, according to Kuo as 9to5Mac reports. But it's important to remember that the range of between 1.7 million and 2 million preorders that Kuo estimates for the iPhone 12 does not include the iPhone 12 Mini or iPhone 12 Pro Max.</p><p>When the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro went up for preorder on October 16, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/iphone-12-pre-order-error-reports-apple-t-mobile-verizon-2020-10\">some customers encountered errors</a> on the websites for Apple, Verizon, and T-Mobile, although it's unclear if those hiccups were the result of high demand or a separate issue.&#160;&#160;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-iphone-12-preorders-release-double-iphone-11-2020-10'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=M09Wg5oC3GQ:IOrZu3B56E4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=M09Wg5oC3GQ:IOrZu3B56E4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=M09Wg5oC3GQ:IOrZu3B56E4:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=M09Wg5oC3GQ:IOrZu3B56E4:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=M09Wg5oC3GQ:IOrZu3B56E4:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=M09Wg5oC3GQ:IOrZu3B56E4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=M09Wg5oC3GQ:IOrZu3B56E4:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=M09Wg5oC3GQ:IOrZu3B56E4:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/M09Wg5oC3GQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 15:34:59 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f8d9c999e9fe4001900a0ab?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"e86eec14a799b4e1a6b10845512da295","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn8@2020_3/2020/10/19/15-59-40-199_1dfbc9333ee1ff5d.webp","destWidth":1949,"destHeight":1462,"sourceBytes":41080,"destBytes":41080,"author":"leadicicco@businessinsider.com (Lisa Eadicicco)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5f85e24491aa9e001880b4fc?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn27@2020_3/2020/10/19/15-59-49-613_33c33925697c17ac.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn56@2020_5/2020/10/19/15-59-47-418_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=M09Wg5oC3GQ:IOrZu3B56E4:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn75@2020_1/2020/10/19/15-59-46-937_f23d5993031a931b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=M09Wg5oC3GQ:IOrZu3B56E4:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn95@2020_5/2020/10/19/15-59-43-171_a3099f4d6d7d69f3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn91@2020_5/2020/10/19/15-59-43-999_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=M09Wg5oC3GQ:IOrZu3B56E4:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn63@2020_3/2020/10/19/15-59-49-196_c590296fe7c5e31a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/M09Wg5oC3GQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn3@2020_3/2020/10/19/15-59-44-003_e33ff79dc049f5f7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603123145981},{"createdTime":"2020-10-19 23:59:05","updatedTime":"2020-10-19 23:59:05","title":"Republican Senator David Perdue faces off against Democrat Jon Ossoff in Georgia","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/georgia-senate-race-david-perdue-vs-jon-ossoff-polls-fundraising-2020-8","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5949f16be592ed34008b5cc4?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Jon Ossoff\" height=\"2074\" width=\"4149\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Democratic candidate for 6th Congressional District Jon Ossoff, left, concedes to Republican Karen Handel while joined by his fiancee Alisha Kramer at his election night party in Atlanta, Tuesday, June 20, 2017.\n<p class=\"copyright\">David Goldman/AP</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>Democrat<strong>&#160;Jon Ossoff</strong> will face Republican Sen<strong>.

David Perdue</strong> for the US Senate election in Georgia this November.&#160;&#160;</p><h2><strong>The candidates</strong></h2><p>Ossoff is an investigative journalist, business owner, and Georgia native. Before running for US Senate, he was the 2017 Democratic nominee for the high-profile special election in Georgia's 6th District, which he ultimately lost. Ossoff launched his US Senate campaign in September 2019, and cleared the competitive primary field to avoid a runoff for the nomination on June 9.</p><p>Ossoff's <a href=\"https://electjon.com/policy/\">campaign platform</a> emphasizes expanding access to affordable healthcare and protecting Social Security, combatting climate change and investing in green infrastructure, and supporting small businesses.&#160;</p><p>Perdue, <a href=\"https://perduesenate.com/meet-david/\">a wealthy businessman and consultant</a> who previously served as the CEO of Reebok and chair and CEO of Dollar General, was first elected in 2014, and is now running for a second term. In Congress, Perdue serves on the Committees on Armed Services, Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, Budget, and Foreign Relations.&#160;</p><p>While Perdue hasn't been as much of a firebrand as some other GOP Senators up for reelection this year, <a href=\"https://www.perdue.senate.gov/about/david\">his official Senate website</a> touts that he is an \"early supporter of President Donald J. Trump and continues to be one of the President's closest allies in the US Senate.\" He's voted in lockstep with Trump 95% of the time since 2017, <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-trump-score/david-perdue/\">according to FiveThirtyEight.&#160;</a></p><h2><strong>The stakes</strong></h2><p>In addition to winning back the White House, regaining control of the US Senate for the first time since 2015 is a top priority for Democrats and would be a major accomplishment towards either delivering on a future president Joe Biden's policy goals or thwarting President Donald Trump's second-term agenda.&#160;</p><p>Currently, the US Senate is made up of 53 Republicans, 45 Democrats, and two independents that caucus with Democrats, winning that Democrats need to win back a net total of four seats to have a 51-seat majority (if Biden wins, his vice president would also serve as president of the Senate and would be a tie-breaker vote).&#160;</p><p>And now, the US Senate is gearing up for a high-stakes confirmation battle to replace Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died at age 87 from pancreatic cancer on September 18. Within hours of her death, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky pledged that Trump's nominee for the high court <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/mcconnell-confirms-senate-will-vote-on-ruth-bader-ginsburg-replacement-2020-9\">would receive a vote on the floor of the Senate</a>, and Trump said the day after that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1307321159113936896\">he would name a replacement \"without delay.\"&#160;</a></p><p>Ginsburg's death threw a stick of dynamite into an already supercharged election shaped by a deadly pandemic that has so far claimed over 200,000 American lives, and a national reckoning around race after several high-profile deaths of Black Americans in encounters with police.&#160;</p><p>Trump and McConnell's posturing on the issue has excited conservatives enthusiastic about the possibility of Trump getting to appoint a third justice in his first term, but infuriated liberals <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/2020-elections/2020/09/mcconnell-hypocrisy-supreme-court-confirmation-ruth-bader-ginsburg/\">who accused McConnell of blatant hypocrisy </a>after he refused to hold confirmation proceedings for Obama's Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland in 2016, citing the upcoming presidential election. Senate Republicans held the seat open long enough for Trump to appoint his choice, Justice Neil Gorsuch, to the seat.&#160;</p><p>McConnell's quest to confirm a new justice before the end of Trump's first term puts the chamber on a collision course with the reelection hopes of many vulnerable Republican Senators, including Perdue.&#160;</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet blockquote\" data-lang=\"en\" data-cards=\"\" data-conversation=\"\">&#8212;Jon Ossoff  (@ossoff) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mims/statuses/1307847018237263873?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 21, 2020</a></blockquote><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><p>&#160;</p><p>While Georgia has been considered a safe Republican stronghold for decades, the tide in the state is shifting in Democrats' favor thanks to <a href=\"http://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/states-of-play-georgia/\">the fast-expanding Atlanta metro area.</a></p><p>The counties surrounding Atlanta, <a href=\"http://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/states-of-play-georgia/\">including Cobb and Gwinnett counties</a>, have been rapidly gaining population and trending towards Democrats in recent election cycles.

Trump now leads Democratic nominee Joe Biden by just 1.3 points on average in polls of the state, <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/georgia/\">according to FiveThirtyEight's polling averages.&#160;</a></p><p>Georgia has two US Senate elections in 2020. In addition to the Ossoff-Purdue race, Sen. <strong>Kelly Loeffler</strong> is running for a full term in a jungle special election where candidates from both parties compete on the same ballot and the top two advance to a runoff.

That it even happened at all is remarkable.</p><p>Military officials have long been accused of corruption but are rarely, if ever, prosecuted. It has been more than two decades since former general and anti-drug czar Jesús Gutiérrez Rebollo was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/18/world/another-mexican-general-is-arrested-and-charged-with-links-to-drug-cartel.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">arrested and later convicted</a> for colluding with high-profile cocaine traffickers like Amado Carrillo Fuentes, better known as the \"Lord of the Skies.\"</p><p>Cienfuegos' arrest also hits hard Mexico's armed forces, which became even more central to attacking organized crime groups when in 2006 then-President Felipe Calderón launched an official crackdown. The militarized approach has only ballooned in the ensuing so-called drug war.</p><p>Since then, more than 200,000 people have been killed in Mexico, and tens of thousands more have disappeared. The indictment suggests that while Cienfuegos was leading the institution at the heart of the fight against organized crime under the Peña Nieto administration, he was also allegedly colluding with the very criminals he pledged to root out.</p><p>Indeed, Cienfuegos' arrest further upends any notion of a \"war,\" in which the state is on one side and criminal groups on the other. In reality, these actors are much more intertwined, maintaining order and driving violence as a means to regulate conditions that are mutually beneficial.</p><p>The United States has much to answer for as well. With the arrest of García Luna and now Cienfuegos, it has become increasingly clear that US security and government officials frequently work with counterparts deeply involved in the drug trade. The question now is what was known and when. Speculation about high-level corruption has swirled for decades, especially during the Calderón administration's tenure from 2006 to 2012.</p><p>\"There were a number of red flags when Cienfuegos was a general, and when he was named defense minister in 2012, I had heard rumors about his corruption,\" Mike Vigil, the DEA's former Chief of International Operations, told InSight Crime.</p><p>This is far from the first time Cienfuegos has been at the center of controversy. In 2015, the former army chief <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/mbn7an/soldiers-wont-be-treated-like-criminals-in-ayotzinapa-case-mexico-army-chief-says\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">infamously said</a> that his soldiers \"won't be treated like criminals\" in relation to the forced disappearance of 43 students from the Ayotzinapa Normal School. Last month, authorities <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-human-rights-ayotzinapa/arrest-warrants-issued-against-mexican-military-members-in-2014-student-disappearances-idUSKBN26H0RP\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">issued arrest warrants</a> for the alleged material and intellectual authors of the crime, including members of the military.</p><p>In 2014, Cienfuegos also <a href=\"https://english.elpais.com/elpais/2015/02/20/inenglish/1424442625_945153.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">rejected accusations</a> that his troops were culpable in the so-called <a href=\"https://www.insightcrime.org/news/brief/mexican-govt-confirms-massacre-army-tlatlaya/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tlatlaya massacre, </a>when soldiers killed 22 people in what was described as a \"shootout.\" In reality, the soldiers received a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/03/mexican-soldiers-ordered-to-kill-in-san-pedro-limon-claim-rights-activists\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">direct order to kill</a>, according to <a href=\"https://www.wola.org/2015/07/in-mexicos-tlatlaya-massacre-soldiers-were-ordered-to-take-them-out/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">human rights activists</a>.</p><p>Cienfuegos' arrest also adds to the list of Mexican officials to be charged in the United States and not at home. As a result, he won't be held to account for some of the <a href=\"https://aristeguinoticias.com/0902/mexico/rigor-y-contundencia-ante-violaciones-a-derechos-humanos-por-militares-cienfuegos/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">grave human rights abuses</a> he is accused of overseeing as a general in Mexico.</p><p>What's more, the military continues to be one of Mexico's <a href=\"https://www.inegi.org.mx/contenidos/programas/ensu/doc/ensu2020_marzo_presentacion_ejecutiva.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">most trusted institutions</a> and a mainstay of domestic security. A <a href=\"https://www.dof.gob.mx/nota_detalle.php?codigo=5593105&fecha=11/05/20202020\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">May decree</a> signed earlier this year solidified its place in combatting crime groups for the foreseeable future. The United States also <a href=\"https://www.insightcrime.org/news/brief/us-mexico-hardline-drug-approach/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">recently urged</a> Mexico to crack down harder, demanding the Mexican government demonstrate its \"commitment to dismantling the cartels and their criminal enterprises.\"</p><p>This all but guarantees that the armed forces will remain on the frontlines, despite the latest headlines.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

election result,\" a Goldman team led by chief economist Jan Hatzius wrote on Monday. \"Fiscal policy differences between Republicans and Democrats in the Senate are greater than differences between

return policy: \"We are confident that you will feel great about your new vehicle, and so are giving you time to experience and enjoy your new Tesla,\" it said, \"if you are unhappy with your vehicle, you may return it to us within seven (7) calendar days.\"</p><p>\"This return policy is intended to give you confidence in your purchase of a Tesla vehicle, and so is&#160;<em>in addition</em> to any other rights you may have under applicable law,\" the site said, <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200930043628/https://www.tesla.com/en_IE/support/tesla-return-policy\">according to website screen captures archived online.</a></p><p>That page now re-directs to a <a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/support\">generic support page</a> with information about plenty of Tesla vehicles, services, and topics — but nothing about a return policy.</p><p>Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. The blog Electrek <a href=\"https://electrek.co/2020/10/16/tesla-cancels-ballsy-no-question-asked-7-day-return-policy/\">first spotted the change</a>, and reported that sources had told it the policy was no longer available.</p><p>As recently as April, CEO Elon Musk discussed the policy on Twitter. He's frequently touted the rule as a selling point in recent years.</p><p>\"You may return the vehicle for a full refund in the unlikely event that it causes domestic discord,\" he told a potential Cybertruck customer.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet blockquote\" data-lang=\"en\" data-cards=\"\" data-conversation=\"none\">&#8212;Elon Musk  (@elonmusk) <a

But pension funds and professionals usually get there first, leaving \"retail investors,\" as Wall Street calls them, typically picking up the post-offering breadcrumbs — and often paying a higher price.</p><p>But a back-door, formerly out-of-favor IPO approach known as a SPAC has recently roared back in popularity among entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. It may offer a new opportunity for small investors to get in on the action at the beginning.</p><h2>What is a SPAC?</h2><p>SPAC is an acronym for a Special Purpose Acquisition Company, basically a publicly traded firm that has no operations, no assets — other than a war chest of cash — and just one stated business plan: to eventually buy another company.</p><p>A SPAC is generally formed by a group of investors, called sponsors, with a strong background in a particular industry or business sector. They raise funds from other investors, and use the money to acquire an existing, privately held company — and then take it public in an IPO.</p><p>When they launch the SPAC, the sponsors generally either don't have a specific target in mind, or they're not ready to name it in order to avoid the extensive paperwork and disclosures required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p><p>The early-bird underwriters and institutional investors, and the individual investors who generally come in later, typically have no idea exactly how the sponsors will spend the money. So early investors are basically relying on the sponsors' reputation in the hope of snagging a good investment.</p><p>But they've got to be prepared to wait. Even after a SPAC goes public, it can take up to two years to pick and announce the target company it wants to acquire, or technically speaking, merge with (the corporate charter specifies the exact time frame, per SEC regulations). If it doesn't, the SPAC is liquidated, and funds it's raised are supposed to be returned to investors.</p><p>All this uncertainty is one reason why most SPACs trade at only $10 a share. Of course, the assumption is that when, and if, they acquire a company and take it public, the share prices will soar. At this point, investors can cash out, or hold on for longer-term gains.</p><h2>How SPACs work&#160;</h2><p>If the SPAC set-up sounds like a situation ripe for abuse — it once was. Back in the 1980s, a lot of fraud surrounded these blank check companies, as they were then known. Many were purely shell companies, offering thinly traded<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-are-penny-stocks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> penny stocks</a> or \"pink sheets.\" Often these firms either absconded with investors' cash or engaged in overvalued insider deals that left many investors with a bagful of nothing.</p><p>Since then, however, the metamorphosis from blank check company to SPAC has involved more than just a name change. The SEC has tightened regulations and procedures for these ventures.</p><p>Now, for example, a SPAC generally has to place the investor money in a trust or escrow account to keep it secure until the target company is publicly announced. At that point, if investors don't like the looks of the deal, they should be able to recover their funds.</p><p>SPACs also have to register with the SEC, even if they're relatively small (which in the IPO universe means assets under $1 million).</p></li></ul><div class=\"insider-raw-embed\"><iframe title=\"SPACs are soaring in numbers and size\" aria-label=\"Grouped Bars\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-SDcem\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/SDcem/4/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% ; border: none;\" height=\"630\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}}))}();</script></div><h2>SPAC Pros and Cons</h2><p>Like any investment, SPACs have advantages and disadvantages.</p><h3>Advantages of SPACs</h3><ul><li><strong>They're cheap</strong>. Many SPACs are priced at $10 a share, well within reach of retail investors. And they stay low for a while. \"SPAC IPOs on average don't jump on the first day of trading,\" notes Jay R. Ritter, the Joseph B. Cordell Eminent Scholar Chair at the University of Florida's Warrington College of Business, who researches IPOs. \"The average increase this year on the first day of trading has been 1.7%, so buying in the market might mean paying $10.17 or so.\"</li><li><strong>They invest in hot areas.</strong> The new breed of SPACs focuses on sexy sectors in the tech or consumer fields. Promising startups like <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/chamath-palihapitiya-spac-buys-opendoor-quiet-period-2020-9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Opendoor</a>, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/clover-health-spac-plans-and-growth-projections-for-medicare-2020-10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Clover Health</a>, and electric automaker Nikola are among the firms that have gone public via SPACs.</li><li><strong>They're open to individual investors</strong>. Even though institutional investors usually go to the front of the line for SPAC offerings, the high number of shares sold makes it easier for smaller investors to get a piece of the action.<strong style=\"color: #222222;\">&#160;</strong></li></ul><h3>Disadvantages of SPACs</h3><ul><li><strong>Blind investment.</strong> SPAC investors usually don't know how their money will be used — what the SPAC's target company is (often the sponsors don't know either). So the deal's impossible to evaluate.</li><li><strong>Lag time.</strong> There can be a long lag between the time investors pump money into a SPAC and when it actually buys up a company and starts operations. Your money may sit for up to two years in an escrow account. If no acquisition happens, your funds are returned, but idling capital for that long may be painful.</li><li><strong>Mixed track record</strong>. In a July 2020 report, Goldman Sachs analyzed the performance of 56 SPACs — primarily in the technology, industrials, energy, and financial segments, — that \"merged\" with their target companies beginning in January 2018. \"During the one-month and three-month periods following the acquisition announcement, the average SPAC outperformed the S&#38;P 500 by 1 percentage point (pp) and 11 pp, respectively, and beat the Russell 2000 by 6 pp and 15 pp, respectively,\" the report notes. \"However, the average SPAC underperformed both indexes during the 3, 6, and 12-months after the merger completion.\"</li></ul><p>Of course, some SPACs do better than that. For example, <strong>Virgin Galactic Holdings </strong>(<a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/spce-stock\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SPCE</a>) — a particularly high-profile offering — has appreciated 146% in the year since it went public via a SPAC in October 2019.&#160;</p><h2>Why SPACS are becoming popular</h2><p>SPACs embarked on their newly respectable road in the mid-2010s. Big-name entrepreneurs, hedge-fund managers, and celebrities like Richard Branson, Bill Ackerman, and Michael Jordan became involved in them, as did mutual fund companies like Fidelity and T. Rowe Price, and investment banks like Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse, and Goldman Sachs.</p><p>Their numbers swelled in 2020. As of early October 2020, SPACs have launched 128 IPOs, raising a total of $49.1 billion, according to SPAC Research, which gathers data on SPACs. That's up from 2019 when just 59 SPACs raised a total of $13.6 billion.</p><p>Certainly, the COVID-19 pandemic has been a factor. SPACs tend to<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/spac-blank-check-companies-explained-2020-5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> fare better in periods of stock market decline</a> because of the way they work.&#160;</p><p>Also, compared to a traditional IPO, SPACs offer certain advantages to sponsor-organizers and to the companies who want to go public. One is the streamlined disclosure requirements that save time, money, and trees.</p><p>SPAC IPOs are further turbocharged because there are fewer people involved. A traditional IPO involves \"multiple investors negotiating with issuers and underwriters simultaneously, about specific terms like the offering price, executive compensation, underwriter rights, and multiple other issues,\" says Tyler Gellasch, executive director of Healthy Markets Association, a nonprofit, investor educational coalition. \"But in a SPAC, it's often just the sponsor and the target company at the table.\"</p><p>So deals can move faster.</p><h2>How to invest in SPACS</h2><p>Getting into a SPAC is not as simple as buying regular equities: Hedge funds, mutual funds, and other deep-pocketed institutional investors typically find out about a new SPAC first. \"It helps if a would-be investor has an existing relationship with a SPAC sponsor,\" says Tyler Gellasch.&#160;</p><p>But if Michael Jordan isn't among your contacts, there are other ways to break into the world of SPACs:</p><ul><li>Your friendly stockbroker or wealth manager. Ask them to keep an eye out for offerings</li><li>&#160;The websites of IPO-oriented investment banks. One SPAC specialist, <a href=\"https://www.earlybirdcapital.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Early Bird Capital</a>, lists companies that are actively seeking targets.</li><li>&#160;The NASDAQ website also lists upcoming IPOs, including SPACs, which can be identified by a ticker symbol that generally ends with a \"U.\"</li><li>&#160;Industry associations like SPAC Research sometimes highlight S-1 filings, which give formal notice of a SPAC's intention to go public.&#160;</li></ul><h2>The financial takeaway</h2><p>A SPAC is definitely not \"a 'widows and orphans' investment,\" according to Gellasch. \"For one thing, you may be tying up your money for a year or more without knowing what the ultimate investment will be. The sponsor and institutional investors may know — at least generally — what they're looking to do with the funds, but the small investor will likely be in the dark.\"</p><p>\"Until a deal is announced, the investor is just hoping that a good merger will happen,\" Ritter adds. And of course, there are no guarantees as to returns after it does. SPACs are speculative animals. They tend to acquire growth companies — start-ups and fledgling firms — which, by their nature, are higher-risk than, say, established <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-are-blue-chip-stocks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">blue-chip</a> companies.</p><p>Still, SPACs offer smaller investors a way to get into the IPO game — if not up in front with the big players, at least not too far behind them.</p><h2>Related Coverage in&#160;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/investing-reference\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"100\">Investing</a>:</h2><ul class=\"read-more-links\"><li><h3><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/top-spac-underwriters-law-firms-investors-blank-check-volume-fees-2020-9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"100\">Meet 16 bankers, lawyers, and capital providers helping engineer a $40 billion blank-check craze that's fast-tracking companies to public markets</a></h3></li><li><h3><a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/ipos-top-largest-initial-public-offerings-all-time-ranked-cash-2020-7-1029373999\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Here are the 11 largest IPOs of all time</a></h3></li><li><h3><a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/spac-etf-first-blank-check-begins-trading-stock-market-nyse-2020-10-1029640817\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">First blank-check ETF begins trading as SPAC euphoria continues</a></h3></li><li><h3><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/biggest-companies-to-go-public-through-a-spac-2020-10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Going public through a SPAC isn't just for the unsexy startups anymore.

rel=\"noopener\">the best smart speakers</a> around, not necessarily because of its high-end audio, but because of how intelligent Google Assistant is. But, despite its smarts, the Home is also an aging product. First launched in 2016, the speaker can't help but feel a little stale in 2020.</p><p>With that in mind, there's finally a refresh, and it represents Google's renewed attempt to offer a better audio experience to go along with its already impressive digital assistant.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1721072491310276872\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow nofollow noopener sponsored sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Google Nest Audio</a> offers a totally different design compared to the Google Home. Perhaps most important is that under the hood the speaker now features a 75mm woofer and a 19mm tweeter, instead of the Home's single full-range driver — and all at only $100.</p><p>But how does the speaker actually perform? Is this really a worthy upgrade that can match Amazon's Echo? We've been testing the Google Nest Audio for a while now to find out.</p><h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f8d93da9e9fe4001900a046?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Google nest audio 2\" height=\"843\" width=\"1125\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Christian de Looper/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>The <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1721072491310276872\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Nest Audio</a> represents a major design shift from the older Google Home smart speaker. It fits in style with the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/google-nest-mini-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Nest Mini</a>, with an all fabric exterior, and a relatively friendly appearance that should look good in most environments. Even better is the fact that it's available in five colors – including Chalk, Charcoal, Sage, Sand, and Sky. We're reviewing the Sage model, but safe to say, there should be something for everyone. And, no matter which color you go for, they're all pretty subtle.&#160;</p><p>The speaker measures a little less than seven inches tall and a little less than five inches wide, and as a result, it's small enough to sit on a table, nightstand, or shelf, without drawing too much attention to itself. It's not battery powered — so you will need to place it relatively close to a power outlet.&#160;</p><p>According to Google, the enclosure of the speaker is made from 70% recycled plastic, which is a nice touch. Tech companies in general are starting to take their environmental impact more seriously, and while they have a <em>long</em> way to go, making their devices from recycled materials is one step in the right direction.</p><p>Google has also been taking privacy a little more seriously, and that shows with the <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1721072491310276872\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Nest Audio</a>. There's now a physical microphone mute switch on the back of the speaker — so if you don't want to feel like it's always listening, you can move that switch to the off position.</p><p>Capacitive touch controls are found on the top, though you wouldn't know that just by looking at the speaker. You can tap the two top corners to control volume, while the top middle of the device is where you can play or pause your music. On the front of the speaker, there are four LED lights that activate when the Assistant is in use.&#160;</p><p>Generally speaking, the <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1721072491310276872\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Nest Audio</a> is an attractive speaker, and I appreciate the move towards a simpler, friendlier design compared to the previous model.&#160;</p><h2>Specs</h2><ul><li><strong>Dimensions: </strong>6.89 x 4.89 x 3.07 inches</li><li><strong>Colors: </strong>Chalk, Charcoal, Sage, Sand, Sky</li><li><strong>Connectivity: </strong>802.11/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.0</li><li><strong>Speakers: </strong>75mm woofer, 19mm tweeter</li><li><strong>Microphones:</strong> Three far-field microphones</li><li><strong>Smart Assistant: </strong>Google Assistant</li><li><strong>Controls: </strong>Capacitive touch sensors</li><li><strong>Processor: </strong>Quad core A53 1.8GHz</li></ul><h2>Setup and Assistant performance</h2><p>Getting the <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1721072491310276872\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Nest Audio</a> up and running is incredibly easy with the Google Home app. Once you plug the speaker in and open the Home app, you'll be guided through the setup process. The exact process will vary a little depending on whether or not you've got other Google Assistant devices but, at most, you'll have to sign into your account, record a few sentences for the voice match system, and so on.&#160;</p><p>The setup process also involves linking the speaker to your music streaming service of choice. Currently, you're limited to YouTube Music, Google Play Music, Spotify, Deezer, and Pandora. To be fair, that should encompass the vast majority of Google Assistant fans anyway, since few Google users also have Apple Music, but it would at least be nice to be able to link Amazon Music to your account without having to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/can-google-home-play-amazon-music\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">rely on casting</a>.&#160;</p><p>Google Assistant on the <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1721072491310276872\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Nest Audio</a> is just as powerful as it always has been. You can use the speaker to control smart home devices, find out information from the web and, as mentioned, play and control music. New for this model, however, is a machine learning chip that Google says will make for faster Assistant responses and some local processing.</p><p>In practice, Google Assistant on the Nest Audio is very responsive, with similar performance as the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/google-nest-mini-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nest Mini</a>. This reliable speed particularly comes into play with voice commands for things like playing and pausing music, changing volume, and so on.&#160;</p><h2>Audio quality</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f8d940ac21cfb0019468b3e?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Google nest audio 3\" height=\"843\" width=\"1125\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The Google Nest Audio (left) pictured with the Google Nest Mini (right).\n<p class=\"copyright\">Christian de Looper/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Google is leaning heavily into audio quality for the <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1721072491310276872\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Nest Audio</a> and, for the most part, the device offers a full-bodied experience that the majority of buyers will love. This is partly thanks to the fact that the speaker has a separate woofer, for low frequencies, and tweeter, for high frequencies, meaning that it can better represent a full range of sound.</p><p>In other words, bass is relatively heavy and strong, though the fact that this is such a small and compact speaker does limit just how deep the low-end can go. Still, most will appreciate the punchy kick drums and smooth bass tones.&#160;</p><p>The speaker especially excels at offering a good amount of clarity and detail for a model in this price range. This means that you'll be able to clearly hear cymbals and percussion, and that there's a good amount of separation between instruments in music. The speaker can get pretty loud for a device its size, and there's little distortion to speak of, which is always good to hear.&#160;</p><p>The \"smart\" part of this smart speaker doesn't just relate to its Google Assistant functions. It also has to do with how the speaker processes audio. The tip of the iceberg is the fact that you can pair two Nest Audio speakers for stereo playback. We only have one for testing, however, so we haven't been able to try this option out ourselves.&#160;</p><p>But, the speaker goes a lot further than that. According to Google, the <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1721072491310276872\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Nest Audio</a> was tested in thousands of different situations to better tune the speaker for playback in varied environments and placements. This work is all done under the hood, but safe to say the speaker does offer a relatively natural audio response, even in a corner, where bass would traditionally be amplified.&#160;</p><p>Other smart features include Google's Ambient EQ feature, which allows the device to automatically adjust its volume depending on its environment, and a new Media EQ feature, which allows it to automatically tune itself depending on the style of music that you're listening to. As a result, this is one of the smarter smart speakers on the market, whether or not you actually want or will use features like this.&#160;</p><h2>Problems with the Nest Audio</h2><p>The <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1721072491310276872\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Nest Audio</a> offers incredible value for its price, coming in at only $100 — and that's before any deals or specials that are likely to come up. But it's not <em>perfect</em>.&#160;</p><p>As mentioned, the compact size is nice, but the result is that it can't <em>quite</em> get as deep as we would like. Still, most will be perfectly fine with the bass performance it offers.</p><p>The only other issues, at least when comparing this speaker to the competition from Amazon, are that it doesn't have a 3.5mm port for connecting to an external speaker, or any smart home hub features, like Zigbee connectivity. That latter omission means that you're a bit more limited in the smart home devices that you can connect to your Google account. We would have liked to see Google adopt these features since they will be integrated in the new fourth-generation Echo.</p><h2>The bottom line</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f74d67d0ab50d00184ad622?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Google Nest Audio\" height=\"500\" width=\"1000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Google</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Despite the fact that the <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1721072491310276872\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Nest Audio</a> doesn't have the same connected home features on offer as other smart speakers, the device is a hit. That's especially true given its price range. At $100, you'd be hard-pressed to find a more well-rounded Google Assistant smart speaker. If you're looking for a new speaker in Google's ecosystem, this is the one to get.</p><h3>What are your alternatives?</h3><p>The <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1721072491310276872\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Nest Audio</a> does face some stiff competition. Amazon's upcoming fourth-generation Echo could be an especially tempting alternative. The new <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07XKF5RM3/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B07XKF5RM3&linkCode=as2&tag=biip_101620_nest-audio-review-20&linkId=88276691eb3c1a97cc4b0e37affd7d50eb3c1a97cc4b0e37affd7d50\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Echo</a> is also $100 and will come with Zigbee connectivity and a 3.5mm port. We'll have to wait and see how it performs but, ultimately, most buyers will end up picking whichever model fits the smart home ecosystem they're already in.&#160;</p><p>There's also the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07NJQFL4X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B07NJQFL4X&linkCode=as2&tag=biip_101620_nest-audio-review-20&linkId=ba4995ddc3b04a009cab934e4bfdd846c3b04a009cab934e4bfdd846\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Sonos One</a> to consider, which is pretty different from the <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1721072491310276872\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Nest Audio</a>. Despite the Nest Audio's excellent audio chops, the Sonos One still sounds more natural and has better bass response. That said, the Nest Audio offers more smart features, and Google Assistant responds to prompts quite a bit faster on the Nest Audio compared to the Sonos One. You'll have to decide what's more important to you, though given the Sonos One is twice the price of the Nest Audio, most people should save their cash.&#160;&#160;</p><p>If you want a smart speaker that's a solid, all-around speaker for listening to music and controlling Google alike, the <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/1721072491310276872\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Nest Audio</a> is absolutely the way to go.</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Friendly design, good audio quality, fast Google Assistant performance, reliable smart features</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Bass response could be a little deeper, no smart home hub integration, doesn't include a USB-C port or 3.5 mm jack</p><div id=\"ProductCard_5f74e95ebe509c36a745efed\" style=\"position:relative; display:block; width: 100%\"><iframe src=\"https://produktor.businessinsider.com/productCardService?id=5f74e95ebe509c36a745efed&type=button&live=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"150%\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" style=\"position:absolute; top:0; left: 0\"></iframe></div><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/google-nest-audio-smart-speaker-review'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=eY9UgI3uOyE:cE-_9IbM55c:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=eY9UgI3uOyE:cE-_9IbM55c:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=eY9UgI3uOyE:cE-_9IbM55c:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=eY9UgI3uOyE:cE-_9IbM55c:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=eY9UgI3uOyE:cE-_9IbM55c:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=eY9UgI3uOyE:cE-_9IbM55c:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=eY9UgI3uOyE:cE-_9IbM55c:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=eY9UgI3uOyE:cE-_9IbM55c:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/eY9UgI3uOyE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 15:13:55 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f8d9360c21cfb0019468b3b?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"cf924d6948a0882768893a2a48fb5914","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn64@2020_5/2020/10/19/15-59-22-637_b317d93036a42563.webp","destWidth":1125,"destHeight":843,"sourceBytes":87638,"destBytes":87638,"author":"insider@insider.com (Christian de Looper)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5f8d9360c21cfb0019468b3b?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn64@2020_5/2020/10/19/15-59-22-637_b317d93036a42563.webp","https://i.insider.com/5f8d93da9e9fe4001900a046?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn4@2020_3/2020/10/19/15-59-49-405_2c1f3ac0697bcf79.webp","https://i.insider.com/5f8d940ac21cfb0019468b3e?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn16@2020_6/2020/10/19/15-59-47-949_e0e9c63900fa0c95.webp","https://i.insider.com/5f74d67d0ab50d00184ad622?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn55@2020_3/2020/10/19/15-59-46-674_d94ba60c794600cd.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn56@2020_5/2020/10/19/15-59-47-418_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=eY9UgI3uOyE:cE-_9IbM55c:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn28@2020_6/2020/10/19/15-59-41-140_0e1ee3aadde85114.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=eY9UgI3uOyE:cE-_9IbM55c:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn47@2020_1/2020/10/19/15-59-46-563_3c2a5234919908b1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn91@2020_5/2020/10/19/15-59-43-999_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=eY9UgI3uOyE:cE-_9IbM55c:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn63@2020_6/2020/10/19/15-59-41-534_574aee6498df82f0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/eY9UgI3uOyE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn32@2020_2/2020/10/19/15-59-41-176_fcd63f0ddf86c0c6.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603123145993},{"createdTime":"2020-10-19 23:59:06","updatedTime":"2020-10-19 23:59:06","title":"The pandemic has changed how the wealthy buy planes amid a boom of first-time buyers.

Private aircraft operators are rejoicing as it means more flights for their fleets but an even smaller segment of wealthy flyers are viewing the pandemic as a reason to make the jump into aircraft ownership.</p><p>Acquiring an aircraft comes with unique perks such as unrestricted aircraft availability but comes at a substantially higher cost. Industry veterans say buying an aircraft shouldn't be considered unless a person is spending $500,000 or more on private charter each year.&#160;</p><p>Purchasing an aircraft, unlike buying a car, is an intimate process not only because of the financial commitment but largely due to the fact that an aircraft often serves as a home away from home. Textron Aviation's Senior Vice President of Sales and Flight Operations, Rob Scholl, told Business Insider that his salespeople will travel to prospective buyers and get a sense of their flying needs before recommending an aircraft.&#160;</p><p>Manufacturers like Textron Aviation and aircraft sales firms are once again seeing normal transaction levels but the pandemic has changed the buying process. The cancellation of air shows and industry networking events is making it difficult for firms to get their aircraft in front of potential buyers and travel restrictions are delaying the process when it comes time to close.</p><p>Here's how they're navigating the pandemic to close deals.</p><h2>The right time to buy</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f5a9cf5e6ff30001d4e834d?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Gulfstream G650ER\" height=\"1334\" width=\"1778\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A Gulfstream G650ER private jet aircraft.\n<p class=\"copyright\">REUTERS/Aly Song</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>The immediate aftermath of the pandemic saw aircraft values drop as global travel restrictions largely hindered where people could fly. In some countries, citizens couldn't travel between states, let alone to the other side of the world on a vacation.</p><p>It's created a buyer's market for potential aircraft owners and encouraging the wealthy to purchase aircraft in preparation for when the borders do open.&#160;</p><p>\"There has been some price depreciation since COVID,\" Chad Anderson, president of aircraft sales and acquisition firm Jetcraft, told Business Insider. \"And depending on the model of aircraft, you're looking at probably 10% to 15%, maybe 20% on an older product.\"&#160;</p><p>As the pandemic enters its sixth month and travel restrictions begin to ease, prices are likely the lowest they'll get with Anderson saying the demand is catching up to the supply. Not only is Jetcraft seeing greater than normal number of transactions for this time of year – a typically slow season for aircraft sales – but charter operators are seeing an uptick in their business, indicating a desire to travel.</p><p>\"The best signal we have is that charter market,\" Anderson said. \"When charter market starts to return to business, that's a very healthy, starting point for us\"</p><p>International travel restrictions have not stopped sales for ultra-long-haul aircraft as the pandemic has incurred&#160;pent up demand for cross-border travel. Customers want to be able to jet off to distant locales now more than ever and are making their purchases now so that they don't have to wait even longer for the right aircraft once restrictions do lift.&#160;</p><p>Long-range aircraft from Gulfstream, Dassault, Bombardier are still as popular as ever since they can fly further without stopping compared to smaller jets.&#160;</p><h2>Bringing the plane to the buyer</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f5a9cafe6ff30001d4e8349?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Dassault Falcon 7X\" height=\"1665\" width=\"2221\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A Dassault Falcon 7X private jet aircraft.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Fasttailwind / Shutterstock.com</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Pre-pandemic buyers often journey to the aircraft they're seeking to purchase. Though it may seem counterintuitive since the latter is built to travel, flying an aircraft to a customer can negatively impact its value since it incurs more hours on the aircraft, similar to adding miles on a car.</p><p>But travel restrictions have forced sales firms to adapt and bring the product directly to the passengers, at a costly rate. \"We're spending a lot of time and money with airplanes on the road right now,\" said Anderson.</p><p>With even a half-hour flight costing thousands of dollars, firms have to be strategic with to whom they bring the plane for a showing. And much like charter operators, Jetcraft is investing in disinfectants like MicroShield 360 so potential buyers feel comfortable when touring an aircraft.&#160;</p><p>Textron Aviation uses demonstrations flights as a selling point for its buyers, including owners who are also pilots, and has had to revise its procedure for each flight to ensure a safe experience. Personal protective equipment is available to passengers and aircraft are sanitized before and after every flight, Scholl said.&#160;&#160;</p><p>Salespeople are also changing their pitches by familiarizing themselves with the safety features of an aircraft rather than just the onboard luxuries or cost benefits for some owners that come with flying private.&#160;</p><p>\"It was very interesting about how quickly my sales team learned about how quickly the air circulates, how often it's refreshed, and where specifically it goes through the airplane,\" Scholl said, noting that it takes two minutes for the air to recycle on all of Textron's aircraft.&#160;</p><h2>Navigating lockdowns when it's time to buy</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f5a9c9ee6ff30001d4e8347?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Cessna Citation CJ3\" height=\"1666\" width=\"2222\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A Textron Aviation Cessna Citation CJ3 private jet aircraft.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Mike Fuchslocher / Shutterstock.com</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Both Jetcraft and Textron Aviation have multiple international offices so navigating travel restrictions isn't difficult for salespeople and flight crews, the latter of which are normally exempt from most restrictions, but closing the deal can often be a more time-intensive process.&#160;</p><p>A recent Jetcraft transaction in Europe required the company to convince authorities to open airports that had been closed, waive quarantine restrictions for flight crews, and circumvent international travel restrictions to access a plane at Geneva Airport.</p><p>\"You just have to find a way,\" Pascal Bachmann, Jetcraft's senior vice president of sales in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia, told Business Insider.</p><p>It's often not impossible to close the deals but clearing each new obstacle that the pandemic has put in the way of international commerce often takes longer for deals to be completed. And it's not for lack of cooperation as authorities are often willing to help, according to Bachmann.</p><p>\"I like to say that for the impossible, we need 24 hours delay,\" Bachmann said. \"For miracles, we might need a bit longer.\"</p><p>But the new style of doing business virtually likely won't last in this sector, according to Scholl, as his experience during the pandemic hasn't been too different from normal.</p><p>\"Customers are still coming in here to Wichita to meet with us and go on factory tours,\" Scholl said. \"And I have been out to meet with customers in their homes so I think people still seem to be comfortable with those one-on-one interactions.\"</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a
