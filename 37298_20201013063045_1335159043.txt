This is the first time since I started blogging that I haven't written much. But that's ok.&nbsp; Life threw a few curve balls - as some of you may know I was diagnosed with Stage 1 <i>Breast Cancer</i> back in February (2017) &amp; my life has gone through some major changes. Not only did my diet completely change but the food that feeds my soul needed more attention &amp; so I went ahead &amp; tended to it. I had surgery to remove the cancer &amp; thank the Lord I am doing well. It is a day to day thing ....sometimes fearing the unknown and whenever I get a strange pain I think \"<i>What if</i>?\"&nbsp; But I know I need to always remind myself of the blessings that God has already given me &amp; that is what keeps me moving forward.&nbsp;</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\"><br /></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\">As for blogging I'm not sure where it's headed or what direction I will take. But what I do know is that I've learned to be more present in my life. That social media along with blogging takes away from the beauty of <b><i>'real life'&nbsp; -</i></b> as difficult as it may seem sometimes.&nbsp;</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\"><br /></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\">So with all that said, thank you for visiting once again &amp; stay tuned photos of my newly decorated apartment! </div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><br /></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"780\" data-original-width=\"640\" src=\"https://www.madebygirl.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/jen-noah1.jpg\" /></div><br /><br />-post by jen ramos<br /><br /><br />","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 06 Aug 2017 20:34:00 +0000","feedId":37298,"bgimg":"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-81hdttSwPiI/WYiOx44Q66I/AAAAAAAAa8c/_F1KA2lW-U4Oij262bBgvAltEPxfr4FZQCLcBGAs/s1600/jen-noah1.jpg","linkMd5":"cf22e4e21db2918bf2316417ded1c168","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn86@2020_4/2020/10/13/06-28-42-714_595d0887e78d9f1a.webp","destWidth":640,"destHeight":780,"sourceBytes":203336,"destBytes":69758,"author":"Jen of MadeByGirl","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-81hdttSwPiI/WYiOx44Q66I/AAAAAAAAa8c/_F1KA2lW-U4Oij262bBgvAltEPxfr4FZQCLcBGAs/s1600/jen-noah1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn86@2020_4/2020/10/13/06-28-42-714_595d0887e78d9f1a.webp","https://www.madebygirl.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/jen-noah1.jpg":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602570522305}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-10-13 14:28:42","updatedTime":"2020-10-13 14:28:42","feedId":37298,"fetchDate":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 06:28:42 +0000","fetchMs":80,"handleMs":27,"totalMs":123735,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":25,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"6923885023856883326b4ebb589fbdad","hostName":"us-021*","requestId":"171841655a884358accb314f54f903b3_37298","contentType":"application/atom+xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":69758,"bgimgsTotal":1,"bgimgsGithubTotal":1,"articlesImgsTotal":2,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":1,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx15":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 03:10:28","updatedTime":"2020-09-07 05:27:49","id":37298,"name":"Made By Girl","url":"http://madebygirl.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default","subscriber":86,"website":null,"icon":"http://madebygirl.blogspot.com/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx64/cdn66@2020_6/2020/09/06/21-25-02-395_0ebb19365e354d4d.ico","description":"A blog about Lifestyle, Art, Fashion and being a Mom.","weekly":null,"link":null},"noPictureArticleList":[{"createdTime":"2020-10-13 14:30:45","updatedTime":"2020-10-13 14:30:45","id":null,"feedId":37298,"linkMd5":"cf22e4e21db2918bf2316417ded1c168"}],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":69758,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1602570522194,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":84,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":27,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":0,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"},{"spend":121427,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"}]},"extra5":2,"extra6":1,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[null,null],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{"http://us-037.herokuapp.com/":{"failCount":1,"successCount":0,"resultList":[null]},"http://europe-24.herokuapp.com/":{"failCount":1,"successCount":0,"resultList":[null]}},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[{"code":1,"isDone":false,"source":"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-81hdttSwPiI/WYiOx44Q66I/AAAAAAAAa8c/_F1KA2lW-U4Oij262bBgvAltEPxfr4FZQCLcBGAs/s1600/jen-noah1.jpg","sourceStatusCode":200,"destWidth":640,"destHeight":780,"fixedGithubDest":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn86@2020_4/2020/10/13/06-28-42-714_595d0887e78d9f1a.webp","sourceBytes":203336,"destBytes":69758,"targetWebpQuality":75,"feedId":37298,"totalSpendMs":2178,"convertSpendMs":45,"createdTime":"2020-10-13 14:28:42","host":"us-024*","referer":"http://madebygirl.blogspot.com/2017/08/hello-again-its-me.html","linkMd5ListStr":"cf22e4e21db2918bf2316417ded1c168,cf22e4e21db2918bf2316417ded1c168","githubUser":"myreaderx15","githubHttpCode":201,"extra22GetBytesInfo":"1、没有Referer字段","extra23historyStatusCode":[200],"sourceSize":"198.6 KB","destSize":"68.1 KB","compressRate":"34.3%"}],"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx15":1},"failGithubMap":{}}
