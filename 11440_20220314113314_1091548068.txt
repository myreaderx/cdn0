These hidden app trackers are super creepy because they can track everything you do in an app and also can continue to track you even when you&#x2019;re not using the app. Many of these trackers are designed to record your activity <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/19/opinion/location-tracking-cell-phone.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">in real time</a>: where you are, what you&#x2019;re doing, where you&#x2019;ve been, and even how many hours you sleep at night.</p><p>Across all your apps, your personal data is being sent to dozens of third-party companies, thousands of times per week. This data enables tracking networks like Facebook and Google to create even more detailed digital profiles on you. With those profiles, tracking networks can manipulate what you see online, target you with ads based on your behavior, and even sell your data to other companies like <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90310803/here-are-the-data-brokers-quietly-buying-and-selling-your-personal-information\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">data brokers</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/location-tracking-whistleblower-reveals-info-on-companies-buying-and-selling-your-location-data/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">advertisers</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244848/us-intelligence-memo-admits-buying-smartphone-location-data\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">governments</a>.</p><p>Over 96% of the popular free Android apps we tested (based on <a href=\"https://androidrank.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">AndroidRank.org</a> rankings) contained hidden third-party trackers. Of those, 87% sent data to Google and 68% sent data to Facebook. A <a href=\"https://blog.appcensus.io/2020/11/18/snapshot-of-privacy-behaviors-in-the-australian-android-app-ecosystem/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">report by AppCensus</a> found similar results.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/2021/11/01---Apps-Tracking.v6-1.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Introducing App Tracking Protection for Android: The easiest way to block trackers lurking in your apps\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\"><figcaption><em>Companies hide trackers in your apps that can capture personal information.</em></figcaption></figure><p>Recently Apple <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212025\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">introduced</a> App Tracking Transparency, a feature for iPhones and iPads that asks users in each app whether they want to allow third-party app tracking or not, with the <a href=\"https://www.flurry.com/blog/ios-14-5-opt-in-rate-idfa-app-tracking-transparency-weekly/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">vast majority of people opting-out</a>. However, most smartphone users worldwide use Android, where no similar feature exists. In fact, advertisers are now <a href=\"https://digiday.com/marketing/as-att-hits-critical-mass-media-spending-see-saw-from-ios-to-android-continues/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">spending more money</a> on Android apparently because it&#x2019;s now easier to track you there.

It is now built right into the DuckDuckGo Android app.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/2021/11/02---Activity-Report.v5B-1-1-1.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Introducing App Tracking Protection for Android: The easiest way to block trackers lurking in your apps\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\"><figcaption><em>Protection from app trackers, even while you sleep.</em></figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"how-does-it-work\">How does it work?</h3><p>After enabling App Tracking Protection, the DuckDuckGo app will detect when your Android apps are about to send data to third-party tracking companies found in our app tracker dataset, and block those requests. You can enjoy your apps as you normally would and App Tracking Protection will run in the background and continue to block the detected trackers throughout your apps, even while you sleep. We are continually working to identify and protect against new trackers, so you can rest easy knowing you&#x2019;re getting the most up-to-date protection.</p><p>App Tracking Protection is not a virtual private network (VPN), though your device will recognize it as one. This is because App Tracking Protection uses a local &#x201C;VPN connection&#x201D; which means that it works its magic right on your smartphone. However, App Tracking Protection is different from VPNs because it never routes app data through an external server.</p><p>Directly from the DuckDuckGo app, you can see a real time view of App Tracking Protection blocking trackers as well as which tracking networks they tried to send data to. If you have notifications on, you&#x2019;ll also get automatic summaries.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/2021/11/03---Notification.v5-1-1-1.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Introducing App Tracking Protection for Android: The easiest way to block trackers lurking in your apps\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\"><figcaption><em>Daily App Tracking Protection summary</em></figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"join-the-private-beta-waitlist\">Join the private beta waitlist.</h3><p>To get access to the beta of App Tracking Protection, join the private waitlist!

While it&#x2019;s in beta, there are a small number of apps being excluded because they rely on tracking to work properly.

You&apos;ll then be asked to give details of the problem you experienced.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://spreadprivacy.com/content/images/2021/11/04B---Protection-v3B-1-1.gif\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Introducing App Tracking Protection for Android: The easiest way to block trackers lurking in your apps\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\"><figcaption><em>Disable protection and report issues for other apps</em></figcaption></figure><p>If you&#x2019;re an Android user who has been waiting for a feature to block hidden third-party trackers in your apps, the wait is almost over.
