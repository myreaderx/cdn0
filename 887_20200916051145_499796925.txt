Once you subscribe, set up a rule in your email application to forward the newsletter to your Feedly email. You can then delete it from your email inbox.</p></div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-gts-feedly-accordion webfeeds-accordion\"><h4 class=\"webfeeds-accordion__title\" role=\"button\">Can I automatically forward existing newsletters from my inbox to Feedly</h4><div class=\"webfeeds-accordion__content\"><p>Yes, you can. Generate a Feedly email address and create a forward rule in your email application to forward your existing newsletters to that Feedly email address. </p><p>Forwarded newsletter emails will show up in your Feedly. We recommend generating one email address per newsletter so that you can easily organize newsletters in your Feedly as individual sources.</p></div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-gts-feedly-accordion webfeeds-accordion\"><h4 class=\"webfeeds-accordion__title\" role=\"button\">Can I import newsletters from my email?</h4><div class=\"webfeeds-accordion__content\"><p>Currently, you can’t import newsletters from your email. However, you can forward newsletters directly from your email (instead of resubscribing on the newsletter website). Generate a Feedly email address and create a rule in your email application to forward each newsletter.</p></div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-gts-feedly-accordion webfeeds-accordion\"><h4 class=\"webfeeds-accordion__title\" role=\"button\">How many newsletters can I subscribe to in Feedly?</h4><div class=\"webfeeds-accordion__content\"><p>Pro+ users can follow up to 25 newsletters. Business users can follow up to 50 newsletters, and Enterprise users can follow up to 100 newsletters.</p></div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-gts-feedly-accordion webfeeds-accordion\"><h4 class=\"webfeeds-accordion__title\" role=\"button\">Can I subscribe to multiple newsletters with the same generated Feedly email address?</h4><div class=\"webfeeds-accordion__content\"><p>Yes, but it is not recommended. We recommend subscribing to newsletters with unique Feedly email addresses for each newsletter so you can then organize them into your feeds.</p></div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-gts-feedly-accordion webfeeds-accordion\"><h4 class=\"webfeeds-accordion__title\" role=\"button\">How can I unsubscribe from a newsletter I added to my feeds?</h4><div class=\"webfeeds-accordion__content\"><p>To unsubscribe from a newsletter, right-click on the newsletter source in the left navigation bar, and click ‘Unfollow’.</p></div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-gts-feedly-accordion webfeeds-accordion\"><h4 class=\"webfeeds-accordion__title\" role=\"button\">Does following a newsletter in Feedly impact the analytics of the newsletter publisher?</h4><div class=\"webfeeds-accordion__content\"><p>No. When you open and read a newsletter in Feedly, the content creator gets the same analytics as when you open and read the newsletter in your inbox.</p></div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-gts-feedly-related-post webfeeds-related-posts\" class=\"wp-block-gts-feedly-related-post\"><h3>You might also be interested in</h3><div
