With her signature style of raucous slapstick humor, Dressler challenged stereotypes to become one of Hollywood’s most unconventional stars.</span></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size:10pt\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">Marie Dressler was born Leila Marie Koerber on this day in 1868 in Cobourg, a Canadian town on the shore of Lake Ontario. She began acting with stock companies by the age of 14. Over the following years, Dressler showcased her comedic chops in vaudeville, burlesque, and revue performances and ascended from local theater all the way to Broadway musicals.&nbsp;</span></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size:10pt\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">By 1896, Dressler was a certified theater phenomenon. She reached the apex of her stage career in the 1910 Broadway hit “Tillie’s Nightmare,” which was adapted for the big screen four years later. The result was the first-ever feature-length comedy film “Tillie’s Punctured Romance”—a massive box office hit in which Dressler co-starred alongside a young Charlie Chaplin.</span></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size:10pt\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">Dressler’s rich stage voice proved a perfect fit for the “talkie” films that came along in the late ‘20s. She delivered a show-stealing performance in the 1930 drama “Anna Christie,” and the following year, her talent was recognized at the highest level when she won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in the 1930 film “Min and Bill.”</span></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size:10pt\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">Happy birthday to a legendary star whose talent and humor knew no bounds.&nbsp; </span></span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> </p> \n<p><strong>Location:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.google.com/doodles/search?query=Canada\">Canada</a> </p> \n<p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.google.com/doodles/search?query=Birthday\">Birthday</a>, <a href=\"http://www.google.com/doodles/search?query=theater\">theater</a>, <a href=\"http://www.google.com/doodles/search?query=actor\">actor</a>, <a href=\"http://www.google.com/doodles/search?query=film\">film</a>, <a href=\"http://www.google.com/doodles/search?query=silent film\">silent film</a>, <a href=\"http://www.google.com/doodles/search?query=comedy\">comedy</a>, <a href=\"http://www.google.com/doodles/search?query=movies\">movies</a> </p>","descriptionType":"text/html","feedId":7744,"bgimg":"http://www.google.com/logos/doodles/2020/marie-dresslers-152nd-birthday-6753651837108791-l.png","linkMd5":"f39ab85e3d1eca426d50719429e5d2cf","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn62@2020_3/2020/11/20/04-57-39-655_8340b522f73f25e2.webp","destWidth":500,"destHeight":200,"sourceBytes":40181,"destBytes":47546,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://www.google.com/logos/doodles/2020/marie-dresslers-152nd-birthday-6753651837108791-l.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn62@2020_3/2020/11/20/04-57-39-655_8340b522f73f25e2.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605848259431}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-11-20 12:57:39","updatedTime":"2020-11-20 12:57:39","feedId":7744,"fetchDate":"Fri, 20 Nov 2020 04:57:39 +0000","fetchMs":56021,"handleMs":47,"totalMs":57211,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":20,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"25831ba229ab386e6c9fb33b53312d7f","hostName":"us-006*","requestId":"af98b52d5f494ba493eb15e9e900474b_7744","contentType":"text/xml;charset=utf-8","totalBytes":47546,"bgimgsTotal":1,"bgimgsGithubTotal":1,"articlesImgsTotal":1,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":1,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx22":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 04:33:53","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 15:42:33","id":7744,"name":"Google Doodles","url":"http://www.google.com/doodles/doodles.xml","subscriber":null,"website":null,"icon":"http://www.google.com/images/branding/product_ios/3x/gsa_ios_60dp.png","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx61/cdn73@2020_2/2020/09/05/07-42-29-270_3dd0df133009cafc.png","description":"Holiday Logos and Events - Google style!
