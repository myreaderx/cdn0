Then July’s events moved out. Now it’s looking like the type of large-scale events B2B marketers depend on will have to wait until 2021… at the earliest.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But we don’t have to despair! We can close the gap with virtual events. The speaking gig at an industry conference can become a webinar, as can a planned panel discussion or product demonstration. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The good news is plenty of people have more spare time than before to watch your webinar.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bad news is that everyone who </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">makes</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> webinars has time on their hands, too. So, your webinar has to have a little extra oomph to stand out in the crowd. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here’s how you can level up your webinar creation and promotion.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to Get the Most from Your B2B Webinar</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s no longer enough to put up a slide deck and talk through bullet points. These tips will help you make a more compelling webinar — and make sure that people attend it.</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start with Content Research</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No marketer worth their salt would make a blog post without doing content research. Why should your webinar be different? </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To determine the best subject matter for your webinar, bring all of your research tools to bear:</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SEO research via </span><a href=\"https://www.semrush.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SEMRush</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and Google Analytics</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Question research via </span><a href=\"https://buzzsumo.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BuzzSumo</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"https://answerthepublic.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AnswerthePublic</span></a></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prospect feedback from your sales team</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Competitor content evaluation</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of these resources will help you home in on the topics that your audience most wants to hear about. Your research might even drive what type of webinar you create: If your audience needs how-to advice, you might do a live demonstration. If they’re looking for thought leadership, you might partner with influencers. Speaking of the latter...</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reach Out to Influencers</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In case you missed the headline yesterday, </span><a href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/2020/07/b2b-influencer-marketing-2020/?utm_source=Social&#38;utm_medium=Lee%20Odden&#38;utm_campaign=2025%20State%20of%20Influencer%20Marketing%20Report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">B2B Influencer Marketing</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is kind of a big deal. There’s no greater boost to your credibility (and your potential audience) than adding industry thought leaders to your webinar. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Look for people who are influential with your audience — those who are regularly producing content and engaging with anyone who posts a comment. They don’t have to have Taylor Swift-level follower counts to make a difference. They just have to be able to get a relevant audience’s attention and hold it.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, it’s not enough to just have someone appear with you on camera, though — it’s important to ask meaningful questions that will enable a substantive discussion. Keep your content research in mind as you plan the interview.</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create a Landing Page &#38; Promote</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Give your audience plenty of time to prepare for your webinar. We recommend starting outreach at least two weeks beforehand, and up to a month if you can swing it. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create a short landing page to collect sign-ups — include a few key points you plan to cover, and introduce yourself and your guests. You can promote the landing page via social media — image-led social works well — and blog content that builds anticipation for your topic.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t forget to include the webinar in your newsletter, and to enlist your influencers to drive pre-registration.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One great way to promote the webinar, and focus your content at the same time, is to poll your audience via social media. Ask for their thoughts on your topic. Ask what they most want to know about it. Ask what they would like to ask your thought leader guest. These posts can help drive registration while also making sure the content will be more relevant to the audience.</span>\n\n[bctt tweet=\"“One great way to promote the webinar, and focus your content at the same time, is to poll your audience via social media. Ask for their thoughts on your topic. Ask what they most want to know about it.” @NiteWrites\" username=\"toprank\"]\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Change Up the Format</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Q&#38;A, the panel discussion, the lecture — there are a few tried-and-true formats for webinars. But as the market gets flooded with content, we need to be more creative. For example, what about a working session instead of a discussion, where your panel collaboratively creates something? Or what about spicing up an interview with interstitial, pre-produced video content? </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You could even host the webinar on a platform like LinkedIn Live (while recording it for later publication, of course) and interact in real time with the audience. Just make sure to have a moderator to help keep the questions flowing smoothly.</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plan and Practice, But Be Flexible</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s always a good idea to run through your entire webinar a few times before you go live. If you’re doing a lecture or presentation format, that means practicing all the content you plan to put across. For a panel discussion or interview, you may not be able to do a full run-through with your influencer, but you can still test the technology you will be using.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t let your practicing and planning make your presentation too rigid, though. You should be able to follow an interesting conversational thread in your interview, or incorporate an audience comment in your presentation, without the whole thing going off the rails.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, it’s always going to be tricky to run a live presentation, especially if you or your guests don’t do this type of presenting for a living. It can be challenging to think on your feet, come across as engaging, and keep a conversation focused and interesting to your audience.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Which is why I’m going to court controversy and say...</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You Don’t Have to Be Live</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we think about changing up the format and offering a higher-quality experience to the audience, it may be time to let go of the idea that webinars have to be live. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After all, editing is the gift that you give to your audience. You wouldn’t write a blog post in real time with a hundred people watching. You wouldn’t record a podcast episode and publish the raw audio. So why not pre-record and edit your webinar?</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s true there is an immediacy to a live presentation that would be lost with a pre-recorded one. But the boost in quality for the audience could cover that loss. And you can still have an interactive experience with the audience through chat. You could even play the pre-recorded portion first, then hop on the video stream live for an audience Q&#38;A.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s an enormous gap between the standard slideshow &#38; lecture webinar and the produced, polished video that audiences appreciate most. Pre-recording and editing is one way to start closing that gap. </span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Follow Up with Extra Content</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What should your audience do next after attending the webinar? That’s a question to answer before you take your first registration. Once you have a next step in mind, create a content bundle to send to each registrant after the webinar airs. This bundle could include a normally gated eBook or two, some recommended reading from your blog, or more content from your influencer guests.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can also create extra content </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">from</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the webinar to help fill out your editorial calendar. Use excerpts from your discussion to fuel blog posts. Repurpose the audio as a podcast. Pull the best quotes to use as video posts on social media that drive to a gated version of the recorded webinar. Essentially, it’s about getting the most value possible from your content asset — the same thing you do with eBooks or blogs.</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Webinars Killed the Radio Star</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pandemic has made webinars a go-to tactic for marketers who are missing out on face-to-face events. But as more marketers get into the webinar game, your content needs to be extraordinarily valuable and extremely well-promoted. If you plan, produce and promote your webinar with the same strategic care that you use for the rest of your content marketing, you’ll bring your audience more value and earn their attention in return.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Check out our CEO Lee Odden in a recent webinar: </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM8yUidVf98\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener

can poll results tell B2B marketers about a year unlike any other, and how can this valuable audience data help us refine our marketing strategy as we push towards 2021?\n\nFor more than a year we’ve run weekly social media polls on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/toprank\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">our Twitter profile</a>, and for several months now have simultaneously also placed a weekly user poll on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/toprank-online-marketing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">our LinkedIn* page</a>.\n\nWe wanted to share some of the fascinating insights you have shared with us in the form of results from our polls, in order to see the trends that have emerged during this unprecedented year.\n\nLet’s look at trends in social media communications, how marketing is changing in 2020, and the rising effectiveness of <a href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/2020/07/b2b-influencer-marketing-2020/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">B2B influencer marketing</a>, all through the lens of poll-derived feedback.\n<h2>Social Media Communication Expectations</h2>\n<h3>Insight #1 — Social Response Times</h3>\nHow quickly do we expect a response from a brand when we ask a question publicly on social media?\n\nThe majority marketers we polled expect to hear back from a brand within 24 hours, with 61 percent of respondents on LinkedIn expecting a reply within a day, 24 percent within one hour, and 16 percent by the end of the workday.\n\nTwitter respondents voiced similar sentiments, with 38 percent looking to get a reply from a brand within 24 hours, 33 percent by the end of the current workday, and 21 percent within an hour.\n\nIf you’re not answering social media inquiries within 24 hours you may come under fire, as not even one respondent to our poll said that they expect brands to take longer than a day to reply.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28883\" src=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020July28LIPoll.png\" alt=\"2020July28LIPoll\" width=\"539\" height=\"375\" />\n<h3>Insight #2 — Email Response Times</h3>\nWe also asked the same question for a different form of online communications, curious about expectations when sending an old-fashioned email to a brand.\n\n50 percent of our Twitter poll respondents said that they expected an email reply within 24 hours, mostly echoing the expectations for public social media questions. 22 percent said they expected brands to reply by the end of the workday, 18 percent within a week — a notable difference from social media queries — and just 9 percent within an hour.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28886\" src=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020February18TwitterPoll500w.png\" alt=\"2020February18TwitterPoll\" width=\"500\" height=\"360\" />\n<h3>Insight #3 — Unfollowing</h3>\nWhat drives people who have already taken the time and effort to follow a brand on social media to later unfollow them, and what messages can we learn from these mistakes?\n\nWhen we asked this question in a poll, our LinkedIn respondents said the top reason they unfollow brands comes down to posting poor quality content, followed by irrelevant content and brands that post too much content. Just two percent of respondents said that they unfollow brands that don’t post enough content.\n\n44 percent of our Twitter respondents said that irrelevant content was their top reason for unfollowing a brand, followed by poor quality content at 33 percent, and too much content at 22 percent.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28887\" src=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020July14LIPoll500w.png\" alt=\"2020July14LIPoll\" width=\"500\" height=\"343\" />\n<h3>Insight #4 — Stories Format</h3>\nWe also ran a poll asking how the ephemeral stories format would fare on LinkedIn if the platform were to make its test of the post type a permanent part of the service. 33 percent of respondents said that LinkedIn Stories would be a great addition to the platform, while 25 percent felt it would be a good match. 25 percent also said that it would be an unlikely match, and 16 percent noted that the stories format would be a poor match for LinkedIn.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28888\" src=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020May19TwitterPoll500w.png\" alt=\"2020May19TwitterPoll\" width=\"500\" height=\"362\" />\n<h3>Insight #5 — Experiential Content</h3>\nWe were also curious how B2B marketers are using experiential content in 2020. 58 percent of our Twitter poll respondents said that they expected to incorporate experiential content very frequently into their marketing efforts during 2020, followed by 41 percent who planned to do so somewhat frequently.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28889\" src=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020March3TwitterPoll500w.png\" alt=\"2020March3TwitterPoll\" width=\"500\" height=\"389\" />\n\nExperiential content is playing a greater role in B2B marketing efforts in 2020, which I looked at in “<a href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/2020/01/what-b2b-marketers-need-to-know-about-experiential-content/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">What B2B Marketers Need to Know About Experiential Content,</a>” and our <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NickNelsonMN\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nick Nelson</a> examined recently in \"<a href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/2020/05/hitting-a-content-marketing-home-run-with-experiential/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How to Hit a Marketing Home Run with Experiential Content</a>.\"\n<h3>Insight #6 — Chatbots &#38; Artificial Intelligence</h3>\nHow B2B marketers communicate is constantly shifting as new technologies become available and gain wider adoption. We asked our Twitter followers who use chatbots or other forms of messaging featuring artificial intelligence (AI) to chime in on how the technology has performed for them.\n\n49 percent of B2B marketers who responded said that chatbots and AI-assisted technology has performed better than expected, yet 42 percent noted that the technology has under-performed, while 14 percent found that it performed as they had expected.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28890\" src=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020May5TwitterPoll500w.png\" alt=\"2020May5TwitterPoll\" width=\"500\" height=\"332\" />\n<h3>Insight #7 — Virtual Meeting Length</h3>\nWe were curious what our audience of B2B marketers on Twitter felt the most effective length of time might be when it comes to virtual meetings.\n\n58 percent of respondents said that 30 minutes was the optimal length of time for effective virtual meetings, while 17 percent felt that 15 minutes or less works best, with 17 percent also noting that 45 minutes is the most effective, followed by just 5 percent who said an hour was best.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28891\" src=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020March24TwitterPoll500w.png\" alt=\"2020March24TwitterPoll\" width=\"500\" height=\"386\" />\n<h3>Insight #8 — Reviews &#38; Testimonials</h3>\nAnother part of marketing communications is <a href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/2020/04/b2b-testimonials-reviews/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">user feedback, reviews, and testimonials</a>, and we asked our Twitter followers to share how often they use positive reviews in their marketing efforts.\n\n47 percent of respondents said that they use positive reviews in their marketing efforts occasionally, however 23 percent noted that they never do, followed by 17 percent who said that they always do, and 11 percent who do so frequently.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28892\" src=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020February25TwitterPoll500w.png\" alt=\"2020February25TwitterPoll\" width=\"500\" height=\"371\" />\n<h3>Insight #9 — Newsletter Preferences</h3>\nSpeaking of email, we also wondered when B2B marketers prefer to receive monthly newsletters. 45 percent of our respondents said they prefer the first of the month, followed by 27 percent who are fond of mid-month newsletters, 18 percent who prefer a time early in the month, and 9 percent who want to see newsletters arrive at the end of the month.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28893\" src=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020February11TwitterPoll500w.png\" alt=\"2020February11TwitterPoll\" width=\"500\" height=\"393\" />\n<h3>Insight #10 — The Emoji Divide</h3>\nThe use of emojis in social media messaging was an area of contention among our poll respondents. 35 percent said that emoji were somewhat effective, while the same number noted their use to rarely be effective. 17 percent said emoji were extremely effective, and some 11 percent noted that they never use them.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28894\" src=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020January28TwitterPoll500.png\" alt=\"2020January28TwitterPoll\" width=\"500\" height=\"370\" />\n<h2>The Changing Face of 2020 Marketing</h2>\nThe global health crisis has changed the face of marketing events in 2020, as nearly all conferences have made the jump to virtual events, as I wrote about recently in \"<a href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/2020/07/17-top-virtual-marketing-conferences-for-summer-2020-beyond/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">17+ Top Virtual Marketing Conferences for Summer 2020 &#38; Beyond</a>.\"\n<h3>Insight #11 — Virtual Event Attendance</h3>\nAre B2B marketers planning to attend newly-virtual events, and if so how many?\n\nWe asked our LinkedIn and Twitter users how many virtual marketing events they planned to attend over the final five months of 2020.\n\nMost respondents said that they will attend between one and five virtual marketing events, while the second most frequent choice was those who said they won’t be attending a single virtual event, followed by those who plan to attend between six and 10.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28895\" src=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020July21LIPoll500w.png\" alt=\"2020July21LIPoll\" width=\"500\" height=\"339\" />\n\nVirtual events and webinars are undoubtedly seeing an unexpected golden age this year, and we’ve explored how to best utilize them, in “<a href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/2020/07/b2b-webinars-2020/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How B2B Marketers Can Get the Most Out of Webinars in 2020</a>.”\n\n[bctt tweet=\"“One great way to promote the webinar, and focus your content at the same time, is to poll your audience via social media.

marketers, and among those answering our LinkedIn poll 64 percent said that a decrease in budget or business has been the top challenge, followed by the difficulty in engaging customers at 36 percent.\n\n46 percent of Twitter respondents also revealed that falling budgets and business were their top pain points, followed by engaging customers at 38 percent and remote work issues for some 15 percent of marketers.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28896\" src=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020July7LIPoll500w.png\" alt=\"2020July7LIPoll\" width=\"500\" height=\"341\" />\n<h3>Insight #13 — Learning New Skills</h3>\n63 percent of poll respondents said that they have used their time during the pandemic to learn new marketing skills online, while 18 percent said that they planned to do so.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28897\" src=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020May12TwitterPoll500.png\" alt=\"2020May12TwitterPoll\" width=\"500\" height=\"356\" />\n<h3>Insight #14 — Digital Asset Management</h3>\n54 percent of B2B marketers we polled on Twitter said that they either already use a digital asset management (DAM) solution in their marketing stack or plan to implement one, while 45 percent didn’t use a DAM.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28898\"

marketers, I looked into the issue in \"<a href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/2020/04/digital-asset-management-tips-for-b2b-marketers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Why B2B Marketers Should Give a DAM: Top Tips on Digital Asset Management</a>.\"\n<h3>Insight #15 — Podcast Growth</h3>\nWith U.S. podcast listeners topping the 100 million mark for the first time in 2020, we wondered how the global health crisis has affected listening frequency among B2B marketers.\n\n40 percent of our Twitter respondents said that they have been listening to more podcasts during the pandemic, with 22 percent noting that they’ve listened to fewer, 18 percent about the same amount, and another 18 percent who said they don’t listen to podcasts.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full

Use</h3>\nWith numerous studies showing that streaming music ads were booming in 2019, we wondered what B2B marketers planned for 2020, and 50 percent of our Twitter poll respondents said that they had no streaming ad plans for the year, while 25 percent said they planned to implement more streaming ads, 16 percent fewer of them, and 8 percent about the same.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full

Customer Journey</h3>\nContent creation efforts are also shifting in 2020, and we asked B2B marketers to share which stage of the customer journey they are focusing on the most.\n\n47 percent of respondents said that generating awareness was where they were placing the greatest focus, followed by brand advocacy at 35 percent, consideration and intent at 11 percent, and evaluation and purchase at 5 percent.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28901\" src=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020February4TwitterPoll500w.png\" alt=\"2020February4TwitterPoll\" width=\"500\" height=\"371\" />\n<h2>The Rising Effectiveness of Influencer Marketing</h2>\n<h3>Insight #18 — Influencer Marketing Program Length</h3>\nWe asked our LinkedIn and Twitter followers to chime in on the ideal length of time a <a href=\"https://www.toprankmarketing.com/services/influencer-marketing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">B2B influencer marketing program</a> should run for maximum effectiveness, and the majority of our savvy followers chose always-on and ongoing programs — 73 percent of our LinkedIn respondents and 64 percent of our Twitter respondents.\n\nInfluencer marketing programs encompassing at least two campaigns was the second most popular choice, the choice of 21 percent of LinkedIn respondents and 18 percent of our Twitter respondents.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28902\" src=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020June16LIPoll500w.png\" alt=\"2020June16LIPoll\" width=\"500\" height=\"349\" />\n<h3>Insight #19 — Pandemic Focus Areas</h3>\nWe asked B2B marketers which area of marketing they were the most likely to increase focus on during the global health crisis, and topping the list was influencer marketing at 35 percent, followed by content marketing at 30 percent, search marketing at 20 percent, and email marketing, which garnered 12 percent of the poll responses.\n\n<img

/>\n<h3>Insight #20 — Volume of Influencer Marketing Work</h3>\nWe were also curious how the pandemic has affected the volume of work B2B marketers have done with influencers. The greatest number of our respondents — some 36 percent — said that their volume of work with influencers had increased, followed by 32 percent who said that they didn’t use influencers, 24 percent who found that the volume of work was about the same, while 8 percent noted that the volume decreased.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28904\" src=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020April14TwitterPoll500.png\" alt=\"2020April14TwitterPoll\" width=\"500\" height=\"368\" />\n<h2>Listening To Your Audience &#38; Taking Action</h2>\n<iframe class=\"giphy-embed\" src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/KyGno1zsRxg27aR31d\" width=\"480\" height=\"352\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\n<a href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/KyGno1zsRxg27aR31d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">via GIPHY</a>\n\nKeeping your finger on the pulse of your audience — whether it’s from poll results, surveys, questionnaires or other forms of feedback — goes a long way when it comes to making your marketing efforts authentic, and will help ensure that your communication is a two-way street and not just a publish-and-forget effort.\n\nWe hope you’ve found this glimpse into some of our own poll results helpful as you navigate the sometimes murky marketing waters 2020 has given us.

src=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/trust-authentic-content-cx.jpg\" alt=\"Authentic Content Customer Experience\" width=\"600\" height=\"335\" />\n\nThe experience customers have through marketing content can be one of the most important differentiators for brands today.\n\nAnd yet 58% of B2B buyers don't not believe claims made by the vendors they most recently bought from (<a href=\"https://www.b2bmarketing.net/en/resources/news/almost-60-b2b-buyers-do-not-trust-vendors\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TrustRadius</a>).\n\nIt’s hard to create a great experience if customers don’t trust brand communications.\n\nTrust is the gateway to influence perceptions, behaviors and actions and brands that want to succeed in the uncertain environment of today’s digital world need to double down on building trust with their customers. But how?\n\nToday’s increasingly digital buyers have high expectations of the companies they do business with: buyers want personalized and relevant information, they want a consistent experience across channels, they want confidence in the brand as a company that cares about privacy, their customers and the community.\n\nMeeting these expectations has been a challenge. From fake news to privacy issues to deep fakes, the digital world has become an uncertain source of information for consumers.\n\nTired of information overload, sales focused brand messaging and unremarkable content, 86% of customers say authenticity is important when deciding what brands they like and support (<a href=\"https://stackla.com/resources/reports/the-consumer-content-report-influence-in-the-digital-age/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stackla - The Consumer Content Report: Influence in the Digital Age</a>).\n\nCustomers want what’s real. They want to trust and be confident about their decisions.\n\nWhile there’s a lot of information and even misinformation about content marketing and what it means for business communicators, there’s hope in building trust and influence by creating great customer experiences with authentic content.\n\nTo help marketers better understand how brands are winning customer hearts, minds, and trust with authentic content experiences here are 5 important steps:\n<h2>Accelerate Internal Credibility</h2>\nIn order for marketing to have the support it needs to be successful externally with customers, marketing needs to be credible inside the organization. Unfortunately, 80% of CEOs don’t trust marketers but 91% do trust CIOs and CFOs (<a href=\"https://www.fournaisegroup.com/CEOs-Do-Not-Trust-Marketers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fournaise Group</a>).\n\nTo earn C-level trust, marketers must identify the key business problems faced by the business and make the connection to how marketing can help solve those issues. More importantly, marketing needs to provide clear direction about how and show credible reporting about impact. Ensuring credibility internally means promoting your wins to internal stakeholders. Make sure everyone from department heads to the C-suite are aware of the results that you are delivering to the business bottom line.\n\nAs marketers use content marketing integrated across channels to create “best answer” experiences for customers, marketers must also become the best answer for business growth inside the company by focusing on and communicating what matters to the business - not fluffy marketing promises with ambiguous correlations to the impact on the business.\n<h2>Double Down on Activating Customers</h2>\nWord of mouth and advocacy continue to represent important sources of trust and influence for brands. Marketers need to engage customers for reviews, ratings and even user generated content. As I’ve often said,\n<blockquote>\n<h2>“If you want your content to be great, ask your customers to participate.”</h2>\n</blockquote>\nBuild credibility and influence with customers by engaging them and making them part of the narrative that builds trust about your brand where buyers are looking.\n<h2>Work with External Influencers to Grow Brand Credibility</h2>\nEvery brand has a story to tell and to help make that story relevant, interesting and effective amongst buyers who are probably ignoring most brand communications, marketers can engage with relevant industry influencers. What makes someone influential is that they have the trust and attention of your customers. What better way to add credibility to your brand content than to collaborate with people who already have that credibility?\n\nVirtually any kind of external content that brands create can consider influencer collaboration to make it more credible, relevant, engaging and capable of actually reaching the audience it is intended for. Authenticity is essential for influencer collaborations to work so it’s important that marketers do their due diligence with influencers through proper identification, qualification and engagement best practices.\n<h2>Create a Content Collaboration Ecosystem</h2>\nMost marketers don’t have all the content creation resources they need to create the kind of content that drives customer experience. Engaging influencers to collaborate on content is a great start. But to truly build authenticity and content experiences that matter, customers can be engaged as well. User generated content is not for everyone, but when customers can contribute their voices to brand content, it adds a level of authenticity and trust that most marketing departments are able to on their own.\n\nEmployees are another important source of authentic content for brands, whether it’s telling stories about the impact those employees have on the lives of customers or by enlisting employees to help tell the brand story.\n<h2>Optimize Measurement to Customer ROI</h2>\nCreating trust with authentic content experiences must be a measurable exercise. Beyond share of voice and brand sentiment metrics, marketers must pay attention to measuring the effectiveness of content through the customer journey.\n\nAt a minimum, marketers must understand the the impact in these key areas:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Attract</strong> - Is your marketing reaching the right audience in the channels they’re actually influenced by?</li>\n \t<li><strong>Engage</strong> - Is your marketing creating meaningful and satisfying experiences? Are you effectively using authenticity and influence to build trust?</li>\n \t<li><strong>Convert</strong> - Is the content you’re creating and co-creating actually inspiring action? Are those actions delivering impact for the business whether it’s brand perception, leads, sales or revenue?</li>\n</ul>\nBeyond these important steps towards more effective content marketing that drives trust are the influence traits brands must have to build trust:\n\n<strong>Purpose</strong>: “In this time of turmoil people are turning to brands as islands of stability.” Richard Edelman. How will the world be different after you’re successful doing what you do? How does that narrative translate into your marketing?\n\n<strong>Relevance</strong>: Use data to understand your internal/external customer and create compelling, useful content experiences that matter. Leverage the voices of your customers, prospects, and those they trust to help add credibility and context to your message.\n\n<strong>Reach:</strong>  Become “the best answer” for your customers with content that is easy to find and exists in context wherever buyers engage.\n\n<strong>Resonance:</strong>  Understand audience motivations through the buyer journey to inform messaging that “clicks” and inspires action and makes real, measurable business impact.\n\n<a href=\"https://summit.iabcmn.com/2020agenda/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28873\" src=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/convergence-summit-2020.jpg\" alt=\"Convergence Summit 2020\" width=\"500\" height=\"263\" /></a>\nI hope you can join me at the virtual <a href=\"https://summit.iabcmn.com/2020agenda/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">IABC Minnesota Convergence Summit</a> conference this week where I will be giving the opening keynote on Wednesday August 12th at 4pm: <strong>In Search of Trust: How Authentic Content Drives Customer Experience</strong>.

of when you see a person’s business title, and how do the role assumptions we all inevitably bring to the table affect our ability to market authentically?\n\nCan we find our own more effective and authentic marketing identity and build greater business communication opportunities by ditching preconceived role beliefs?\n\nMarketing has seen dwindling levels of trust in recent years, and as our CEO <a href=\"https://twitter.com/leeodden\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lee Odden</a> observed in his recent “<a href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/2020/08/in-search-of-trust/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">In Search of Trust: How Authentic Content Drives Customer Experience</a>,” building great customer experiences is an uphill battle if customers don’t trust brand communications.\n\n<a href=\"https://stackla.com/resources/reports/the-consumer-content-report-influence-in-the-digital-age/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">86 percent</a> of customers have said that authenticity is important when deciding what brands they like and support, which ought to make marketing that resonates with truth a key goal among forward-thinking B2B marketers.\n\nUnderstanding that we’re not interacting with businesses but with human beings is also especially important as we push towards 2021, as our senior content strategist <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NickNelsonMN\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nick Nelson</a> examined in “<a href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/2020/03/how-authentic-content-builds-brand-trust-in-uncertain-times/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How Authentic Content Builds Brand Trust in Uncertain Times</a>.”\n\nSo sit back and let’s explore how to find your most authentic marketing identity through the lens of authenticity when it comes to how we perceive the many professionals in our business lives.\n<h2>Looking Anew At Our Universe of Business Associates</h2>\nBack in 2011 during my decade as lead editor at search and social media conference Pubcon I created <a href=\"https://www.pubcon.com/dont-be-misunderstood-come-to-pubcon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a grid image</a> in a style that was popular at the time, making light-hearted fun at how some people in the world of technology might mistakenly view those in different segments of the industry.\n\nIt highlighted how we sometimes tend to see ourselves and others who hold the same positions that we do in generally more favorable light than how we view our associates who have differing roles.\n\nBack then I included search engine optimizers, social media optimizers, social media marketers, chief executives, and affiliate marketers, and I thought it might be time for an update including chief marketing officers, chief information officers, and influencers.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28931\" src=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/AuthenticMarketingGridImageA600w.jpg\" alt=\"Collage of heroes and unsuccessful people.\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" />\n\nWhile “<i>To thine own self be true</i>” is unmistakably sound Shakespearian wisdom, it’s also important to see others as they truly are — without the prejudice of weighty titles.\n\nBeing true to ourselves starts when we strip away preconceived notions of what a CMO does or what a CEO doesn’t do and look instead at the totality of each person — a shift that can begin a newfound level of productive communication in both our professional and personal lives.\n\nAfter all, as <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/vanessacolella/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Vanessa Colella</a>, chief innovation officer at Citi, recently noted in an <a href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/podcast/were-all-the-same-size-rectangle-on-the-zoom-screen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">American Banker podcast</a>, “<b>We’re all the same size rectangle on the Zoom screen</b>.”\n<h2>Using A Fresh Understanding of Others To Learn More About Ourselves &#38; Tell More Authentic Marketing Stories</h2>\nWe’re all so much more than mere titles — each of us is a fantastic and unique collection of strengths, weaknesses, and the cumulative collection of professional and personal journeys our lives have given us.\n\nOur personal histories shape the stories we’re able to tell in our marketing, and making our storytelling authentic is a primary factor in making it successful.\n\n[bctt tweet=\"“We’re all so much more than mere titles — each of us is a fantastic and unique collection of strengths, weaknesses, and the cumulative collection of professional and personal journeys our lives have given us.” — Lane R. Ellis @lanerellis\" username=\"toprank\"]\n\nLet's now look at five tips for uncovering and putting your authentic marketing identity to work:\n<h2>1 — Bring Measurement to Authentic Content Experiences</h2>\n“Creating trust with authentic content experiences must be a measurable exercise,” Lee has urged. “Beyond share of voice and brand sentiment metrics, marketers must pay attention to measuring the effectiveness of content through the customer journey,” Lee added.\n\nIt's not enough to infuse authenticity in top-notch digital content, as to truly understand the significance and success of our efforts we need to incorporate a measurement to gauge performance.\n\nMeasurement comes in many forms, from manual to automated solutions, and each can only tell you so much if you don't have the proper key performance indicators (KPIs) relevant to your authentic campaigns. Albert Einstein offered insight that applies to marketing measurement and analytics, \"Not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted.\"\n\n<iframe class=\"giphy-embed\" src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/3o6Ztfbym9laEgGpJ6\" width=\"480\" height=\"300\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\n<a href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/einstein-albert-3o6Ztfbym9laEgGpJ6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">via GIPHY</a>\n\nWe've explored how marketers can measure for success in a number of articles, including these to get you up to speed:\n<ul>\n \t<li><a href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/2020/05/how-to-measure-marketing-goals-during-a-crisis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How to Measure Changing Marketing Goals During a Crisis</a></li>\n \t<li><a href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/01/actionable-content-marketing-dashboard/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Measure for Success: 7 Secrets of Actionable Content Marketing Dashboards</a></li>\n \t<li><a href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/2018/12/top-analytics-advice-from-the-experts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Measuring Content Marketing Success: Analytics Advice &#38; Insight from the Experts</a></li>\n</ul>\n[bctt tweet=\"“Authenticity is essential for influencer collaborations to work so it’s important that marketers do their due diligence with influencers through proper identification, qualification and engagement best practices.” @LeeOdden\" username=\"toprank\"]\n<h2>2 — Look to the Long-Term for Business Relationships</h2>\n“Content marketing is inherently a long game, focused on building relationships first and foremost,” Nick has observed. “Right now, the best way to pursue this goal is through authenticity and altruism, in the context of your business and its audience,” he added.\n\nAlways-on marketing has become more important in efforts to build trust, strengthen relationships, and achieve ongoing long-term success — a trend we’ve explored recently since the launch of our groundbreaking <a href=\"http://download.influencermarketingreport.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2020 State of B2B Influencer Marketing report</a>.\n\n“As the need for B2B brands to reach and connect authentically with customers rises, B2B influencer marketers are evolving from transactional and intermittent campaigns to more relationship driven, Always-On Influencer engagement programs,” Lee observed in “<a href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/2020/08/engine-influence-always-on/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">For Successful B2B Marketers The Engine of Influence is Always On #B2BIMReport</a>.”\n\nYou can learn more about how always-on marketing benefits B2B marketers in the following additional articles we've published on the subject:\n<ul>\n \t<li><a href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/2020/07/5-always-on-influencer-marketing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Always On Influence: Costs Less and Better ROI – Here’s Why</a></li>\n \t<li><a href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/2020/06/influencer-relationships-crisis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Always On Influence: Short Term vs. Long Term for Success During a Crisis</a></li>\n \t<li><a href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/2020/04/always-on-influence/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Always On Influence: Definition and Why B2B Brands Need it to Succeed</a></li>\n \t<li><a href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/2020/06/always-on-b2b-influencer-marketing-brand-research/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Always-On Influence: Why B2B Needs Brand Research</a></li>\n \t<li><a href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/2020/05/5-always-on-b2b-influencer-marketing-examples/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Always-On Influence: 5 Examples of Ongoing B2B Influencer Marketing In Action</a></li>\n</ul>\n[bctt tweet=\"“Marketers, brands, and creators of all kinds can make a positive difference. Being legitimately and authentically helpful in a moment like this can have a lasting impact.” @NickNelsonMN\" username=\"toprank\"]\n<h2>3 — Bring Authenticity to Every Facet of Your Life</h2>\nAuthenticity matters everywhere in our lives, and leading a life where we’re as authentic as possible in all areas makes it easier and more natural to incorporate it into our marketing efforts.\n\nUnforgettable marketing and <a href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/2020/02/art-science-b2b-marketing-content/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">best-answer marketing</a> often go hand-in-hand, both filled with the kind of authenticity and genuine emotion that builds especially strong brand affinity.\n\n“Authenticity is a collection of choices that we have to make every day. It’s about the choice to show up and be real. The choice to be honest. The choice to let our true selves be seen,” author <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BreneBrown\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brené Brown</a> has observed.\n\n[bctt tweet=\"“Building authenticity can be accomplished by sharing the kind of best-answer content that your audience is actively searching for.” — Lane R. Ellis @lanerellis\" username=\"toprank\"]\n<h2>4 — Purpose &#38; Authenticity Go Hand-in-Hand</h2>\n“Building a purpose-driven authentic brand brings growth,” Lee has observed, and during this year more than others brands have had to take a close look at their purpose and how they are pushing beyond words and into the realm of taking action.\n\nIn “<a href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/2020/06/b2b-brands-take-a-stand/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">B2B Brands Take a Stand: 5 Examples of Going Beyond Words to Action</a>,” I examined at why it’s never been more important for brands to show purpose and to be connected to what’s important to customers, and seeing others and ourselves authentically can certainly go a long way in making this happen.\n\n[bctt tweet=\"“Don't mistake good communication for action. There is a really big difference.” Karen Kahn of @HP\" username=\"toprank\"]\n<h2>5 — Authenticity Builds Mutually Beneficial Programs</h2>\nIn <a href=\"https://www.toprankmarketing.com/services/influencer-marketing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">B2B influencer marketing programs</a>, cooperative marketing efforts serve to benefit both brands and influencers, as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dgingiss\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dan Gingiss</a>, chief experience officer at The Experience Maker recently examined in our influencer marketing strategist <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dfriez\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Debbie Friez</a>’ “<a href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/2020/07/9-top-brand-marketing-tips-from-b2b-influencers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">B2B Influencer Marketing Advice from 9 Top B2B Influencers</a>.”\n\nWhether working with influencers or in more traditional marketing efforts, authenticity cuts to the heart of what drives the type of brand storytelling that truly connects with customers.\n\nIt's also the kind of authentic digital storytelling that is remembered well beyond the two seconds that recent research suggests is all marketers are likely to get these days — see \"<a href=\"https://www.thedrum.com/news/2020/08/13/you-get-2-seconds-engage-consumers-online-mars-neuroscientist-shares-key-findings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">You get 2 seconds to engage consumers online: Mars neuroscientist shares key findings</a>.\"\n\n[bctt tweet=\"“The best influencer programs highlight an authentic relationship between the influencer and the brand, and the best way to accomplish that is to ensure a mutually beneficial program.” — Dan Ginigiss @dgingiss\" username=\"toprank\"]\n<h2>Authenticity Energizes Marketing &#38; Our Personal Journeys</h2>\n<iframe class=\"giphy-embed\" src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/lOUKVHqVTs7xBfv2Rk\" width=\"480\" height=\"359\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\n<a href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/tcm-turner-classic-movies-metropolis-art-deco-lOUKVHqVTs7xBfv2Rk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">via GIPHY</a>\n\nBeing authentic and true to ourselves is a process that can shift over time, requiring occasional reevaluation and possible adjustments to how we live and work.

Judging by the response we've had to The State of B2B Influencer Marketing <a href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/2020/07/b2b-influencer-marketing-2020/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Report</a> so far, we're definitely meeting a need.\n\nThere is both optimism and an unrealized opportunity with influencer marketing for B2B companies. For evidence, check out these stats from the report:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>78%</strong> of B2B marketers believe prospects rely on advice from influencers</li>\n \t<li><strong>74%</strong> believe that Influencer Marketing improves customer and prospect experiences</li>\n \t<li><strong>63%</strong> agree that marketing would have better results if it included an Influencer Marketing program</li>\n \t<li><strong>60%</strong> of marketers who use always on Influencer Marketing programs are very successful vs. 5% who do periodic campaigns</li>\n</ul>\nAnd yet:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Only 19%</strong> of B2B marketers are running ongoing influencer marketing programs</li>\n \t<li><strong>Only half</strong> include a plan for influencer activation in their influencer marketing strategy</li>\n \t<li><strong>Only 35%</strong> of marketers use software to identify potential influencers</li>\n \t<li><strong>60%</strong> say they don’t have the knowledge to execute or have the right skills in house to implement ongoing Influencer Marketing programs</li>\n</ul>\nInfluencer Marketing is a significant opportunity for B2B Marketers to connect with <a href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/2020/06/trust-marketing/\">trusted and credible experts</a> that have the attention of audiences that are probably overwhelmed with information and ignoring most of the ads that do get to them. At the same time B2B brands that build relationships to co-create content with these industry voices can integrate influence with <a href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/2020/07/aoi-thought-leadership/\">thought leadership</a> to build the authority and influence of brand employees.\n\nIt is very satisfying to have spent the past 8 years focusing on such a niche aspect of B2B marketing to see it now start to grow in acceptance, adoption and maturity amongst some of the top B2B brands in the world.  Where there were previously no positions outside of PR with \"influencer\" in the title, now it is much more common to find marketers with titles like, Head of Global Influencer Marketing, VP Influencer Marketing and Communications, or B2B Influencer Engagement Strategist.\n\nMany B2B marketing professionals with these titles have earned hard won insights into what makes influencer marketing truly work for B2B, especially during a time when brand marketers are highly motivated to focus on strategies and tactics that will <a href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/2020/06/b2b-marketing-pandemic/\">help them survive and thrive</a> during the pandemic.\n\nTo help you connect with the collective wisdom of the B2B influencer marketing crowd, here are 20 B2B Influencer Marketing Professionals to follow (in no particular order):\n\n<strong><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28818\" src=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/Ursula-Ringham-SAP-1.jpg\" alt=\"Ursula Ringham\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" />\nUrsula Ringham</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ursularingham\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@ursularingham</a>\nHead of Global Influencer Marketing at SAP\n\n<strong><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28819\" src=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/rani-mani-Adobe.jpg\" alt=\"Rani Mani\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" />\nRani Mani</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ranimani0707\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@ranimani0707</a>\nHead of Social Influencer Enablement at Adobe\n\n<strong><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28820\" src=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/Jen-Holtvluwer-Spirion.jpg\" alt=\"Jen Holtvluwer\" width=\"227\" height=\"199\" />\nJen Holtvluwer</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JenHoltvluwer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@JenHoltvluwer</a>\nCMO at Spirion\n\n<strong><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28821\" src=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/Garnor-Morantes-LinkedIn.jpg\" alt=\"Garnor Morantes\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" />\nGarnor Morantes</strong> <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/garnormorantes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">/in/garnormorantes/</a>\nGroup Marketing Manager at LinkedIn\n\n<strong><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28822\" src=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/Martin-Hanna-Schneider-Electric.jpg\" alt=\"Martin Hanna\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" />\nMartin Hanna</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/martyhanna\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@martyhanna</a>\nVP, Analyst and Influencer Relations at Schneider Electric\n\n<strong><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28823\" src=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/Amisha-Gandhi-SAPAriba.jpg\" alt=\"Amisha Gandhi\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" />\nAmisha Gandhi</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AmishaGandhi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@AmishaGandhi</a>\nVP Influencer Marketing and Communications at SAP Ariba\n\n<strong><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28824\" src=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/Chris-Purcell-HPE.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Purcell\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" />\nChris Purcell</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chrispman01\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@chrispman01</a>\nManager, Influencer Marketing at Hewlett Packard Enterprise\n\n<strong><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28825\" src=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/Janine-Wegner-Dell.jpg\" alt=\"Janine Wegner\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" />\nJanine Wegner</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JanineWegner\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@JanineWegner</a>\nGlobal Thought Leadership Program &#38;

/>\n\nEmpathy is more than a buzzword. It’s not a box to be checked, or an added finishing touch for content. If B2B marketers want to successfully engage human audiences and break free from the deluge of irrelevant messages swirling around today’s customers, empathy needs to be at the center of all strategic initiatives from start to finish.\n<h2>What Does Empathy Mean in B2B Marketing?</h2>\nEmpathy is defined simply as the ability to understand and share the feelings of another. But I’m not sure that characterization fully does it justice in the context of modern marketing.\n\nI rather like the way Zen Media CEO <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Shama\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Shama Hyder</a> described empathy in the <a href=\"https://monday.com/lp/better-creative-teamwork-expert-advice\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">better creative teamwork guide</a> we helped our clients at monday.com put together:\n\n<i>“Empathy is critical. It's much more than just having an understanding of what someone else's challenges might be. Part of it is that you have to give up being a control freak. As leaders, we should really look at the big picture and ask ourselves, is this necessary? Or is this just politicking, or someone trying to make it seem like it has to be done this way because it's the way they prefer?”</i>\n\nShama was speaking from the perspective of a business leader trying to get on the same page as their team, but it applies just as well to marketing endeavors. The critical first step in developing empathy is <i>disconnecting from our own ingrained perceptions and assumptions</i>. Only then can we truly understand and support the audiences we want to reach.\n\nToo often, empathy in marketing tends to be a bit narrow and self-centered (which is contradictory to the very concept itself). We often seek to understand only the challenges and pain points that drive interest in what we’re selling. Looking beyond this scope is necessary to build strong relationships founded on trust, especially now.\n\n“What you are creating, marketing and ultimately selling is but one piece of your customer’s life as a human on Earth. One very small piece,” said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MaryBeech1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mary Beech</a>, principal at MRB Brand Consulting and former CMO of Kate Spade, in an <a href=\"https://www.ama.org/marketing-news/how-does-empathetic-marketing-make-you-feel/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AMA article on empathy in marketing</a>. “And if we aren’t keeping in mind their full journey, including their emotional, mental, social and physical needs — as well as the challenges and joys they are facing — we cannot do our jobs well.”\n\nAs <a href=\"https://twitter.com/briansolis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brian Solis</a> wrote at Forbes recently, the <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/briansolis/2020/07/09/in-an-era-of-covid-19-disruption-brands-must-rethink-marketing-as-empathetic-customer-experiences/#186775907aa1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">need for empathetic customer experiences is greater than ever</a> in the age of COVID-19 disruption. People have so much going on in their lives, and are facing so many unprecedented difficulties, that a myopic brand-centric focus is all the more untenable. “Traditional marketing will no longer have the same effect moving forward,” he argues. “If anything, it will negatively affect customer relationships rather than enhance them.”\n\nAgreed. So, let’s find a better way.\n<h2>Engaging with True Empathy in the New Era of Marketing</h2>\nImagine if it was possible to sit down and have an in-depth conversation with each one of your customers and potential customers. You’d gain first-hand insight into their worldviews, their challenges, their hopes and dreams.\n\nSadly, it’s not possible. You don’t have the time, nor do your customers. (Although I do recommend making a habit of engaging in direct, candid conversations with them when possible.) To make empathy scalable, marketers need to take advantage of all the tools at their disposal. This largely requires <a href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/2017/12/data-customer-experience/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">using data to connect the dots</a>.\n\n“It’s critical for marketers to have a real-time 360 view and understanding of a customer’s full journey, at every stage, from discovery to engagement to retention and loyalty to advocacy,” Solis wrote at Forbes.\n\nHere are some suggestions for obtaining such a view:\n\n<b>Use empathy-mapping. </b>This practice, explained in a <a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/empathy-mapping/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">helpful primer from Nielsen Norman Group</a>, involves creating a visualization of attitudes and behaviors to guide decision-making. Empathy-mapping originated in the world of UX design, but given how much user experience and customer experience now overlap, it’s becoming a powerful tool for marketers.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28806\" src=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/EmpathyMap600w.png\" alt=\"Empathy Map\" width=\"570\" height=\"602\" />\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">(Source: <a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/empathy-mapping/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nielsen Norman Group</a>)</p>\n<b>Coordinate and integrate your organizational efforts.</b> Every customer-facing function in a company — marketing, sales, customer service — sees the customer from a different perspective. Seek ways to bring all these perspectives together into one centralized, holistic view. Per Solis: “Cross-functional collaboration is a mandate. As such, integration will become the new standard and will quickly become table stakes as every company rushes in this direction.”\n\n<b>Tap into meaningful influencer relationships.</b> Influencers can play a key role in empathetic marketing because they have relationships and perspectives extending beyond our brand ecosystems. If they align with your audience, influencers can bring unique insight and connect at deeper levels. <a href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/2018/12/influencer-marketing-mechanical-meaningful/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Turning influencer engagements from mechanical to meaningful</a> is essential to accomplishing this.\n\nIncidentally, Mr. Solis recently partnered with TopRank Marketing on the first-ever <a href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/2020/07/b2b-influencer-marketing-2020\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">State of B2B Influencer Marketing</a> report, in which our friend Ann Handley summarizes the impact quite well: “You could call yourself a good parent or a world-class marketer or an empathetic friend ... but any of those things would carry more weight coming from your child, customer, or BFF. So it is with integrating influencer content: It's a direct line to building trust and customer confidence.”\n\n<b>Research and engage with topics that matter to your customers outside of their jobs.</b> Given the connotations of B2B, it’s all too easy to isolate our customer research around what they do professionally. But these are human beings with lives outside of work. To drive powerful engagement, marketers should search for the cross-sections between their brand’s purpose and values, and what matters to their customers.\n\nA good example of this is found in the <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/think/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">IBM THINK Blog</a>, which is “dedicated to chronicling the fast-moving world of cognitive computing” and covers many important societal topics. (Recent focuses include a post on gender pronouns and a corporate environmental report.)\n<h2>Examples of Empathetic B2B Marketing</h2>\nWho’s getting it right and paving the way for a more empathy-driven approach to engaging B2B audiences? Here are a few examples:\n<ul>\n \t<li>My post on <a href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/2018/12/b2b-brands-talking-consumers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">seven B2B brands that talk to consumers, not companies</a> highlights several instances of an authentic and relatable human tone shining through.</li>\n \t<li>It goes without saying that the video-conferencing service Zoom stumbled into a massive business opportunity with the dramatic pivot to remote work this year. The company could simply try to cash in and maximize that opportunity, but instead, they’re doubling down on building trust. Zoom’s CEO Eric S. Yuan recently wrote about his roots in China in <a href=\"https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360039993092-Zoom-s-Commitment-to-User-Support-Business-Continuity-During-the-Coronavirus-Outbreak\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">articulating his organization’s support for this embattled region of the world</a>, noting that Zoom is providing expanded features for free accounts and offering accessible resources and education. He also <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2020/03/13/zoom-video-coronavirus-eric-yuan-schools/#5be1772b4e71\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">made the company’s tools free to K-12 schools</a> (a potentially lucrative customer base) in March.</li>\n</ul>\nSeeing human faces brings an instantly relatable element to any B2B campaign. That’s why <a href=\"https://news.microsoft.com/stories/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Microsoft’s Story Labs microsite</a>, which frames some of the company’s initiatives and guiding principles around real people and their stories, is so effective.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28807\" src=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/MicrosoftStoryLabsImage600w.png\" alt=\"Microsoft Story Labs\" width=\"600\" height=\"372\" />\n<h2>Let Empathy Guide Your B2B Marketing Strategy</h2>\nIn order to walk in someone else’s shoes, you first need to untie and remove your own. Making empathy a core strategic pillar requires marketers to take a step back, disconnect from their ingrained perceptions and assumptions, and get fully in tune with the people they serve.\n\nOnly then can we create the type of relevant and personalized experiences that drive deep and long-lasting brand engagement.\n\nFor more tips that will help your business-oriented content strike notes of genuine empathy, read Josh Nite’s blog post on <a href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/2020/02/humanize-b2b-content-marketing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">5 Ways to Humanize B2B Marketing</a>.\n\n&#160;<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/2020/07/boosting-and-deepening-engagement-through-empathy-in-b2b-marketing/\">Boosting and Deepening Engagement through Empathy in B2B Marketing</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com\">Online Marketing Blog - TopRank®</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/OnlineMarketingSEOBlog?a=WeZnr5lpjhc:grfsum1Hkzc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/OnlineMarketingSEOBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/OnlineMarketingSEOBlog/~4/WeZnr5lpjhc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 10:30:43 +0000","feedId":1311,"bgimg":"https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/BoostingEngagementWithEmpathyImageA600w.jpg","linkMd5":"bc3d3fe5db193a6027c7b6a533457ee0","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn96@2020_2/2020/08/24/14-15-22-298_8829d01fc007f72b.webp","destWidth":600,"destHeight":360,"sourceBytes":64000,"destBytes":26538,"author":"Nick Nelson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/BoostingEngagementWithEmpathyImageA600w.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn96@2020_2/2020/08/24/14-15-22-298_8829d01fc007f72b.webp","https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/EmpathyMap600w.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn26@2020_4/2020/08/24/14-15-25-190_cc244050b7d0d821.webp","https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/MicrosoftStoryLabsImage600w.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn76@2020_5/2020/08/24/14-15-26-562_345741a9bc22c5f6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/OnlineMarketingSEOBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn11@2020_5/2020/08/24/14-15-22-140_b75958f276086430.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/OnlineMarketingSEOBlog/~4/WeZnr5lpjhc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn95@2020_2/2020/08/24/14-15-25-201_9bac63160ebd876d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598278521889},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 22:15:21","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 22:15:21","title":"For Successful B2B Marketers The Engine of Influence is Always On #B2BIMReport","link":"https://www.toprankblog.com/?p=28838","description":"<p><img width=\"600\" height=\"323\" src=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/engine-b2b-influence-always-on.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"B2B Engine of Influence Always On\" srcset=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/engine-b2b-influence-always-on.jpg 600w, https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/engine-b2b-influence-always-on-300x162.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28851\" src=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/engine-b2b-influence-always-on.jpg\" alt=\"B2B Engine of Influence Always On\" width=\"600\" height=\"323\" />\n\nAs the need for B2B brands to reach and connect authentically with customers rises, B2B influencer marketers are evolving from transactional and intermittent campaigns to more relationship driven, <a href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/2020/04/always-on-influence/\">Always-On Influencer engagement</a> programs as our research from the <a href=\"http://download.influencermarketingreport.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2020 State of B2B Influencer Marketing repor</a>t found:\n<ul>\n \t<li>19% are piloting</li>\n \t<li>25% run periodic campaigns</li>\n \t<li>34% use an Always-On approach</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Transactional campaign approaches are hard pressed to develop brand loyalty and advocacy</strong>. That's why, with 84% of B2B marketers focused on building brand awareness with their influencer marketing efforts, that ongoing influencer engagement has become essential for creating vested relationships that inspire more qualitative activations and brand advocacy.\n\n<strong>The Engine of Influence needs to run ongoing</strong> in order to win relationships with the most trusted voices. Our findings amongst B2B marketers have found several interesting insights when it comes to an Always-On approach to influencer relations compared to campaigns, the best practices followed and what Always-On influence in action really looks like.\n\n<a href=\"http://download.influencermarketingreport.com\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28850\" src=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/Stat-60-AlwaysOn-B2B-Influencer-Marketing.jpg\" alt=\"60% of B2B marketers who use Always-On Influencer Marketing programs are very successful vs. 5% who only use periodic campaigns.\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" /></a>\n<h3>Influencer Marketing is a Relationship Business</h3>\nDistractions and competition for attention with B2B customers are at an all-time high. At the same time, B2B marketers are challenged to find the right strategies to maximize resources and marketing impact. Our research found that 76% of B2B marketers find the strategy of working with influencers through Always-On engagement or a combination of Always-On and campaigns, delivers results.\n\nIn the world of business, many decisions are made based on emotion, brand strength and the trust of expert voices. B2B marketers who build relationships with trusted experts understand the value of having brand advocates engage authentically with hard to reach audiences that increasingly discount brand communications. An Always-On approach to influencer marketing provides a framework for finding, engaging and elevating relationships with those very experts that customers trust and want to hear from.\n<h3>The Always-On Imperative for B2B Brands</h3>\nIn today’s uncertain environment, brand reach and credibility are more important than ever. Some of the top B2B brands in the world have invested in developing communities of industry experts through Always-On influencer marketing that they can count on for social engagement, event activations, and brand advocacy.\n\nOur research found that B2B marketers using an Always-On influencer marketing strategy are seeing important benefits including:\n<ul>\n \t<li>75% Increased views of brand content</li>\n \t<li>60% Increased share of voice</li>\n \t<li>55% Increased media mentions of brand</li>\n \t<li>50% Increased brand advocacy</li>\n</ul>\nBuyers want to trust the brands they work with and with brand trust at a low, it’s important for B2B companies to invest in relationships with credible experts that buyers do trust.\n\n<a href=\"http://download.influencermarketingreport.com\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28849\" src=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/Garnor-Morantes-B2BInfluence-Always-On-Quote.jpg\" alt=\"Garnor Morantes Always-On Influence Quote\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" /></a>\n<blockquote>Being \"always-on\" has allowed our team to build meaningful relationships with influencers. This approach means that the relationship ceases to be \"transactional\" (what can you do for us) when we're in a state of ongoing activity. Because of this foundation, we are in a situation where, when urgency strikes, we've been able to immediately activate influencers, whether it be for private, direct, unfiltered feedback and consult, or for external, public-facing advocacy and amplification. B2B brands would be wise to adopt an always-on influencer engagement approach as they look to build true brand advocates.\n<strong>Garnor Morantes, Group Marketing Manager, LinkedIn</strong></blockquote>\nTo learn about how LinkedIn built trust and advocacy with Always-On Influence and achieving promising results including:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Nearly 2,000 brand mentions by influencers and their networks</li>\n \t<li>84M in potential reach from brand mentions by influencers</li>\n \t<li>200-450% above benchmark engagement on one social influencer activation</li>\n</ul>\n<a href=\"https://bit.ly/30R0VYT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">see this Always-On Influencer Marketing case study</a>.\n<h3>How Always-On Influence Drives Marketing Results</h3>\nAlway-On Influencer Marketing is the practice of ongoing relationship building, engagement and activation of a specified group of influencers to build community, content and brand advocacy that is of mutual value to the brand, its customers and the influencers.\n\nFrom a confidence standpoint, 94% of B2B marketers using an Always-On influencer engagement strategy believe influencer marketing will grow in importance over the next 12 months vs. 73% of marketers who focus on campaigns.\n\nThat confidence is reflected in marketing budgets as well. 89% of B2B marketers implementing Always-On influencer programs expect their budgets to increase or remain the same vs. 73% for marketers running campaign based programs. 28% Always-On influencer programs spend more than $100,000 per year vs. 8% for marketers running campaigns.\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Always On Influencer Marketing is a strategic approach to creating communities of trusted experts that is relationship and content focused.</h2>\n</blockquote>\nThose relationships are nurtured over time through ongoing engagement and activations that create value for buyers, the brand and the influencers – it is truly an “everybody wins” approach to marketing.\n<h3>Then Engine of Influence is Always-On</h3>\nInfluencer Marketing is a relationship business and an Always-On influencer engagement strategy helps B2B brands turn those connections with trusted experts into marketing results.\n<blockquote>\n<h2>60% of B2B marketers who use Always-On Influencer Marketing programs are very successful vs. 5% who only use periodic campaigns.</h2>\n</blockquote>\nAlways-On Influencer Marketing elevates influencer engagement from mechanical to meaningful, from transactional to relationship focused. As a result, brands like LinkedIn are able to activate their community on-demand. “When urgency strikes, we've been able to immediately activate influencers,” says Garnor Morantes of LinkedIn,”B2B brands would be wise to adopt an always-on influencer engagement approach as they look to build true brand advocates.”\n\n<strong>An Always-On Influencer Marketing strategy creates a win for everyone.</strong> With a framework that goes beyond influencer content marketing campaigns to partnering with industry experts to drive conversations and advocacy, an Always-On approach builds brand awareness, and inspires customers to trust and engage with the business.\n\nThis post is an excerpt from the 2020 <a href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/2020/07/b2b-influencer-marketing-2020/\">State of B2B Influencer Marketing Report.</a> To learn more about the current state of B2B Influencer Marketing, including strategies, tactics, challenges, software, operations, integration and predictions for the future, <a href=\"http://download.influencermarketingreport.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">access our new report here</a>.\n\n<a href=\"http://download.influencermarketingreport.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28759\" src=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020-state-b2b-influencer-marketing-report-toprank-marketing.jpg\" alt=\"B2B Influencer Marketing Report 2020\" width=\"600\" height=\"336\" /></a><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/2020/08/engine-influence-always-on/\">For Successful B2B Marketers The Engine of Influence is Always On #B2BIMReport</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com\">Online Marketing Blog - TopRank®</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/OnlineMarketingSEOBlog?a=1Nhq7xqm1h4:QBJqpi5EYZg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/OnlineMarketingSEOBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/OnlineMarketingSEOBlog/~4/1Nhq7xqm1h4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 05 Aug 2020 13:30:20 +0000","feedId":1311,"bgimg":"https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/engine-b2b-influence-always-on.jpg","linkMd5":"10d56be7dd191e05c598dbf602763d97","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn40@2020_1/2020/08/24/14-15-22-277_34434931f052d9ff.webp","destWidth":600,"destHeight":323,"sourceBytes":41684,"destBytes":24362,"author":"Lee Odden","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/engine-b2b-influence-always-on.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn40@2020_1/2020/08/24/14-15-22-277_34434931f052d9ff.webp","https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/Stat-60-AlwaysOn-B2B-Influencer-Marketing.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn45@2020_4/2020/08/24/14-15-25-331_818efa5602a7a773.webp","https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/Garnor-Morantes-B2BInfluence-Always-On-Quote.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn31@2020_3/2020/08/24/14-15-26-339_8d2554368c6f6e53.webp","https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020-state-b2b-influencer-marketing-report-toprank-marketing.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn47@2020_4/2020/08/24/14-15-26-502_d0bebfadafe12749.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/OnlineMarketingSEOBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn11@2020_5/2020/08/24/14-15-22-140_b75958f276086430.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/OnlineMarketingSEOBlog/~4/1Nhq7xqm1h4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn14@2020_6/2020/08/24/14-15-25-218_f5bbaed5c1f433d3.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598278521883},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 22:15:21","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 22:15:21","title":"How to Optimize Original B2B Research Content For Credibility and Impact","link":"https://www.toprankblog.com/?p=28916","description":"<p><img width=\"600\" height=\"318\" src=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/optimize-research-impact.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"Optimize Original Research Content\" srcset=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/optimize-research-impact.jpg 600w, https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/optimize-research-impact-300x159.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28917\" src=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/optimize-research-impact.jpg\" alt=\"Optimize Original Research Content\" width=\"600\" height=\"318\" />\n\nFor many in the B2B marketing world, original research provides an effective way to build thought leadership and drive content for owned and earned media.\n\nUnfortunately, many research reports from B2B companies are dry, uninspired and focus solely on pontifications from the brand point of view. Such unremarkable content isn't helping customers, especially if they never see it due to information overload or they don't trust it.\n<blockquote>\n<h2>“With more information, options and people involved in a buying process, buyers are paralyzed when trying to move forward.” <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/what-sales-should-know-about-modern-b2b-buyers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gartner</a></h2>\n</blockquote>\nFortunately, there's a better way.\n\nMore often than not, B2B research reports have marketing objectives focused on building brand thought leadership, attracting new names for nurturing and to serve as a resource for sales. Since most B2B brands don't have the credibility and distribution to reach their marketing goals on their own with such reports, they rely on advertising and PR to attract attention.\n\nAds and PR are fine complements to content. But they're even more effective if that content delivers an experience that is includes built-in credibility and distribution to the the audiences that are probably ignoring most marketing and advertising.\n\nHow can you optimize research report content to deliver this kind of experience?\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Brands that co-create experiential content with relevant experts and influencers can build industry confidence, grow brand trust, create a more effective digital customer experience and drive business growth.</h2>\n</blockquote>\nWhat does that kind of research report collaboration content process look like?\n\nB2B marketers have included quotes from industry experts in their reports for many years - but most do not. However there are many more ways to engage with credible voices that have the trust and attention of the audience you're after.\n\nFor example, you might partner with a mix of industry experts, influential customers and people who work at brands that represent your ideal clients to add perspective to original research.  Adding that expertise isn't enough. The content itself should be packaged as an experience. Whether it's interactive or just well-designed, research content doesn't have to be boring.\n\nI think our <a href=\"http://download.influencermarketingreport.com\">latest research report</a> on B2B Influencer Marketing is a perfect example of this.\n\n<a href=\"http://download.influencermarketingreport.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28786\" src=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/b2bimreport20-preview.gif\" alt=\"B2B Influencer Marketing Report Preview\" width=\"600\" height=\"334\" /></a>\n\nWe partnered with 20+ B2B brand marketing executives and influencers to provide perspective on the key issues surfaced by the research. Instead of the report being authored by me (with some help from my team), there are contributions from influential B2B brands that include:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Dell</li>\n \t<li>SAP</li>\n \t<li>LinkedIn</li>\n \t<li>AT&#38;T Business</li>\n</ul>\nThere are also insights provided by some of the top B2B influencers in the industry including:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Brian Solis</li>\n \t<li>Ann Handley</li>\n \t<li>Tamara McCleary</li>\n \t<li>Mark Schaefer</li>\n</ul>\nPulling together credible voices to join your own in an experiential piece of content is far more likely to be shared by contributors and your community, looked at by industry media and potential customers, and actually used by your sales people in their communications with prospects.\n\nSuch a rich content experience can deliver far more value than a one time campaign, especially if you roll it out in phases.\n\nFor example, you might extend the value of original research by implementing a phased content approach. For example:\n\n<strong>The first phase</strong> might be the co-creation and publishing of the original research with industry experts and clients.  Promotion would focus mostly on owned channels, organic social and private channels like email, forums, etc.\n\n<strong>The second phase</strong> could emphasize earned media and extensions of the narratives highlighted by the research. Names captured can be nurtured with useful resources that go deeper on the topics and a video interview series with the experts who contributed would feature more in-depth conversations around the key report findings. Online events and some useful tools and more visual versions of the original content could also help with promotion hang time.\n\n<strong>The third phase</strong> takes the report content and repurposes it into new formats: explainer videos, a podcast, infographics. An interactive microsite that gives viewers and opportunity to assess themselves against the benchmark data from the research provides an engagement opportunity without substantial investment in new content. The original group of influencers is now expanded to invite more people in those roles to contribute their expertise to content around the report's narratives.\n\nWhat you do specifically for your B2B business is up to you, but publishing original research in white paper format without any 3rd party validation within is simply no longer enough to attract, engage and inspire a meaningful experience or a return on your investment.\n\nCreating a content experience that is credible and that can rely on distribution by its influential contributors on top of brand channels, PR efforts and ad buys will certainly achieve the expected thought leadership, engagement and demand gen goals more effectively. In the case of our report mentioned above, we hit one of our most important 3rd Quarter goals in just the first 2 weeks because of following this advice.\n\nImagine what you could do?\n\n&#160;<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/2020/08/optimize-original-research/\">How to Optimize Original B2B Research Content For Credibility and Impact</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com\">Online Marketing Blog - TopRank®</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/OnlineMarketingSEOBlog?a=xgr0cWO3_xA:yzmch4TqRJE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/OnlineMarketingSEOBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/OnlineMarketingSEOBlog/~4/xgr0cWO3_xA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 10:37:07 +0000","feedId":1311,"bgimg":"https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/optimize-research-impact.jpg","linkMd5":"d58b5fa74087c291534c4fc6ec179b94","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn44@2020_1/2020/08/24/14-15-22-271_9a13574b19c77311.webp","destWidth":600,"destHeight":318,"sourceBytes":40608,"destBytes":24976,"author":"Lee Odden","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/optimize-research-impact.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn44@2020_1/2020/08/24/14-15-22-271_9a13574b19c77311.webp","https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/b2bimreport20-preview.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn6@2020_5/2020/08/24/14-15-43-477_cf980b5c11ff7d67.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/OnlineMarketingSEOBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn11@2020_5/2020/08/24/14-15-22-140_b75958f276086430.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/OnlineMarketingSEOBlog/~4/xgr0cWO3_xA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn64@2020_5/2020/08/24/14-15-25-138_4b4548fbd850be8a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598278521855},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 22:15:21","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 22:15:21","title":"A Day in the Life of a Content Marketer During the Pandemic: Challenges and Tips","link":"https://www.toprankblog.com/?p=28905","description":"<p><img width=\"600\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/DayInTheLifeImageA600w.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"Working at Home with Cat on Laptop\" srcset=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/DayInTheLifeImageA600w.jpg 600w, https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/DayInTheLifeImageA600w-300x180.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28906\" src=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/DayInTheLifeImageA600w.jpg\" alt=\"Working at Home with Cat on Laptop\" width=\"600\" height=\"360\" />\n\nI'll never forget the night that everything <i>really</i> changed.\n\nIt was my wife's birthday, March 11th. I took her out for dinner at a lovely restaurant in South Minneapolis, and for a couple of blissful hours, over exotic cocktails and delicious food, we unplugged from the loudening noise of a worrisome outside world.\n\nAfter we walked out of that restaurant, there would be no more tuning out.\n\nStepping out from the darkly lit building, I looked down at my phone, and tried to process the sudden rush of stunning headlines:\n\nWHO declares global pandemic. NBA suspends season. Trump addresses the nation. Tom Hanks has coronavirus. Tom Hanks!\n\nIt all happened on the same day, like a floodgate bursting. And the ensuing deluge has since uprooted almost every sense of normalcy we once knew. Around that time, I stopped going into work, as did most others around the country. I haven't gone back since, save for the odd trip to water a plant or record a video in an empty office.\n\nTopRank Marketing has been in WFH mode for more than five years now. Sorry, did I say years? Months. Needless to say, I know we are not alone, which is why I thought I'd offer a look at my typical day as a content marketer in the (ugh) \"new normal,\" and share some helpful things I've learned.\n\nWe're all figuring this out as we go.\n<h2>Overcoming New Daily Challenges as a Content Marketer During the Summer of COVID</h2>\nI count myself as a lucky man, for a lot of reasons. One of them is that I can do my job pretty frictionlessly from home. While I miss seeing my coworkers, and there are newfound challenges (as I'll discuss), I'm able to stay productive. In part that’s because I’ve developed my own personal solutions to these WFH hurdles. Maybe some of them can help you.\n<h3>Getting Going in the Morning</h3>\nI'm not what one would call a \"morning person.\" Generally I am rather groggy and cloudy after waking up. In this respect, going into the office was always helpful for me – the routine of showering, getting dressed, prepping some breakfast and coffee, and hopping into the car was inherently awakening.\n\nI can't say I take all those steps on a typical morning anymore. For a while, it was tough, getting in the mindset of traveling from bedroom to living room, and suddenly entering Work Mode. But what I've found helpful is using the morning as a bit of personal zen time. Unless I have early meetings, I'll usually rouse myself gradually, pour some coffee, scroll Twitter, and size up my day. I'll go through my emails, prioritize my tasks, and check in with account managers. This helps me build momentum toward optimal mid-day productivity.\n<blockquote><b><i>Takeaway: </i></b><i>Work/life balance can be tough during these times. (It’s often cited in surveys as one of the biggest challenges for full-time remote workers.) Don’t force yourself to instantly flip a switch. Find a comfortable routine that works for you.</i></blockquote>\n<h3>Managing Distractions and Finding the Zone</h3>\nBeing in the office can bring its own set of distractions, but there are some unique ones associated with working from home. For many people, creating a designated workspace around the house is helpful. Personally, I live in a small apartment with my wife (who’s also working from home), and all of our building’s common areas have been closed, so finding our own space can be a challenge.\n\nThere are no easy answers to this one. Folks who have children home all day have it much worse than me. Especially in creative pursuits like planning and developing content, it’s key to find a zone, and the disruptions of screaming kiddos or a construction worker banging away outside can be anathema when it comes to getting things done.\n\nThe main thing I would advise is this: embrace asynchronous work to the extent possible. This basically refers to operating around your own schedule rather than those of others. For example, if there’s no timely need for me to work on something during the day, and my wife has meetings throughout the afternoon, maybe I’ll set aside a few hours in the evening to dive in.\n<blockquote><b><i>Takeaway:</i></b><i> Flexible work is becoming the new norm. Free yourself from the constrictions of a 9-to-5 workday and determine a schedule that facilitates your best work (while still being there for your teammates and clients as needed).</i></blockquote>\n[bctt tweet=\"“Overcome WFH distractions by embracing asynchronous work to the extent possible.” @NickNelsonMN #ContentMarketing #WFHtips\" username=\"toprank\"]\n<h3>Communicating with Colleagues and Clients</h3>\nIn Buffer’s <a href=\"https://lp.buffer.com/state-of-remote-work-2020\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">State of Remote Work Report 2020</a>, when respondents were asked about their biggest struggle with working remotely, there was a two-way tie for first place:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Collaboration and communication</li>\n \t<li>Loneliness</li>\n</ul>\nNo surprise, as these responses basically tie back to the same ultimate downside of working away from our coworkers: disconnection and isolation. Collaboration is vital to producing the best work possible, as I rely on the talents and smarts of my teammates to enhance my own efforts.\n\nThere is no way to replicate the energy and organic spontaneity of working in the physical proximity of your coworkers. My best recommendation is finding varied ways to coordinate and communicate. Don’t rely on just one channel. Slack is good, and Zoom is good, but both can cause fatigue when overdone. Try different methods of collaborating, like generating ideas with a teammate simultaneously in a Google Doc, or even jumping on the good ol’-fashioned telephone.\n\nOne more thing: carve out “do not disturb” zones. When you’re in the office, you can plug in your headphones and signal that you’re focusing. Work with your team to create similar arrangements in the WFH, where this is far more ambiguous. You might even collectively decide on a consistent portion of the day where no meetings are scheduled and expectations for responsiveness are lowered (for us at TopRank, this is from noon to one every afternoon).\n<blockquote><b><i>Takeaway: </i></b><i>Maintaining consistent and constructive communication is one of the toughest challenges for distributed teams. The best way to foster remote collaboration is to … collaborate. Work together to develop practices and protocols that best align with everyone’s preferences.</i></blockquote>\n[bctt tweet=\"“The best way to foster remote collaboration is to … collaborate. Work together to develop practices and protocols that best align with everyone’s preferences.” @NickNelsonMN #ContentMarketing #WFHtips\" username=\"toprank\"]\n<h3>Breaking Up the Day</h3>\nMonotony can be one of the biggest inhibitors of creativity and productivity in WFH settings. There is a natural variety that plays out when you go into the office: interacting with different people, moving between meeting rooms, maybe running out for coffee or lunch as a change of scenery. Working from home, especially at a time where we’re all encouraged to quarantine and avoid public places, can really make the hours and days run together.\n\nThis leads to one of the biggest benefits I’ve discovered in the altered routine. It is now much easier to get out and get active. Sure, we’d occasionally go out for team walks when we were in the office, but without the ability to shower and change clothes I wasn’t exactly going out for intense exercise. And by the time I got home, I was often too tuckered out.\n\nNow, I find myself getting out for a run, bike ride, or brisk walk almost every afternoon. It’s rejuvenating for body and mind. One silver lining of this pandemic is its timing; at least it struck as the summer was getting underway, which has allowed me to enjoy a lot of nice weather outdoors.\n<blockquote><b><i>Takeaway:</i></b><i> Find activities you enjoy to break up your workday and keep your mind fresh. Whether it’s exercise, a hobby, or simply unplugging, working from home provides the freedom to step away. And embracing asynchronicity enables you to distribute your work throughout the day.</i></blockquote>\n<h2>For Better or Worse… There’s No Place Like Home</h2>\nPlenty of people have been working from home full-time for years, and have developed their own habits and routines to optimize for it. But for many, like myself and surely many reading this, it’s something we’ve had to learn on the fly, out of necessity.\n\nThe good news is that our adaptations during this time will benefit us and our companies going forward. I am in full agreement with our clients at Sococo, who make a strong evidence-based argument that <a href=\"https://www.sococo.com/managing-distributed-teams-new-reality/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">distributed work is here to stay</a> and will forever be part of our reality going forward.

The very idea of these interviews seems weird now — we were just sitting! Three feet apart! With no masks! At a giant marketing conference at a hotel!</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The cancellation of in-person events means I’ll miss one or two conferences this year. But for folks who make a living as keynote speakers and thought leaders, it’s a massive adjustment. And that includes a sizable subset of B2B influencers — those who are primarily keynote speakers and in-person consultants.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an agency, we’re true believers in </span><a href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/2020/07/b2b-influencer-marketing-2020/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">B2B influencer marketing</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (see our latest report to learn why). But we have had to adjust our strategy as influencers’ needs change. Like everything else in 2020, influencer relationship-building takes a different approach than you might be used to.</span>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dfriez/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Debbie Friez</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is an Influencer Marketing Strategist at TopRank Marketing, and she’s an expert at finding the right influencers and developing ongoing relationships. Here’s what Debbie and I have observed and how we’ve changed our outreach strategy.</span>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to Nurture B2B Influencer Relationships During the Pandemic</span></h1>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Influence relationships operate by much the same rules as any friendship: Get to know the person, don’t talk about yourself too much, give something before you ask for anything, and be sensitive to their emotions and needs. And, of course, don’t propose marriage on the first date (unless it’s going REALLY well).</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On top of those rules, here are a few ways to adjust your approach for the current crisis.</span>\n\n[bctt tweet=\"“Influence relationships operate by much the same rules as any friendship: Get to know the person, don’t talk about yourself too much, give something before you ask for anything, and be sensitive to their emotions and needs.” @NiteWrites\" username=\"toprank\"]\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">#1: Scale Back Your Requests</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s easy to imagine that influencers have nothing but free time right now. After all, they’re not traveling as much, and all the events are virtual — that means they should have ample time to write a blog post or film a webinar, right?</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What we’ve seen, however, is the opposite is true. Those who make a living at public speaking are hustling harder than ever. “Now that all the events are virtual, there is a disconnect between how influencers are compensated,” says Debbie. Instead of a 90-minute in-person talk, influencers might need to do a dozen webinars to make ends meet.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now is a good time to focus on micro-content — keep the requests down to 50-100 words. Where you might have asked one influencer for a 500-word blog, ask three influencers the same question and do a roundup of their answers. Or focus on social-first content that can be bite-sized but still foster engagement.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simply put, it’s more important than ever to respect influencers’ time and make sure your requests are appropriate. Speaking of which…</span>\n\n[bctt tweet=\"“It’s more important than ever to respect influencers’ time and make sure your requests are appropriate.” @NiteWrites\" username=\"toprank\"]\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">#2: Offer a Good Value Exchange</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every good influencer relationship is based on a value exchange. You’re giving the influencer something they want, and getting something you want in return. When you build relationships for long-term, always-on influencer marketing, that value exchange tends to be in terms of co-creating awesome content together, exposure to each others’ audience, and other non-monetary benefits. However, direct compensation is always part of the influencer marketing toolkit.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right now, influencers may see less value in co-creation and be looking for more ways to supplement their income. “Frequently, influencers would co-create content for free, as they were taking payment to speak at or attend events,” Debbie says. With events on pause, it’s important for influencer marketers to budget for the right type of compensation.</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">#3: Be Empathetic </span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you might have noticed, it’s rough out in the world right now. Odds are you’re stressed out, concerned about keeping your family safe and the bills paid. You may even have scaled back on your social media and focused more energy inward. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Influencers are no different. It’s important that your outreach be warm (no blind InMail requests or impersonal emails), sympathetic, and respectful. Just as you’ve adjusted your content marketing to meet your audience’s current mental state, make sure your influencer outreach is appropriate for the times.</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">#4: Offer Creative Opportunities</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Odds are any influencer you reach out to has done multiple webinars, guest blogs, and livestreams in the past six months. And they’re likely filling their calendars with as many more gigs as they can get. What can you offer an influencer that will get their attention?</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now is a good time to pitch fun, creative ideas for content. How about a brief interview that you’ll turn into a fully-produced podcast, complete with background music and sound design? Or a short contribution that will be featured in a dynamic, interactive asset? The easier you can make the ask, and the cooler you can make the end product, the better.</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">#5: Explore Always-On Influence</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you’ve seen, it can be challenging to establish relationships with influencers right now. People are busy, distracted and stressed, and it’s easy for your messages to get lost in the shuffle. It’s not impossible, of course, to add net new influencers to your marketing — it just takes more effort.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right now, brands that have ongoing influencer nurturing programs are doing better than those without. It’s easy to see why — they’re not starting from scratch. They have built up a community of influencers over time, co-creating content, helping each other out, even introducing influencers to each other to help them network. It’s easier to maintain an ongoing relationship than start a brand new one.</span>\n\n[bctt tweet=\"“Right now, brands that have ongoing influencer nurturing programs are doing better than those without.

According to research by <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">HubSpot</a>, 70% of marketers actively investing in content marketing  and there's no sign of a slowdown, especially as <a href=\"https://www.semrush.com/blog/content-marketing-statistics/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SEMrush</a> research has found, marketers are focused on using content to generate more quality leads (75%), attract more traffic to their website (71%), improve brand reputation (56%), and improve customer engagement and loyalty (45%).\n\nThe problem is, many of those marketers are not creating <a href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/01/best-answer-strategy-b2b/\">best answer content experiences</a>. Creating useful content by itself is not an effective strategy in a world of brand distrust, content attention deficit and the distractions brought by a global pandemic. Being the best answer for your customers means being found and also delivering on expectations. Creating findable, credible content that is also useful and experiential is at the center of what being the best answer means for marketers.\n\nContent is the common denominator between the building blocks of creating best answer experiences including <a href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/category/seo/\">SEO</a> and social for <a href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/2020/01/optimize-for-trust/\">findability</a> as well as <a href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/2016/05/what-is-influencer-marketing/\">influencer marketing</a> and earned media for credibility. Video and audio driven content formats and even <a href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/02/examples-interactive-b2b-content/\">interactive</a> are what help deliver on experiences. Unfortunately, many B2B marketers don't have the resources or insight to bring these essential elements together for their content marketing strategy.\n\nTo help create the foundation for providing customers with best answer content experiences, here are 5 steps for developing a more powerful content marketing strategy:\n<h3>Step 1: Ideal Customer Profiles</h3>\nContent Marketing is essentially connecting customers with relevant information in a way that provides mutual value for both customers and brands. While content informs, it also influences readers to the logical conclusion to buy – directly or indirectly.\n\nThe most effective content marketing efforts are thoughtful about understanding the people the brand is trying to engage. To do that, there are a few key questions that should be answered:\n<ul>\n \t<li>What are your customers’ content preferences?</li>\n \t<li>How do they discover, consume &#38; share content?</li>\n \t<li>Who are they influenced by?</li>\n \t<li>What questions do they need answered during the buying cycle?</li>\n \t<li>What content formats are most compelling (audio, video, text, long/short form, interactive)?</li>\n</ul>\nThe answers to questions like these can help B2B marketers make important decisions about their content marketing strategy, social media channels of focus and measurement via social monitoring and web analytics.\n\nDocumenting ideal customer archetypes involves collecting data, aggregating and analyzing it into profiles to help marketers understand expectations, goals, problems and solutions that can be addressed through experiential content.\n\nThe first step is to collect data you already have on existing customers that exemplify ideal characteristics such as profitability, low support costs, referrals and retention. Additional internal sources include web analytics data from brand websites to identify KPIs that lead to ideal customer acquisition. Social media monitoring and analytics data can also provide insight into ideal customer behaviors. Influencer Marketing platforms can help identify the key voices that have the attention of customers on the topics relevant for the brand solution.\n\nAdditional tools include competitive search and social media research services, social media monitoring tools and keyword research tools. You can also survey your customers to identify what social media and content sites they prefer, who they are influenced by and the types of content that is most valuable to them.\n<h3>Step 2: Topics of Influence, Search and Social</h3>\nDriven by a desire to connect customers with the information they need to make B2B buying decisions, content marketers dedicate substantial resources to creating information and media that engage. Understanding target customer interests and the language they use to think about the problem/solution involved with your offering are an important step in optimizing content for discovery through search, social media and influencers.\n\nWith the pandemic driving virtually all B2B activities online, many buyers discover new services through search engines. They also look for recommendations from influencers and discuss what they find via search on social networks, forums and blogs. Search engine optimization best practices call for topic research so that content can be optimized for what’s relevant to customers and the language they actually use when searching for solutions.\n\nBecause B2B buyers are active and influenced by social content, it’s important for B2B marketers to understand social topics as well as search keywords. What buyers search on Google and what they discuss on social networking or Q/A sites like Quora are not always the same.\n\nSEO focused topics help inspire creation and optimization of content for discovery via search engines. Social media focused topics help guide the content and messaging approach on relevant social channels. Topics of influence help marketers identify the people that are most trusted and therefore can be engaged to co-create and promote content to audiences that are interested. This way, when B2B buyers search a category for solutions, they see “Brand 123” in a prominent position. When that buyer looks at social content like blogs, Twitter, LinkedIn or video for the topic, Brand 123 appears there as well. When B2B buyers see their search and social findings match with what they see trusted industry experts advocating and what is covered in industry publications, it creates and incredibly powerful combination.\n<h3>Step 3: Editorial Plan &#38; Content Mapping</h3>\nThe implementation of a content strategy, ideal customer profile and search/social/influencer topics is through the <a href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/07/editorial-calendar-content-marketing/\">Editorial plan</a>. Most B2B marketers engaging in content marketing have adopted the same best practices used by publishers to create engaging information and media for a specific type of audience.\n\nThe Editorial plan covers any kind of content that tells the brand story to the customer segments being targeted. Such content plans factor in original website and blog content, curated content from other sources, influencer contributions, repurposed content from inside the organization and content published on other websites or other brand web properties.\n\nThe editorial plan also influences the content created for social media specific purposes such as blog posts, Tweets, Facebook Status updates, LinkedIn forum posts, YouTube videos, and influencer activations on social channels.\n\nIn order to coordinate the connection between the ideal customer profile guided Editorial Plan and the actual content, it should be mapped. Many SEO practitioners already do this with keywords and associate target keyword phrases with specific web pages or categories of pages. This is useful for making sure all target concepts are accounted for with on-page optimization and can be modified as content or target keywords change. If there is no content for a target keyword to be mapped to, then it’s added to the content creation plan.\n\nMapping content according to the ideal customer profile is very similar. Existing content is audited for its ability to address the information needs of target customers across the buying cycle. If there are gaps, then new content is created to address those needs. In a coordinated Social, SEO Influencer Marketing effort, the Editorial Plan and Content Mapping process occurs first, then the <a href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/04/how-b2b-marketers-can-optimize-content-performance-with-an-seo-audit/\">SEO audit</a>.\n<h3>Step 4: Content Promotion</h3>\n“Build it and they will come”. It’s a well-known and often over-used quote used to describe the fallacy of great content as a marketing tool. Content isn’t great until someone shares it. And they share it, and so on and so on.\n\nWith B2B content marketing, great content is the beginning not the end objective. An effective Content Marketing strategy includes information about the customer, search and social topics as well as topics of influence, editorial plan and a plan for promoting all the high quality content being created.  With content attention deficit and information overload experienced by so many, buyers can easily be distracted. It’s important for B2B brands to stand out and stay connected with findable, credible content that delivers and experience.\n\nHere are four basic reasons for promoting great content as well as making it findable:\n<ol>\n \t<li>Many B2B buyers still rely on information to be pushed to them because finding and trusting new sources on an ongoing basis isn’t practical.</li>\n \t<li>Promoting content through channels where a social network has been developed can lead to exposure, traffic and links.</li>\n \t<li>Content promotion can inspire syndication and citations from other blogs and online media.</li>\n \t<li>Brand trust is an issue, so when credible experts share and advocate, customers listen.</li>\n</ol>\nA particularly effective model for coordinated Social, SEO, Influencer and Content promotion is a Hub and Spoke. Depending on your content strategy and target audience, the hub might be a resource center, a blog, Facebook Fan Page, YouTube Channel or a Website. The spokes are distribution and promotion channels leading to off-site networks or communities.\n\nUnderstanding the communities and influencers and involving them in both content development and promotion keeps topics fresh, relevant and trusted as well as interesting for the community to promote to others.\n<h3>Step 5: Mining Search, Social &#38; Influencer Analytics</h3>\nAs B2B marketers implement a coordinated Best Answer Content Experience effort, there’s a cyclical publishing, promotion, analysis and improvement process that can boost effectiveness: Marketing Optimization.\n\nIt starts by co-creating topic specific content with influencers, optimizing it for search and promoting it to relevant social channels. As the brand content gets noticed, it is shared and engaged with creating more awareness of the brand as a source of useful information on the desired topics. At the same time, a persistent effort is made to grow social network connections and relationships with relevant influencers. Increased exposure of brand-authored content will attract more subscribers, followers, mentions and citations of brand messages. Increased links &#38; social exposure by influencers and social networks will attract even more search, link &#38; social traffic. Increased web traffic &#38; community engagement actions will provide the brand with data that can be used to research, develop &#38; further grow social networks for content, SEO and expand influencer relationships. With the information gained from community data, editorial optimization plans can be refined for more effective content creation, influencer activation, search optimization and content promotion.\n\nWhile these 5 steps are relatively basic for more advanced B2B marketers, hopefully the model will provide you inspiration or fuel to start intentionally and consistently incorporating Influencers, Social Media and SEO in your B2B content marketing. You’ll reach more customers where they’re looking with experiences that will inspire more effective engagement, revenue and retention outcomes.<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/2020/08/b2b-content-marketing-strategy/\">5 Steps for a More Powerful B2B Content Marketing Strategy</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com\">Online Marketing Blog - TopRank®</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/OnlineMarketingSEOBlog?a=fD735OplpS0:iSaYwV48oA8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/OnlineMarketingSEOBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/OnlineMarketingSEOBlog/~4/fD735OplpS0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 13:36:15 +0000","feedId":1311,"bgimg":"https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/powerful-b2b-content-marketing-strategy.jpg","linkMd5":"906b7dc450492bc6c88d8ff4d04be93e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn52@2020_2/2020/08/24/14-15-22-164_72043ebd629ea45e.webp","destWidth":600,"destHeight":338,"sourceBytes":54692,"destBytes":32200,"author":"Lee Odden","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/powerful-b2b-content-marketing-strategy.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn52@2020_2/2020/08/24/14-15-22-164_72043ebd629ea45e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/OnlineMarketingSEOBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn11@2020_5/2020/08/24/14-15-22-140_b75958f276086430.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/OnlineMarketingSEOBlog/~4/fD735OplpS0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn20@2020_1/2020/08/24/14-15-26-089_c870990b79c682ef.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598278521890},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 22:15:21","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 22:15:21","title":"7 B2B Content Marketing Tactics For Long Term Success","link":"https://www.toprankblog.com/?p=28933","description":"<p><img width=\"600\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/LongTermContentMarketingTacticsImageA600w.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"Man running down an infinite road into the sunset image.\" srcset=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/LongTermContentMarketingTacticsImageA600w.jpg 600w, https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/LongTermContentMarketingTacticsImageA600w-300x180.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28934\" src=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/LongTermContentMarketingTacticsImageA600w.jpg\" alt=\"Man running down an infinite road into the sunset image.\" width=\"600\" height=\"360\" />\n\nI have an important question for you:\n\nAthlete A runs a marathon in under 3 hours. Athlete B runs a 40-yard dash in under 5 seconds. Which athlete is more impressive to you?\n\nAthlete A can run the distance, but Athlete B is explosive. ?\n\n<iframe class=\"giphy-embed\" src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/2bUpP71bbVnZ3x7lgQ\" width=\"480\" height=\"401\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\n<a href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/reaction-2bUpP71bbVnZ3x7lgQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">via GIPHY</a>\n\nIf you’re anything like me, you answered that they’re both very impressive.

Well, the most successful <a href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/2016/03/what-is-a-content-marketing-strategy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">content marketing strategies</a> have tactics that cover those two qualities: endurance and power. AKA long-term <i>and</i> short-term tactics.\n\nFor content marketing to be successful, you need those flashy, attention-grabbing campaigns to meet immediate goals. But you also need reliable, consistent, thought-provoking content to compound results over time. Below, I share the B2B content marketing tactics that combine for the greatest long-term success.\n\n[bctt tweet=\"“The most successful content marketing strategies have tactics that cover two qualities: endurance and power. AKA long-term and short-term tactics.” — Annie Leuman @annieleuman\" username=\"toprank\"]\n<h2>7 of the Best B2B Content Marketing Tactics</h2>\n<h3>Long-Term B2B Content Marketing Tactics</h3>\n<h4>Tactic #1 - Blog Content</h4>\nWhen it comes to tried and true tactics, blogging takes the cake. Blogging is some 26-years old and still drives amazing results. In fact, a<a href=\"https://www.semrush.com/blog/content-marketing-statistics/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> recent survey from SEMrush</a> found that it remains the most popular content type with 86% of marketers responding that it is the most important content type they create. Considering how much we marketers value optimization and data, we wouldn’t still be writing blog posts in 2020 if they didn’t drive results.\n\nHow is blogging a long-term tactic, though? Well, similar to most long-term tactics, once you start you can’t stop. A blog is a brand-owned channel and a valuable resource of relevant knowledge for your customers and prospects. Stop publishing there, and it stops being that reliable source of brand perspectives and information.\n\n<b>All out of new blog content ideas? Read these </b><a href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/2018/10/efficient-content-creation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b>tips for more efficient content creation</b></a><b> from TopRank Marketing CEO, Lee Odden.</b>\n<h4>Tactic #2 - Social Media Content</h4>\nBack in 2019, <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/433871/daily-social-media-usage-worldwide/#:~:text=As%20of%202019%2C%20the%20average,minutes%20in%20the%20previous%20year.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Statista reported</a> the average person spent 144 minutes per day on social media. I can only imagine that number has gone up in 2020 due to the COVID-19 health crisis. In marketing, you go where your audience is, making social media content a must for any brand both B2B and B2C.\n\nAnd once again, your social media content needs to be consistent over the long term if you’re to grow your social media following into the connected group of prospects, customers, and partners that you desire. Furthermore, social media content requires constant monitoring so you’re able to capitalize on timely topics and discussions that happen on social media platforms in real time. Growing your audience on social media is a laborious and lengthy process, but it’s easily worth it to have an engaged following, ready to consume the content you distribute and promote on your platforms of choice.\n\n<b>How should you approach social media listening in the age of coronavirus? We have some </b><a href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/2020/04/active-social-media-listening-during-covid-19/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b>tips for you that should help</b></a><b>. </b>\n<h4>Tactic #3 - Influencer Content</h4>\nRead any other marketing blog and an influencer marketing campaign is probably classified as an ad-hoc, short-term tactic. However, here at <a href=\"https://www.toprankmarketing.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TopRank Marketing</a>, we believe in an <a href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/2020/04/always-on-influence/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">always-on approach to influencer marketing</a>.\n\nThink about it this way: do you approach personal relationships as a one and done interaction? No, relationships require nurturing and frequent interactions in order to grow and solidify. We believe influencer relationships, and therefore influencer marketing, needs to be approached in the same way. With nurturing. With empathy. Influencers are people, too, you know.\n\n<b>Not sure what always-on influencer marketing looks like? View </b><a href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/2020/05/5-always-on-b2b-influencer-marketing-examples/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b>these 5 examples</b></a><b>. </b>\n<h4>Tactic #4 - Podcast Content</h4>\nStarting a podcast is not for the faint of heart. It involves working with a new medium: audio. It involves publishing across several channels: Spotify, Apple Podcasts, Stitcher, etc. It involves securing guests. It involves creating thoughtful episodes. And, most importantly, it involves creating a show listeners want to tune into week after week.\n\nIt is because a podcast is intended to be a continual show or series that it’s one of our favorite B2B content marketing tactics. Here at TopRank, we think of our podcasts like TV shows. Each podcast has several seasons made up of carefully designed episodes that match the theme of the season. This allows us to use each episode and each season as a chance to further grow and engage our listeners.\n\n<b>If you’re wondering how you can launch your B2B podcast, </b><a href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/2019/10/launching-b2b-podcast/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b>start with these 10 steps.</b></a>\n<h3>Short-Term B2B Content Marketing Tactics</h3>\n<h4>Tactic #5 - Sponsored &#38; Guest Content</h4>\nAs stated above, blog content is extremely valuable. But when posted on a brand-owned blog, you’re limiting the exposure of your content to the people who already know or follow your brand. To reach a larger audience, you need to turn outward. And while more social media or email promotion could help — if it’s on a brand-owned channel you’re still limited to people who already follow you. So what about reaching a new audience?\n\nThis is where sponsored or guest content can help you reach a new audience and expand your reach in the short-term. By posting content on a different channel, you’re exposing your content and thought leadership to a different audience. For example, you can secure placement on publications in a new target vertical or write a guest post on an expert’s blog. These are one-time placements, making this tactic drive short-term results, but the pay-off of greater reach and exposure is definitely worth it.\n\n<b>But wait </b>—<b> isn’t that just advertising? We explain the great </b><a href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/2015/04/content-vs-advertising/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b>content vs. advertising debate here</b></a><b>. </b>\n<h4>Tactic #6 - Digital Advertising Content</h4>\nMarketers have the seemingly impossible task of delivering the right message, at the right time, to the right audience, in the right channel. That’s a lot to ask. And it’s reaching that right audience that can be really hard to do with the long-term tactics above. Like I said, using brand-owned channels can make it tough to reach a new audience.\n\nLuckily, digital advertising content is a great short-term tactic that can help you target your ideal audience with the right message, at the right time, in the right channel. From native social media advertising to traditional display ads, these ad campaigns can help you spread your message in the short-term.\n\n<b>Digital advertising is best when paired with content marketing. Learn more about </b><a href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/2017/01/harmony-digital-advertising-content-marketing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b>how to marry the two tactics here.</b></a><b> </b>\n<h4>Tactic #7 - eBooks, Infographics, and Larger Content Campaigns</h4>\nCampaigns, like eBooks, infographics, and interactive assets, have a beginning, a middle, and an end. Because campaigns aren’t designed to last forever — you need one to end for another to begin — they make it onto our short-term tactics list.\n\nWhy are they a great short-term tactic? You can pack <i>a ton</i> of information and insight into a content marketing campaign. Plus, you can use a wide mix of media and strategies like influencers, video, audio, interactivity, and more to drive powerful engagement among your audience. They aren’t built to last, but they are built to pack a punch.\n<h2>Birds of a Feather Flock Together</h2>\nThe best B2B content marketing strategies use a mix of the tactics above for both long- and short-term success. Short-term tactics help raise awareness for the long-term tactics. And long-term tactics help build up a loyal, engaged audience for future short-term campaigns. In other words, you need both. There’s a mutually beneficial relationship between all content marketing tactics. So use the list above to start plotting your course to B2B content marketing success.\n\nHungry for even more B2B content marketing tactics?

Many of the decisions we made personally and as marketers in the days and weeks following the declaration of a pandemic were made with limited information.\n\nAs an agency, we focused on how to adapt our own day-to-day operations and plans, while helping our clients shift theirs. As time has gone by, and we start to understand more the potential long-term impacts this crisis could have, we are still adapting. However, now is the opportunity — not to be reactive — but to continue to invest in the future.\n\n<a href=\"https://emtemp.gcom.cloud/ngw/globalassets/en/marketing/documents/research-gartner-cmo_spend_2020_research_part1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">44% of CMOs</a> reported midyear budget cuts in 2020. Most of these cuts focused on the short-term need to free up cash flow. This included cutting in-person events, media buys, and contract staff. Many of us were optimistic the economic impact of COVID-19 would be short lived and spending would rebound quickly. Given the immediacy and unexpectedness of the budget changes, there was likely less consideration of the long-term impact of certain adjustments.\n\nWhile we are still facing uncertainty, most CMOs are optimistic about spending in 2021. As we set our sights on next year already, there is an opportunity to plan for flexibility in a way which will maximize our impact in 2021. How can we accomplish that? Here are five considerations to make as you plan your 2021 marketing budget.\n\n[bctt tweet=\"“As we set our sights on next year already, there is an opportunity to plan for flexibility in a way which will maximize our impact in 2021.” — Alexis Hall @Alexis5484\" username=\"toprank\"]\n<h2>#1 - Speed Up Your Planning Cycle</h2>\nYou already know that you’ll need to be flexible as you approach your 2021 budget planning. Let’s be frank, it’s unlikely that a “set and forget” 2021 annual plan will be successful as we continue to face uncertainty and rapid change within the market. Planning is still critical, but instead our attention needs to be on how to speed up your planning cycle. The more quickly you are able to analyze and adjust the implementation of your plan, the more you will be able to successfully navigate impending changes.\n<h3>How to Speed Up Your Planning Cycle</h3>\n<ol>\n \t<li><b>Create an annual plan.</b> Go ahead and create those high level targets for your marketing budget and outcomes, as well as your tactical plan. Setting these targets will help you continue to pace toward your long term goals and always create a feedback mechanism regarding the success of your plan.</li>\n \t<li><b>Set up quarterly and monthly reviews.</b> Determine now what metrics you’ll analyze on a monthly and quarterly basis. Focus on leading indicators, for example a reduction in web traffic may be a leading indicator of a decrease in leads. If a leading indicator is not meeting a goal, then you have the opportunity to adjust your tactical plan.</li>\n \t<li><b>Speed up time to market</b>. Very large campaigns, which take months of up front investment of time, resources and budget dollars, may not be most practical right now. You can still plan a large scale campaign, but smaller units enable you to get into the market as soon as possible. This can help you gauge audience response, analyze, and adjust as needed and drive impact now.</li>\n</ol>\n[bctt tweet=\"“Planning is still critical, but instead our attention needs to be on how to speed up your planning cycle.” — Alexis Hall @Alexis5484\" username=\"toprank\"]\n<h2>#2 - Focus on ROI</h2>\nAn emphasis on understanding and driving tactical planning based on return on investment has been a priority for CMOs for a while now, but in 2021 it will be more imperative than ever. Line items which are unproven when it comes to driving revenue and margin, are most likely to be cut. It is critical to show the outcome of marketing as a department, but also understand the impact of individual line items.\n<h3>How to Hone In on ROI</h3>\n<ol>\n \t<li><b>Invest in analytics. </b>To understand ROI you must invest in the tools to track outcomes, as well as the talent to manage it. Tracking back to revenue can be complex, especially if you, like many organizations, are facing a lot of disparate systems that don’t necessarily speak to each other. Create a plan which will move you closer to that end outcome.</li>\n \t<li><b>Drive your team to value efficiency metrics.</b> With the right analytics and planning sessions in place, you can drive your team to analyze and adjust tactics which will drive the highest return.</li>\n</ol>\n[bctt tweet=\"“To understand ROI you must invest in the tools to track outcomes, as well as the talent to manage it.” — Alexis Hall @Alexis5484\" username=\"toprank\"]\n<h2>#3 - Understand Your Priorities</h2>\nWhether or not you’re optimistic about spending in 2021, it’s important to be prepared for adjustments to your marketing budget midyear. 2020 midyear budget adjustments forced many marketers to prioritize short-term cash flow and what could be easily paused. In 2021, be prepared to adjust budgets based on impact. It’s critical to understand which marketing activities are essential versus those that you could afford to decrease.\n<h3>How to Understand Your Priorities:</h3>\n<ol>\n \t<li><b>Determine what makes certain activities more critical than others.</b> ROI is definitely important here, but not the only lens. Other things to evaluate are how important that activity is for growth, creating part of your differentiation strategy or is it critical to reduce risk.</li>\n \t<li><b>Evaluate and force rank.</b> Creating a system to really understand which activities are most important to driving impact will set you up to adjust based on what is most important to you. You may decide this is a helpful exercise to review quarterly.</li>\n \t<li><b>Create contingency budgets. </b>These back-up budgets will help you understand exactly how you would adjust based on either increases or decreases to your budget.</li>\n</ol>\n[bctt tweet=\"“In 2021, be prepared to adjust budgets based on impact. It’s critical to understand which marketing activities are essential versus those that you could afford to decrease.” — Alexis Hall @Alexis5484\" username=\"toprank\"]\n<h2>#4 - Invest in Your Brand for the Long Term</h2>\nShort-term budget cuts can often have the unfortunate result of a reduction in brand visibility and communications, which are critical during an economic downturn. As you plan ahead for 2021, creating a plan which emphasizes maintaining or increasing saturation of communication from your brand will increase trust and keep you top of mind for customers and prospects as a critical resource. This strategy can result in an increased share of voice that will help maintain strength now, and create an advantageous position during recovery.\n<h3>How to Invest In Your Brand for the Long Term:</h3>\n<ol>\n \t<li><b>Invest in organic</b>. Increasing activities which contribute to organic brand mentions and placements, like influencer marketing or SEO, can help build your visibility across search and social media, growing your community and contributing to a footprint which can self sustain. This is a good long term investment. In fact, the <a href=\"https://www.toprankmarketing.com/get-the-2020-b2b-influencer-marketing-report/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2020 State of B2B Influencer Marketing Research Report</a> found that 90% of influencer marketing budgets are expected to increase or stay the same.</li>\n \t<li><b>Don’t slash your media spend. </b>Organic and paid tactics work best when both are running together. If you make big changes to your paid investment, expect an impact to your brand visibility.</li>\n</ol>\n[bctt tweet=\"“Increasing activities which contribute to organic brand mentions and placements, like influencer marketing or SEO, can help build your visibility across search and social media.” — Alexis Hall @Alexis5484\" username=\"toprank\"]\n<h2>#5 - Position for Recovery</h2>\nAfter most recessions, consumer behavior returns to normal within a year or two. But the deeper and longer the recession is, the more likely it is to have a lasting impact on consumer behavior. Brands that are positioning to service their customers now and later are more likely to create brand loyalty and come out ahead during the recovery phase.\n<h3>How to Position for Recovery:</h3>\n<ol>\n \t<li><b>Understand your best customers.</b> Now is a great time to partner with your customer data team in order to understand more about what makes an ideal customer (i.e. who is mostly likely to be loyal, spend more money and refer your brand to their friends). If budgets are changing, shift your efforts to acquiring more of these types of customers.

When the pandemic hit hard in March, I wasn’t ready to cancel my ticket yet. Surely, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">surely</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> we would have it sorted in time for an outdoor concert four months from now. I held out hope. Then, in June, she rescheduled for July, 2021. And now I’m wondering if </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will be enough time.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Isn’t it ironic? </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t you think?</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of which to say: This pandemic has been around for longer than we thought it would, and is looking to linger far longer than we would like. What seemed like a brief, surreal interlude to be gotten through has now become a reality to live with, at least for the time being.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As B2B marketers, we need to reassess how we are adapting our marketing to our buyers’ current situation. We’re no longer scrambling to cobble together short-term fixes — we need to be out of reaction mode and into strategic planning mode.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our marketing agency has been helping clients <a href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/2020/03/covid19-stop-b2b-marketing/\">revise their marketing plans</a> for months now, from messaging and audience to tactics and measurement. Here are a few rules we’ve picked up that other marketers should follow:</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6 New Rules for B2B Marketing in the COVID-19 Era</span></h2>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rule #1: Always Be Relevant</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Okay, this is less a NEW rule than a timely reminder. I’m sure most marketers who read our blog (as smart, skilled and beautiful as you are) don’t need to hear it. But just in case: You should never come to an audience without something of value.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Corollary: “Something of value” can not equal “Knowledge of how our product/solution can improve your life.”</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People are distracted and stressed. They’re dealing with a new crisis every day. They’re spending </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">way </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more time with their children than is psychologically healthy. And they have more content than ever before to occupy their free time. If you’re asking for their attention, you must reward it. Be entertaining, be useful, be both if you can. [bctt tweet=\"'Be entertaining, be useful, be both if you can' in your #B2B content marketing, says @nitewrites.\" username=\"toprank\"]</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After you deliver, then you can ask for a next step. But make sure your content is intrinsically valuable.</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rule #2: Encourage Interaction</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pandemic lifestyle is, to put it lightly, isolating. Who would have thought you could miss hearing co-workers rock in their chairs, play music a little too loud, or bump into you in the hallway? Most of us are craving social interaction.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re used to broadcasting with your content, it’s time to consider how you can start conversations. How can you interact with your audience on a human level? How can you encourage them to interact with each other, too? Think how much your audience would value a lively, thought-provoking conversation with their colleagues and peers.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can encourage interaction with content in a few easy ways:</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Host a LinkedIn Live chat</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Run a Twitter chat</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sponsor a topic-themed chat in a video conferencing app</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Run an </span><a href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/2020/07/b2b-webinars-2020/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">interactive webinar</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In general, look for ways you can call out a subset of your audience and get them talking, both to each other and to your brand representatives. We can all use a little more social interaction right now.</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rule #3: Keep Messaging Empathetic</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don’t know about you, but I cringe every time I see an ad about something “going viral.” We are 6 months into a viral pandemic and marketers are still running ads about going viral! How can this be? </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is just one example of how completely innocuous messaging pre-COVID can seem tone-deaf now. Does your content have an anecdote about a dinner party with 15 people? Does your header image feature a crowd of people? Are you talking about “going into the office” or “thinking about this on your commute?” If so, you’re alienating your audience.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not every piece of content has to be about the pandemic, or being nostalgic for the world that once was. But there needs to be a </span><a href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/2020/07/boosting-and-deepening-engagement-through-empathy-in-b2b-marketing/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">baseline of empathy</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Working from home, social distancing, and mask-wearing are all facts of everyday life.</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rule #4: Experiment with Formats</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the time before the pandemic, we all spent hours looking at screens every day. It’s just there were </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">different</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> screens, in different environments. It was easier to differentiate between the office and home, work and play. Now, our surroundings are homogenous throughout the day — and the content we consume feels same-y, too.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Think about content fatigue as you plan your calendar. Is your audience looking for another wall of text? Do they want to look at another grid of talking heads? </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our agency is finding more success right now with multimedia, interactive content. Our </span><a href=\"https://www.toprankmarketing.com/get-the-2020-b2b-influencer-marketing-report/?utm_source=Social&#38;utm_medium=Lee%20Odden&#38;utm_campaign=2025%20State%20of%20Influencer%20Marketing%20Report\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">B2B Influencer Marketing report</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is an example. The content includes case studies, influencer participation, and original research, presented in an animated, dynamic way.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Essentially, keep in mind that idea of efficiently delivering value. Can your blog post be a quick video or audio interview instead? And can that video be five minutes long instead of 10?  [bctt tweet=\"Can your blog post be a quick video or audio interview instead? And can that video be five minutes long instead of 10? says @nitewrites.\" username=\"toprank\"]</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rule #5: Collaborate on Content</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For me, one of the stranger elements of pandemic life is learning how similar I am to everyone else. I had an urge to do puzzles in March — all the stores were sold out. I wanted to make bread in April — the stores ran out of flour. In May, everyone bought bikes. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right now, every B2B business is missing their trade shows and in-person demos. So most of them are doubling down on content. The best way to differentiate </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">your</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> content is to bring your audience voices they can’t hear anywhere else.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Co-create content with influencers. Feature subject matter experts in your organization. Tap your current and prospective customers to get their take. The more voices you can bring to your content, the more it will stand out to your audience.</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rule #6: Re-Align Measurement with Current Goals</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Per rule #1, people are less interested in promotional content right now. Businesses may have put their purchasing plans on hold, or at least tightened budgets. Marketing’s chief goal right now is likely to be establishing brand credibility, creating thought leadership content, and building relationships for the future.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As your goals change, your measurement must change as well. You can’t measure an awareness campaign in SQLs, or relationship-building in number of demo requests received. That doesn’t mean giving up on measurement or accountability — it just means making the metrics match your goals. For example, you could measure:</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brand share of voice</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Email/Blog subscribers</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social media audience/interactions</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content consumption metrics (time on page, scroll depth, links clicked)</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content resonance (backlinks and social shares)</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How New Are These Rules?</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So here’s the $100,000 (adjusted for inflation) question: At what point should you </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">stop </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">producing relevant, interactive, empathetic, dynamic and collaborative content? When can you heave a sigh of relief, stop listening to your audience, and start broadcasting promotional messages?</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you put it that way, it’s obvious: These rules are best practices for content no matter what’s going on in the world. The pandemic didn’t create the need for these rules; it just amplified how crucial they are. Back in January, we might have had the luxury of ignoring one or more of them. Now we have the joyous necessity of being forced to do better.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And that’s the good news: Making your marketing better for the pandemic will make you a better marketer now and for whatever comes next.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Need help creating content? </span><a href=\"https://www.toprankmarketing.com/services/content-marketing/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’re here for you</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/2020/08/new-rules-covid/\">6 New Rules for B2B Marketing in the COVID-19 Era</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.toprankblog.com\">Online Marketing Blog - TopRank®</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/OnlineMarketingSEOBlog?a=3aA_ZYjsEDE:0J2dhUgA81A:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/OnlineMarketingSEOBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/OnlineMarketingSEOBlog/~4/3aA_ZYjsEDE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 04 Aug 2020 11:57:04 +0000","feedId":1311,"bgimg":"https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/b2b-marketing-rules-covid19.jpg","linkMd5":"7082a34ad0400553a9b689c6f56595d3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn80@2020_6/2020/08/24/14-15-22-251_778bcf3c1d138d34.webp","destWidth":600,"destHeight":338,"sourceBytes":48303,"destBytes":25310,"author":"Joshua Nite","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/b2b-marketing-rules-covid19.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn80@2020_6/2020/08/24/14-15-22-251_778bcf3c1d138d34.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/OnlineMarketingSEOBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn11@2020_5/2020/08/24/14-15-22-140_b75958f276086430.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/OnlineMarketingSEOBlog/~4/3aA_ZYjsEDE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn40@2020_6/2020/08/24/14-15-26-478_3d9cfbff60124f86.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598278521890},{"createdTime":"2020-08-24 22:15:21","updatedTime":"2020-08-24 22:15:21","title":"5 Unheralded SEO Tools for Content Marketers","link":"https://www.toprankblog.com/?p=28796","description":"<p><img width=\"600\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/5SEOToolsImageA600w.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"Smiling businesswoman at computer image.\" srcset=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/5SEOToolsImageA600w.jpg 600w, https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/5SEOToolsImageA600w-300x180.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28797\" src=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/5SEOToolsImageA600w.jpg\" alt=\"Smiling businesswoman at computer image.\" width=\"600\" height=\"360\" />\n\nAre you using the latest search engine optimization (SEO) tools to help with your content marketing efforts?\n\nDon't worry, as we’ve got you covered with a look at some of the most helpful SEO tools to help you refine and augment your content marketing plans.\n\nSorting through lists of the seemingly endless number of available SEO tools can be frustrating as well as a hit and miss proposition, however we’ve put this collection together so that you can skip the search and get right into SEO tools you can use today to help you create <a href=\"https://www.toprankmarketing.com/services/content-marketing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">amazing content marketing stories</a>.\n\nLet’s jump in with our collection of fresh SEO tools to boost your content marketing experiences.\n<h2>1 — Google Lighthouse</h2>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28798\" src=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/GoogleLighthouse600w.png\" alt=\"Google Lighthouse\" width=\"600\" height=\"290\" />\n\nGoogle’s own <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lighthouse</a> tool — an open-source project — offers a simple way to check a number of basic SEO-related issues that every website should consider.

tool can be run standalone, from the web, in Google's Chrome DevTools, or incorporated into continuous integration systems, and its Lighthouse Viewer allows viewing and sharing of analysis data online.\n<h2>2 — Botify SEO Platform</h2>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28799\" src=\"https://www.toprankblog.com/wp-content/uploads/Botify600w.png\" alt=\"Botify\" width=\"600\"

schema markup for structured data in the format set forth and maintained by the <a href=\"https://schema.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Schema.org</a> organization, which is especially important today as features including Google’s Knowledge Graphs rely in part on this simple yet often-overlooked element, as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/michalpecanek\" target=\"_blank\"
