This comes at the heels of a recent <a href=\"https://smallbiztrends.com/2020/05/remote-work-after-pandemic-survey.html\">report </a>where 65% of workers prefer to work remotely full-time in the post-pandemic era. With an additional 31% swaying towards a mix of both home and in-office work after COVID-19.</p>\n<p>FlexJob has developed a <a href=\"https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/negotiate-a-work-from-home-arrangement/\">guide for employees</a> seeking to convince their employers to consider a work from home arrangement. The guide advises a written request to work from home permanently. It explains the perks of a permanent arrangement and a potential work from home schedule and communication details.</p>\n<h3>Growth of Remote Working</h3>\n<p>One of the reasons why remote working has grown is because of the advances in technology that have made transitioning to remote working much easier. Even before the pandemic, a steady slew of communication and collaboration tools such as Zoom, Slack and Microsoft Teams made it easy for teams to stay connected and productive.</p>\n<p>Remote working offers great opportunities and flexibility for businesses as well. It allows them to save a considerable amount of money on office space, insurance, and taxes.</p>\n<p>This comes in handy in times when business is slow or other unforeseen conditions. By exploring remote working, businesses can expand the pool of candidates they hire irrespective of location. For employees, one of the first things working remotely does cut commuting costs. Additionally, it allows them to spend more time with their family and live in areas with lower costs of living. Remote workers on average can save up to $ 2,000 when working two to three days from home every week.</p>\n<p><em><small>Image: Depositphotos.com</small></em></p>\n<p>This article, \"<a href='https://smallbiztrends.com/2020/11/flexjobs-most-surprising-remote-jobs-2020.html'>The 50 Most Surprising Remote Jobs in 2020</a>\" was first published on <a href='https://smallbiztrends.com'>Small Business Trends</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SmallBusinessTrends?a=XxRz4n5R6NI:J6j7KRefq4g:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SmallBusinessTrends?i=XxRz4n5R6NI:J6j7KRefq4g:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SmallBusinessTrends?a=XxRz4n5R6NI:J6j7KRefq4g:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SmallBusinessTrends?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SmallBusinessTrends?a=XxRz4n5R6NI:J6j7KRefq4g:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SmallBusinessTrends?i=XxRz4n5R6NI:J6j7KRefq4g:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SmallBusinessTrends?a=XxRz4n5R6NI:J6j7KRefq4g:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SmallBusinessTrends?i=XxRz4n5R6NI:J6j7KRefq4g:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SmallBusinessTrends/~4/XxRz4n5R6NI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 15 Nov 2020 20:00:26 +0000","feedId":47184,"bgimg":"https://smallbiztrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Remote-Jobs-in-2020.png","linkMd5":"6a43a0582d5ebf49efc8f55f707f49c6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn85@2020_1/2020/11/15/23-27-18-882_05f252c405f63d93.webp","destWidth":1000,"destHeight":560,"sourceBytes":204420,"destBytes":44910,"author":"Samson Haileyesus","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://smallbiztrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Remote-Jobs-in-2020.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn85@2020_1/2020/11/15/23-27-18-882_05f252c405f63d93.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SmallBusinessTrends?i=XxRz4n5R6NI:J6j7KRefq4g:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn1@2020_5/2020/11/15/23-27-20-026_5866505fbd612b1f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SmallBusinessTrends?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn94@2020_5/2020/11/15/23-27-19-834_24b9f14737a49b0d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SmallBusinessTrends?i=XxRz4n5R6NI:J6j7KRefq4g:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn89@2020_1/2020/11/15/23-27-19-839_b38ea9fb4ef50b05.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SmallBusinessTrends?i=XxRz4n5R6NI:J6j7KRefq4g:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn98@2020_5/2020/11/15/23-27-19-921_e169ea424e9fbafa.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SmallBusinessTrends/~4/XxRz4n5R6NI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn6@2020_4/2020/11/15/23-27-52-124_bddbf084172abf48.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605482838664}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-11-16 07:27:18","updatedTime":"2020-11-16 07:27:18","feedId":47184,"fetchDate":"Sun, 15 Nov 2020 23:27:18 +0000","fetchMs":26,"handleMs":8,"totalMs":34409,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"c95099efafc17f9e0beaf843cecd5c56","hostName":"us-003*","requestId":"27164e70baef44158d3067728057e4d3_47184","contentType":"text/xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":46174,"bgimgsTotal":1,"bgimgsGithubTotal":1,"articlesImgsTotal":6,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":6,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx8":1,"myreaderx16":1,"myreaderx10":1,"myreaderx2":1,"myreaderx12":1,"myreaderx":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 03:44:29","updatedTime":"2020-09-07 06:02:39","id":47184,"name":"Small Business Trends","url":"http://feeds2.feedburner.com/SmallBusinessTrends","subscriber":68,"website":null,"icon":"http://smallbiztrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/sbt-logo-Aug-2012-144x107.jpg","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx61/cdn15@2020_4/2020/09/06/22-02-36-730_56a9d927bfea4121.jpg","description":"Founded in 2003, Small Business Trends is an award-winning online publication for small business owners, entrepreneurs and the people who interact with them.
