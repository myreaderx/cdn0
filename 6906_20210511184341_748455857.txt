We&nbsp;feel&nbsp;the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/19/well/mind/covid-mental-health-languishing.html\">languishing effects</a>&nbsp;of the past year, too. So we decided to go in search of some good news in the world outside, and it didn’t take long to uncover all kinds<strong> </strong>of it. While we’re stoked that&nbsp;many Americans are getting the COVID-19 vaccine&nbsp;and that some of our favorite&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.outsideonline.com/2393435/ultimate-guide-adventure-travel\">summer outdoor pursuits</a>&nbsp;are right around the corner, we dug even deeper to find more&nbsp;good things that came out of the past year. Like outdoor companies investing in new inclusion efforts, creative environmental developments,&nbsp;and scientific studies showing that 2020 actually made our brains stronger. And did we mention new research shows that<strong> </strong>wine and cheese are actually good for you? We hope this surprising list inspires you to seek joy and adventure&nbsp;this season.&nbsp;We can’t wait to see you out there.</p> \n<h2><strong>The Kids Are Alright</strong></h2> \n<p> \n <figure data-js-slideshow=\"\" class=\"post-block article-hero-slideshow hero-slideshow rel \"> \n  <div class=\"slideshow__controls\"> \n   <button class=\"slick-arrow slick-arrow--prev js-prev\"><span class=\"is-vishidden\">Previous</span></button> \n   <button class=\"slick-arrow slick-arrow--next js-next\"><span class=\"is-vishidden\">Next</span></button> \n  </div> \n  <div class=\"slides hero-slides article-hero-slides siema\"> \n   <div class=\"no-slide-gradient hero-slide article-image\"> \n    <div class=\"img-wrap\">\n     <img class=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.outsideonline.com/2422825/data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" data-original=\"https://www.outsideonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/width_800/public/2021/04/29/erin-brooks-good-news_h.jpg?itok=yYAw4kCy\" alt=\"\" />\n    </div> \n    <span class=\"post-caption article-slideshow-post-caption db\"> <span class=\"hero-slide-article-caption\"> Erin Brooks</span> (Rip Curl/Matt Ord) </span> \n   </div> \n   <div class=\"no-slide-gradient hero-slide article-image\"> \n    <div class=\"img-wrap\">\n     <img class=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.outsideonline.com/2422825/data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" data-original=\"https://www.outsideonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/width_800/public/2021/04/29/sky-brown-good-news_h.jpg?itok=gWhPV0Dd\" alt=\"\" />\n    </div> \n    <span class=\"post-caption article-slideshow-post-caption db\"> <span class=\"hero-slide-article-caption\"> Sky Brown</span> (Carl De Souza/AFP/Getty) </span> \n   </div> \n   <div class=\"no-slide-gradient hero-slide article-image\"> \n    <div class=\"img-wrap\">\n     <img class=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.outsideonline.com/2422825/data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" data-original=\"https://www.outsideonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/width_800/public/2021/04/29/kai-jones-good-news_h.jpg?itok=b95csFzI\" alt=\"\" />\n    </div> \n    <span class=\"post-caption article-slideshow-post-caption db\"> <span class=\"hero-slide-article-caption\"> Kai Jones</span> (Nic Alegre/Teton Gravity Research) </span> \n   </div> \n  </div> \n </figure> </p> \n<p>The coming generation of adventure athletes are already going big—<em>very</em> big. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/erinbrookssurf/?hl=en\">Erin Brooks</a> is a 13-year-old surfing phenom notching impressive competition results and landing tricks that still elude many adult pros.

Of course, it also revealed the size of our digital divide. If we want to become truly untethered from office parks and be able to work from anywhere after the pandemic, we’ll need high-speed internet to be just as available in rural and wilderness-adjacent areas as it is in urban ones. Enter Elon Musk. The tech visionary’s company SpaceX launched a thousand low-Earth-orbit satellites to build <a href=\"https://www.starlink.com/\">Starlink</a>, a network that will eventually beam high-speed internet from space to almost anywhere on the planet. Last fall the company rolled out a trial program, Better than Nothing Beta, to select locations in the U.S., Canada, and the UK, and starting this year, it aims to launch 100 new satellites per month to expand its territory. Even with limited reach, the technology is already making a difference. In the U.S., several rural school districts have begun pilot programs with Starlink to make remote learning more equitable for students without internet access at home. And last fall in Canada, Starlink successfully delivered broadband internet to a handful of First Nations communities that previously were forced to make do with slow service. For now, Starlink’s $499 receivers, which according to the company are about the size of a pizza box, aren’t portable enough to be vanlife-ready, but Musk has intimated that mobile units are a near-term goal. —Christopher Keyes</p> \n<h2>And You Can Keep Wearing Your Sweatpants</h2> \n<p>We all rediscovered comfortable apparel last year, and the outdoor industry was uniquely well positioned to outfit the work-from-home trend.
