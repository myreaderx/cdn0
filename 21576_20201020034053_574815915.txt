Why, if it prosper, none dare call it treason.”</em></p> \n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>–</em> Sir John Harrington.</p> \n<p>As Shakespeare would state in his play <em>Hamlet</em>, “<em>Something is rotten in the state of Denmark</em>,” like a fish that rots from head to tail, so do corrupt government systems rot from top to bottom.</p> \n<p>This is a reference to the ruling system of Denmark and not just the foul murder that King Claudius has committed against his brother, Hamlet’s father. This is showcased in the play by reference to the economy of Denmark being in a state of shambles and that the Danish people are ready to revolt since they are on the verge of starving. King Claudius has only been king for a couple of months, and thus this state of affairs, though he inflames, did not originate with him.</p> \n<p>Thus, during our time of great upheaval we should ask ourselves; what constitutes the persisting “ruling system,” of the United States, and where do the injustices in its state of affairs truly originate from?</p> \n<p>The tragedy of Hamlet does not just lie in the action (or lack of action) of one man, but rather, it is contained in the choices and actions of all its main characters. Each character fails to see the longer term consequences of their own actions, which leads not only to their ruin but towards the ultimate collapse of Denmark. The characters are so caught up in their antagonism against one another that they fail to foresee that their very own destruction is intertwined with the other.</p> \n<p>This is a reflection of a failing system.</p> \n<p>A system that, though it believes itself to be fighting tooth and nail for its very survival, is only digging a deeper grave. A system that is incapable of generating any real solutions to the problems it faces.</p> \n<p>The only way out of this is to address that very fact. The most important issue that will decide the fate of the country is what sort of changes are going to occur in the political and intelligence apparatus, such that a continuation of this tyrannical treason is finally stopped in its tracks and unable to sow further discord and chaos.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>When the Matter of “Truth” Becomes a Threat to “National Security”</strong></p> \n<p>When the matter of truth is depicted as a possible threat to those that govern a country, you no longer have a democratic state. True, not everything can be disclosed to the public in real time, but we are sitting on a mountain of classified intelligence material that goes back more than 60 years.</p> \n<p>How much time needs to elapse before the American people have the right to know the truth behind what their government agencies have been doing within their own country and abroad in the name of the “free” world?</p> \n<p>From this recognition, the whole matter of declassifying material around the Russigate scandal in <em>real time</em>, and not highly redacted 50 years from now, is essential to addressing this festering putrefaction that has been bubbling over since the <a href=\"https://www.strategic-culture.org/news/2020/01/19/secret-wars-forgotten-betrayals-global-tyranny-who-is-really-in-charge-of-the-u-s-military/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">heinous assassination of President Kennedy</a> on Nov. 22<sup>nd</sup>, 1963 and to which we are still waiting for full disclosure of classified papers 57 years later.</p> \n<p>If the American people really want to finally see who is standing behind that curtain in Oz, <em>now is the time</em>.</p> \n<p>These intelligence bureaus need to be reviewed for what kind of method and standard they are upholding in collecting their “intelligence,” that has supposedly justified the Mueller investigation and the never-ending Flynn investigation which have provided <u>zero</u> conclusive evidence to back up their allegations and which have massively infringed on the elected government’s ability to make the changes that they had committed to the American people.</p> \n<p>Just like the Iraq and Libya war that was based off of cooked British intelligence (refer <a href=\"https://carnegieendowment.org/2004/08/28/niger-uranium-still-false-claim-pub-1595\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here </a>and <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmfaff/119/119.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>), Russiagate appears to have also had its impetus from our friends over at MI6 as well. It is no surprise that Sir Richard Dearlove, who was then MI6 chief (1999-2004) and who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/06/mi6-stood-by-bogus-intelligence-until-after-iraq-invasion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">oversaw and stood by the fraudulent intelligence </a>on Iraq stating they bought uranium from Niger to build a nuclear weapon, is the very same Sir Richard Dearlove who promoted the Christopher Steele dossier as something “credible” to American intelligence.</p> \n<p>In other words, the same man who is largely responsible for encouraging the illegal invasion of Iraq, which set off the never-ending wars on “terror,” that was justified with cooked British intelligence is also responsible for encouraging the Russian spook witch-hunt that has been occurring within the U.S. for the last four years…over more cooked British intelligence, and the FBI and CIA are knowingly complicit in this.</p> \n<p>Neither the American people, nor the world as a whole, can afford to suffer any more of the so-called “mistaken” intelligence bumblings. It is time that these intelligence bureaus are held accountable for at best criminal negligence, at worst, treason against their own country.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>When Great Figures of Hope Are Targeted as Threats to “National Security”</strong></p> \n<p>The<a href=\"https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB222/\"> Family Jewels report</a>, which was an investigation conducted by the CIA to investigate <em><u>itself</u></em>, was spurred by the Watergate Scandal and the CIA’s unconstitutional role in the whole affair. This investigation by the CIA reviewed its own conduct from the 1950s to mid-1970s.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-559239\" src=\"https://www.strategic-culture.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ch19102001.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"318\" /></p> \n<p>The Family Jewels report was only <a href=\"https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB222/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">partially declassified</a> in June 25, 2007 (30 years later). Along with the release of the redacted report included a six-page summary with the following introduction:</p> \n<p>“<em>The Central Intelligence Agency <u>violated its charter for 25 years</u> until revelations of illegal wiretapping, domestic surveillance, <strong>assassination plots</strong>, and <strong>human experimentation </strong>led to official investigations and reforms in the 1970s.</em>” [emphasis added]</p> \n<p>Despite this acknowledged violation of its charter for 25 years, which is pretty much since its inception, the details of this information were<u> kept classified for 30 years</u> from not just the public but major governmental bodies and it was left to the agency itself to judge how best to “reform” its ways.</p> \n<p>On Dec. 22, 1974, The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1974/12/22/archives/huge-cia-operation-reported-in-u-s-against-antiwar-forces-other.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">New York Times published an article by Seymour Hersh </a>exposing illegal operations conducted by the CIA, dubbed the “family jewels”. This included, covert action programs involving assassination attempts on foreign leaders and covert attempts to subvert foreign governments, which <u>were reported for the first time</u>. In addition, the article discussed efforts by intelligence agencies to collect information on the political activities of U.S. citizens.</p> \n<p>Largely as a reaction to Hersh’s findings, the creation of the Church Committee was approved on January 27, 1975, by a vote of 82 to 4 in the Senate.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/about/powers-procedures/investigations/church-committee.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Church Committee’s final report</a> was published in April 1976, including <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?409117-1/church-committee-hearings-fbi-intelligence-activities\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">seven volumes</a> of Church Committee hearings in the Senate.</p> \n<p>The Church Committee also <a href=\"https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/94465.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">published an interim report</a> titled “Alleged Assassination Plots Involving Foreign Leaders”, which investigated alleged attempts to assassinate foreign leaders, including Patrice Lumumba of Zaire, Rafael Trujillo of the Dominican Republic, Ngo Dinh Diem of Vietnam, Gen. René Schneider of Chile and Fidel Castro of Cuba. President Ford attempted to withhold the report from the public, but failed and reluctantly issued <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP79-00498A000200080107-3.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Executive Order 11905</a> after pressure from the public and the Church Committee.</p> \n<p>Executive Order 11905 is a United States Presidential Executive Order signed on February 18, 1976, by a very reluctant President Ford in an attempt to reform the United States Intelligence Community, improve oversight on foreign intelligence activities, and ban political assassination.</p> \n<p>The attempt is now regarded as a failure and was largely undone by President Reagan who issued <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/codification/executive-order/12333.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Executive Order 12333</a>, which extended the powers and responsibilities of U.S. intelligence agencies and directed leaders of the U.S. federal agencies to co-operate fully with the CIA, which was the original arrangement that CIA have full authority over clandestine operations (for more information on this refer to my papers <a href=\"https://www.strategic-culture.org/news/2020/01/19/secret-wars-forgotten-betrayals-global-tyranny-who-is-really-in-charge-of-the-u-s-military/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.strategic-culture.org/news/2020/06/14/enemy-within-story-purge-american-intelligence/\">here</a>).</p> \n<p>In addition, the Church Committee produced seven case studies on covert operations, but only the one on Chile was released, titled “<a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/files/declassification/iscap/pdf/2010-009-doc17.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Covert Action in Chile: 1963–1973</a>“. The rest were kept secret at the CIA’s request.</p> \n<p>Among the most shocking revelation of the Church Committee was the discovery of <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/DomesticSurveillence101OperationSHAMROCK\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Operation SHAMROCK</a>, in which the major telecommunications companies shared their traffic with the NSA from 1945 to the early 1970s. The information gathered in this operation fed directly into the NSA Watch List. It was found out during the committee investigations that Senator Frank Church, who was overseeing the committee, <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/DomesticSurveillence101OperationSHAMROCK\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">was among the prominent names</a> under surveillance on this NSA Watch List.</p> \n<p>In 1975, the Church Committee decided to unilaterally declassify the particulars of this operation, against the objections of President Ford’s administration (refer <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/DomesticSurveillence101OperationSHAMROCK\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.strategic-culture.org/news/2020/03/14/a-70-year-war-on-propaganda-built-by-the-cia/\">here</a> for more information).</p> \n<p>The Church Committee’s reports constitute the most extensive review of intelligence activities ever made available to the public. Much of the contents were classified, but over 50,000 pages were declassified under the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992.</p> \n<p>President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas on Nov. 22<sup>nd</sup>, 1963. Two days before his assassination a hate-Kennedy handbill (see picture) was circulated in Dallas accusing the president of treasonous activities including being a communist sympathizer.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-559240\" src=\"https://www.strategic-culture.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ch19102002.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"804\" /></p> \n<p>On March 1<sup>st</sup>, 1967 New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison arrested and charged Clay Shaw with conspiring to assassinate President Kennedy, with the help of David Ferrie and others. After a little over a one month long trial, Shaw was found not guilty on March 1<sup>st</sup>, 1969.</p> \n<p>David Ferrie, a controller of Lee Harvey Oswald, was going to be a key witness and would have provided the ”smoking gun” evidence linking himself to Clay Shaw, was likely murdered on Feb. 22<sup>nd</sup>, 1967, less than a week after news of Garrison’s investigation broke in the media.</p> \n<p>According to Garrison’s team findings, there was reason to believe that the CIA was involved in the orchestrations of President Kennedy’s assassination but access to classified material (which was nearly everything concerning the case) was necessary to continue such an investigation.</p> \n<p>Though Garrison’s team lacked direct evidence, they were able to collect an immense amount of circumstantial evidence, which should have given the justification for access to classified material for further investigation. Instead the case was thrown out of court prematurely and is now treated as if it were a circus. [Refer to Garrison’s <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/ontrailofassassi00jimg\">book </a>for further details and Oliver Stone’s excellently researched movie <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w16bYZ-4nmE\">JFK</a>]</p> \n<p>To date, it is the only trial to be brought forward concerning the assassination of President Kennedy.</p> \n<p>The Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) was created in 1994 by the Congress enacted President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992, which mandated that all assassination-related material be housed in a single collection within the National Archives and Records Administration. In July 1998, <a href=\"https://aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/arrb/report/pdf/ARRB_Rpt_0_Title.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a staff report</a> released by the ARRB emphasized shortcomings in the original autopsy.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1998/08/02/gaps-in-kennedy-autopsy-files-detailed/f374ef5c-7be3-48ad-a661-394a170a6e67/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ARRB wrote</a>, “One of the many tragedies of the assassination of President Kennedy has been the <strong><u>incompleteness of the autopsy record</u></strong> and the suspicion caused by the shroud of secrecy that has surrounded the records that do exist.” [emphasis added]</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/arrb/report/pdf/ARRB_Rpt_0_Title.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The staff report for the Assassinations Records Review Board</a> contended that brain photographs in the Kennedy records <em><u>are not of Kennedy’s brain</u></em> and show much less damage than Kennedy sustained.</p> \n<p>The Washington Post <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1998/08/02/gaps-in-kennedy-autopsy-files-detailed/f374ef5c-7be3-48ad-a661-394a170a6e67/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reported</a>:</p> \n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“<em>Asked about the lunchroom episode </em>[where he was overheard stating his notes of the autopsy went missing]<em> in a May 1996 deposition, Finck said he did not remember it. He was also vague about how many notes he took during the autopsy but confirmed that “after the autopsy I also wrote notes” and that he turned over whatever notes he had to the chief autopsy physician, James J. Humes.</em></p> \n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>It has long been known that Humes <u>destroyed some original autopsy papers</u> in a fireplace at his home on Nov. 24, 1963. He told the Warren Commission that what he burned was an original draft of his autopsy report. Under persistent questioning at a February 1996 deposition by the Review Board, <u>Humes said he destroyed the draft and his “original notes.”</u></em></p> \n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>…Shown official autopsy photographs of Kennedy from the National Archives, </em>[Saundra K.]<em> Spencer </em>[who worked in “the White House lab”] <em>said they were not the ones she helped process and were printed on different paper. She said “there was no blood or opening cavities” and the wounds were much smaller in the pictures… </em>[than what she had] <em>worked on… </em></p> \n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>John T. Stringer, who said he was the only one to take photos during the autopsy itself, said some of those were missing as well. He said that pictures he took of Kennedy’s brain at a “supplementary autopsy” were different from the official set that was shown to him.</em>” [emphasis added]</p> \n<p>This not only shows that evidence tampering did indeed occur, as even the Warren Commission acknowledges, but this puts into question the reliability of the entire assassination record of John F. Kennedy and to what degree evidence tampering and forgery have occurred in these records.</p> \n<p>We would also do well to remember the numerous crimes that the FBI and CIA have been guilty of committing upon the American people such as during the period of McCarthyism. That the FBI’s COINTELPRO has been implicated in covert operations against members of the civil rights movement, including Martin Luther King Jr. during the 1960s. That FBI director J. Edgar Hoover made no secret of his hostility towards Dr. King and his ludicrous belief that King was influenced by communists, despite having no evidence to that effect.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-559241\" src=\"https://www.strategic-culture.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ch19102003.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"685\" height=\"421\" /></p> \n<p>King was assassinated on April 4th, 1968 and the civil rights movement took a major blow.</p> \n<p>In November 1975, as the Church Committee was completing its investigation, the Department of Justice formed a Task Force to examine the FBI’s program of harassment directed at Dr. King, including the FBI’s security investigations of him, his assassination and the FBI conducted criminal investigation that followed. One aspect of the Task force study was to determine “whether any action taken in relation to Dr. King by the FBI before the assassination had, or might have had, an effect, direct or indirect, on that event.”</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/select-committee-report/part-2d.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">In its report</a>, the Task Force criticized the FBI not for the opening, but for the protracted continuation of, its security investigation of Dr. King:</p> \n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">“<em>We think the security investigation which included both physical and technical surveillance, should have been terminated … in 1963. That it was intensified and augmented by a COINTELPRO type campaign against Dr. King was unwarranted; the COINTELPRO type campaign, moreover, was ultra vires and very probably … felonious.</em>”</p> \n<p>In 1999, <a href=\"https://thekingcenter.org/conspiracy-trial/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">King Family v. Jowers civil suit</a> in Memphis, Tennessee occurred, the full transcript of the trial can be found <a href=\"https://thekingcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/King_Family_Trial_Transcript.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>. The jury found that Lloyd Jowers and unnamed others, including those in high ranking positions within government agencies, participated in a conspiracy to assassinate Dr. King.</p> \n<p>During the four week trial, it was pointed out that the rifle allegedly used to assassinate King did not have a scope that was sighted, which meant you could not have hit the broad side of a barn with that rifle, <em>thus it could not have been the murder weapon</em>.</p> \n<p>This was only remarked on over 30 years after King was murdered and showed the level of incompetence, or more likely, evidence tampering that was committed from previous investigations conducted by the FBI.</p> \n<p>The case of JFK and MLK are among the highest profile assassination cases in American history, and it has been shown in both cases that evidence tampering has indeed occurred, despite being in the center of the public eye. What are we then to expect as the standard of investigation for all the other cases of malfeasance? What expectation can we have that justice is ever upheld?</p> \n<p>With a history of such blatant misconduct, it is clear that the present demand to declassify the Russiagate papers now, and not 50 years later, needs to occur if we are to address the level of criminality that is going on behind the scenes and which will determine the fate of the country.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>The American People Deserve to Know</strong></p> \n<p>Today we see the continuation of the over seven decades’ long ruse, the targeting of individuals as Russian agents without any basis, in order to remove them from the political arena. The present effort to declassify the Russiagate papers and exonerate Michael Flynn, so that he may freely speak of the intelligence he knows, is <u>not</u> a threat to national security, <em>it is a threat to those who have committed treason against their country</em>.</p> \n<p>On Oct. 6<sup>th</sup>, 2020, President Trump ordered the declassification of the Russia Probe documents along with the classified documents on the findings concerning the Hillary Clinton emails. The release of these documents threatens to expose the entrapment of the Trump campaign by the Clinton campaign with help of the U.S. intelligence agencies.</p> \n<p>The Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe released some of these documents recently, including former CIA Director John Brennan’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJpvZJ2Jq2A\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">handwritten notes</a> for a meeting with former President Obama, the notes revealing that Hillary Clinton approved a plan to “vilify Donald Trump by stirring up scandal claiming interference by the Russian security service.”</p> \n<p>Trey Gowdy, who was Chair of the House Oversight Committee from June 13<sup>th</sup>, 2017 – Jan. 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2019, has <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJpvZJ2Jq2A\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">stated in an interview</a> on Oct. 7<sup>th</sup>, 2020 that he has never seen these documents. Devin Nunes, who was Chair of the House Intelligence Committee from Jan. 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2015 – Jan. 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2019, has also said in a recent interview that he has never seen these documents.</p> \n<p>And yet, both the FBI and CIA were aware and had access to these documents and sat on them for four years, withholding their release from several government-led investigations that were looking into the Russiagate scandal and who were requesting relevant material that was in the possession of both intelligence bureaus. Do these intelligence bureaus sound like they are working for the “national security” of the American people?</p> \n<p>The truth must finally be brought to light, or the country will rot from its head to tail.</p> \n<p>\n <!--see-also--></p> \n<p><em>The author can be reached at </em><a href=\"mailto:cynthiachung@tutanota.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>cynthiachung@tutanota.com</em></a></p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 13:42:38 +0000","feedId":21576,"bgimg":"https://www.strategic-culture.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ch19102001.jpg","linkMd5":"ded2611c4487e7be5c98ec1c4cb4aac5","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn52@2020_6/2020/10/20/03-40-44-745_8c5daf2372e09a6b.webp","destWidth":400,"destHeight":318,"sourceBytes":61448,"destBytes":32968,"author":"Andrey Areshev","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.strategic-culture.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ch19102001.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn52@2020_6/2020/10/20/03-40-44-745_8c5daf2372e09a6b.webp","https://www.strategic-culture.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ch19102002.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn91@2020_1/2020/10/20/03-40-50-266_a1530f496b7a72fa.webp","https://www.strategic-culture.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ch19102003.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn88@2020_2/2020/10/20/03-40-51-246_dbc15f9e5c01414a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603165238535}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-10-20 11:40:38","updatedTime":"2020-10-20 11:40:38","feedId":21576,"fetchDate":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 03:40:38 +0000","fetchMs":10334,"handleMs":50,"totalMs":25228,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"43c3bad3e29a981cf61d68eda731a7b1","hostName":"us-027*","requestId":"dae33ec2d617494f847b76d89f28dabe_21576","contentType":"application/rss+xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":181732,"bgimgsTotal":1,"bgimgsGithubTotal":1,"articlesImgsTotal":3,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":3,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx12":1,"myreaderx1":1,"myreaderx18":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 02:25:24","updatedTime":"2020-09-07 04:14:39","id":21576,"name":"Strategic Culture Foundation","url":"http://www.strategic-culture.org/rss.html","subscriber":154,"website":null,"icon":"https://www.strategic-culture.org/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx64/cdn34@2020_4/2020/09/06/20-14-39-102_0371fe9dffacc659.ico","description":"Strategic Culture Foundation provides a platform for exclusive analysis, research and policy comment on Eurasian and global affairs.
