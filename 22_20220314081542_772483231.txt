href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/pentagon-rejects-poland-offer-send-jets-us-air-base-ukraine-2022-3\">the US rejected a plan</a> to send Polish fighter jets to help Ukraine combat Russian air power.</p><p>On Tuesday, Poland, a NATO member, offered to send Ukraine MiG-29 jets via the US Air Force&#39;s Ramstein Air Base in Germany.</p><p>However, the Pentagon quickly poured cold water on the idea.</p><p>&#34;It is simply not clear to us that there is a substantive rationale for it,&#34; Pentagon spokesman John Kirby <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PentagonPresSec/status/1501336450012528647\">tweeted</a>.</p><p>&#34;The prospect of fighter jets &#39;at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America&#39; departing from a US/NATO base in Germany to fly into airspace that is contested with Russia over Ukraine raises serious concerns for the entire NATO alliance.&#34;</p><p>In <a href=\"https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/yevropejci-povinni-posilyuvati-sankciyi-proti-rosiyi-tak-sho-73465\">an address early Thursday</a>, Zelenskyy, who has thanked Poland for the offer, called on the West to step up in helping defend Ukraine from Russia&#39;s aerial attacks.&#160;</p><p>&#34;Together we must return courage to some Western leaders. So that they finally do what they had to do on the first day of the invasion,&#34; he said.</p><p>&#34;Either close the Ukrainian sky from Russian missiles and bombs, or give us fighter jets so that we can do everything ourselves. A pause without a decision has become simply deadly.&#34;</p><p>Zelenskyy has long decried the lack of military action by the West over Russia&#39;s invasion, calling on the US and NATO to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine.</p><p>Agreeing to a no-fly zone would mean the US and NATO committing to shoot down Russian aircraft that enter Ukrainian airspace, a prospect most Western leaders have been unwilling to contemplate.</p><p>Echoing the Pentagon, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/scholz-sending-polish-jets-to-ukraine-via-us-base-in-germany-certainly-not-an-option/a-61060929\">said Wednesday</a> he did not support the proposal to send jets as it won&#39;t help &#34;de-escalate the conflict.&#34;</p><p>Marek Magierowski, Poland&#39;s ambassador to the US,&#160;<a href=\"https://t.co/QtEdek3Tzj\">said</a> he understood the US position that the plan was &#34;too escalatory&#34; and that NATO should &#34;move on.&#34;&#160;</p><p>On Monday, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/ukraines-zelensky-says-he-has-cooled-on-joining-nato-2022-3\">Zelenskyy said he had &#34;cooled down&#34; on Ukraine&#39;s plan to join NATO</a> &#34;after we understood that NATO is not prepared to accept Ukraine.&#34;&#160;</p><p>Though the US has refused to send its military forces into Ukraine, it has supplied equipment and military aid, and bolstered its military presence in neighboring countries.</p><p>On Tuesday, <a href=\"https://www.aa.com.tr/en/americas/us-sending-2-patriot-missile-batteries-to-poland-statement/2528353\">the US sent two Patriot missile batteries</a> to Poland &#34;to confront any potential threats&#34; to NATO as a result of Russia&#39;s invasion.</p><p>In his address Thursday, Zelenskyy highlighted the stream of what he said were war crimes recently committed by Russia during the first two weeks of the invasion.&#160;</p><p>&#34;Destroyed hospitals. Destroyed schools, churches, houses. And all the people killed.

The findings showed that those who voluntarily left their jobs in search of something better generally found it.&#160;</p><p>Pew&#39;s survey of 6,627 non-retired adults, conducted between February 7 and February 13, included 965 people who quit in the last year. People cited several primary reasons for leaving their jobs, including low pay, no opportunities for advancement, and feeling disrespected at work.</p><p>Child care issues and lack of flexibility played a role for many people as well, the survey found.&#160;</p><p>Most of the people who quit said they found another job quickly &#8212; more than half said they&#39;re currently employed full time, and 61% said it was at least somewhat easy to find their new job, according to the survey.&#160;</p><p>And those who quit found a better quality of life as well: 56% said they&#39;re making more money, 53% said they have more opportunities to move up the ladder, 53% said it&#39;s easier to balance their work life and family life, and 50% said their work schedules are more flexible.&#160;</p><p>One sticking point appears to be benefits, according to Pew&#39;s research. Only 42% of people who quit said they have better benefits now and 36% said their benefits situation, which includes things like health insurance and paid time off, is pretty much the same. Nearly a quarter of workers say their benefits are now worse than at their last job.</p><h2>The Great Resignation, one year later</h2><p>The idea of a Great Resignation began percolating in the spring of 2021 and continued throughout the year, with a record <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-many-people-quit-jobs-november-record-high-great-resignation-labor-shortage-2022-1\">4.5 million workers quitting in November alone</a>, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.&#160;</p><p>In fact, the news of so many people quitting may have even influenced people to quit their own jobs, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/workers-rethinking-jobs-careers-due-to-great-resignation-comparably-survey-2022-2\">Insider reported</a>.&#160;</p><p>The unusually high quit rate has led to a shortage of workers across industries and a rush to fill open positions. On the employment website CareerBuilder, for example, the number of monthly job postings jumped from roughly 1 million in February 2021 to over 1.8 million in February 2022.</p><p>Nursing roles and counselor positions have seen triple-digit percentage increases in the last two years, the company said Wednesday. Other sectors &#8212; like hospitality, retail, and foodservice &#8212; <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/great-resignation-january-quits-jolts-report-labor-shortage-hiring-walkouts-2022-3\">consistently saw high </a>quit rates&#160;throughout 2021.&#160;</p><p>Pew&#39;s findings align with stories from those who left their jobs in the last year.&#160;An ICU nurse told Insider that working through the pandemic <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/icu-nurse-encourages-others-to-quit-after-pandemic-burnout-2022-1\">led him to quit in search of less stress</a>.&#160;One teacher <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/teacher-turned-plumbing-apprentice-career-switch-pandemic-2022-2\">quit her job after more than a decade in the field</a> to become a plumbing apprentice, telling Insider that teaching remotely wasn&#39;t for her. Childcare workers told Insider they quit <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/childcare-workers-quitting-low-pay-childcare-shortage-2021-10\">in search of better pay</a>.&#160;</p><p>&#34;I think a lot of people are looking to better themselves,&#34;

Peters and Knisley turned themselves in, according to authorities.</p><p>In the indictment, District Attorney Dan Rubinstein said that Peters and Kinsley attempted to convince at least four other public servants to follow a plan to disseminate confidential information from Dominion Voting Systems voting machines &#8212; which are not connected to the internet &#8212; online, following a &#34;trusted build,&#34; which is a high-security software update for the machines.</p><p>The indictment added that they convinced staff that an unauthorized man was a county worker.</p><p>&#34;Beginning in April 2021 and in advance of the May 25-26, 2021, trusted build, Tina Peters and Belinda Knisley, either as principal actors and/or acting as complicators, devised and executed a deceptive scheme which was designed to influence public servants, breach security protocols, exceed permissible access to voting equipment, and set in motion the eventual distribution of confidential information to unauthorized people,&#34; Rubinstein wrote in the indictment.</p><p>Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold has sued Peters three times, but it was her August 2021 lawsuit accusing Peters of orchestrating the breach that spawned local and national investigations.&#160;</p><p>A grand jury was called after Griswold&#39;s lawsuit, and the case will now go to trial. District Attorney Dan Rubinstein said that others could be charged in connection with the breach.</p><p>In early February of this year, Peters <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/pro-trump-colorado-clerk-appears-kick-police-officer-during-arrest-2022-2\">was arrested</a> for resisting a search warrant for her iPad &#8212; unrelated to her alleged election data breach. Peters also announced a run for Colorado secretary of state against Griswold during the same month.</p><p>&#34;The grand jury, randomly selected from the same pool of citizens that elected Clerk Tina Peters and chosen months before any of these alleged offenses occurred, concluded there is probable cause that Clerk Peters and Deputy Clerk&#160; Knisley committed crimes,&#34; Rubinstein and Attorney General Phil Weiser said in a statement.</p><p>Peters accused Griswold of &#34;using a grand jury to formalize politically-motivated accusations against candidates,&#34; <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tina-peters-colorado-mesa-county-indicted-voting-system-breach/\">according to CBS.</a></p><p>&#34;Using legal muscle to indict political opponents during an election isn&#39;t new strategy, but it&#39;s easier to execute when you have a district attorney who despises President Trump and any constitutional conservative like myself who continues to demand all election evidence be made available to the public,&#34; Peters said in response to the indictment.</p><p>Tina Peters&#39; office did not immediately return Insider&#39;s request for comment.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/colorado-clerk-tina-peters-indicted-on-election-data-breach-counts-2022-3\">Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=tKt2zyewZAU:KO7NcoAUB8o:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=tKt2zyewZAU:KO7NcoAUB8o:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=tKt2zyewZAU:KO7NcoAUB8o:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=tKt2zyewZAU:KO7NcoAUB8o:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=tKt2zyewZAU:KO7NcoAUB8o:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=tKt2zyewZAU:KO7NcoAUB8o:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=tKt2zyewZAU:KO7NcoAUB8o:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=tKt2zyewZAU:KO7NcoAUB8o:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 10 Mar 2022 03:17:29 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/6229559c6ec7c20019cd6cb2?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"f9b1da8b6a1d707192c70f216897108a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn66@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-15-23-253_e15e7b49b149a517.webp","destWidth":1333,"destHeight":1000,"sourceBytes":33618,"destBytes":33618,"author":"aharoun@insider.com (Azmi Haroun)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/6229539d6ec7c20019cd6cab?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn19@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-15-24-989_df6937e15def8585.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn56@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-15-33-003_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=tKt2zyewZAU:KO7NcoAUB8o:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn26@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-15-33-263_e5e238ad1dbf818c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=tKt2zyewZAU:KO7NcoAUB8o:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn73@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-15-29-577_fa08634544a8e702.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn52@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-15-28-705_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=tKt2zyewZAU:KO7NcoAUB8o:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn66@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-15-26-272_f343091d76839cd4.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245704354},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:04","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:04","title":"How to make your iPhone alarm louder, and 5 other tips for making sure your alarm goes off properly","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-make-iphone-alarm-louder","description":"<figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/62295d796ec7c20019cd6d2d?format=jpeg\" height=\"1060\" width=\"2121\" charset=\"\" alt=\"woman on phone in bed\"/><figcaption>There are several ways to optimize your iPhone alarm to make sure it wakes you up.<p class=\"copyright\">Adam Hester/Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>You can make your iPhone alarm louder by dragging the Ringer and Alerts slider in the Settings app.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">You should also be sure to choose a louder alarm sound that has a more aggressive noise, which can more easily wake you.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Consider playing the alarm through external speakers or using an Apple Watch, which can also help wake you with haptics.&#160;</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-reference\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Visit Insider&#39;s Tech Reference library for more stories</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>Is your iPhone&#39;s alarm not loud enough to do its job in the morning? Sure, you might bear some of the blame if you&#39;re an especially sound sleeper, but your iPhone needs to be able to step up to the challenge as well. The good news is that you can raise the volume with just a few taps and not miss your wake-up alarm.&#160;</p><h2><strong>How to make your iPhone alarm louder</strong></h2><p>Your iPhone relies on one accessible slider in Settings to control the overall volume of your alarm. Just beware that this is also your phone&#39;s ringer volume, so you should choose a level that&#39;s appropriate for both.&#160;</p><p><strong>1.</strong> On your iPhone, start the <strong>Settings </strong>app.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Tap <strong>Sound &#38; Haptics</strong>.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> In the <strong>Ringer and Alerts</strong> section, drag the slider to the right to increase the volume.&#160;</p><figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/622967046ec7c20019cd6dff?format=jpeg\" height=\"1919\" width=\"1242\" charset=\"\" alt=\"Changing the ringer and alerts volume on iPhone.\"/><figcaption>In the Sound &#38; Haptics section of Settings, you can adjust the volume of your ringer and alerts.<p class=\"copyright\">Dave Johnson</p></figcaption></figure><p>By default, the volume buttons on the side of your iPhone do not control the ringer and alerts volume (which is also the alarm volume). But you can enable this, which makes it easier to quickly adjust the volume at bedtime. In the Settings app, tap <strong>Sound &#38; Haptics</strong>, then in the <strong>Ringer and Alerts</strong> section, turn on <strong>Change with Buttons</strong> by swiping the button to the right. Just be sure you don&#39;t accidentally lower the volume using the buttons.&#160;</p><h2><strong>Other tips for making sure your iPhone alarm goes off properly</strong></h2><p>There are a few other tips you can check or apply to your alarm&#39;s volume and vibration to help wake you up.</p><ul><li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Make sure you haven&#39;t accidentally set the alarm sound to None.</strong> Start the <strong>Clock </strong>app, tap the <strong>Alarm </strong>tab and tap the alarm you want to use.

That&#39;s especially true if you use your own song or sound effect. Start the <strong>Clock </strong>app, tap the <strong>Alarm </strong>tab and tap the alarm you want to use. Tap <strong>Sound</strong>, then explore the various sounds to see which one works best for you.&#160;</li><li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Change or customize the alarm vibration. </strong>Through the Clock app, you can also <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-change-alarm-sound-on-iphone\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">change your alarm vibration or even create a custom vibration pattern</a> to accompany the alarm&#39;s sound.&#160;</li><li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Play the alarm through external speakers.</strong> If you can&#39;t make your iPhone loud enough to suit you, that probably means there&#39;s something wrong with the phone&#39;s built-in speaker, and you might want to get it serviced. In the meantime, you might consider connecting the phone to a dock with integrated speakers or some other external speaker that you can set as loud as you like.&#160;</li><li><strong>Use the iPhone with an Apple Watch.</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-pair-apple-watch-with-iphone\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">An Apple Watch can be configured to work with your iPhone&#39;s Alarm app</a> and will wake you with vibrations and sound.</li></ul><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-make-iphone-alarm-louder\">Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=7hmVjOz21_s:C4btjrIVdkE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=7hmVjOz21_s:C4btjrIVdkE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=7hmVjOz21_s:C4btjrIVdkE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=7hmVjOz21_s:C4btjrIVdkE:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=7hmVjOz21_s:C4btjrIVdkE:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=7hmVjOz21_s:C4btjrIVdkE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=7hmVjOz21_s:C4btjrIVdkE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=7hmVjOz21_s:C4btjrIVdkE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 10 Mar 2022 03:01:03 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/62295d5f6ec7c20019cd6d28?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"cb5097c1c6fcd06e07deeb319bfed17f","destWidth":1824,"destHeight":1368,"sourceBytes":109678,"destBytes":109678,"author":"insider@insider.com (Dave Johnson)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/62295d796ec7c20019cd6d2d?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn96@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-15-26-161_b6e88caaa60c19d0.webp","https://i.insider.com/622967046ec7c20019cd6dff?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn19@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-15-25-616_69c10c622126ab24.webp","https://i.insider.com/622967396ec7c20019cd6e03?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn84@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-15-36-055_59cc021ca03c50a3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn56@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-15-33-003_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=7hmVjOz21_s:C4btjrIVdkE:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn19@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-15-28-935_257b62de0e81a33b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=7hmVjOz21_s:C4btjrIVdkE:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn20@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-15-32-848_53ee5d6b97f30c4c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn52@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-15-28-705_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=7hmVjOz21_s:C4btjrIVdkE:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn80@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-15-30-385_f7e8e383048d8f34.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245704360},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:04","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:04","title":"Donald Trump Jr. says his father only praised Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong Un, and Xi Jinping in order to 'play' them","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/donadld-trump-jr-says-father-praised-leaders-to-play-them-2022-3","description":"<figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6229653b7eb82f00180e4514?format=jpeg\" height=\"1571\" width=\"2095\" charset=\"\" alt=\"Donald Trump Jr. speaks at a podium.\"/><figcaption>Donald Trump Jr. said his father&#39;s praising of world leaders was not an act of &#34;capitulation.&#34;<p class=\"copyright\">Ethan Miller/Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>Donald Trump Jr. said his father&#39;s flattery of world leaders like Russia&#39;s Vladimir Putin doesn&#39;t equate to &#34;capitulation.&#34;</li>\n<li>Trump Jr. said his father knows how to deal with &#34;powerful men&#34;

aired its finale on February 27, and the episode seemed to complete the main characters&#39; story arcs. After a long journey across the American West, they had reached their destinations and some main characters had died.</p><p>But two weeks earlier, the company Paramount (formerly ViacomCBS) announced during an investor presentation that it had ordered more episodes of the series, stopping short of saying it had been renewed for season two.</p><p>&#34;1883&#34; and &#34;Yellowstone&#34; executive producer David Glasser told Insider during an interview this week that fans shouldn&#39;t expect a second season, but that the story would continue.</p><p>He declined to specify what form the new episodes would take. But Paramount also announced another prequel series, &#34;1932,&#34; and Glasser said it&#39;s safe to think of the prequels together as an &#34;anthology series,&#34; implying that more could be on the way.</p><p>&#34;If you&#39;re a fan of the Dutton family and the saga bringing you to the current day [portrayed in &#39;Yellowstone&#39;], what will come is that continued saga,&#34; he said.</p><p>Glasser said that Sheridan knows how &#34;Yellowstone&#34; will end, no matter how many seasons it continues for. And he had conceived of the 1800s history of the Dutton family when he first started writing &#34;Yellowstone,&#34; long before &#34;1883&#34; was a reality.</p><figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/619bbb6b1ca92500180c3a36?format=jpeg\" height=\"1230\" width=\"1748\" charset=\"\" alt=\"yellowstone\"/><figcaption>Kevin Costner in &#34;Yellowstone.&#34;<p class=\"copyright\">Paramount Network</p></figcaption></figure><p>&#34;He knows every character and backstory,&#34; Glasser said. &#34;He told me the &#39;Yellowstone&#39; ending the day we started. When that happens, I don&#39;t know. But he knows where every character ends up.&#34;</p><p>&#34;Yellowstone,&#34; which stars Kevin Costner as the powerful rancher John Dutton, concluded its fourth season in January and Paramount Network quickly <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/yellowstone-renewed-for-season-5-on-paramount-network-2022-2\">renewed the series for season five</a>. The season-four finale was viewed by 9.3 million viewers the day it aired, making it the biggest cable telecast since 2017.</p><p>The streaming rights to &#34;Yellowstone&#34; belong to NBCUniversal&#39;s Peacock, which nabbed them in 2020 before Paramount+ launched in March of 2021. But Paramount is still taking advantage of the show&#39;s popularity. Creator Taylor Sheridan recently renewed a lucrative deal with the company <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/more-tv-shows-from-yellowstone-creator-1883-mayor-of-kingstown-2022-1\">to make original series</a>, including the &#34;Yellowstone&#34; spinoffs and &#34;Mayor of Kingstown.&#34;</p><p>The strategy has paid off. Paramount+ said that &#34;1883&#34; was its biggest original-series debut yet when it premiered in December. The Paramount company added 9.4 million subscribers in Q4 2021 across its streaming platforms (which also includes Showtime), 80% of which came from Paramount+.</p><p>On the franchise&#39;s success, Glasser said that Sheridan, who grew up on a ranch in Texas, was able to tap into an audience he knows well.&#160;</p><p>&#34;Taylor&#39;s a cowboy,&#34; he said. &#34;His writing comes in the evenings. His days are spent being a rancher and farmer. He knows his audience well and he served up something that was for that audience.&#34;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/yellowstone-prequel-1883-story-will-continue-but-without-season-2-2022-3\">Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=g8ubPt9VNVw:zFagtu1YzHQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=g8ubPt9VNVw:zFagtu1YzHQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=g8ubPt9VNVw:zFagtu1YzHQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=g8ubPt9VNVw:zFagtu1YzHQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=g8ubPt9VNVw:zFagtu1YzHQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=g8ubPt9VNVw:zFagtu1YzHQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=g8ubPt9VNVw:zFagtu1YzHQ:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=g8ubPt9VNVw:zFagtu1YzHQ:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 10 Mar 2022 14:04:31 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/6229057b7eb82f00180e330c?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"d95ea8569264f7e1ca995081f0b466de","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn69@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-15-23-069_3b9b59cff6b0779f.webp","destWidth":1673,"destHeight":1254,"sourceBytes":43824,"destBytes":43824,"author":"tclark@insider.com (Travis Clark)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/61dc8a1a4ede320018b6debb?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn76@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-15-24-642_0a4a55c198e189a0.webp","https://i.insider.com/619bbb6b1ca92500180c3a36?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn35@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-15-24-917_ff186588ed1e9e43.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn56@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-15-33-003_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=g8ubPt9VNVw:zFagtu1YzHQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn71@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-15-30-131_7db9bba5cf16d859.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=g8ubPt9VNVw:zFagtu1YzHQ:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn64@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-15-29-075_002fc98d8a342cee.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn52@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-15-28-705_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=g8ubPt9VNVw:zFagtu1YzHQ:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn26@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-15-29-251_642488d45771f8aa.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245704380},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:04","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:04","title":"The US Navy's only operational sub named after a president has been doing top-secret missions for 17 years","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/navy-seawolf-class-sub-jimmy-carter-secret-missions-17-years-2022-3","description":"<figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/622961cf6ec7c20019cd6d7d?format=jpeg\" height=\"647\" width=\"1295\" charset=\"\" alt=\"Navy Seawolf-class submarine USS Jimmy Carter\"/><figcaption>US Navy Seawolf-class fast-attack submarine USS Jimmy Carter, September 11, 2017.<p class=\"copyright\">US Navy/Lt.

responsible for investigating Amazon accused the tech giant of lying.</li>\n<li>The committee is investigating whether Amazon used third-party seller data to develop its products.</li>\n<li>It said Amazon stonewalled requests for evidence and provided &#34;ever-shifting explanations.&#34;</li>\n</ul><p>The Congressional Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law sent a <a href=\"https://judiciary.house.gov/uploadedfiles/hjc_referral_--_amazon.pdf\">letter</a> to the Department of Justice on Wednesday requesting that it investigate &#34;potentially criminal conduct by Amazon.&#34;</p><p>The committee has been conducting a long-running antitrust investigation into whether Amazon <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-uses-seller-data-copy-products-alleges-house-antitrust-report-2020-10\">exploited third-party seller data to give itself an unfair competitive edge</a>. Referring Amazon to the DOJ, and particularly accusing it of lying and obstructing Congress, marks an escalation in tensions between lawmakers and the tech giant.</p><p>Amazon employees told <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reviews/out?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Famazon-scooped-up-data-from-its-own-sellers-to-launch-competing-products-11587650015\">The Wall Street Journal</a> in 2020 that the company used third-party data to develop its own first-party products. The committee said in its letter that it uncovered similar evidence from former Amazon employees.&#160;</p><p>The letter said although Amazon told the committee it never used third-party seller data, it didn&#39;t produce any evidence to contradict the committee and The Journal&#39;s findings.</p><p>&#34;Throughout the course of the Committee&#39;s investigation, Amazon attempted to cover up its lie by offering ever-shifting explanations of what it called its &#39;Seller Data Protection Policy,&#39;&#34; the letter said.</p><p>The letter also pointed to a 2021 report by <a href=\"https://themarkup.org/amazons-advantage/2021/10/14/amazon-puts-its-own-brands-first-above-better-rated-products\">The Markup, </a>which&#160;said Amazon gave its own-brand products preferential placement above third-party products on its marketplace.</p><p>&#34;After Amazon was caught in a lie and repeated misrepresentations, it stonewalled the Committee&#39;s efforts to uncover the truth,&#34; the letter said.</p><p>Finally, the letter said the committee wrote to Amazon CEO <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/andy-jassy-amazon-web-services-ceo-2021-1\">Andy Jassy</a> in October 2021 offering the chance to provide evidence exonerating itself.</p><p>According to the letter, Amazon brought in a law firm who said the company had conducted multiple internal investigations. None of them found evidence that employees regularly exploited third-party seller data or that the company gave its own products a boost on its marketplace, it said.</p><p>&#34;When the Committee asked for the business records that proved these claims, however, Amazon refused to provide them,&#34; the letter said.</p><p>In response to the letter, an Amazon spokesperson told Insider: &#34;There&#39;s no factual basis for this, as demonstrated in the huge volume of information we&#39;ve provided over several years of good-faith cooperation with this investigation.&#34;</p><p>The DOJ did not immediately respond when contacted by Insider outside of usual US working hours.</p><p>At a congressional antitrust hearing in 2020 then-Amazon CEO <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-ceo-jeff-bezos-richest-man-world-career-life-story-2017-7\">Jeff Bezos</a> said although Amazon has a policy against using &#34;seller-specific data&#34;

In July, Yoon criticized outgoing <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/south-korea-has-dropped-its-inhumane-workweek-to-52-hours-a-week-2018-7\">President Moon Jae-in&#39;s policy</a> to promote better work-life balance. Moon&#39;s policy limits the hours people can work to 52 hours a week &#8212; that&#39;s 40 hours a week, plus another 12 hours of overtime.&#160;</p><p>Yoon said the system should allow for more flexibility, as some workers &#8212; such as game developers &#8212; may need to work longer hours during peak periods before going on an extended break.</p><p>&#34;Workers should be allowed to work 120 hours a week and then take a good rest,&#34; he said, according to the <a href=\"https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2021/11/356_313675.html\">Korea Times.</a> His suggestion of 120 hours a week is the equivalent of five 24-hour days.</p><p>The average South Korean worker worked 1,908 hours in 2020 (36.69 hours a week), according to data from the <a href=\"https://data.oecd.org/emp/hours-worked.htm\">Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD.)</a> That&#39;s one of highest hours-worked totals across the 38-country economic organization, behind only Costa Rica, Mexico, and Colombia. In the US, for comparison, the average worker put in 1,767 hours of work in 2020 (33.98 hours a week).</p><p>Although South Korea&#39;s working hours in 2020 looked punishing, they were down from 1,967 hours in 2019 and 2,106 hours in 2013, per <a href=\"https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/employment/data/hours-worked/average-annual-hours-actually-worked_data-00303-en\">OECD data</a>.</p><p>South Korea is known for its hard-driving work culture.

That&#39;s nonsense,&#34; he said, per the Korea Herald. &#34;I heard that people on the political opposite side from me distorted what I said as if I said we should work 120 hours. It&#39;s not worth any attention.&#34;</p><p>Yoon has made other controversial comments on his campaign trail, including one in which he appeared to disparage Africa.</p><p>&#34;Companies depend on internationally competitive technology. There is no such thing as hands and feet labor like people used to do anymore. India doesn&#39;t even do that anymore. It&#39;s something only a place like Africa still does,&#34; said <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/yoon-seok-youl-faces-racism-controversy-with-comment-belittling-africa-10544723\">Yoon during a meeting</a> with university students in September, the <a href=\"https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2021/09/356_315689.html\">Korea Times</a> reported.</p><p>He has also suggested that feminism is responsible for the country&#39;s abysmal birth rate.

On February 24, Russian President <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/putin-threatens-worst-ever-consequences-if-west-intervenes-in-ukraine-2022-2\">Vladimir Putin made comments seen as a thinly-veiled threa</a>t to western and NATO nations during a speech offering his rationale for the invasion.&#160;</p><p>They would face &#34;consequences greater than any you have faced in history,&#34; if they became embroiled in the war, he said, while alluding to Russia&#39;s enormous nuclear arsenal.&#160;</p><p>Putin also announced on March 27 that he put his nuclear armory on &#34;special alert&#34; in reaction to western sanctions on Russia.</p><p>The gesture was <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/putin-nuclear-alert-attempt-distract-ukraine-resistance-ben-wallace-2022-2\">interpreted by the UK&#39;s defense minister Ben Wallace</a> as an attempt to distract from the invasion of Ukraine, which many observers believe is proving far more difficult than Russia expected.</p><p>Nonetheless, moves of this kind appear to have informed the responses of NATO and Western supporters of Ukraine, who have proved wary to make any moves that could be read as an escalation.</p><p>One recent example was the US rejecting a plan from the Polish government to provide fighter jets to Ukraine.

Economists expect to see a rise of 7.9% in the consumer price index (CPI), following January&#39;s 7.5% increase.

An upside surprise may encourage the market to price a higher probability of a 50bp hike at the March and/or May meeting. However, we would encourage fading such a move as the Fed is currently hiking on eggshells given geopolitical uncertainty,&#34; Bank of America analysts said in a note.&#160;</p><p><a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/commodities/oil-price\">Brent crude oil</a> was up over 4% at $115.60 a barrel, paring some of Wednesday&#39;s steep losses, after the United Arab Emirates <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/commodities/oil-price-today-uae-opec-should-boost-output-faster-production-2022-3\">appeared to climb down</a> from an earlier pledge to raise output.

Both represented modest increases from the past fiscal year and the measure would keep the government&#39;s doors open through Sept. 30, the end of the current fiscal year.</p><p><a href=\"https://rules.house.gov/sites/democrats.rules.house.gov/files/BILLS-117HR2471SA-RCP-117-35.pdf\">The 2,741 page bill</a> amounted to one of the largest spending bills in history. It was released in the very early hours of Wednesday morning after months of protracted negotiations and last-minute haggling on a range of spending programs. Lawmakers also approved a four-day funding patch to give the Senate more time to process the bill.</p><p>But many rank-and-file Democrats <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/democrats-states-covid-19-relief-cash-government-funding-bill-2022-3\">squared off with Pelosi</a> after learning the bill clawed back stimulus cash from states to offset around half of $15 billion meant to be spent on new coronavirus aid, mainly vaccines and future pandemic preparedness. The revolt forced her to scrap the funding and push a standalone measure at a later date that&#39;s all but doomed in the Senate given GOP resistance to additional spending.</p><p>Pelosi acknowledged that Democrats ultimately didn&#39;t get everything they wanted, specifically on coronavirus aid. The Biden administration initially sought $22.5 billion in more funding, only to see their request get dropped in Pelosi&#39;s last-ditch efforts to salvage the rest of the package.</p><p>&#34;We have a lively negotiation. It has to be bipartisan,&#34; Pelosi said earlier Wednesday. &#34;We wanted it to be bipartisan. But in the Senate, you need 60 votes.&#34;</p><p>The legislation also <a href=\"https://appropriations.house.gov/sites/democrats.appropriations.house.gov/files/Ukraine%20Supplemental%20Summary.pdf\">set aside $13.6 billion</a> in emergency humanitarian and military aid for Ukraine, a top White House and Congressional priority. The amount gradually crept up with many lawmakers in both parties eager to provide financial and military help to Ukraine, especially as the Russian military campaign intensified in recent days.</p><p>Roughly $6.5 billion of that pot of money was set aside to help Ukraine prop up its defenses, and another $4 billion would go to the State Department so it could channel funds into migrant aid among other uses.</p><p>The bill contained an extra $12 billion for the Internal Revenue Service ahead of a tax season that experts say will further strain the agency. The money was devoted to help the IRS sort through a massive backlog of paper returns and modernize some of its systems. Democrats said it was the largest infusion of federal funding in two decades.</p><p>Republicans and Democrats seemed satisfied with the measures secured in the package.

But it goes further in two ways.</p><p>The bill would kickstart a process to suspend Russia from the World Trade Organization and reauthorize the Magnitsky Act, which allows the US government to sanction entities that it deems to be human rights offenders.</p><p>It&#39;s the latest economic penalty that Congress wants to impose on Russia in an escalating campaign to devastate its economy and punish Russian President Vladimir Putin for the onslaught in Ukraine. The US and its European allies had already hammered the Kremlin with other sanctions, cutting off its access to international cash reserves and penalizing political and business elites with close ties to Putin.</p><p>Yet the White House had faced <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/nancy-pelosi-calls-for-a-ban-on-russian-oil-imports-2022-3\">rising bipartisan pressure</a> to impose an energy embargo as Moscow intensified its brutal military campaign by targeting Ukrainian civilians. The Biden administration had been reluctant to further rattle global energy markets, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/gas-price-outlook-forecast-biden-russia-crude-oil-ban-sanctions-2022-3\">likely leading to even higher gas prices</a>.</p><p>Republicans and Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee had been drafting legislation through the weekend to block the importation of Russian energy supplies. But the White House intervened on Monday to try and squash the bill and prevent them from appearing to corner the administration, two congressional aides told Insider.&#160;</p><p>&#34;They wanted to scoop us,&#34; one of the aides said, adding that the White House had been looped in for days. The aides were granted anonymity to reveal private details about internal discussions.</p><p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi scheduled the vote despite the early White House objections. But <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/the-house-passes-government-funding-bill-ukraine-aid-2022-3\">it was ensnared in a separate battle</a> to fund the government, briefly stalling its progress.</p><p>Republicans went along with it. Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas, the top Republican tax-writer in the House, told reporters he was voting for it &#34;principally because Congress forced the president&#39;s hand&#34; on the oil and gas ban.</p><p>Former President Donald Trump has made no secret of his admiration of Russian President Vladimir Putin, calling him <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-vladimir-putin-ukraine-invasion-justification-genius-savvy-2022-2\">a &#34;genius&#34; and &#34;very savvy&#34;</a> recently. But Republican leaders like Kevin McCarthy <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/kevin-mccarthy-theres-nothing-savvy-or-genius-about-putin-2022-3\">distanced themselves</a> from the remarks on Wednesday.&#160;</p><p>Where the House bill goes from here remains uncertain. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer held off from committing to voting on the measure at his weekly press conference on Tuesday, telling reporters that he would have to see the final text of the bill and would then work with the White House to &#34;find the best way to make sure that the oil import ban is tight and tough.&#34;</p><p>Senators from both parties said they believed the White House could go further than it already has to further isolate Russia from the global economy, such as by choking off its trade.</p><p>&#34;Russia&#39;s actions do not warrant them continuing to reap the fruits of the international trade system,&#34; Sen.

Among the 31 items listed under the &#34;A La Carte&#34; section is one simply labeled &#34;Taco.&#34; It is there that you can specify &#34;hard-shelled&#34; and &#34;ground beef.&#34;</p></div><div class=\"slide\">I ordered a taco, of course, and a beef enchilada. My partner ordered the number one, which included a tostada, a taco, and a cheese enchilada. As we waited, a freshly-fried basket of tortilla chips arrived with salsa.<figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/622906e37eb82f00180e33cd?format=jpeg\" height=\"3024\" width=\"4032\" charset=\"\" alt=\"Chips and salsa at Mitla Cafe in San Bernardino, Calfornia, the 85-year-old restaurant that inspired the creation of Taco Bell.\"/><figcaption><p class=\"copyright\">Ben Gilbert/Insider</p></figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"slide\">Though visually similar, and made from the same ingredients, it&#39;s hard to overstate how different Mitla Cafe&#39;s hard-shelled taco is from Taco Bell.<figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/622907749fa32d00184c9625?format=jpeg\" height=\"3024\" width=\"4032\" charset=\"\" alt=\"A photo of the original hard-shelled ground beef taco from Mitla Cafe that inspired Glen Bell to create Taco Bell.\"/><figcaption><p class=\"copyright\">Ben Gilbert/Insider</p></figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"slide\">How different is Mitla Cafe&#39;s hard-shelled ground beef taco from Taco Bell&#39;s hard-shelled ground beef taco?&#160;Let us count the ways! For starters, Mitla Cafe fries each tortilla to order.<figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/622909c29fa32d00184c9694?format=jpeg\" height=\"3024\" width=\"4032\" charset=\"\" alt=\"An image of a hard-shelled ground beef taco at Mitla Cafe, the restaurant that inspired Taco Bell.\"/><figcaption><p class=\"copyright\">Ben Gilbert/Insider</p></figcaption></figure><p>You can see the difference both in the tortilla&#39;s lighter color and in the irregularity of its edges. You can also instantly taste the difference, as Mitla&#39;s hard-shelled tortilla doesn&#39;t instantly crack into a trillion pieces after a single bite.&#160;</p></div><div class=\"slide\">Inside the tortilla, Mitla Cafe uses a heavily-spiced ground beef patty rather than loose ground beef.<figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/62290a769fa32d00184c96e9?format=jpeg\" height=\"3024\" width=\"4032\" charset=\"\" alt=\"A photo of the hard-shelled ground beef taco at Mitla Cafe, which inspired the creation of Taco Bell.\"/><figcaption><p class=\"copyright\">Ben Gilbert/Insider</p></figcaption></figure><p>The biggest difference in flavor comes from the primary ingredient in Mitla Cafe&#39;s hard-shelled taco: The beef.</p><p>Rather than using loosely sauteed beef which can sog through the tortilla, Mitla creates a kind of burger patty. It&#39;s heavily-spiced, textured, and wildly delicious. The beef, beyond everything else, was the best part of Mitla&#39;s foundational taco.&#160;</p><p>It probably goes without saying, but this is a significantly better taco than the one it inspired at Taco Bell.</p></div><div class=\"slide\">The rest of the ingredients &#8212; shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes, and grated cheddar cheese &#8212; were improved simply by not coming from a fast-food kitchen.<figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/62290be17eb82f00180e35c8?format=jpeg\" height=\"2274\" width=\"3024\" charset=\"\" alt=\"A hard-shelled ground beef taco at Mitla Cafe, the 85-year-old restaurant that inspired Glen Bell to create Taco Bell.\"/><figcaption><p class=\"copyright\">Ben Gilbert/Insider</p></figcaption></figure><p>More often than not, the lettuce and tomatoes used in fast food items is limp, cold, and flavorless. That&#39;s because it&#39;s often pre-cut and shipped in bags to the franchise for ease of use.</p><p>The experience at Mitla Cafe was what you would expect from a restaurant: the lettuce and tomato were crisp, and the cheddar was room temperature rather than cold. We&#39;re not talking about a revelatory experience here, but it&#39;s clear that the quality was higher solely based on its context. And it makes a difference in the final product when you&#39;re biting through crunchy lettuce rather than wilted greens.</p></div><div class=\"slide\">Beyond the taco, everything we got at Mitla Cafe was tremendous. It&#39;s easy to understand why it&#39;s been a community staple for over 80 years.<figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/622915c47eb82f00180e3994?format=jpeg\" height=\"3024\" width=\"4032\" charset=\"\" alt=\"An enchilada, a tostada, and a hard-shelled ground beef taco at Mitla Cafe, the restaurant that inspired Glen Bell to create Taco Bell.\"/><figcaption>The combination plate my partner got featured a cheese enchilada, a bean tostada, and a hard-shelled ground beef taco. It was glorious.<p class=\"copyright\">Ben Gilbert/Insider</p></figcaption></figure><p>From the fast, friendly service to the delicious food, it&#39;s easy to understand why Mitla Cafe has survived and thrived for nearly 100 years.</p><p>For me, having grown up in the suburbs outside New York City, the experience at Mitla Cafe evoked nostalgia-laced memories of chicken cacciatore and lasagna dinners at my favorite Italian-American restaurant from childhood, <a href=\"https://www.johnthebakerrestaurant.com/\">John the Baker</a>. The flavors are different, of course, but there&#39;s a universality to comforting home cooking that crosses cultures seamlessly.&#160;</p></div><div class=\"slide\">For more on the history of Mitla

href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-stock-split-20-for-one-buyback-shares-surge-2022-3\">20-for-1 stock splits</a> from tech giants <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/googl-stock\">Alphabet</a> and <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/amzn-stock\">Amazon</a> could lead to a big shakeup in the 126-year old <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/index/dow_jones\">Dow Jones Industrial Average</a> later this year.</p><p>That&#39;s because the 30-member index popular with investors is price weighted, which means sky-high stock prices are usually a limiting factor to be included in the index.</p><p>Whereas the <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/index/s&#38;p_500\">S&#38;P 500</a> ranks its holdings based on the market value of its constituents, the Dow Jones ranks its holdings based on the absolute level of its constituents&#39; stock price.</p><p>That means <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/unh-stock\">UnitedHealth Group</a> has a higher weighting than Apple in the Dow Jones because its current stock price of about $485 is more than double <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/aapl-stock\">Apple&#39;s</a> current stock price of about $160. That&#39;s despite the fact that Apple is six times the size of UnitedHealth Group based on the traditional market capitalization measure.</p><p>There is little criteria for a company to be included in the Dow Jones, other than that the stock has to already be included in the S&#38;P 500, and is not a utility or transportation company.</p><p>According to guidelines from S&#38;P Dow Jones Indices, a stock &#34;typically is added to the index only if the company has an excellent reputation, demonstrates sustained growth and is of interest to a large number of investors.&#34; It&#39;s safe to say that Alphabet and Amazon both meet those criteria.</p><p>And a post-stock split inclusion in the index wouldn&#39;t be the first time a mega-cap tech company joined the Dow Jones index. Apple was added to the Dow Jones in 2015, about nine months after it enacted a 7-for-1 stock split that brought its stock price down to about $100 from about $700.</p><p>Once the stock splits are enacted, Alphabet and Amazon&#39;s stock price will fall from a current price of $2,668 and $2,885 to about $133 and $144, respectively. As to who the mega-tech giants will replace in the index, potential candidates include the two smallest constituents of the index, Walgreens and Intel.</p><p>Amazon replacing Walgreens would make sense given that both companies are categorized as consumer stocks, while Alphabet replacing Intel could happen given both have a strong tech focus.</p><p>Gene Munster of Loup Ventures believes it&#39;s inevitable that all of the mega-cap tech companies will be added to the Dow Jones index.</p><p>&#34;Eventually, all these big tech companies are going to find their way into the Dow because eventually they will all become essentially consumer staple companies,&#34; Munster told CNBC on Thursday.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-stock-split-dow-jones-industrial-average-index-shakeup-alphabet-2022-3\">Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=5RI-krCHEE0:29pIAXnBAZM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=5RI-krCHEE0:29pIAXnBAZM:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=5RI-krCHEE0:29pIAXnBAZM:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=5RI-krCHEE0:29pIAXnBAZM:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=5RI-krCHEE0:29pIAXnBAZM:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=5RI-krCHEE0:29pIAXnBAZM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=5RI-krCHEE0:29pIAXnBAZM:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=5RI-krCHEE0:29pIAXnBAZM:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 10 Mar 2022 14:39:20 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/61a4e00dee97950018841532?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"c3d5942f5158f53e2507d2a1b011a3cc","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn48@2020_3/2022/03/14/08-15-23-271_4e0442bc0dc83675.webp","destWidth":5973,"destHeight":4480,"sourceBytes":1069458,"destBytes":1069458,"author":"mfox@businessinsider.com (Matthew Fox)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5f3a825ce89ebf001f04527b?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn57@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-15-25-538_97c493f18e67611f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn56@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-15-33-003_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=5RI-krCHEE0:29pIAXnBAZM:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn76@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-15-32-119_0e1d143983ac719d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=5RI-krCHEE0:29pIAXnBAZM:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn3@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-15-35-154_dec4cb94f3220f45.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn52@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-15-28-705_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=5RI-krCHEE0:29pIAXnBAZM:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn96@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-15-39-160_287db77d8829c14c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245704318},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:04","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:04","title":"Prices of TVs, vacuums, and cars soared by as much as 17% in Russia in the last week, as the Kremlin calls inflation a 'shocking external impact on our economy'","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/prices-tvs-vaccums-cars-soar-in-russia-as-inflation-bites-2022-3","description":"<figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6229f1bf6ec7c20019cd73a3?format=jpeg\" height=\"1328\" width=\"1770\" charset=\"\" alt=\"Russian shopper\"/><figcaption><p class=\"copyright\">Alexander Ryumin\\TASS via Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>The cost of consumer goods in Russia is soaring as the country&#39;s currency falls.</li>\n<li>The price of TVs, cars, and appliances spiked by as much as 17% in the past week.</li>\n<li>Companies are also pulling out of Russia, leading to shortage concerns.&#160;</li>\n</ul><p>The cost of consumer goods and food is soaring in Russia as Western sanctions severely weaken the value of the Russian ruble and disrupt supply chains.&#160;</p><p>The cost of TV sets, vacuum cleaners, and cars shot up by as much as 17% in the week after Russia invaded Ukraine, according to data from Russia&#39;s governmental statistics agency, <a href=\"https://rosstat.gov.ru/storage/mediabank/38_09-03-2022.htm\">the Federal State Statistics Service</a>.

Workdays could last up to 12 hours and days off were sparse. I returned home tired, sore, smelly, and sticky, and woke up the next morning after not nearly enough sleep to do it all again.&#160;</p><h2><strong>The winery was hard, humbling, and laborious work, but I loved it</strong></h2><p><strong></strong></p><figure><strong><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6228bcd17eb82f00180e1a21?format=jpeg\" height=\"2597\" width=\"3463\" charset=\"\" alt=\"Zoe Baillargeon Some of the winery crew.

Every day, I learned something new, like driving a forklift or mastering barrel rolling and stillage working,which involves moving, stacking, and filling wine barrels, in the wine caves.</p><p>The crew made the long shifts fun by singing along to &#34;Red Red Wine&#34; and other songs while working the pinot noir grape-crush line.</p><h2>One of my most memorable moments was powering through six punchdowns in a single morning</h2><p>Punchdowns are where you use a specialized tool to manipulate and punch through the hard, fermented floating cap of grape matter on a several-hundred-gallon tank, releasing color and tannins. It&#39;s a whole body workout. Sometimes, the grape caps are so hard it&#39;s like trying to punch through clay.&#160;</p><figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6228bd999fa32d00184c81cd?format=jpeg\" height=\"3024\" width=\"4032\" charset=\"\" alt=\"Doing aerated pumpovers.

When harvest ended at the winery in October 2021, I returned to freelance writing and the cocktail distillery with renewed purpose and a zest for discovery that the pandemic had sapped from me.</p><h2><strong>Since first starting work at the distillery, I&#39;ve had to frequently remind myself that there&#39;s no shame in needing a second job</strong></h2><p><strong></strong></p><figure><strong><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6228bd3b7eb82f00180e1a4e?format=jpeg\" height=\"2274\" width=\"3024\" charset=\"\" alt=\"Organizing and doing stillage in the wine caves.

I was doing what I needed to do to support myself, and gained new life experiences and became a more well-rounded person because of it.</p><p>With the pandemic&#39;s two-year anniversary on the horizon, my freelancing is finally back on track and better than ever. I still work part-time in the distillery tasting room, partly for financial security and partly because I enjoy the people and atmosphere so much.</p><h2>Working at the cocktail distillery and winery became about more than just a part-time job &#8212; the first-hand experience of working in production has also made me a better wine and drinks writer</h2><p>It&#39;s one thing to read about inoculating cold soaks to start fermentation and quite another to start your mornings with the smell of industrial Fermaid O yeast in your nose and covered with sticky grape juice from doing pumpovers and punchdowns.&#160;</p><p>Ultimately, my forays into winemaking and cocktails reminded me of the joys and rewards of trying new things just because, even if nothing comes of it. My mental health had taken a nosedive during the pandemic, but it rebounded as I stepped outside of my comfort zone again and enjoyed the challenges of a new job.&#160;</p><p>The beverage industry was a safe harbor for me to find my feet again, discover new interests, and learn some cool new things in the process. I hope to stay involved in the spirits world in the future, maybe even by working different harvests around the world.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/work-distillery-winery-extra-income-part-time-side-gig-2022-3\">Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=RzVKSxTNmxA:k71z4EEuaKU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=RzVKSxTNmxA:k71z4EEuaKU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=RzVKSxTNmxA:k71z4EEuaKU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=RzVKSxTNmxA:k71z4EEuaKU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=RzVKSxTNmxA:k71z4EEuaKU:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=RzVKSxTNmxA:k71z4EEuaKU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=RzVKSxTNmxA:k71z4EEuaKU:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=RzVKSxTNmxA:k71z4EEuaKU:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 10 Mar 2022 14:33:04 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/6228c2a49fa32d00184c8373?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"9e467f355b14609e391578c8fe07b894","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn90@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-15-23-886_f2891b56389593fc.webp","destWidth":2294,"destHeight":1720,"sourceBytes":242616,"destBytes":242616,"author":"insider@insider.com (Zoe Baillargeon)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/6228bf6c7eb82f00180e1b6c?format=jpeg":null,"https://i.insider.com/6228be9e7eb82f00180e1acb?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn80@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-15-28-118_1a9ce64d3ad4059d.webp","https://i.insider.com/6228b5b67eb82f00180e18b8?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn32@2020_5/2022/03/14/08-15-26-636_39800cac69d2f735.webp","https://i.insider.com/6228bcd17eb82f00180e1a21?format=jpeg":null,"https://i.insider.com/6228bd999fa32d00184c81cd?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn32@2020_2/2022/03/14/08-15-24-917_9509fccbac848c4f.webp","https://i.insider.com/6228bd3b7eb82f00180e1a4e?format=jpeg":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn56@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-15-33-003_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=RzVKSxTNmxA:k71z4EEuaKU:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn50@2020_6/2022/03/14/08-15-27-697_17c70cdd11ff7246.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=RzVKSxTNmxA:k71z4EEuaKU:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn32@2020_4/2022/03/14/08-15-23-678_7f1916ddf7d3a1b1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn52@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-15-28-705_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=RzVKSxTNmxA:k71z4EEuaKU:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn98@2020_1/2022/03/14/08-15-26-483_aff17a0a8c09e810.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1647245704324},{"createdTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:04","updatedTime":"2022-03-14 16:15:04","title":"Taiwan says it's studying how Ukraine is repelling Russian troops for 'asymmetric warfare' plans: local reports","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/taiwan-studies-ukraine-resistance-for-asymmetric-war-plans-2022-3","description":"<figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6229b0f27eb82f00180e46b5?format=jpeg\" height=\"2064\" width=\"2759\" charset=\"\" alt=\"Taiwan’s defense minister Chiu Kuo-cheng (right) said Thursday that its military is studying the war in Ukraine on how to conduct asymmetric warfare.

President Joe Biden sent a delegation of former officials to meet Taiwan&#39;s democratically-elected president Tsai Ing-wen in Taipei last week, with retired Adm.

Inflation was initially expected to cool late last year as supply chains healed, yet lingering pain in the global logistics industry and new pressures on commodity prices have kept the problem around.</p><p>Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine has been the biggest factor boosting inflation in the past few weeks. Initial fears of an attack hit crude oil and natural gas prices, as Russia&#39;s energy sector <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/gas-price-outlook-forecast-biden-russia-crude-oil-ban-sanctions-2022-3\">plays a major role in feeding the global supply</a>. The conflict has since lifted prices for a range of other commodities <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/russia-ukraine-inflation-lifting-prices-american-shoppers-gas-wheat-nickel-2022-3\">including wheat, nickel, and fertilizer</a>. Though February only includes the first few days of Russia&#39;s invasion, the new release still captures some of the initial market activity as investors began to price in the attack.</p><p>The CPI measure also rose 0.8% through the month, according to the report, similarly&#160;matching the average economist forecast. That marked a pickup from the 0.6% gain seen in January, signaling inflation is still running red hot month-by-month.</p><p>Core CPI, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.5% in February, slowing from the 0.6% pace seen a month earlier. That, too, matched economist estimates.</p><p>Soaring prices for gas, rent, and food were the biggest drivers of February&#39;s stronger inflation. The government&#39;s gas-price measure leaped 6.6% through the month, sharply accelerating from the 0.8% decline seen the month prior. Food prices edged 1% higher, and shelter costs notched a 0.5% gain. Demand for those goods and services tends to stay elevated even when the Federal Reserve lifts interest rates. Their large upticks through February hint that, even if price growth cools across other categories, broad inflation is set to remain elevated in the coming months.</p><p>Other goods and services saw encouraging slowdowns in inflation or outright price declines over the month. Electricity prices fell 1.1% after January&#39;s 4.2% gain. Used cars and trucks, which previously fueled much of the US&#39;s pandemic inflation, saw prices drop by 0.2% following the prior month&#39;s 1.5% increase. Apparel inflation also eased to 0.7% growth from 1.1%.</p><p>There could soon be more cooling where that came from. The Federal Reserve is poised to raise interest rates at its March 16 policy meeting, kicking off a cycle of monetary tightening aimed at reining in inflation. Higher rates tend to cool spending and, in turn, leave businesses better equipped to match supply with demand. The February report is all but guaranteed to be the last of the near-zero-rate era.</p><p>There&#39;s a long way to go before inflation returns to its pre-pandemic trend, and fears of persistently strong price growth remain.
