So why is Disney+ even attempting to make another one? Well, thanks to the existence of the <strong>LEGO</strong> side of <em>Star Wars</em> entertainment, the franchise has the perfect path to have fun with the saga without sullying any of the mythology.</p>\n<p>The tongue-in-cheek comedic antics of the <strong>LEGO<em> Star Wars</em></strong> animated shorts and video games let the new <strong><em>LEGO Star Wars Holiday Special</em></strong> dig into the history of <em>Star Wars</em> with a delightfully goofy <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/lego-star-wars-holiday-special-trailer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">time travel adventure</a> that feels like <em>Avengers: Endgame</em>, <em>Back to the Future</em>, and <em>It&#8217;s a Wonderful Life</em> tossed into a blender with a family friendly version of <em>Robot Chicken</em>.<span id=\"more-645879\"></span></p>\n<p>The <em>LEGO Star Wars Holiday Special</em> finds the heroes of the new <em>Star Wars</em> trilogy getting ready to celebrate Life Day. Right off the bat, the special is made all the more intriguing by the fact that it takes place after the events of <em><strong>The Rise of Skywalker</strong></em>, revealing what Rey and Finn might really be up to if this were an adventure actually set in the canonical <em>Star Wars</em> universe. Rey is teaching Finn how to be more mindful of the Force by letting him use her yellow-bladed lightsaber to practice with a remote training droid.</p>\n<p>Finn isn&#8217;t doing the best with this training, and Rey (who is voiced by the spectacular Daisy Ridley impersonator <strong>Helen Sadler</strong>) is having a hard time figuring out how to be a better mentor. So after consulting the Jedi texts, she heads off to a nearby Jedi Temple to get some guidance on how to improve her training methods. It&#8217;s there that she finds a mysterious crystal which holds &#8220;the key to the galaxy&#8217;s past&#8221; which is how &#8220;a Jedi&#8217;s future becomes clear.&#8221; Using this crystal, Rey figures out that she must travel to the past to learn more from the likes of Jedi Master Yoda, Luke Skywalker, and others in order to be a more effective teacher.</p>\n<p>What begins as a simple lesson from seeing Luke Skywalker get his training on Dagoabah suddenly turns into a time-hopping series of missteps that threatens to undo the entire <em>Star Wars</em> universe. Though Rey makes amusing appearances during pivotal moments in <em>Star Wars</em> history, such as Luke&#8217;s heroic run through the Death Star trench in <em><strong>A New Hope</strong></em>, and less memorable scenes such as Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn waiting to settle a trade dispute in <em><strong>The Phantom Menace</strong></em>, eventually, she creates some trouble as the likes of Darth Vader and tons of other character from different points in the <em>Star Wars</em> timeline start to tumble through time portals with her.</p>\n<p>A lot of laughs and wild, impossible crossovers come from her frantically flying through time. Darth Vader meets himself during the Empire&#8217;s assault on Hoth, for example. And old and young Han Solo both give Greedo what&#8217;s coming to him. There&#8217;s also a big lightsaber battle aboard the speeding podracers of Anakin Skywalker and Sebulba, which also careen through various points in time, dragging more and more <em>Star Wars</em> characters with them until there&#8217;s a massive assembly of heroes and villains who begin to battle each other in the middle of the Lars homestead on Tatooine, much to the surprise of a young Luke Skywalker drinking little carton of blue milk. Even the upper half of Darth Maul gets in on the action.</p>\n<p>The adventure gets a tad more serious when Darth Vader gets his hands on this time traveling crystal, and Emperor Palpatine learns that the future isn&#8217;t so bright for him roughly 30 years after the events of <strong><em>Return of the Jedi</em></strong>. So he brings Kylo Ren from in the middle of <em><strong>The Last Jedi</strong></em> in order to hopefully avoid his failure. The way everything plays out from there has a lot of fun with the climax of <em>Return of the Jedi</em>, including even more lightsaber battles.</p>\n<p>If this doesn&#8217;t feel like much of a holiday special, don&#8217;t worry, there&#8217;s plenty of traditional Christmas-like silliness happening back on the Millennium Falcon while Rey is off on this adventure. Poe Dameron is tasked with planning the Life Day party, which includes roast porg (sorry!), gift-giving between friends, and even some music (though it&#8217;s nothing nearly as painful or long-winded as the many musical and dance sequences in the original <em>Star Wars</em> holiday special). After all, there has to be something Rey realizes she&#8217;s missing out on when she learns her ultimate lesson about friendship.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a lot of childish silliness to be found in the <em>LEGO Star Wars Holiday Special</em>, but there are also some solid jokes for longtime fans of the franchise. Plus, there are shots that are lifted directly from the movies and recreated with LEGO ships, environments, and minifigures. In particular, a recreation of a squadron of X-wings making their way towards the Death Star and the dive into the trench is most impressive. However, I will say that sometimes it feels like the animation cuts corners by not using enough real LEGO pieces to create the environments, unlike <em>The LEGO Movie</em>, where absolutely everything was assembled with real (digital) LEGO pieces. But even so, there are still some amusing LEGO-inspired gags, such as Rey taking off her entire hairpiece to dump water out of it. Even the new <em>Star Wars</em> production logo that debuted with <em>The Mandalorian</em> is given a LEGO makeover.</p>\n<p>The <em>LEGO Star Wars Holiday Special</em> is a huge step above the original travesty that graced television screens in 1978. Not only is it half the length of the original holiday special, but it&#8217;s infinitely more enjoyable. In fact, it&#8217;s kind of a shame that this will only be available on Disney+, because this is the kind of special that you&#8217;d love to stumble upon several times while flipping through the cable guide during the holiday season. At the very least, it&#8217;s available to watch over and over again if you have Disney+, and it&#8217;s something the kids will enjoy the hell out of while they wait for Life Day to arrive.</p>\n<p><strong>/Film Rating: 7 out of 10</strong></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/lego-star-wars-holiday-special-review-a-delightfully-goofy-time-travel-trip-in-a-galaxy-far-far-away/\">&#8216;LEGO Star Wars Holiday Special&#8217; Review: A Delightfully Goofy Time Travel Trip in a Galaxy Far, Far Away</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=kEt2yHFpEFQ:5j7CsP7I9Pg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=kEt2yHFpEFQ:5j7CsP7I9Pg:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=kEt2yHFpEFQ:5j7CsP7I9Pg:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=kEt2yHFpEFQ:5j7CsP7I9Pg:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=kEt2yHFpEFQ:5j7CsP7I9Pg:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=kEt2yHFpEFQ:5j7CsP7I9Pg:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/kEt2yHFpEFQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 16:00:33 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/legostarwarsholidayspecial-rey-darthvader-falling-lightsabers-700x309.jpg","linkMd5":"34f0d481b27cdd307f20bac6fbef998c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn13@2020_3/2020/11/16/16-45-46-162_d528a9229c5f438e.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":309,"sourceBytes":25614,"destBytes":16562,"author":"Ethan Anderton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/legostarwarsholidayspecial-rey-darthvader-falling-lightsabers-700x309.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn13@2020_3/2020/11/16/16-45-46-162_d528a9229c5f438e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn80@2020_3/2020/11/16/16-45-55-195_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=kEt2yHFpEFQ:5j7CsP7I9Pg:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn95@2020_1/2020/11/16/16-46-02-271_4271241f3e823cdf.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn16@2020_3/2020/11/16/16-46-12-382_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=kEt2yHFpEFQ:5j7CsP7I9Pg:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn36@2020_1/2020/11/16/16-45-50-658_54d9aa9c8a1fba4f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/kEt2yHFpEFQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn63@2020_6/2020/11/16/16-45-56-392_e74bd7da3d2cf87a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605545127661},{"createdTime":"2020-11-17 00:45:27","updatedTime":"2020-11-17 00:45:27","title":"‘The Stand’ Trailer: Whoopi Goldberg and Alexander Skarsgård Face Off in the Miniseries Adaptation of Stephen King’s Classic Novel","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=645911","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-645912\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-stand-2-700x272.jpg\" alt=\"the stand trailer\" width=\"700\" height=\"272\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-stand-2-700x272.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-stand-2-360x140.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-stand-2-768x299.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-stand-2.jpg 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>It might seem a weird time for CBS All Access to release its TV miniseries adaptation of <strong>Stephen King</strong>&#8216;s pandemic apocalypse thriller <strong><em>The Stand</em></strong>, but perhaps it will be a form of escape to see a pandemic-stricken Earth become a battleground between good and evil. King&#8217;s epic novel is getting a 10-episode miniseries adaptation featuring a star-studded cast that includes <strong>James Marsden</strong>, <strong>Amber Heard</strong>, <strong>Greg Kinnear</strong>, <strong>Odessa Young</strong>, <strong>Whoopi Goldberg</strong><strong>.</strong> Watch <em>The Stand</em> trailer below.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-645911\"></span></p>\n<h2>The Stand Trailer</h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0WhEUiHsl14?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Whoopi Goldberg stars as Abigail Freemantle, a spiritual leader who draws the good survivors of the plague to her rural farmhouse, called the Boulder Free Zone. Alexander Skarsgård strikes a chilling figure as the supernatural baddie Randall Flagg, who draws the bad plague survivors to him in Las Vegas, now dubbed New Vegas. The two communities prepare for some kind of all-out war in the new <em>The Stand</em> trailer, which is much more action-packed than the <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-stand-trailer/\">ominous first trailer</a>, which focused on the post-apocalyptic setting of the series, with many shots of people wandering abandoned streets. This time, the residents of the Boulder Free Zone are gearing up to go against &#8220;the Dark Man,&#8221; as Abigail dubs him, Skarsgård&#8217;s embodiment of pure evil who has appeared in at least nine of King&#8217;s novels as a supernatural antagonist to many of his characters. Skarsgård is well-cast, appearing like some kind of hedonistic prophet, in stark contrast to Goldberg&#8217;s kindly old leader.</p>\n<p>Other characters in <em>The Stand</em> include<strong> James Marsden</strong> as Stu Redman, the closest thing the story has to an everyman hero; <strong>Odessa Young</strong> as Frannie Goldsmith, who discovers she’s pregnant right before the plague breaks out;<strong> Owen Teague</strong> as Harold Lauder, an insecure guy who has a crush on Frannie; <strong>Nat Wolff</strong> as Lloyd Henreid, a convict who becomes Flagg’s right-hand-man; <strong>Jovan Adepo</strong> as Larry Underwood, a musician who has a hit song just as the virus starts killing people; and <strong>Heather Graham</strong> as Rita Blakemoor, a lonely woman Larry travels with along the way.</p>\n<p><strong>Josh Boone</strong>, who has been attached to a new <em>Stand</em> adaptation for a few years now, directs the first episode, while <strong>Benjamin Cavell</strong> and <strong>Taylor Elmore</strong> serve as showrunners.</p>\n<p>Here is the synopsis for <em>The Stand</em>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Based on the best-selling novel by Stephen King, CBS All Access’s The Stand stars Whoopi Goldberg, Alexander Skarsgård, James Marsden, Odessa Young, Jovan Adepo, and many more.

But usually it doesn&#8217;t take much to figure it: there are apps that can help identify melodies, and most of the time a search for the lyric will find the answer. But in this episode, filmmaker <strong>Tyler Gillet</strong> (one of the directors of the horror film <em>Ready or Not</em>) has an incredibly detailed memory of hearing a specific song, but when he went to search for it, he found&#8230;nothing. All evidence of it had been scrubbed from Google. What happened? Did the song even exist in the first place, or was Tyler&#8217;s memory playing tricks on him? This is the story of what happens when the lack of Google results turns into an obsession and a quest for the truth.</p>\n<p><strong>Why It&#8217;s Essential Listening</strong>: Reply All&#8217;s tagline is &#8220;a show about the Internet,&#8221; which gives it license to cover a wide swath of different material. But episode 158 is a pure, self-contained mystery story which launched the show to new heights of popularity, and for good reason: it&#8217;s a totally riveting episode that had me on the edge of my seat.<span id=\"more-645829\"></span></p>\n<p>I am not a regular listener of this show, but I downloaded this episode back in March when it was originally released because I saw several people praising it on Twitter. It&#8217;s been collecting dust in my podcast player ever since, waiting for me to finally see what all the fuss was about. The timing couldn&#8217;t have been better because I recently finished listening to the phenomenal <em>Wind of Change</em> podcast, and this really filled that gap for me in a way I didn&#8217;t know I needed.</p>\n<p>I will not spoil what happens in the episode, because the joy is in experiencing how the story unfolds and tracing how your feelings might vacillate between multiple possibilities as the mystery deepens. But <em>The Case of the Missing Hit</em> gets my highest recommendation: it&#8217;s a practically perfect piece of storytelling that&#8217;s relatable, funny, immersive, and gripping.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-quarantine-stream-the-case-of-the-missing-hit-is-a-riveting-episode-of-reply-all/\">The Quarantine Stream: &#8220;The Case of the Missing Hit&#8221; is a Riveting Episode of &#8216;Reply All&#8217;</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=sgBtvPWVSrY:pcdJ1Kxfkxw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=sgBtvPWVSrY:pcdJ1Kxfkxw:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=sgBtvPWVSrY:pcdJ1Kxfkxw:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=sgBtvPWVSrY:pcdJ1Kxfkxw:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=sgBtvPWVSrY:pcdJ1Kxfkxw:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=sgBtvPWVSrY:pcdJ1Kxfkxw:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/sgBtvPWVSrY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 15:00:33 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Reply-All-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"c89c1ffb5398e4b0c1eb2006f735a811","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn12@2020_2/2020/11/16/16-45-30-138_e861ad7dfee270d1.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":42860,"destBytes":26770,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Reply-All-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn12@2020_2/2020/11/16/16-45-30-138_e861ad7dfee270d1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn80@2020_3/2020/11/16/16-45-55-195_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=sgBtvPWVSrY:pcdJ1Kxfkxw:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn99@2020_2/2020/11/16/16-45-50-658_04c1a7ad7b464301.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn16@2020_3/2020/11/16/16-46-12-382_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=sgBtvPWVSrY:pcdJ1Kxfkxw:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn30@2020_5/2020/11/16/16-46-02-285_f7fb976d90785016.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/sgBtvPWVSrY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn6@2020_1/2020/11/16/16-45-59-491_1e5d5bc1921c9cdd.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605545127661},{"createdTime":"2020-11-17 00:45:27","updatedTime":"2020-11-17 00:45:27","title":"VOTD: Watch Taika Waititi’s Epic, Tearjerking Coca-Cola Commercial for Christmas","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=645906","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-645909 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/cocacola-taikawaititi-commercial-letter-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Taika Waititi's Coca-Cola Christmas Commercial\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/cocacola-taikawaititi-commercial-letter.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/cocacola-taikawaititi-commercial-letter-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Director <strong>Taika Waititi</strong> has brought us twisted mockumentary laughs in <em>What We Do in the Shadows</em>, delightful coming-of-age adventure in <em>Hunt for the Wilderpeople</em>, hilarious comic book spectacle with <em>Thor: Ragnarok</em>, and sharp satire in <em>Jojo Rabbit</em>.

But he&#8217;s not going to let that ruin his daughter&#8217;s Christmas. He swims, climbs, hitchhikes, and crosses glaciers, lakes, mountains, fields, deserts, and more, all so he can get this letter to the North Pole. We&#8217;ll let you watch above instead of spoiling the ending, but you should get those tissues ready.</p>\n<p>Honestly, we&#8217;re not sure why this guy couldn&#8217;t have just dropped the letter off in a mail box in one of the many places he passed through on the way to the North Pole, but maybe time was limited. Plus, that would have totally ruined the ending anyway. For their part, Kris Robbens, marketing director at Coca-Cola Great Britain said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;This year, the Christmas season is set to be more meaningful than ever before. As a company, Coca-Cola has been celebrating the festive season through our advertising since the 1920s, featuring uplifting messages of unity and joy. Our new advert reflects the real magic of Christmas—our greater appreciation for loved ones, a sense of community and our need to be present with each other this Christmas, above all else.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>We hope you can enjoy Christmas safely this year, whether it&#8217;s actually with loved ones or through a screen.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/taika-waititis-coca-cola-christmas-commercial/\">VOTD: Watch Taika Waititi&#8217;s Epic, Tearjerking Coca-Cola Commercial for Christmas</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=CLZB1Sxtiko:cKHxbwCxoaA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=CLZB1Sxtiko:cKHxbwCxoaA:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=CLZB1Sxtiko:cKHxbwCxoaA:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=CLZB1Sxtiko:cKHxbwCxoaA:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=CLZB1Sxtiko:cKHxbwCxoaA:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=CLZB1Sxtiko:cKHxbwCxoaA:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/CLZB1Sxtiko\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 14:00:52 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/cocacola-taikawaititi-commercial-letter-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"44daae4ce59cabf0ef53cc29af5f0846","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn4@2020_1/2020/11/16/16-45-44-121_eb62ed05e5f936c3.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":39764,"destBytes":28840,"author":"Ethan Anderton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/cocacola-taikawaititi-commercial-letter-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn4@2020_1/2020/11/16/16-45-44-121_eb62ed05e5f936c3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn80@2020_3/2020/11/16/16-45-55-195_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=CLZB1Sxtiko:cKHxbwCxoaA:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn4@2020_3/2020/11/16/16-46-00-272_ed0350849ac2c637.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn16@2020_3/2020/11/16/16-46-12-382_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=CLZB1Sxtiko:cKHxbwCxoaA:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn92@2020_2/2020/11/16/16-46-24-097_46a5a52b3c79449a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/CLZB1Sxtiko":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn67@2020_1/2020/11/16/16-45-50-138_54d5c6d37d59089e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605545127661},{"createdTime":"2020-11-17 00:45:27","updatedTime":"2020-11-17 00:45:27","title":"New ‘The Mandalorian’ Posters Featuring Mando, Baby Yoda, and More Go on Sale Today","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=645926","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-posters-mando-mondays.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-645935\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-posters-mando-mondays-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"mandalorian posters mando mondays\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-posters-mando-mondays-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-posters-mando-mondays-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-posters-mando-mondays-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mandalorian-posters-mando-mondays.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Kids these days can&#8217;t get enough of <strong><em>The Mandalorian</em> </strong>and his sidekick, the <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/lucasfilm-responds-to-backlash-over-baby-yoda-eating-eggs-in-the-mandalorian/\">egg-loving</a> Baby Yoda (real name: Fred, er, I mean, The Child).
