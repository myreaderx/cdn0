This article was originally published in September 2015.</em></p>\n<p>It’s been fodder for many a heated debate among men for centuries.</p>\n<p>What skills should every man know?</p>\n<p>A vast amount of ink and e-ink has been spilled on the subject. But why?</p>\n<p>Part of being a man is being competent and effective in the world. To do that, you’ve got to have skills. A man wants to know (or at least feel like he knows) that no matter what situation he’s placed in, he’ll be able to handle himself — to act rather than be acted upon. Hence our incessant drive to figure out what skills we’ll need to know in order to demonstrate confidence and capability in our manly roles as <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/the-3-ps-of-manhood-procreate/\">procreators</a>, <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/the-3-ps-of-manhood-protect/\">protectors</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/the-3-ps-of-manhood-provide/\">providers</a>.</p>\n<p>For primitive man, this needed skill-set was clear and relatively narrow, largely revolving around the jobs of fighting and hunting.</p>\n<p>The breadth of skills needed today, however, is much wider. The modern man must be both a warrior and a diplomat, a woodsman and a scholar. We need both hard skills and soft skills; skills we use every day and skills we keep in the back pocket, just in case.</p>\n<p>We’ve covered many of these skills over the years on the Art of Manliness, and so figured it was time to add our contribution to the collective cultural enterprise of figuring out which skills a well-rounded, grown man should have. Below you’ll find the AoM list of 100 skills every man should know.</p>\n<h3>1. <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-tie-a-tie/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tie a Necktie</a></h3>\n<p>Even in our casual culture where hoodies are appropriate attire for billionaire CEOs, every man should know how to tie a tie. Funerals, weddings, and job interviews are just a few occasions when a sharp necktie is appropriate, and you’ll be attending plenty of those during your adult life. You don’t want to be the 30-something who needs to ask his mom to tie his tie for him.</p>\n<h3>2. <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-build-a-roaring-campfire/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Build a Campfire</a></h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-50529 size-full\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2015/09/Manly-Skills-2.jpg\" alt=\"Men built a camp fire.\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2015/09/Manly-Skills-2.jpg 550w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2015/09/Manly-Skills-2-320x296.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\"></img></p>\n<p>There’s a primordial link between men and fire. While it’s no longer necessary for our survival, man’s connection to fire still exists. It’s both exhilarating and calming, dangerous and assuring. There’s nothing like sitting around a crackling fire under a starry sky while poking the embers with a stick and meditating on the big questions in life. Just for those reasons alone a man should know how to build a fire. But it’s also vital to know so you can build a fire while camping in order to <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/cooking-around-the-campfire-9-easy-and-delicious-foil-packet-recipes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cook a solid meal for yourself and those with you</a>. Using Duraflame logs is a cardinal sin that will automatically send you to outer darkness, where there is wailing and gnashing of teeth.</p>\n<h3>3. <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-hang-a-picture/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hang a Picture</a></h3>\n<p>Being asked to hang a picture on the wall may be perhaps the world’s most common “honey-do.” While not necessarily an exact science, knowing some basics about wall hangings, and where to place prints on the wall, will ensure that your home has charm that will knock the socks off visiting dates and parents, and greatly please your main squeeze.</p>\n<h3>4. <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/the-ultimate-guide-to-shining-your-shoes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Shine Your Shoes</a></h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-50565 size-full\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads//2015/09/Manly-Skills-39.jpg\" alt=\"Man is shining his shoes.\" width=\"486\" height=\"550\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2015/09/Manly-Skills-39.jpg 486w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2015/09/Manly-Skills-39-320x362.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px\"></img></p>\n<p>A pair of shoes with a mirror shine can add the finishing touch to a sharp get-up. And besides keeping your shoes in tip-top shape, the act of shoe shining is a satisfying, manly ritual that calms the mind. The repetitive strokes of the shine brush coupled with the warm smell of shoe shine polish is enough to put you into a meditative state. To go the extra mile, <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-make-a-shoe-shine-box/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">build your own shoe shine box</a>.</p>\n<h3>5. <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/complete-guide-to-snakes-part-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Treat a Snakebite</a></h3>\n<p>Since the very dawn of man, snakes have been one of our greatest enemies. They slither and sneak and hiss, and just are no good for anyone. Should you encounter a poisonous variety of snake (<a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/complete-guide-to-snakes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">learn how to identify them here!</a>), it’s in your best interest to know how to treat being bitten. Hint: most of the old wives’ tales are just that, so don’t go trying to suck the poison out.</p>\n<h3>6. <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-read-a-book/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Read a Book</a></h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-50561 size-full\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2015/09/Manly-Skills-35.jpg\" alt=\"Man is reading a book.\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2015/09/Manly-Skills-35.jpg 550w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2015/09/Manly-Skills-35-320x278.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\"></img></p>\n<p>1) Open book. 2) Read words. 3) Close book. 4) Move on to next book. Reading a book seems like a pretty straightforward task, doesn’t it? And in some cases, it is. If you’re reading purely for entertainment or leisure, it certainly can be that easy. There’s another kind of reading, though, in which we at least attempt to glean something of value from the book in our hands (whether in paper or tablet form). In such cases, there are certain techniques you must master to be able to dive deeper into the text and suck out all the marrow.</p>\n<h3>7. <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-survive-a-bear-attack-visual-guide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Survive a Bear Attack</a></h3>\n<p>While bear attacks are rare, a man should always be prepared. Whether you’re camping for a weekend, or simply out for a morning hike, you never know when you’ll need this information. Believe it or not, just weeks after I compiled the research for our <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-survive-a-bear-attack-visual-guide/\">AoM guide on the topic</a>, I encountered not one, but two black bears on a popular trail in Rocky Mountain National Park. It does happen. I was surprisingly calm with this useful knowledge at hand, and I felt confident I could have taken down those black bears should necessity have called. Alas, it didn’t, and I mourned the loss of the new rug I was looking forward to for my living room.</p>\n<h3>8. <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-shave-like-your-grandpa/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wet Shave</a></h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-50575 size-full\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2015/09/Manly-Skills-49.jpg\" alt=\"Man is shaving.\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2015/09/Manly-Skills-49.jpg 550w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2015/09/Manly-Skills-49-320x320.jpg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2015/09/Manly-Skills-49-45x45.jpg 45w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\"></img></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/art-of-manliness-sacrilege-my-year-long-experiment-with-using-an-electric-razor/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Electric shaving is fast and easy</a> and the multi-bladed razors can give you a pretty close shave. But nothing beats the manly ritual of shaving with a <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-shave-like-your-grandpa/\">safety razor</a> or <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-straight-razor-shave/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">straight razor</a>. Traditional wet shaving adds an element of skill back into what has become a mindless grooming activity. It makes you mindful and present. Plus, old school wet shaving is much cheaper than using the fancy multi-blade cartridges. A blade will only set you back about 25 cents. Feel manly <em>and</em> save money? It’s a win-win proposition.</p>\n<h3>9. <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-parallel-park-like-a-man/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Parallel Park</a></h3>\n<p>In the suburbs you enjoy endless drive-in parking in the giant lots in front of big box stores. Make a trip downtown and it’s a different story. Yeah, there are parking garages, but most of the parking is on the street next to the curb (not to mention it’s also the cheapest), meaning you need to know how to parallel park. You don’t want to be the guy who holds up traffic because he’s constantly backing up and moving forward after multiple failed attempts.</p>\n<h3>10. <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-paddle-a-canoe-the-j-stroke/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Paddle a Canoe</a></h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-50557 size-full\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2015/09/Manly-Skills-31.jpg\" alt=\"A guy is paddling a boat.\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2015/09/Manly-Skills-31.jpg 550w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2015/09/Manly-Skills-31-320x320.jpg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2015/09/Manly-Skills-31-45x45.jpg 45w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\"></img></p>\n<p>Paddling lazily across the water is one of man’s great joys. Whether with your gal on a date, or just enjoying nature on a solo outing, there are few better recreational activities. While paddling might seem as natural as riding a bike, it takes a certain level of skill to deftly captain a canoe. Don’t be that guy/couple who can’t make headway because they paddle inefficiently or even tip over and end up in the water.</p>\n<h3>11. <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-haggle-like-your-old-man/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Negotiate/Haggle</a></h3>\n<p>Depending on where you are in the world, negotiation is either a part of everyday life or an uncomfortable practice that’s consciously avoided whenever possible. But here’s a truth that many of us, especially those of us living in the Western world, don’t always consider: whether or not you realize it, many of your commercial transactions can be negotiated. From hotel rooms, to rental cars, to complex business deals, knowing how to haggle can save you (or your business) a boatload of money. It’s awkward, sure, but with practice, you’ll get more confident and capable in the deft art of negotiating.</p>\n<h3>12. Fix a Leaky Faucet</h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-50545 size-full\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2015/09/Manly-Skills-19.jpg\" alt=\"A man is fixing a leaky faucet.\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2015/09/Manly-Skills-19.jpg 550w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2015/09/Manly-Skills-19-320x320.jpg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2015/09/Manly-Skills-19-45x45.jpg 45w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\"></img></p>\n<p><em>Drip. Drip. Drip.</em> It can drive a man crazy in the middle of the night when he’s trying to sleep. It can also cost you money in the long run, in both water and handyman bills. While plumbing is not always a DIY project, fixing a leaky faucet is generally a pretty simple task. With a couple tools, a trip to your local hardware store, and this guide from This Old House, you’ll restore your sanity in no time.</p>\n<h3>13. <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/treat-minor-burn/\">Treat a Burn</a></h3>\n<p>Burns can happen just about any time and any place. Spilled coffee, mischievous campfire, over-heated car engine — our world is rife with potential for harm through heat. Should you find yourself with a first or even second-degree burn, you can almost always treat it yourself. A couple tips: You want to slowly cool the affected area with cool, not icy, water. Make sure to clean the burn and apply an antibiotic ointment, and don’t pop the blisters, as that increases the infection risk.</p>\n<h3>14. Tell a Joke</h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-50570 size-full\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2015/09/Manly-Skills-44.jpg\" alt=\"A man is telling a joke to his friends.\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2015/09/Manly-Skills-44.jpg 550w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2015/09/Manly-Skills-44-320x320.jpg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2015/09/Manly-Skills-44-45x45.jpg 45w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\"></img></p>\n<p>In the age of dank memes and viral videos, the art of the well-told joke is a dying skill. Knowing how to make people laugh without resorting to showing a guy kicked in the nuts on your smartphone will set you apart from the pack. Plus, when you’re out in the middle of the woods and cell phone reception is non-existent, knowing how to tell a well-timed joke will be some of the only entertainment you have.</p>\n<h3>15. <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/fair-or-foul-how-to-use-a-barometer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Predict the Weather</a></h3>\n<p>If you regularly watch your local news for the weather forecast, or check your smartphone for it, you know how often they are flat out wrong. While forecasting has come a long ways, some of the most accurate tools are the oldest. <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/fair-or-foul-how-to-use-a-barometer/\">Barometers</a>, for instance, can tell you what the weather will be like in the next 24-48 hours as well as any professional forecast. Beyond scientific instruments, even old proverbs — like <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/forecast-the-weather-like-daniel-boone/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“Red sky at night, sailors delight; red skies in morning, sailors take warning”</a> — have many kernels of truth contained within. Soon enough your own predictions will be beating that of your local weatherman.</p>\n<h3>16. <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-deadlift/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Do a Deadlift Properly</a></h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-50537 size-full\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2015/09/Manly-Skills-10.jpg\" alt=\"Do a deadlift properly.\" width=\"486\" height=\"550\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2015/09/Manly-Skills-10.jpg 486w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2015/09/Manly-Skills-10-320x362.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px\"></img></p>\n<p>The deadlift trains the muscles that allow you to perform one of the most basic of human movements — lifting stuff off the ground. Besides the squat, no other exercise provides as much practicality as the deadlift. And it just feels plain awesome to hoist 400+ lbs off the ground with a barbell.</p>\n<h3>17. <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/20-best-poems/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Recite a Poem From Memory</a></h3>\n<p>There’s something about reciting a poem from memory that’s different from just reading it over and over again. The words become a part of you. They may not be your original words, but when you say them from memory, it feels like they’re coming from the heart. Reciting a poem from memory can provide you and others inspiration and consolation in trying times. Plus, knowing how to effortlessly sprinkle in a few lines from a poem in a conversation can make you appear a bit like the Most Interesting Man in the World.</p>\n<h3>18. <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/the-art-of-summer-grilling/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Grill With Charcoal</a></h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-50547 size-full\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2015/09/Manly-Skills-21.jpg\" alt=\"A man is grilling with charcoal.\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2015/09/Manly-Skills-21.jpg 550w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2015/09/Manly-Skills-21-320x320.jpg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2015/09/Manly-Skills-21-45x45.jpg 45w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\"></img></p>\n<p>While the propane barbecue grill has only been around since the 1950s, men have been grilling with charcoal for thousands of years. Rather than just pushing a button for your fire, charcoal requires a little more skill and care, and according to most folks, makes for a better-tasting product as well. <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/summer-grilling-week-how-to-light-a-charcoal-grill/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bone up on lighting a charcoal grill</a>.</p>\n<h3>19. <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/heart-attack-symptoms-what-to-do-cpr-aed/\">Perform CPR</a></h3>\n<p>Some emergency situations are so urgent that <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-call-911-no-its-not-as-obvious-as-you-think/\">calling 911</a> and waiting for paramedics will be too late. One of those is in the case of heart attack or other scenario where someone becomes unresponsive and is having trouble breathing. Believe it or not, one-quarter of Americans say they’ve been in such a situation. Don’t be caught unprepared. While you should know <a href=\"http://depts.washington.edu/learncpr/quickcpr.html\">conventional CPR</a>, you should also be aware of the new <a href=\"https://cpr.heart.org/en\">hands-only method</a> which can be used on teenagers and adults.</p>\n<h3>20. <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-throw-a-spiral-football/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Throw a Spiral</a></h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-50573 size-full\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2015/09/Manly-Skills-47.jpg\" alt=\"Throwing a spiral.\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2015/09/Manly-Skills-47.jpg 550w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2015/09/Manly-Skills-47-320x320.jpg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2015/09/Manly-Skills-47-45x45.jpg 45w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\"></img></p>\n<p>Whether you’re playing catch with your kiddos on a Saturday or playing all-time QB at this year’s Thanksgiving Turkey Bowl, you’ll need to know how to throw a nice, tight football spiral.</p>\n<h3>21. <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/sewing-on-a-button/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sew a Button</a></h3>\n<p>You’re hastily getting ready for work, and as you button up your nice oxford shirt, one pops off. You’ve known it was loose, and that this reckoning would come. What is a man to do? Sew it back on, of course! While sewing may seem like a skill purely in the ladies’ realm, knowing this simple clothing fix can come in mighty handy when you’re in a pinch.</p>\n<h3>22. <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-split-firewood/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Split Firewood</a></h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-50568 size-full\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2015/09/Manly-Skills-42.jpg\" alt=\"Split firewood.\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2015/09/Manly-Skills-42.jpg 550w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2015/09/Manly-Skills-42-320x320.jpg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2015/09/Manly-Skills-42-45x45.jpg 45w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\"></img></p>\n<p>Yes, most of us have central heating to <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-keep-your-house-warm-in-the-winter/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">keep our houses warm during the winter</a>, but there’s nothing like <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-start-a-cozy-fireplace-fire/\">the warm glow of a fireplace fire</a> during the winter months to keep you toasty. But to get the big logs to fit into your fireplace, you’ll need to make them smaller by splitting them. And let’s be honest, splitting wood isn’t so much about lowering your heating bill, but rather about the satisfaction a man gets when his maul goes cleanly through a log and splits it in one stroke. It makes for great exercise, too.</p>\n<h3>23. <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-find-water-in-the-wild/\">Find Potable Water</a></h3>\n<p>When you’re lost in the woods, your most immediate needs are food, shelter, and water — the last of which is the most pressing. One method of finding safe drinking water is to collect rainwater.

If you experience loss of color or feeling at your extremities (frostbite hits your body at its furthest points from your core), you’re possibly experiencing an onset of frostbite.

In the tactical world, it’s often said that the best way to win a fight is to avoid a fight in the first place. To do that, you need to develop your situational awareness.

The date’s structure allows a man to show off his ability to woo a lady.

You could be moving hundreds of cubic feet of the fluffy (or not-so-fluffy) white stuff.

But I’ll be darned if it’s not also one of the most satisfying. Many a great man from history used horseback riding as a way to decompress — Thomas Jefferson, Teddy Roosevelt, Jack London. It simply feels wonderful to mount up and head towards the horizon. Also, if American cinema is correct about the apocalypse, horses will once again be the primary mode of transportation one day.

Give a Good Massage</h3>\n<p>While the date is the ultimate tool in the gentleman’s romantic arsenal, you need other skills as well to impress your gal (including many on this list!).

That’s because during the wars of the 20th century, when it often took a long time for a wounded solider to get medical attention, the tourniquet would end up cutting off the blood supply for too long, necessitating amputations. But the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan showed that tourniquets, coupled with speedy medical attention, could be absolute life savers, and thus <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/21/science/reviving-a-life-saver.html?_r=0\">their use has been revived in combat and civilian medicine alike</a>.

Since babies can’t do anything for themselves, their cries are designed by nature to get your attention, burrowing into your brain and refusing to let go until you alleviate their distress. Their wails elicit a real physiological response — you start to sweat, your heart rate goes up, and your body releases cortisol (the stress hormone). So it’s no surprise that knowing how to calm a crying baby is one of the most important new-dad tools you can have in your arsenal!</p>\n<h3>96. <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/learning-to-ride-your-first-motorcycle/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ride a Motorcycle</a></h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-50563 size-full\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2015/09/Manly-Skills-37.jpg\" alt=\"Ride a motorcycle.\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2015/09/Manly-Skills-37.jpg 550w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2015/09/Manly-Skills-37-320x320.jpg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2015/09/Manly-Skills-37-45x45.jpg 45w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\"></img></p>\n<p>Motorcycles are one of the pinnacles of manliness. They’re up there with Islay single malt, grass-fed sirloin, and Creed’s Green Irish Tweed aftershave. Why? Because unlike automobiles, they offer a visceral experience: one that requires skill, mental engagement, and risk management. On a motorcycle, you can’t sip coffee, fiddle with your phone, or daydream the minutes away. Your senses are on red alert, and your life depends on two tiny patches of rubber connecting you to the road. Riding a motorcycle is an experience every man should have in his life.</p>\n<h3>97. <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-to-use-a-hammer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hammer a Nail Correctly</a></h3>\n<p>To the unskilled, hammering just means pounding the hell out of something until you get the job done. Sure, you <em>could </em>do that, but you’ll end up with crummy results and a tired arm to boot. A wise handyman knows how to use a hammer safely, effectively, and efficiently.</p>\n<h3>98. <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/category/travel-leisure/food-drink/cooking-food-drink/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cook a Signature Dish</a></h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-50536 size-full\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2015/09/Manly-Skills-9.jpg\" alt=\"Cook a signature dish.\" width=\"540\" height=\"auto\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2015/09/Manly-Skills-9.jpg 550w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2015/09/Manly-Skills-9-320x320.jpg 320w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2015/09/Manly-Skills-9-45x45.jpg 45w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\"></img></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/how-cooking-can-make-you-a-better-man/\">Cooking cultivates a variety of manly qualities, from self-reliance to chivalry</a>. So while you need not become a 5-star chef, at a certain point every man needs to move on from the Easy Mac, ramen, and frozen pizza he subsisted on in college. <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/kitchen-basics/\">Knowing your way around the kitchen</a> can be intimidating at first, but <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/1-pot-1-pan-5-ingredients-5-minimalist-meals/\">even with just a single pot</a> you can make some tasty meals that will impress friends, family, and ladies alike. Once you’ve mastered some basics, you can work on creating a signature dish that you perfect and whip up on special occasions.</p>\n<h3>99. <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/9-ways-to-start-a-fire-without-matches/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Make Fire Without Matches</a></h3>\n<p>It’s easy to start a fire when you have a pack of matches at your disposal. But could you forge a flame if you didn’t have that crutch? Or would you starve and freeze? There are many ways to make fire sans matches, from using a battery or magnifying glass to going totally primal and using only a board and a stick. Learn as many methods as you can, so that if you ever find yourself alone on a desert island, you can declare to your volleyball friend: “I have made fire!”</p>\n<h3>100. <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/3-simple-steps-to-telling-a-great-story-book-giveaway/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tell a Story</a></h3>\n<p><img style=\" display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-50571 size-full\" src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2015/09/Manly-Skills-45.jpg\" alt=\"Tell a story.\" width=\"483\" height=\"550\" srcset=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2015/09/Manly-Skills-45.jpg 483w, https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2015/09/Manly-Skills-45-320x364.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 483px) 100vw, 483px\"></img></p>\n<p>Every man needs to be able to tell a great story. It might be for a presentation you give at work. Or for a paper you need to write. Maybe you’re just hanging out with your buddies swapping stories. Or you’re tucking your kids into bed, and a nighttime tale is demanded. No matter the scenario, it takes a certain amount of skill to tell a story in a way that captivates an audience.</p>\n<p>The most important part of storytelling though, is simply having the experiences that make for good tales. What stories of your life will you have to tell your grandkids? Start making those memories now by learning as many of these skills as you can. The more know-how you gain, the more places you can go, things you can do, and people you can converse with; in short, the more skills you master, the more adventures you can have!</p>\n<div
