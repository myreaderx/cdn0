(Family Photo)</small></div><p>Place survived 18 days on a ventilator and returned home, but his weight complicated his illness and care, and now is influencing his painful, laborious recovery.</p><p>Eight months into the pandemic, obesity has turned out to be one of the clearest predictors of a difficult battle against covid-19, for reasons that may vary from person to person. Some experts say they consider obesity to have contributed to the stunning coronavirus death and morbidity rate in the United States, which has one of the highest obesity rates in the world. And there is some evidence it is particularly harmful for people under 60, who generally fare better than the elderly against the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.</p><p>A constellation of factors can influence a patient’s outcome: Fat can physically compress parts of the lungs, impeding respiration. In the hospital, it can make calculating medication doses, inserting intravenous tubes and moving patients more difficult. It can stimulate parts of the body’s hormonal system, worsening<b> </b>covid-19, a disease that often provokes a powerful inflammatory response itself. And it is associated with a wide range of comorbidities, from heart disease to diabetes, that increase vulnerability to the worst impacts of the infection.</p><p>“It changes how you evaluate all kinds of considerations, from vascular issues to medications,” said Lewis Kaplan, a critical care doctor for Veterans Affairs and the University of Pennsylvania. “We have an [obesity] epidemic in the midst of a pandemic.”</p><p>The pandemic already has killed more than 183,000 Americans and infected more than 6.1 million, according to a tally kept by The Washington Post. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists 5,614 covid-19 deaths where obesity was a contributing factor, but this is probably a sharp undercount, said Robert N. Anderson, chief of the Mortality Statistics Branch at the National Center for Health Statistics. Clinicians and researchers in all parts of the United States have noted the condition’s influence on patients.</p><p>More than 42 percent of U.S. residents are obese, defined as a body mass index of 30 or greater, and more than 9 percent are severely obese, with BMIs of 40 or more. A 5-9 person weighing 203 pounds has a BMI of 30. The same person would weigh 271 pounds if his <a href=\"https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/BMI/bmi-m.htm\">BMI</a> were 40.</p><p>For some groups, conditions are worse: 56 percent of African American women, for example, are obese, according to data from the CDC. It lists a BMI over 30 <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/p0625-update-expands-covid-19.html\">as a risk factor for severe covid-19. </a></p><p>Britain is urging its citizens to lose weight to protect themselves against covid-19. When University of North Carolina researchers reviewed the academic literature on obesity and covid-19 for an analysis released this week, they found that people with BMIs over 30 were at much greater risk for hospitalization, intensive care and death.</p><p>Early analyses point to obesity itself — rather than the comorbidities it creates — as a separate precursor to poor outcomes.</p><p>When researchers at Kaiser Permanente of Southern California looked at <a href=\"https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-3742\">nearly 7,000 people with covid-19, </a>they found an association between a BMI over 40 and higher death rates, particularly among men and people younger than 60, when they controlled for other weight-related conditions. The latter finding is surprising, because deaths from covid-19 are overwhelmingly concentrated among older people.</p><p>Sara Tartof, a Kaiser Permanente research scientist who led the analysis, speculated that large amounts of visceral fat — the fat stored in the abdomen around body organs — may play a role in producing severe covid-19. Fat is not inert; it secretes chemicals that can influence bodily systems. It may affect the angiotensin system that helps regulate blood pressure and blood flow, leading to more severe symptoms, Tartof said.</p><p>“We almost think this is akin to throwing a match on a tinderbox,” she said.</p><p>Jennifer Lighter, an NYU Langone hospital epidemiologist, has been studying a link between covid-19 and fat cells. Lighter said people with obesity seem to have more ACE2 receptors, the gateway the virus uses to invade cells. “So there are more opportunities to attack,” she said.</p><p>Lighter, who published a study showing that people under age 60 are two to three times more likely to be admitted to the hospital for covid-19 if they are obese, also said it is possible a mechanism of the disease is hormonally regulated. That could explain why men are doing worse, she said, and why prepubescent children are faring well in the pandemic.</p><p>“Obese people have more androgens and male hormones. Maybe that’s impacting the virus affecting the cells,” she hypothesized.</p><p>Another study published in the International Journal of Obesity by Candida Rebello, a pharmacology researcher at Louisiana State University, found that the hormone leptin, which regulates metabolism and appetite and is found in greater amounts in obese people, may make them more vulnerable to covid-19. High levels of leptin have been associated with a type of systemic inflammatory state.</p><p>“We propose that leptin may be the link between obesity and its high prevalence as a comorbidity of the SARS-CoV-2 infection,” she wrote.</p><p>In addition to metabolic issues, “obesity in itself is a complex issue, because it usually leads to so many comorbidities” and can affect lung mechanics, said Maria Plataki, an assistant professor at Weill Cornell Medicine who studies the impact of obesity on lung cells. A recent study of 1,687 hospitalized adults by a team that included Plataki found that obese patients were more likely to have respiratory failure but not any more likely to die.</p><p>Place, the Florida patient, had a BMI of 37 when the disease sent him to Westside Regional Medical Center in Plantation two months ago. His temperature had reached 103.9 degrees and pneumonia clogged both his lungs.</p><p>When doctors discovered Place’s uncontrolled diabetes, they put him on an insulin drip. As the oxygen level in his blood plummeted, he was sent to the ICU, where he was sedated and intubated.</p><p>At times, there was not enough staff for the delicate task of turning him onto his stomach — a procedure called “proning” that helps open airways — or returning him to his back, Zymet said. Five people were needed to accomplish the task because of Place’s weight and the medical devices he was attached to. Heavier people also are more likely to develop bed sores.</p><p>“We prone obese people all the time,” said Russell Buhr, a pulmonary and critical care physician at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles. “Instead of needing four people to do it, you might need six or eight people to do it.”</p><p>Intubating very obese people also can be more complex because fat deposits around the neck can make proper positioning more difficult, Buhr said. When patients are sedated and their muscles relax, fat can compress the airway itself, he said.</p><p>Standard doses for drugs — such as pain killers, blood thinners and other critical medications — usually stop at certain weights. That requires caretakers to calculate appropriate amounts for the severely obese, and often there is not a simple linear relationship between weight and dosage.</p><p>Opioids, for example, are stored in fatty tissue, Kaplan said, which can lead to accumulation and complicate doses.</p><p>Place lost 49 pounds during his hospital stay while he was being fed through a tube and on a ventilator, leaving at 199 pounds. But the physical cost was enormous. When he awoke, the only part of his body he could move was his left arm, from the elbow to his fingers.</p><p>“All my muscle was gone,” he said. “My calf muscles were just flopping around. They just hung. My ribs were sticking out.” He could not sit up without becoming dizzy and short of breath. Standing was out of the question.</p><p>Gradually regaining his strength with the aid of physical therapy, Place is able to walk for five minutes at a time now, though parts of his body remain numb and he is still in considerable pain. He and his family haven’t eaten restaurant food since the coronavirus lockdown began in March and he is off insulin.</p><p>Now at 208 pounds, Place wants to keep his weight around 180  once he fully regains his health. He has started <a href=\"https://imalivebrand.com/\">a new business </a>selling T-shirts, hats and masks with the logo “I’m alive.”</p><p>“One silver lining is at least he’s going to take care of his health,” Zymet said. “It puts everything into perspective.”</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Sat, 05 Sep 2020 00:21:23 +0000","feedId":9034,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"cd814b78f7d8b6e4a33e093d5a5ba8ab","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://tabletimages.washingtonpost.com/production/content/0f370980-e22f-11ea-b69b-64f7b0477ed4_published_1599263872630_ba83/image/27b19e2f-451e-4f9e-b927-42c6bb958ccc_p.jpeg?ts=1599263872710":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn44@2020_3/2020/09/05/07-56-24-152_114a4b7523e5c76a.webp","https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SPT7VOXOBAI6VPIIDMIBGK2FR4.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn11@2020_2/2020/09/05/07-56-25-797_67923a5626c3e00b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599292581395},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 15:56:21","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 15:56:21","title":"A Black woman was confronted about ‘Blue Lives Matter’ on a flight.

She said she was happy she remained calm and that other passengers helped her.</p><p>Delta told The Washington Post via email that the branded Black Lives Matter pin was conceptualized by a flight attendant and created as an optional in-flight pin for staff. The D.C.-based Delta team wanted to give one to Poe as part of their gesture.</p><p>“We have a lot of work to do for true equity to be within reach for the Black community, and it’s part of our culture to represent efforts our customers and our employees care about,” a spokesperson for Delta said. “For now, these pins are for our people and not available to customers, but our teams chose to include a pin for this customer as part of their gesture.”</p><p>Poe also says the march went just as planned. “But I will say that I don’t want to have to go to one like that ever again,” she said. “This is something my grandmother marched for when she was young, and I don’t want my future children to have to do this, too.”</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Sat, 05 Sep 2020 00:21:23 +0000","feedId":9034,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"056c44efb06c0d3312fbf6d17bd733a7","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://tabletimages.washingtonpost.com/production/content/056c44efb06c0d3312fbf6d17bd733a7_published_1599245671765_99225/image/16ec761c-5b1f-48f8-ad34-e705fd5e30f3_p.jpeg?ts=1599245671882":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn82@2020_3/2020/09/05/07-56-24-806_2d374c8fbdac7297.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599292581395},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 15:56:21","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 15:56:21","title":"University plans to replace the professor who admitted to falsely claiming Black identity","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/gwu-plans-to-replace-jessica-krug-the-professor-who-admitted-to-falsely-claiming-black-identity/2020/09/04/699fc2be-eedb-11ea-ab4e-581edb849379_story.html","description":"<img src=\"https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/642R6BHO4MI6VPIIDMIBGK2FR4.jpg\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\">Jessica A.

Krug, the associate professor who said she <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2020/09/03/white-gwu-professor-admits-she-falsely-claimed-black-identity/\">lied</a> about being a Black woman, the chair of the department confirmed.</p><p>“We certainly want the classes to continue, and we’re going to see if it’s possible,” said Daniel Schwartz. “We’re looking to see if we can find a replacement.”</p><p>Krug was teaching courses on African and Latin American history in the fall semester, Schwartz said. He said the department is looking to bring in a professor with experience teaching those subjects. A replacement has not been chosen, but Schwartz mentioned the possibility of recruiting someone from the GWU community.</p><p>“There are people who are not full-time faculty at GW, but have taught part time before,” he said.</p><p>Schwartz said Krug is still working for the department. A spokeswoman for the university did not confirm Krug’s employment.</p><p>Krug did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>The university, in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GWtweets/status/1301631568256131073\">tweet</a>, confirmed Krug wrote the <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jessakrug/the-truth-and-the-anti-black-violence-of-my-lies-9a9621401f85\">Medium blog post</a> in which she confessed to lying about her identity.</p><p>The White professor said she had been “audaciously deceptive” about her identity. Krug, who grew up in suburban Kansas City, Kan., has claimed multiple identities throughout her life, including North African, Black American and Black Caribbean. In an essay published on Essence.com about the Puerto Rican uprising against its governor in 2019, she called herself a “boricua.”</p><p>“There is no ignorance, no innocence, nothing to claim, nothing to defend,” Krug wrote in the blog post. “I have moved wrong in every way for years.”</p><p>Krug built her scholarship on African and Latin American history. She has written about subjects including hip-hop, colonialism in Africa and Latin America, the trade in enslaved people, and African American history.</p><p>The professor wrote she should be canceled and believes in “cancel culture as a necessary and righteous tool for those with less structural power to wield against those with more power.”</p><p>Academics of color reacted to Krug’s announcement on social media. Krug, through her scholarship and falsely claimed identity as a Black woman, became part of a network of Black and Hispanic scholars.</p><p>“Nothing says white privilege like trying to orchestrate your own cancellation,” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sofiaquintero/status/1301669002784235520\">tweeted</a> Sofia Quintero, a writer and activist from the Bronx.</p><p>Krug said she had eschewed her experiences growing up in suburban Kansas City. She wrote in the blog post she had been alienated from her family.</p><p>Quinton Lucas, the mayor of Kansas City, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/QuintonLucasKC/status/1301870408711516160\">retweeted</a> a yearbook photo from 1999 that showed Krug and himself as part of a student political organization called StuPac. Lucas and Krug were classmates at Bristow High School in Kansas City, Mo., according to the tweet.</p><p>“One of the stranger person-in-your-yearbook-photo-did-this stories I’ve stumbled upon. Yes, Jessica graduated a few years ahead of me,” Quinton tweeted. “She was interesting back then, but it is really surprising she’s tried to pass as Black for 20 years. Her apology in reflection is warranted.”</p><p><i>Susan Svrluga contributed to this report.</i></p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 04 Sep 2020 21:20:34 +0000","feedId":9034,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"0b889c75486bcc9942e567672090b1bd","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/642R6BHO4MI6VPIIDMIBGK2FR4.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn19@2020_6/2020/09/05/07-56-23-691_6bfd389955184bfb.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599292581395},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 15:56:21","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 15:56:21","title":"GOP candidate poses with rifle, says she’s targeting ‘socialist’ congresswomen","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-gun-squad-photo/2020/09/04/bb1da24c-eebc-11ea-b4bc-3a2098fc73d4_story.html","description":"<img src=\"http://tabletimages.washingtonpost.com/production/content/bb1da24c-eebc-11ea-b4bc-3a2098fc73d4_published_1599242108496_312fe/image/be538829-c864-4e13-866a-767fe189663c_p.jpeg?ts=1599242108601\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\">Construction executive Marjorie Taylor Greene, third from left, with supporters at a watch party event on Aug. 11 in Rome, Ga.

Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.).</p><p>The caption under the gun-toting Greene reads: “Squad’s worst nightmare.”</p><p>“Hate America leftists want to take this country down,” Greene wrote. “Our country is on the line. America needs fighters who speak the truth. We need strong conservative Christians to go on the offense against these socialists who want to rip our country apart. Americans must take our country back. SAVE AMERICA. STOP SOCIALISM. DEFEAT THE DEMOCRATS!”</p><p>Greene, in a separate post, said she was raffling off an AR-15 firearm.</p><p>She did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>House Republican leaders had no immediate comment on the post, an apparent call-to-arms as Trump has spoken out against lawlessness and warned that a Joe Biden presidency would plunge the nation into violence and chaos.</p><p>Omar, however, called on Facebook to remove the post immediately.</p><p>“Posting a photo with an assault rifle next to the faces of three women of color is not advertising. It’s incitement,” Omar wrote on Twitter. “There are already death threats in response to this post. Facebook should remove this violent provocation.”</p><p>Tlaib also weighed in on Twitter, writing: “It’s dangerous in a time of rising political violence openly encouraged by this fascist President that a soon-to-be member of Congress thinks a post threatening women’s lives is acceptable. Take it down. P.S. Imagine it was me w/ a rifle. The post would have been down in seconds.”</p><p>It was unclear whether U.S. Capitol Police, tasked with ensuring the safety of members of Congress, would investigate. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called on Republicans on Twitter to “immediately condemn this dangerous threat of violence against Democratic Congresswomen.”</p><p>Greene has already created problems for Republicans. As an adherent of the QAnon conspiracy, she backs the baseless theory that Trump is battling a cabal of “deep state” saboteurs who worship Satan and traffic children for sex. The FBI has labeled the group a domestic terrorist threat.</p><p>Greene won a Republican primary runoff in Georgia’s 14th Congressional District, last month. Her victory, in a northwestern swath of the state that has favored Republicans by wide margins, sets her up to become QAnon’s first devotee in Congress.</p><p>Greene has been caught on camera calling black voters “slaves” to the Democratic Party and likening the election of Muslim lawmakers to an “Islamic invasion” of the U.S. government.</p><p>The day after the runoff, Trump hailed Greene as a “future Republican Star,” tweeting that she is “strong on everything and never gives up — a real WINNER!” He did not endorse in the runoff.</p><p>Last week, Greene attended Trump’s White House speech in which he accepted the GOP nomination.</p><p>House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) has said he would seat Greene if she is elected to Congress, but the post drastically escalates the challenge for GOP leaders as many rank-and-file members worry about how to respond to her.</p><p>House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) and Conference Chairwoman Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) distanced themselves from Greene after the discovery of videos of her making racist, anti-Semitic and Islamophobic comments.</p><p>A group of Republicans had tried to convince McCarthy to support her primary opponent to ensure she was not seated, but McCarthy refused and in an apparent peace accord reached out to her before her victory.</p><p>Traditionally, members who engage in unethical behavior are censured. Last year, McCarthy removed Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) from a committee for a string of racist comments.</p><p>In a recent interview, Rep. Tom Reed (R-N.Y.), the centrist leader of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, voiced his own concern about what such rhetoric would mean for the institution. He said he hopes candidates like Greene change their language — if not their views as well — when they are elected to the House</p><p>“I’ve watched these candidates who have sort of embraced that hard-right rhetoric and I would encourage them to look at the rhetoric. You are a member of the House and those extreme positions are very troublesome positions,” he said. “If you believe in those positions, there’s no place in the Republican Party, that I believe in, for those.”</p><p>Greene’s posts, however, suggests she currently has no intention of muting herself.</p><p>Former Rep. Charles W. Boustany Jr. (R-La.) said he has been “deeply concerned” by the actions of some of the incoming GOP candidates — and that some of his former colleagues appear to be “cowed into silence” instead of pushing back on the direction of the party. It’s up to House GOP leadership, he said, to set candidates using these type of rhetoric on track — otherwise, “the party is headed for a really bad place and permanent minority status,” he said.</p><p>“I’m deeply concerned at the extent to which the president has fomented these kinds of divisions within our party and has fomented some of the more violent extremist type of activity out there, and I think that’s wrong,” Boustany said. “So, in my view, I hope these trends reverse, but I don’t see them reversing without very principled and strong leadership emerging from those who have the responsibility to step forward and say enough is enough.” </p><p>Several lawmakers of color say they are starting to fear for their safety amid an apparent call to arms by some on the right. Earlier this week, Facebook removed two posts by Rep. Clay Higgins (R-La.) in which the ex-police officer wrote of protesters, “One way ticket fellas. Have your affairs in order. Me? … I wouldn’t even spill my beer. I’d drop any 10 of you where you stand.”</p><p>“I don’t mind when people have political or ideological differences with me and my other colleagues who are black and brown … but when people begin to question my humanity based on my race, it becomes increasingly difficult to work with them,” said Rep. Emanuel Cleaver II (D-Mo.) in an interview before Greene’s post.</p><p>The move to incite militias, he added, is even more worrisome: “If this is tolerated we’re going to go downhill.”</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 04 Sep 2020 19:20:23 +0000","feedId":9034,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"38f305534bcdc17f49b251672776eb73","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://tabletimages.washingtonpost.com/production/content/bb1da24c-eebc-11ea-b4bc-3a2098fc73d4_published_1599242108496_312fe/image/be538829-c864-4e13-866a-767fe189663c_p.jpeg?ts=1599242108601":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn7@2020_2/2020/09/05/07-56-22-066_7f8339a666b5995c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599292581395},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 15:56:21","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 15:56:21","title":"Date Lab: When politics came up, the conversation ‘pivoted’","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/date-labwhen-politics-came-up-the-conversation-pivoted/2020/08/28/a1944cb2-d824-11ea-aff6-220dd3a14741_story.html","description":"<img src=\"http://tabletimages.washingtonpost.com/production/content/a1944cb2-d824-11ea-aff6-220dd3a14741_published_1599273680502_586a0/image/ee871969-e963-47d0-a592-c2a7db85e056_p.jpeg?ts=1599273680692\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\"></small></div><div><i>By Prachi Gupta</i><br><i>2020.09.03 18:00</i></div><p>Sam Ricciardi had been in his D.C. apartment only for a week when Date Lab set him up on his first-ever blind date — in the midst of a pandemic. His living room was completely bare, so, he said, to avoid looking like \"some psycho\" a la Robert De Niro in \"Taxi Driver,\" he diligently repositioned the furniture in his bedroom to make it appear less sparse. Even through the pandemic, Sam admits that he has been \"aggressively\" using dating apps like Hinge, though without much luck. \"It's hard to find that much compatibility, frankly,\" he said.</p><p>After three years working abroad, Sam, 25, will be starting graduate school this month and is looking for “something serious.” However, Date Lab did not seem very promising, either: “I was terrified about this happening,” he said. “My name and picture are going to be searchable, and people are going to know about this.” He called his friends and mom for advice on how to approach his very public first date. Their advice: Just be yourself. So he dressed “nicely, but not too nice,” settling on a white shirt and jeans and lots of hair gel — “I’m from New Jersey,” he explained — with a list of questions open on his laptop in case things turned awkward. He also enjoyed some “rock and rye liquor,” whiskey that he and his dad distill in a cask with rock candy and grapefruit. “It’s a bit of a family tradition,” he said.</p><p>Sitting at his repositioned desk with spicy cauliflower and spicy tofu from local Asian restaurant Maketto, Sam signed on a few minutes early — surprised to see that his date, Elli Sloan, 24, had just signed on, too. “From that moment on, it was clear we were both type-A people,” he noted.</p><p>Like Sam, Elli, a digital strategist for a PR firm, is looking for a relationship. And like Sam, her expectations were not very high. “I was working up till the last second,” she said, and was still wearing her work-from-home attire of biker shorts. She put on earrings and mascara and set up her laptop alongside daal, gobhi and zardak — cuisine from Lapis, an Afghan restaurant in Adams Morgan that she had tried once on a previous date. “I had only told one friend” about the Date Lab date, she said.</p><p>The two made small talk, then “it pivoted when we got to talking more about politics,” Sam said. “It turns out we see eye to eye on those matters.” In fact, they had a lot in common: Both went to college in D.C., listen to liberal podcasts like “Pod Save America” and “Lovett or Leave It,” have spent time living in the Middle East, enjoy outdoor activities like biking and hiking, and are passionate about the environment. Plus, she’s vegan and he’s a recent vegetarian. Their differences were minor: “She doesn’t like nuclear energy; I do like nuclear energy,” he said. “That’s how wonky the discussion ended up getting.” They got so caught up in talking, in fact, that neither ate much of their food.</p><p>Meeting through a computer screen did not curb their physical chemistry. Sam immediately noticed Elli’s olive complexion. He added: “She’s beautiful.” Elli, who Sam described as “extroverted,” was not shy about stating her height preferences. “I was like, don’t worry, I’m 5-foot-11,” he said. “And no one would lie about being 5-foot-11, so you can believe me.”</p><p>Sam says his ideal partner would share 80 percent of his political views (100 percent “would be boring,” he says), and over the nearly three-hour conversation, they discovered where their 20 percent gap in politics lay: former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg. When Elli asked him who his preferred candidate was during the 2020 Democratic primaries, she said, “Please don’t say Pete.” (He said Pete.) Sam, on the other hand, says that Elli thought Buttigieg “was a Republican.” Ultimately, it was a difference that both of them could stomach.</p><p>There were no awkward lulls in conversation, and Sam did not consult his tab of questions even once. “I may have committed a big red flag at the end, though,” Sam admitted. The date had lasted longer than the 90 minutes he’d anticipated. As they approached the third hour, his mother, who was expecting to hear from him, texted: “Are you okay?” When Sam relayed this to Elli, she tilted her head sideways, surprised. “Did you tell your mom about this?” she asked.</p><p>“It was embarrassing,” Sam said. It turns out, however, that Elli found the incident “sweet” and “quite funny.”</p><p>Using his mom’s text as his cue to sign off, Sam asked for Elli’s number. As soon as he got it, the call ended — saving him from further awkwardness. That night, he texted her to ask for a second date. “I don’t want to get my hopes up too much,” he said, “but it was a really nice time.”</p><p>Rate the date</p><p><b>Sam:</b> 5 [out of 5].</p><p><b>Elli:</b> 4.5.</p><p>Update</p><p>The two met up for another Zoom call just a few days later and are planning a third date — this time, in person.</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Sat, 05 Sep 2020 03:20:26 +0000","feedId":9034,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"3ea78f318cb4705aa1e7d6705c4c96cf","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://tabletimages.washingtonpost.com/production/content/a1944cb2-d824-11ea-aff6-220dd3a14741_published_1599273680502_586a0/image/ee871969-e963-47d0-a592-c2a7db85e056_p.jpeg?ts=1599273680692":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn68@2020_5/2020/09/05/07-56-22-068_bbf60d9debb098a3.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599292581394},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 15:56:21","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 15:56:21","title":"Dads less likely than moms to be laid off during the pandemic, study shows","link":"https://www.thelily.com/dads-are-less-likely-than-moms-and-people-without-kids-to-be-laid-off-during-the-pandemic-new-research-shows/","description":"<img src=\"http://tabletimages.washingtonpost.com/production/content/6485fc36ecf73998c35b4131ce90048b_published_1599236965675_60927/image/3db782a3-be92-49cd-a60c-291c1058279a_p.jpeg?ts=1599236965780\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\"></small></div><div><i>By Stephanie Murray</i><br><i>2020.09.04 23:24</i></div><p>It’s no secret that the coronavirus has been very hard on parents.</p><p>But a <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0276562420300780#!\">new study</a> conducted by researchers at Tufts University and Duke University shows the exact impact varies by gender and parental status: Fatherhood seems to be shielding some men from the economic fallout.</p><p>Analyzing United States employment data between December and May, researchers found that fathers were much less likely to be laid off during the pandemic than mothers and non-parents, even after controlling for race, age, education and other individual characteristics.</p><img src=\"http://tabletimages.washingtonpost.com/production/content/6485fc36ecf73998c35b4131ce90048b_published_1599236965810_68904/image/33cf8a57-57d4-4e52-b07d-2cde7febfb95_p.jpeg?ts=1599236965875\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\"></small></div><p>These findings add to a growing body of research suggesting that parenthood affects the labor market outcomes of men and women differently. While women experience a <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/25/the-motherhood-penalty-costs-women-16000-a-year-in-lost-wages.html\">motherhood penalty</a> in the form of lower wages and slower advancement, men appear to get a leg up in the labor market after having children.</p><p>Felipe Dias, a professor of sociology at Tufts University and an author of the study, says these new findings are evidence of a fatherhood premium rather than a motherhood penalty, as both male and female non-parents were about as likely to be laid off as mothers.</p><p>In April, the employment-to-population ratio decreased by 7.4 percentage points for fathers, compared to between 9.3 and 9.9 percentage points for mothers and non-parents. These changes were largely driven by layoffs; quit rates actually declined during April and May across all groups. After accounting for race, age, education and other characteristics, researchers estimated that the probability of being laid off increased by 6.1 percent for fathers, compared to 9.9 percent for non-fathers, 10.1 percent for mothers, and 12.5 percent for non-mothers.</p><p>“There’s something going on about how employers are making this decision that is specifically privileging a particular group and not everyone else,” Dias explains.</p><p>Compared to the motherhood penalty, research on fatherhood premiums remains somewhat unsettled and its causes aren’t entirely known. One theory holds that fathers appear to have an advantage over non-fathers simply because men with greater earning potential are more likely to have children. Another suggests that any apparent “bonus” is because fathers are more likely to have a partner that does not work or works part-time, allowing fathers to devote more time and effort to their careers.</p><p>Michelle J. Budig, a professor of sociology at the University of Massachusetts, says both of these explanations fall short. <a href=\"https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.thirdway.org_report_the-2Dfatherhood-2Dbonus-2Dand-2Dthe-2Dmotherhood-2Dpenalty-2Dparenthood-2Dand-2Dthe-2Dgender-2Dgap-2Din-2Dpay-23about-2Dthe-2Dauthor&d=DwMFaQ&c=RAhzPLrCAq19eJdrcQiUVEwFYoMRqGDAXQ_puw5tYjg&r=ftbAkmRHqUd92ogln5y8sdTKoD82vy34Jz6mQBuWEJY&m=csjZgTo9AtcycIRwysM2sMQL6FFmCs14Qaji6OepfBU&s=ElDdI1Wf9zmRwruMxe9thimyZS2mKEuXefIegT-hx3s&e=\">Her research demonstrates</a> that even after taking account of work effort, education, experience, seniority, family structure, spousal employment status and other factors, fatherhood increases men’s earnings by more than 6 percent.</p><p>Budig’s research shows the fatherhood bonus is largest among married, White college graduates in jobs that emphasize cognitive skill over physical strength.</p><p>Dias’s research suggests that a similar phenomenon is playing out during the pandemic, as employers forced to make quick decisions about who to lay off show preferential treatment to fathers.</p><p>There are a couple of different mechanisms by which preferential treatment toward fathers may be occurring. Employers may assume that fathers are the sole or primary breadwinners in their families and therefore need their job more than mothers. This assumption is outdated: Mothers are now the <a href=\"https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/05/29/breadwinner-moms/\">sole or primary breadwinner</a> in over 40 percent of households with children younger than 18.</p><p>Beyond breadwinner stereotypes, Dias says the favorable treatment of fathers may be the result of the organizational policies companies used to determine whom to lay off. Because fathers tend to have fewer career interruptions than mothers and advance to managerial positions faster, policies that favor seniority and tenure disproportionately protect them.</p><p>Contrary to Budig’s research, Dias found that the fatherhood premium during the pandemic was strongest among lower-educated and mid-educated workers, mainly because higher-skilled workers are able to work remotely and less likely to be laid off.</p><p>The findings have both long- and short-term implications, Dias says. The researchers were unable to analyze outcomes by relationship status, but it’s possible employers are assuming mothers have access to a second income that isn’t actually there.

Findley. “Based on the facts of the case as I understand them, can he raise a claim of self-defense? Yeah, it very well could be a triable question, but whether he would prevail or the prosecution would convict him is hard to predict.”</p><p>Attorneys for Rittenhouse said in a statement that they plan to test that proposition, taking the case to trial and making self-defense their primary argument for his acquittal on five felony charges, including two counts of homicide. Rittenhouse, 17, has also been charged with being too young to possess a gun.</p><p>“Kyle did nothing wrong,” the statement read. “He exercised his God-given, Constitutional, common law and statutory law right to self-defense.”</p><img src=\"https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QRMVTNHOLQI6VGNBOE2D2A54FE.jpg\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\">Michael Forest Reinoehl.

That could be a risky proposition, as it could expose him to sharp questions from prosecutors.</p><p>Cotton said the first shooting is less convincing as a self-defense claim, in part because the events that led up to it are somewhat murky and it might be harder to establish he was facing serious danger.</p><p>Rittenhouse traveled from his home in Illinois to Kenosha on Aug. 25 to guard the mechanic shops of an auto dealership that had previously been damaged by a violent protest over the shooting of Jacob Blake by Kenosha police, according to his attorney’s statement.</p><p>After a curfew that night, Rittenhouse was accosted and chased by protesters in the lead-up to the shootings as he guarded one of the shops, his attorneys claim. The criminal complaint against Rittenhouse makes no mention of those incidents.

(Adam Rogan/The Journal Times/AP)</small></div><p>Daily Caller reporter Richard McGinnis told detectives he was interviewing Rittenhouse when the first victim, Joseph Rosenbaum, approached and tried to engage the teen, who was armed with an AR-15-style rifle, according to the criminal complaint.</p><p>The pair are seen on the video approaching a parked car, and a loud bang is heard, before a man shouts an expletive. Rosenbaum approaches Rittenhouse and four more bangs are heard as Rosenbaum collapses, according to the criminal complaint. Rosenbaum was later pronounced dead.</p><p>McGinnis told authorities that Rosenbaum was trying to disarm Rittenhouse when the teen opened fire.</p><p>Cotton said he thought some jurors might conclude that Rittenhouse felt his life was in danger if Rosenbaum wrested control of his weapon, but Marquette University law professor and former prosecutor Gregory J. O’Meara found that idea unconvincing.</p><p>“I don’t think a person of reasonable intelligence and prudence would think someone taking a deadly weapon from a 17-year-old is an attack of imminent death or great bodily harm,” O’Meara said.</p><p>Soon after, another cellphone video shows Rittenhouse running up a road surrounded by people on the pavement and sidewalk. Someone can be heard shouting, “Beat him up!” while someone else yells, “Hey, he shot him!” Rittenhouse trips and falls.</p><p>Video appears to show Anthony Huber, the second victim, hit Rittenhouse with a skateboard as he tries to grab the teen’s rifle. Rittenhouse shoots him and Huber staggers away, falls and later dies, the criminal complaint alleges.</p><p>Rittenhouse sits up and then fires on a third man, Gaige Grosskreutz, who was advancing toward him with what appeared to be a handgun, the criminal complaint alleges. Grosskreutz suffered an arm injury but survived.</p><p>Rittenhouse backed away from the scene, finally bringing the events to a close. He returned to his home in Illinois and later turned himself in. He is awaiting extradition to Wisconsin.</p><p>Cotton and Thomas Grieve, another Wisconsin attorney who regularly handles firearms cases, said the latter shootings should present a much stronger case for self-defense given Rittenhouse was fleeing confrontation and being chased by a man with a deadly weapon.</p><p>“The defense will basically say he was trying to get away, he was trying to de-escalate,” Grieve said. “The prosecution is going to be saying, ‘Look, they had this guy they viewed as a crazy vigilante who might do lord knows what with an AR-15 and they had a duty . . . to save other lives by disarming this individual.’ ”</p><p>Experts said a<b> </b>number of factors could weaken Rittenhouse’s self-defense claim. Under Wisconsin law, someone who engages in unlawful conduct likely to provoke others to attack him or her cannot claim self-defense against such an attack.</p><p>Some legal experts were skeptical of the idea, but Cotton said prosecutors might try to argue Rittenhouse’s conduct was provocative given the volatile situation he inserted himself into that night while allegedly illegally carrying a gun.</p><p>“Unlawfully possessing a gun, showing up from out of state, 17 years old, violating curfew . . . possessing an assault rifle — all of those things are potentially provocative,” Cotton said.</p><p>At the very least, Cotton said, the factors may weigh against a self-defense claim.</p><p>Defense attorneys would have to raise a self-defense claim at trial, and a judge would decide whether to instruct a jury to consider it based on the evidence that has been presented. Prosecutors could argue against it.</p><p>Legal experts said it’s difficult to guess how a jury might rule on a self-defense claim, in part because the case has created such polarizing reactions. Jurors could have radically different views on Rittenhouse’s conduct that mirror the case’s<b> </b>yawning political divide.</p><p>In Portland, Reinoehl appeared to be moving toward the same legal defense, before he was shot and killed. Authorities had issued an arrest warrant for him in connection with the shooting.</p><p>In the interview with “Vice News Tonight,” Reinoehl said he thought his life and that of a friend were on the line during an encounter with Aaron J. Danielson, a supporter of the far-right Patriot Prayer group.</p><p>“I had no choice. I mean, I, I had a choice,” Reinoehl said. “I could have sat there and watched them kill a friend of mine of color. But I wasn’t going to do that.”</p><p>But a person who was with Danielson, 39, offered a conflicting account. The man said he was not aware a gun was being pointed in his direction and felt he and Danielson were targeted because they wore hats associated with Patriot Prayer.</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Sat, 05 Sep 2020 03:20:26 +0000","feedId":9034,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"0d499050a399b6372391ebd7d5aaf0b7","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://tabletimages.washingtonpost.com/production/content/d1981726-ed1f-11ea-b4bc-3a2098fc73d4_published_1599272612081_784ff/image/23252d1c-e352-4f6c-b748-55b094f9afda_p.jpeg?ts=1599272612293":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn80@2020_1/2020/09/05/07-56-22-295_c821884150965223.webp","https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RFLYVOHO44I6VK2OLAPNXBETPE.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn77@2020_5/2020/09/05/07-56-25-217_ec6ec8454142bf84.webp","https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QRMVTNHOLQI6VGNBOE2D2A54FE.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn59@2020_5/2020/09/05/07-56-21-681_3cbe21a4b227fcae.webp","https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QTJHM2HN7YI6VGNBOE2D2A54FE.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn20@2020_5/2020/09/05/07-56-25-526_370dbd626317e0ab.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599292581393},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 15:56:21","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 15:56:21","title":"Experts say Rochester police failed to use tactics designed to help those in crisis as union defends officers involved in death of Black man","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/experts-say-rochester-police-failed-to-use-tactics-designed-to-help-those-in-crisis-as-union-defends-officers-involved-in-death-of-black-man/2020/09/04/6beecd74-eedd-11ea-99a1-71343d03bc29_story.html","description":"<img src=\"https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QSDYCOHNQMI6VPIIDMIBGK2FR4.jpg\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\">A police officer puts a \"spit hood\" over the head of Daniel T. Prude on March 23 in Rochester, N.Y. (Rochester Police/Roth LLP/AP)</small></div><div><i>By Kimberly Kindy and Tim Craig</i><br><i>2020.09.05 07:53</i></div><p>The seven Rochester, N.Y., police officers suspended this week after the release of a video showing a hood being placed on a Black man in the throes of a mental health crisis failed to use decades-old tactics designed to bring unstable people safely into custody, mental health and police training experts said. The head of the city’s police union said Friday the officers were following protocol.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/seven-police-officers-suspended-after-video-shows-hood-placed-on-head-of-black-man-in-police-custody/2020/09/03/3774a954-ee21-11ea-99a1-71343d03bc29_story.html\">Daniel Prude</a>, a 41-year-old Black man from Chicago, died March 30, a week after being detained by Rochester police. The video shows that police handcuffed Prude and covered his head with a “spit hood,” a device  meant to protect police from bodily fluids. The video then shows officers forcing Prude’s head and chest onto the pavement. The incident was not made public until Wednesday, after a Prude family attorney released the video.</p><p>That autopsy report from the Monroe County Medical Examiner’s Office ruled Prude’s death a homicide involving “complications of asphyxia in the setting of physical restraint.”</p><p>Mental health experts, who help train police officers in ways to de-escalate such encounters, said the officers should have maintained their distance from Prude while they calmly talked to him, asking how they could be of assistance. Handcuffs and the hood served to escalate the tension and fear, they said, causing Prude to tell the officers, “You’re trying to kill me.”</p><p>Debbie F. Plotnick, a vice president at Mental Health America, said instead of shouting orders, officers should ask, “How can I help you?” They should also not order a person having a mental health crisis to “calm down,” as officers repeatedly did with Prude, whose autopsy said he had the drug PCP in his system.</p><p>As for the handcuffs, Plotnick said, “They are already afraid. It also criminalizes people with a mental health condition.”</p><p>Michael Mazzeo, who heads the Locust Club, the city’s police union that represents more than 700 officers, said officers were following guidelines established by the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services when they kept Prude, who was naked, handcuffed on chilly, damp cement. Mazzeo said the “spit hood” was used because Prude had claimed to be infected with the novel <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/02/28/what-you-need-know-about-coronavirus/\">coronavirus</a> and had spit at the officers.</p><p>Mazzeo said the officers were involved in a mandated state training about a month before the incident with Prude.</p><p>“They did exactly what they were trained on, and exactly what the training module was,” Mazzeo said. “It was step-by-step, right-to-the-second, what these officers did.”</p><p>In a statement, a spokeswoman for the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services said “state law requires every local police department” in New York “to have its own use of force policy that is consistent with a state-issued model policy on the topic.” But the agency’s only role in training is to set “minimal” standards that must be taught to recruits when they join the force.</p><p>Mazzeo also alleged that the widely circulated video showing Prude pleading for his life was heavily edited. Mazzeo said he is confident that the seven officers, who were suspended with pay on Thursday, will be cleared of all wrongdoing once New York Attorney General Letitia James (D) completes her review of the matter.</p><p>“We believe, more than believe, we know, there is a substantial amount of information to adequately determine what the circumstances are surrounding the death of Daniel Prude,” Mazzeo said. “You look at that video, and then you also have to take so much encompassing information and placing that video in the context that it has to be.”</p><p>Lawyers for Prude’s family did not return requests for comment.</p><p>Specialized police training that teaches officers tactics to safely apprehend people in a mental health crisis have been available since the late 1980s — typically referred to as Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) training.</p><p>However, such training often ranks low among the priorities of a department. While recruits typically spend nearly 60 hours learning to handle a gun, according to a 2015 survey by the Police Executive Research Forum, they receive only eight hours of training to de-escalate tense situations and eight hours learning strategies for handling the mentally ill.</p><p>Rochester Police Department spokeswoman Jacqueline Shuman said it has such a team but declined to say whether any of the officers involved with Prude’s fatal apprehension are on it. The department also would not say how many officers are on the team, nor would they answer questions about the extent of their training.</p><p>Shuman also declined to answers questions about Prude’s death in custody, because this is “still a very active investigation.”</p><p>Ron Bruno, a 25-year police veteran and executive director of CIT International, said the training teaches officers to “slow everything down,” “build rapport” and communicate as long as possible with the individual with the goal of getting them to voluntary comply with being taken for a mental health evaluation.</p><p>However, he said the best way for departments to have success with the training is to develop a full-fledged CIT program, which involves teaming up and responding to 911 distress calls with local mental health care experts.</p><p>Rochester police would not respond to questions about whether they have such a program.</p><p>Severe budget cuts for psychiatric services — by as much as 30 percent in some states in recent years — have created a vacuum that local police are increasingly asked to fill.</p><p>Mazzeo referenced how New York has shut down many of its mental health institutions, which he said has strained police officers.</p><p>“The put people out on the street, and who is one of the only agencies to deal with them — it’s the police,” he said. “We definitely need changes.”</p><p>Plotnick said the number of people who are experiencing mental health problems is skyrocketing right now due to the spread of the coronavirus and the isolation and stress that comes with it.</p><p>At the time of the arrest, Rochester officials have said that Prude was suffering from a mental health breakdown. On the evening of March 22, before his early-morning arrest, authorities had responded to a separate police call involving Prude. He was taken to the University of Rochester Medical Center, the Democrat & Chronicle newspaper reported. But the hospital released him.</p><p>The University of Rochester Medical Center is now conducting an internal review of Prude’s case, the Democrat & Chronicle reported.</p><p>Instead of blaming the officers, Mazzeo said Prude’s death highlights the need for more aggressive reform of New York’s mental health system, including additional resources to pair trained counselors with law enforcement officials.</p><p>“If there is a need to change things, the way things are done, let’s change them,” Mazzeo said. “But an officer does not have the ability to go on or disregard what they are mandated to do, or what they are trained to do.”</p><p>According to a database of fatal police shootings maintained by The Washington Post, of the 5,400 people shot and killed by police nationwide over the past five years, about 1 in 4 were in mental distress. White people represented the largest number of such deaths, with a total of 732, followed by 190 who were Black, 160 who were Hispanic with the remainder being Asian, Native American or individuals whose race wasn’t known. The database also shows that often police are summoned to the scene by family members seeking assistance, as was the case with Prude, whose brother called 911 for help.</p><p>Meanwhile, New York officials continued to point fingers on Friday for who was to blame for body-camera footage of Prude’s arrest not being released to the public sooner.</p><p>At a news conference, Rochester City Corporation Counsel Tim Curtin and City Attorney Stephanie Prince said they had advised Mayor Lovely A. Warren (D) on June 4 that the city should not to release the video or any information about the case publicly. Curtin and Prince said the recommendation followed a meeting that day with an assistant state attorney general, whose office had been investigating Prude’s death since April.</p><p>Prince said the assistant attorney general told her that “in matters like this” the office “preferred that material not be released to the public if that interferes with their investigation” and that the assistant attorney general referenced the body-camera footage.</p><p>In a statement, the attorney general’s office strongly denied it ever urged that information be withheld by the city.</p><p>“There was never a request from the Attorney General’s Office to the city of Rochester Corporation Counsel to withhold information about the events surrounding the death of Daniel Prude, plain and simple,” the statement said.</p><p>On Thursday, Warren told the media that she only learned of the contents of the video on Aug. 4, when the city complied with a public information request that had been submitted by Prude’s family.</p><p>But Curtin said Friday that the city has known for weeks that Prude’s family was planning to file a lawsuit against the city. Curtin said he approached the family in early August to see if they were interested in settling the case before a lawsuit was filed.</p><p>“We approached the family’s attorneys,” Curtin said. “We contacted them to see if it would be appropriate to have settlement discussions before they filed their lawsuit.”</p><p>Mitch Gruber, a member of the Rochester City Council, said the inconsistent statements from top city leaders has left him and other members of the nine-member council frustrated and angered.</p><p>“As soon as this tragedy happened, there should have been transparency and accountability meted out, and there wasn’t that,” said Gruber (D), adding he only learned about the details of Prude’s arrest this week. “We need to figure out who knew what and when.”</p><p><i>Julie Tate and Steven Rich contributed to this report.</i></p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Sat, 05 Sep 2020 03:20:26 +0000","feedId":9034,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"59588e3f5d2788f100d7168daf90f5ab","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QSDYCOHNQMI6VPIIDMIBGK2FR4.jpg":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599292581394},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 15:56:21","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 15:56:21","title":"Portland on edge after suspect in weekend killing is fatally shot by police","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/portland-on-edge-after-suspect-in-weekend-killing-is-fatally-shot-by-police/2020/09/04/0e6f08d4-eed9-11ea-99a1-71343d03bc29_story.html","description":"<img src=\"http://tabletimages.washingtonpost.com/production/content/0e6f08d4-eed9-11ea-99a1-71343d03bc29_published_1599275341637_b0698/image/1030da91-13c8-4034-bf79-cdbabb8f5331_p.jpeg?ts=1599275341746\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\"></small></div><div><i>By Fenit Nirappil, Matt Zapotosky and Mark Berman</i><br><i>2020.09.05 10:13</i></div><p>PORTLAND, Ore. — The fatal shooting by law enforcement of a far-left activist who was suspected of killing a far-right activist renewed tensions in this city Friday, as investigators sought to learn more about both incidents and officials braced for further unrest.</p><p>There were more questions than answers even as prosecutors released a lengthy arrest affidavit detailing what witnesses had said and video had revealed about the initial killing last weekend.</p><p>Dueling demonstrations are expected in the region in coming days. A racial-justice protest is set for Saturday and a pro-Trump event honoring 39-year-old Aaron \"Jay\" Danielson, a supporter of the far right Patriot Prayer group who was shot dead a week ago, is planned for Monday.</p><img src=\"https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/L5R5C3XO7EI6VGNBOE2D2A54FE.jpg\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\">A crime lab worker in Lacey, Wash., looks at evidence markers after law enforcement officers fatally shot the man suspected of killing a far-right activist in Portland, Ore. (Ted S. Warren/AP) </small></div><p>Oregon Gov. Kate Brown (D) said at a news briefing that she remained concerned about more violence and urged calm.</p><p>“There needs to be a community-wide effort to stop the violence,” she said. “Because the violence must stop. Period.”</p><p>Portland has experienced more than three consecutive months of protests against police brutality, with some of the demonstrations descending into destruction and mayhem. But the tension intensified when a caravan of President Trump's supporters drove through the city in trucks, sparking skirmishes with those who objected to their presence.</p><p>After one of those confrontations, Danielson was shot and killed on the street, and police soon identified as their top suspect 48-year-old Michael Forest Reinoehl, an ardent supporter of the far-left antifa movement who has been a fixture at the nightly protests. Then on Thursday, officers working on a federal task force shot and killed Reinoehl as they moved in to arrest him as he approached a vehicle in the southern part of Washington state, about two hours north of Portland.</p><p>Both shootings remain mired in confusing and incomplete accounts. Reinoehl, a construction contractor and former professional snowboarder, claimed in an interview that aired on \"Vice News Tonight\" Thursday that he acted to defend himself and a friend in the shooting that left Danielson dead, all but admitting that he had pulled the trigger.</p><p>“I was confident that I did not hit anyone innocent, and I made my exit,” Reinoehl told Vice News when asked about what happened immediately after the incident.</p><p>\"I see a civil war right around the corner,\" he added later. \"That shot felt like the beginning of a war.\"</p><p>But Chandler Pappas, a friend of Danielson's who was with him during the incident, has said it \"didn't even register that somebody was pointing a gun at us until the shots went off.\" He has claimed that whoever fired the shots \"recognized our Patriot Prayer hats\" and that just before the gunfire, he heard someone say, \"We've got a couple of 'em right here. Pull it out. Pull it out.\"</p><p>The affidavit released Friday details what investigators had found in Danielson's killing. Police interviewed at least five people who saw some portion of the incident and reviewed video footage, the document says, but their accounts stopped far short of providing a cohesive narrative.</p><p>Investigators found on Danielson's body a loaded, holstered gun that they do not think was fired during the incident, as well as an expandable metal baton nearby, according to the affidavit. They also recovered from the scene a canister of \"Bear Attack Deterrent\" that seemed to have been hit by a bullet.</p><p>One witness, who knew Danielson, told investigators he heard a Black man say, \"We're going to [expletive] kill you,\" saw Danielson pull out a can of mace, then heard two gunshots,\" according to the affidavit. Another witness said he saw a Black man turn to another person and say, \"Hey there's the guy.\" The witness said he then saw Danielson spray mace and heard two gunshots, according to the affidavit.</p><p>Pappas told investigators he and Danielson were facing off with two people and one of those people fired a weapon, according to the affidavit.</p><p>In one chilling detail contained in the affidavit, a Portland police detective wrote that surveillance footage showed Reinoehl looking back toward Danielson and walking into a garage entryway to conceal himself as he watched Danielson walk by. Danielson is seen on the camera walking by, apparently holding a can in his right hand and an expandable baton in his left. Seconds after he passes, Reinoehl emerges, reaching toward his waist. Shortly after, the detective writes, the gunfire rang out but the shooting was not captured on the video.</p><p>Videos of the incident that have circulated online have also offered little clarity. In one video, men can be heard shouting, followed in rapid succession by the sound of something spraying and then two gunshots. In another video, shouts of \"We got a couple right here\" and what sounds like \"He's pulling it out\" can be heard before the gunfire. On Friday, Portland police released a picture of a man who they said witnessed the incident, indicating they were seeking the public's help in locating him and were still investigating Danielson's killing.</p><p>Trump has praised his supporters who have descended on the city while lashing out at local leaders. Attorney General William P. Barr issued a fiery statement Friday calling Reinoehl a \"a dangerous fugitive, admitted antifa member, and suspected murderer\" who was shot by law enforcement after he \"attempted to escape arrest and produced a firearm.\"</p><p>“The streets of our cities are safer with this violent agitator removed, and the actions that led to his location are an unmistakable demonstration that the United States will be governed by law, not violent mobs,” Barr said.</p><p>Activists who knew Reinoehl disputed that account, describing Reinoehl as a protector over the past several months of protests who was inspired to join because he believed in equality.</p><p>Elizabeth Pruden, 38, of Salem, said Reinoehl stuck out easily in the crowd of demonstrators because he brought his young daughter. She said she got to know Reinoehl several weeks ago when protesters regrouped outside a downtown Apple Store to avoid police.</p><p>“Like a lot of us, he came into it with a lot of weight on his shoulders and not being the best person he felt like he could be,” Pruden said. “Through the protesting and all the trauma bonding we all went through, he saw himself growing. He saw himself becoming a better father and a better human being. He was becoming a protector.”</p><p>Some activists said the death of Reinoehl — particularly when compared with the comparatively uneventful arrest of Kyle Rittenhouse on charges of killing two protesters last month in Kenosha, Wis. — risked inflaming tensions on the streets of Portland.</p><p>\"If the cops want this to stop, how is coming out here and killing us helping? That's literally why we are out here,\" said Teal Lindseth, protest organizer who met Reinoehl at a gathering outside the county jail early on in the demonstrations. \"They aren't giving us a day in court and are shooting us before asking questions.\"</p><p><b></b>Lindseth and a fellow activist Ronan Williams said protesters who gathered Thursday night after learning of Reinoehl's death were despondent and more irritable while confronting police. The coming days, they said, were laced with uncertainty.</p><p>\"It could literally by the start of something bad or something amazingly nice,\" said Lindseth</p><p><b></b>Reinoehl's Instagram page indicates that he had been attending Black Lives Matter demonstrations in recent months, and he told Bloomberg News in July he was \"working security\" to protect people in the crowd.</p><p>In a lengthy post on June 16, he wrote that he was “100% ANTIFA all the way!” and hinted of violence. “I am willing to fight for my brothers and sisters! Even if some of them are too ignorant to realize what antifa truly stands for. We do not want violence but we will not run from it either!” he wrote.</p><p>His friends, though, said that did not reflect his character and that he did not appear to be part of any organized antifa groups.</p><p>\"He never meant to personally harm someone but to protect us,\" Lindseth said. \"I've never even see him be violent.\"</p><p>It is unclear where Reinoehl went after last Saturday's shooting, or when he was interviewed by Vice News. But on Thursday at about 7:30 p.m., members of the U.S. Marshals Service Pacific Northwest Violent Offender Task Force caught up with him in a quiet, residential area near Olympia, Wash., according to a statement from the U.S. Marshals Service.</p><p>The Marshals Service said officers were trying to arrest him on a murder warrant for the Portland shooting, and, \"initial reports indicate the suspect produced a firearm, threatening the lives of law enforcement officers.\" Reinoehl was fatally shot, authorities said.</p><p>Portland police on Friday said in a statement that their officers had obtained an arrest warrant for him a day earlier on two charges stemming from Danielson's death — a charge of murder in the second degree with a firearm and unlawful use of a weapon, also with a firearm. Law enforcement officials on Thursday also sought a search warrant for his home, where officials found evidence, including the clothes Reinoehl wore during the shooting, authorities said.</p><p>Portland police noted their officers were not present when Reinoehl was shot \"and defer questions about that incident to agencies involved.\"</p><p>Lt. Ray Brady of the Thurston County Sheriff’s Office, which is leading the investigation into the shooting, said that officers were surveilling Reinoehl as he left an apartment complex and confronted him as he made his way to a vehicle. He said Reinoehl was armed and officers fired shots into the vehicle, then — after Reinoehl fled — fired more shots.</p><p>In total, four officers fired shots, Brady said in an interview Friday. These officers were from the Pierce County Sheriff’s Department, the city of Lakewood’s police force and the Washington State Department of Corrections, and they were all part of a federal task force run by the Marshals, he said.</p><p>Trevor Brown, 24, who lives nearby, said he heard gunfire, got up, and saw three or four officers pointing long guns and wearing body armor. He said he could not see whomever they were aiming at. In total, he said, he heard roughly 10 shots — first three that were fired slowly, then a more rapid volley. He said he did not hear anyone say anything, though he might have been too far away to have done so.</p><p>“Nobody seemed to know who he was,” Brown said of Reinoehl. “I have no idea what his connection was with the people out here.”</p><p>Brady said Friday that while “multiple” bullet casings were recovered at the scene, it was too soon to say how many rounds struck Reinoehl or were fired during the encounter. Reinoehl’s autopsy should take place sometime in the middle of next week, which should provide more information, Brady said. The Thurston County Sheriff’s Office found that Reinoehl had “a semiautomatic handgun” that was found “immediately on his person,” Brady said, but he did not know whether Reinoehl fired any shots or brandished the weapon.</p><p>Brady said he also did not know how investigators tracked Reinoehl to the area.</p><p>“We do know that he was at an apartment in that complex,” Brady said. “But we don’t know yet at this time what brought him there, what the ties are between the residents and him.”</p><p>When the sheriff’s office finishes its investigation, the case will be sent to the Thurston County prosecuting attorney, Brady said. But he cautioned that there is “quite a bit of evidence and other documentation in this case,” so it could take at least a few months.</p><p><i>Julie Tate in Washington contributed to this report.</i></p><br><hr><div>获取更多RSS：<br><a href=\"https://feedx.net\" style=\"color:orange\" target=\"_blank\">https://feedx.net</a> <br><a href=\"https://feedx.xyz\" style=\"color:orange\" target=\"_blank\">https://feedx.xyz</a><br></div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Sat, 05 Sep 2020 03:20:26 +0000","feedId":9034,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"b31c0191b2feee5b04be67e2164f7cba","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://tabletimages.washingtonpost.com/production/content/0e6f08d4-eed9-11ea-99a1-71343d03bc29_published_1599275341637_b0698/image/1030da91-13c8-4034-bf79-cdbabb8f5331_p.jpeg?ts=1599275341746":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn51@2020_5/2020/09/05/07-56-22-083_cdb9958dff425782.webp","https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/L5R5C3XO7EI6VGNBOE2D2A54FE.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn85@2020_1/2020/09/05/07-56-25-972_d87c30afca5bfc48.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599292581394},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 15:56:21","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 15:56:21","title":"An overlooked subset of people fatally shot by police: Women","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/investigations/police-shootings-women/","description":"<img src=\"http://tabletimages.washingtonpost.com/production/content/4673979a0dae2c1a420d5580cfcf76f9_published_1599271943383_ef45b/image/6833564f-fa4e-463e-bf9d-78109046dced_p.jpeg?ts=1599271943495\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\"></small></div><div><i>By Marisa Iati, Jennifer Jenkins and Sommer Brugal</i><br><i>2020.09.05 00:04</i></div><p>After Louisville police fatally shot 26-year-old Breonna Taylor during a nighttime raid at her home in March, her killing could have been just another in a long line of deadly police shootings of women that have drawn little publicity.</p><p>But the death of Taylor, who was Black, fell between two high-profile killings of Black men.

But 139 other cases shared one or more of the circumstances in which Taylor was killed.</p><p>Of the 247 women fatally shot, 48 were Black and seven of those were unarmed.</p><p>At least 89 of the women were at their homes or residences where they sometimes stayed. And 12 of those women killed at home were shot by officers who were there to conduct a search or make an arrest.</p><p>Since 2015, Black women have accounted for less than 1 percent of the overall fatal shootings in cases where race was known. But within this small subset, Black women, who are 13 percent of the female population, account for 20 percent of the women shot and killed and 28 percent of the unarmed deaths.</p><img src=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-stat/graphics/ai2html/fatalpolicewomen-ratebyrace-chart/UBQW5FK3H5CUNH5TCZHSYU7EMM/2300-RatesbyRace-Women.jpg?c=1599177252568\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\"></small></div><p>Black men, 12 percent of the male population, make up 27 percent of the men shot and 36 percent of the unarmed deaths.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/as-breonna-taylor-protests-stretch-into-12th-week-calls-for-officers-arrests-intensify/2020/08/18/ce6f2b9a-d823-11ea-930e-d88518c57dcc_story.html\">Taylor’s killing</a> came shortly after midnight on March 13, when plainclothes police officers used a battering ram to force their way into her apartment to execute a “no-knock” search warrant in a drug investigation. At the time, Taylor and her 27-year-old boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, were asleep.</p><p>Walker fired one shot with a gun he legally possessed, striking an officer in the leg. The officers returned fire, and Taylor, an emergency room technician, was struck five times.</p><p>Police said they identified themselves, but a lawsuit filed by Taylor’s family disputes that, and Walker said he thought the officers were intruders, according to <a href=\"https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/crime/2020/05/15/breonna-taylor-shooting-boyfriend-kenneth-walker-faces-charges-what-know/5183805002/\">local news reports</a>. No drugs were found at the home. Charges against Walker for attempted murder of a law enforcement officer were dropped. The city has since banned the use of no-knock warrants.</p><p>The Louisville police chief fired one of the officers involved, Brett Hankison, for “wantonly and blindly” shooting 10 rounds into Taylor’s home in “extreme indifference to the value of human life,” according to the letter announcing his intent to terminate the officer.</p><p>In an appeal, Hankison’s attorney, David Leightty, wrote the officer should not have been fired, noting that the FBI and the Kentucky attorney general’s office were still investigating. “Brett Hankison did not ‘blindly’ discharge his firearm, and did not lack cognizance of the direction in which he fired, but acted in quick response to gunfire directed at himself and other officers,” Leightty wrote.</p><p>A spokesperson for the Louisville Metro Police Department and Walker’s attorney did not respond to requests for comment. Taylor’s family also declined to comment.</p><p>Taylor’s death “could have easily been forgotten, and it was almost forgotten,” said Kimberlé Crenshaw, executive director of the African American Policy Forum, which seeks to combat racially based structural inequality and systemic oppression. “But I think the fact that other cases were happening in the same season made it harder to simply overlook her case.”</p><p>Because women overall account for a much smaller number of people killed by police, Crenshaw said Black women often are left out of the public narrative about the use of force by police against Black people. Police have shot and killed 1,274 Black men since January 2015.</p><p>Crenshaw said Black women’s deaths also may be dismissed as “collateral damage” if they are killed while police are pursuing someone else. Twenty of the 247 women were killed in that kind of situation, analysis shows. In 12 of those 20 shootings, police said the women killed were caught in crossfire or shot accidentally.</p><p>“As long as Black women lose their lives in circumstances like these, their lost life won’t be dramatized in a way that mobilizes the kinds of reforms that have to happen in order to protect more life and to make police officers accountable,” Crenshaw said.</p><p>The shooting with circumstances most similar to Taylor’s killing is that of Alteria Woods, 21, who was killed on March 19, 2017, when members of the Indian River County Sheriff’s Office SWAT team went to her boyfriend’s family’s home in Gifford, Fla., to conduct a search warrant for narcotics, according to an affidavit filed by the sheriff’s office in court.</p><p>The deputies said they identified themselves and began breaking the bedroom window, and Woods’s boyfriend, Andrew Jeff Coffee IV, began shooting, the affidavit states. Deputies returned fire, striking and killing Woods, an unarmed Black woman.</p><p>Indian River County Sheriff Deryl Loar told reporters at the time that Coffee knelt next to Woods, who was in bed, and fired at deputies. One deputy was shot in the shoulder. “He used her for personal protection,” Loar said, <a href=\"https://www.tcpalm.com/story/news/crime/2017/03/19/deputies-respond-incident-gifford-neighborhood/99378080/\">according to TCPalm</a>. The sheriff’s office did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>After he was arrested, Coffee said the deputies did not identify themselves and he did not know who they were. Coffee was charged with attempted murder of a law enforcement officer and other crimes related to drugs and a gun recovered at the home, court documents show. He has pleaded not guilty.</p><p>“As this case is on-going, we can only speak to the unnecessary tragedy of Ms. Woods’ death and the heartbreak of all those that loved her who still wait for answers and accountability,” said Coffee’s lawyers Adam Chrzan and Julia Graves in a statement.</p><p>Woods’s mother told The Post that Taylor’s death has been hard on her because of the similarities. \"It brought back a lot of memories of our daughter’s murder,” Yolanda Woods said.</p><video src=\"https://d21rhj7n383afu.cloudfront.net/washpost-production/The_Washington_Post/20200721/5f1642c74cedfd000108261b/5f51a5f6cff47e0009899718/file_640x360-600-v3.mp4\" width=\"100%\" controls></video><div><small style=\"color: #999;\">Breonna Taylor’s death commanded national attention.

Police said Perry was a suspect in two homicides and a home invasion, and they believed he was on his way to kill a member of a rival drug gang.</p><p>The officers followed Perry, Kager and their 4-month-old son as they drove into a 7-Eleven parking lot. The police cars pulled up behind Kager’s Cadillac, blocking it in.</p><p>An officer threw a flash-bang grenade toward the Cadillac to distract Perry, Virginia Beach Commonwealth’s Attorney Colin Stolle later told reporters. Four officers ran toward the car to arrest Perry and he shot at them.</p><p>The officers fired 30 rounds in response, killing Perry and Kager. Police said the infant, sitting in the back seat, escaped injury. A nearby surveillance camera recorded the gun battle.</p><p>Stolle concluded that the police shooting was justified.</p><p>In 2018, a jury in a wrongful-death civil suit filed by Kager’s family determined that two of the officers acted with “gross negligence” and awarded the family $800,000. The city settled the case to give closure to Kager’s family and to the officers, said Julie Hill, a spokesperson for the city of Virginia Beach.</p><p>Gina Best, Kager’s mother, told The Post that her daughter and Perry were on their way back to Maryland from Virginia Beach, where they introduced their son to Perry’s family that day.</p><p>Best said she sees parallels between her daughter’s killing and Taylor’s case: Both women were Black, police in both cases said they fired their weapons because a man shot first and none of the officers involved in either shooting have been criminally charged.</p><p>The national scrutiny of Taylor’s killing has been a painful reminder that Kager’s death drew far less public attention or outrage.</p><p>“They’re still saying Breonna’s name, but they’ve forgotten India,” Best said. “They’re still not saying her name.”</p><p>Why fewer women are killed</p><p>The Post began tracking fatal police shootings in a database in January 2015, months after a White police officer in Ferguson, Mo., killed Michael Brown, an unarmed Black man during a confrontation. Since then, police have shot and killed about 1,000 people a year.</p><p>The starkest difference between women and men is the rate: Women account for about half the population, but 4 percent of the killings. Of those fatally shot every year, about 44 have been women.</p><p>That difference may be explained in part by broader patterns in criminal justice regarding contact with law enforcement and police stereotypes about gender, experts said. Women in the United States account for about one-fourth of all arrests, according to FBI data.</p><p>“Even when they have a confrontation with a police officer, they’re less likely to have a weapon, they’re less likely to have the same threat level as a man,” said Geoffrey P. Alpert, a criminology professor at the University of South Carolina and co-author of “Evaluating Police Uses of Force.”</p><p>Arrest data indicates how often a gender or ethnic group is confronted by police, Alpert said, but it also distorts how officers perceive the threat a person from that group poses — regardless of whether they are committing a crime at the time. Gender- or race-based stereotypes can create a false perception of how dangerous a person is likely to be, Alpert said.</p><p>“I think it’s an illusion that you look at a woman and you think of her as not being as threatening as a male. Where in the aggregate that may be true, but this particular woman you may be looking at may be Bonnie,” he said, referring to Bonnie Parker, part of a criminal couple believed to have killed at least 13 people during the Great Depression.</p><p>Lawrence Sherman, director of the University of Cambridge’s Police Executive Program and the Cambridge Center for Evidence-Based Policing, agreed that police may feel less threatened by women. Police generally view men as more likely to commit homicides and carry guns, he said.</p><p>Officers also may feel more comfortable taking steps to de-escalate a situation when challenged by a woman, Sherman said. “The police officers may be seeing a challenge from a woman as less risky to their reputation” among their colleagues, Sherman said.</p><p>The chance of police using force on a woman rapidly increases if the officer perceives she is not conforming to stereotypes of women as submissive and deferential — especially if the woman is Black or LGBTQ, said Andrea Ritchie, researcher-in-residence at the Barnard Center for Research on Women.</p><p>She said the officer may view a woman who behaves that way as “hysterical” and, in turn, overreact.</p><p>“There’s definitely a long history of framing women who aren’t compliant as insane,” said Ritchie, author of “Invisible No More: Police Violence Against Black Women and Women of Color.”</p><p>“I think that’s particularly true for Black women.”</p><p>Some patterns in fatal shootings by police hold true for both genders.</p><p>For women and men, about one-third of the police encounters that led to shootings began with a report of a domestic disturbance, a 911 call or a traffic stop, records show.</p><p>The average age of women and men killed by police was 37, and about one-third were 25 to 34.</p><p>As with fatal police shootings of men, the vast majority of the women killed were armed with a potential weapon at the time, although slightly less often: 89 percent of the women were armed, compared to 91 percent of the men.</p><img src=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-stat/graphics/ai2html/fatalpolicewomen-armedunarmed-chart/UBQW5FK3H5CUNH5TCZHSYU7EMM/2300-Armed-Unarmed.jpg?c=1599228637027\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\"></small></div><p>For both genders, a gun was the most common weapon. Of men killed, 57 percent were armed with a gun and of women, 44 percent. In other cases, women were armed with knives, cars, toy weapons, hammers and hatchets.</p><p>By race, 147 of the women killed were White, 48 Black and 29 Hispanic. Five were Native American, four were Asian and three were other races. In 11 cases, race could not be determined. By percentages, men shot by police were less often White and more often Black or Hispanic.</p><p>Since 2015, police have killed 26 unarmed women, including Taylor. Of those, 14 were White, seven were Black, four were Hispanic and one’s race was unknown. While about twice as many White women were shot and killed as Black women, White women account for five times the population.</p><p>One explanation for the disproportionate numbers could be what sociologists call the “ecological fallacy,” which means people — in this case, police — act with generalizations in mind, even though they don’t know whether it applies to the person they’re dealing with, Alpert said.</p><p>“We create these stereotypes for groups, but we have no idea if that one person fits the mold,” he said.</p><p>Crenshaw offered another reason for the disparity: centuries of people associating dark skin with being a threat.</p><p>“You don’t need to have Black people being more frequently arrested to have an implicit association with blackness and danger,” she said. “That is a deep part of our culture.”</p><img src=\"https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6B444KWYNEI6VJ4IFTUGZ2ARFE.jpg\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\">A sign in Louisville, where Breonna Taylor was fatally shot by police.

He ordered her to drop it, but continued to hear popping noises, he said.</p><p>“That’s my mother!” Livingston yelled. At nearly the same moment, a shot rang out and Livingston screamed, “It’s a BB gun! You killed my mother!”</p><p>County District Attorney Kevin Buchanan determined the shooting was justified and declined to charge the officer with a crime.</p><p>Livingston was charged after officers reported finding marijuana in a Mason jar and two sandwich-style bags at the home. He pleaded no contest and received a seven-month suspended sentence.</p><p>Livingston told The Post that Townsend was asleep when police entered the home and that she owned the BB gun to protect herself from pit bulls in the neighborhood. He said his mother might still be alive if police had given him more time to let them inside.</p><p>“I just never had a chance to do it,” Livingston said.</p><p>In October 2019, Livingston filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against the city, which was dismissed on procedural grounds in June, court records show.</p><p>In an interview, Bartlesville Police Chief Tracy Roles said the officers did not know the weapon was not a firearm and had no choice but to use deadly force.</p><p>“The matter of Ms. Townsend choosing to produce a weapon and fire it at our officers really gave them, in my opinion, no choice but to return fire,” said Roles, who joined the department nine months after the shooting.</p><p>Roles said gender is irrelevant to his officers’ decisions to fire their weapons in a confrontation. “We base it on the threat that is presented to us at that time,” he said.</p><p>On Jan. 28, 2019, Houston police were executing a no-knock warrant for heroin trafficking when they shot and killed <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/08/23/couple-was-killed-during-botched-drug-raid-now-an-officer-has-been-charged-with-murder/\">Rhogena Nicholas</a>, 58, and her 59-year-old husband, Dennis Tuttle, a disabled Navy veteran — both White — at the Houston couple’s home.</p><p>About 4:30 p.m., roughly 12 narcotics officers and about six patrol officers, some of them in uniform, broke down the door while announcing themselves, police said.</p><p>A pit bull charged at the first officer inside, who shot and killed the dog, according to police. Tuttle came from the back of the house and shot the officer in the shoulder, causing him to collapse on the living room sofa, police said. Three other officers were also shot by Tuttle, according to Chief Art Acevedo’s statements to reporters.</p><p>Nicholas reached for the officer’s gun, according to police. Police told The Post that seven officers opened fire, striking and killing her and Tuttle.</p><p>The officers had secured the warrant asserting that there was heroin trafficking at the home, but police said they found no heroin.</p><p>In the following months, the official narrative unraveled: An internal police investigation found that an informant referenced in the search warrant said he had never bought drugs at the home.</p><p>Acevedo accused the officer who led the raid of lying to justify it.</p><p>The officer was charged with two counts of murder, while he and another officer were charged with tampering with government records for allegedly falsifying documents related to the raid, the Harris County Prosecutor’s Office said in statements. Both officers have pleaded not guilty, and the cases are ongoing.</p><p>Mike Doyle, an attorney for Nicholas’s family, said a forensic investigator hired by both families found that the officer who fired the shot fatal to Nicholas would have been unable to see her at the time and blindly fired the shot through a wall.</p><p>Doyle said the “militarized” way that officers often execute search warrants in homes — carrying rifles and breaking down doors with battering rams — makes an escalation of force likely.</p><p>“If the starting approach is extreme violence, why wouldn’t you expect bad results way too many times?” Doyle said.</p><p>Nicholas’s brother, John Nicholas, told The Post he wants police to release body-camera video from the patrol officers and other officers who responded after the exchange of gunfire. Acevedo has told reporters that the narcotics officers who led the raid were not wearing body cameras.</p><p>“To this day, the chief of police hasn’t apologized,” John Nicholas said. “They still say there was a reason to be there, but nobody knows that reason.”</p><p>A lawyer for Tuttle’s family did not respond to a request for an interview.</p><p>Three weeks after the shooting, the Houston Police Department announced that it would severely limit its use of no-knock warrants, a controversial tool that is meant to catch suspects off-guard. Since then, the department has conducted no no-knock warrants, Acevedo told The Post.</p><p>“I immediately moved to limit no-knock warrants on the basis of the one that went horribly wrong,” Acevedo said.</p><p>Thor Eells, executive director of the National Tactical Officers Association, which provides tactical training to law enforcement, said search warrants at residences are inherently dangerous. Although police gather information before carrying out a warrant, there are unknowns.</p><p>But Eells cautioned against banning no-knock warrants. That tactic, although high-risk, is occasionally the best choice.</p><p>“It doesn’t mean it’s safe, but it’s sometimes less dangerous than other options,” Eells said.</p><img src=\"https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/L462FXBEA4I6TNNUDUMN7N5QQQ.jpg\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\">Bullet holes can be seen on the front of a home where Houston police officers fatally shot Rhogena Nicholas and Dennis Tuttle while carrying out a search warrant in January 2019.

Without treatment, future interactions with police could end in a fatal use of force by officers, he said.</p><p>“We have a bias against seeing women as dangerous or violent, and their illness may not present with violence in the same way a man’s would,” Snook said. “Often, their treatment is going to be delayed because they won’t meet the standards.”</p><p>The family of <a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/elgin-courier-news/ct-ecn-state-reports-elgin-cop-clements-shooting-st-0628-20190626-sze3iq3kirb2vgusqvjdngvtom-story.html\">DeCynthia Clements</a>, a 34-year-old Black woman who had schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, said police in Elgin, Ill., who shot and killed her should have recognized she was in the throes of a crisis and taken steps to de-escalate the situation.</p><p>On March 12, 2018, Elgin Police Officer Matthew Joniak pulled over a car driven by Clements because it was a “suspicious vehicle,” according to an Illinois State Police investigative report, which did not elaborate. Joniak spoke briefly with Clements. When Joniak returned to his patrol car, Clements drove away and then refused to stop when he tried to pull her over for running a stop sign.</p><p>A short while later, Joniak saw Clements’s SUV parked on the side of the interstate and stopped to investigate. He called other officers for help. Several officers approached Clements and directed her to get out of the car, but she refused and brandished two knives, according to the report.</p><p>For the next hour, Clements refused to leave the vehicle. She then lit two items on fire and tossed them into the back seat of the SUV, body camera video shows, and the car erupted in flames.</p><p>Officers pleaded with Clements to get out of the vehicle. Lt. Christian Jensen told investigators that when Clements stepped out, she pointed the knives at the officers, made what he described as a “war cry” and “charged at the officers,” the report says.</p><p>Jensen told investigators that the officers, who were six to eight feet away, could not escape because they were standing against a highway barrier with patrol cars on two sides of them.

(Photos by Karsten Moran for The Washington Post)</small></div><p>Pizza by the slice — the city’s signature comfort food — went missing amid the pandemic. From Gravesend to the Grand Concourse, restaurateurs grappled with ways to remain open while protecting employees from the pathogen. Some wanted to eliminate lines at sidewalk windows; others sought to reduce germ-ridden detritus — grease-stained paper plates, aluminum soda cans and plastic straws — on countertops. In the end, many reached the same conclusion: move the slice off menu.</p><p>On the Upper West Side, at Mama’s Too, patrons had to buy “half pies,” or four slices. When they picked up orders, owner Frank Tuttolomondo initially only pulled up the glass garage door six inches above the ground before sliding pie boxes out on a rack. (Now he uses a waist-level shelf to slide pizzas out to customers.) Of the myriad changes, though, the slice’s disappearance rankled regulars the most.</p><p>“People really had an issue with no slice,” Tuttolomondo said.</p><p>New Yorkers take pizza personally. When <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/11/nyregion/de-blasio-skewered-for-eating-pizza-with-utensils.html\">Mayor Bill de Blasio ate his with a knife and fork</a> at Goodfella’s on Staten Island in 2014, his eat-with-your-hands electorate was apoplectic. When a denizen <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2015/09/22/the-three-stages-of-going-viral-in-2015-according-to-the-pizza-rat-meme/\">captured a rat carrying a slice down subway stairs</a> on video in 2015, the rodent was feted as the city’s next big star. Even when they leave, locals remain loyalists to cheap, foldable slices. Kemba Walker grew up in the Sack Wern Houses in the Bronx, and is now a multimillionaire all-star in the NBA. He highlights his roots when he wears a gold chain with a pizza slice medallion around his neck. He gave them to several friends from home, too.</p><p>“Everybody has their piece of the pie,” said Kedow Walker, the player’s cousin.</p><img src=\"https://img.washingtonpost.com/news/voraciously/wp-content/uploads/sites/68/2020/08/nycpizza1.jpg\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\">Frank Tuttolomondo who runs Mama’s Too, poses for a portrait outside the pizzeria’s location on Manhattan’s Upper West Side.</small></div><p>But many pizza makers wonder if or when their businesses will be whole again. Since March 16, no customers have been allowed to eat inside shops despite a variety of other industries being allowed to restart during phases over the summer. In early spring, as Wall Street panicked and hospital workers needed fuel around-the-clock, owners kept ovens going at 500 degrees, melding tomato sauce with mozzarella cheese. Day in, day out, obstacles bubbled up, and managers adjusted to increased scrutiny from the city. To mark six feet of social distancing, Anthony Sagos, owner of Da Nonna Rosa, who serves 180 slices per day typically, spaced tomato cans on the sidewalk in front of his shop. Fire marshals and police visited to enforce the ban on indoor dining, with one marshal going so far as to inspect a backroom.</p><p>“We’re not a speakeasy,” Sagos said.</p><p>At least one pizzeria in Queens lost its liquor license due to violations of outdoor dining rules, for serving alcohol to large numbers of congregants. And all managers negotiated new guidelines regarding hygiene while trying to stave off financial collapse. Now, health department letter grades remain in front windows, but no diners are allowed inside. Plexiglas separates customers from cashiers; assembled cardboard boxes are stacked high on tabletops; dispensers of hand sanitizer stand alongside shakers of garlic, red pepper flakes and oregano. Need ingredients? At Artichoke in Brooklyn, a sign advertises a “DIY Home Pizza Kit” — dough, sauce and cheese — for $15. Pepperonis are another $5, oven not included.</p><p>Joe Caruso, co-owner of Pino’s, a Park Slope slice joint that has operated since 1964, calls covid-19’s toll “a disaster.” In 2019, his place went Hollywood when the filmmakers shot a scene from “Marriage Story” on site. Today, the interior resembles a crime scene, yellow caution tape blocking patrons from sitting down.</p><p>A few blocks away, the slice never went away at Antonio’s on Flatbush Avenue, but business is slow. Outside, a statue of a pizza maker — an advertisement of a free soda for those who order any two slices in his hands — has been updated with a single-use mask covering his face. In addition, the owners have moved the classic booths onto the sidewalk by the Seventh Avenue subway station, where they remain rain or shine. Inside, a painting of Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone from “The Godfather,” promises, “I’m going to make you a pizza you can’t refuse.” But deliveries are down, and commuters, who grabbed their greasy triangles to go, aren’t using the subway. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/coronavirus-great-american-migration/2020/03/28/b59d4d44-6f6f-11ea-a3ec-70d7479d83f0_story.html\">Well-to-do neighbors uprooted</a> during the upheaval.</p><img src=\"https://img.washingtonpost.com/news/voraciously/wp-content/uploads/sites/68/2020/08/nycpizza3.jpg\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\">A customer picks up a pizza — which is passed to him on a metal table under the restaurant’s glass roll gate — at Mama’s Too.</small></div><p>Delivery drivers are being dispatched beyond regular boundaries to reach new hands. Parlors like L&B Spumoni Gardens, open since 1939, in Brooklyn and Upside Pizza in Manhattan, which opened in 2019, expanded delivery zones. The Upside radius now stretches from the Hudson River to East River and 14th to 65th streets. Transactions are completed at the curb with as little human interaction as possible.</p><p>Even Lombardi’s in Little Italy, which brands itself as the nation’s first pizzeria (established in 1905) on its boxes, ventured into new territory when it dropped off 50 pies for the USNS Comfort, docked at Pier 90. Still, without tourists and weekday workers, owners pivoted to selling grandma pizza by the slice ($4 plain; $5 with toppings) this week for the first time in the shop’s modern iteration.</p><p>“We’re hanging on by our fingernails,” said Michael Giammarino, CEO of Lombardi’s.</p><p>Many have already fallen. <a href=\"https://comptroller.nyc.gov/reports/save-main-street/\">A city comptroller report</a> tallied just under 1,300 restaurants that permanently closed between March and July. Olga’s, a mom-and-pop operation in Hamilton Heights, was a staple on Broadway. During the lockdown, <a href=\"https://abc7ny.com/olgas-pizza-rally-protest-small-business/6219196/\">customers held a rally in support</a> of the store, and a GoFundMe page was started for the proprietor, Evangelina Gritsipis, who was known to give a free slice to indigent guests. But today, the roller gate remains down and locked. Only the shop’s name and ubiquitous boast — “The Best Pizza in Town” — mark its past status.</p><p>Pizzaphiles make pilgrimages elsewhere. Upon reopening in late May, Scarr Pimentel, owner of his eponymous shop, recognized familiar faces despite their masks. He sealed boxes with orange stickers; customers came by foot, bicycle and SUV, the latter driven onto the narrow street’s sidewalk to retrieve orders. Pimentel smiled.</p><p>“I think we’re going to sell out by noon,” he said.</p><img src=\"https://img.washingtonpost.com/news/voraciously/wp-content/uploads/sites/68/2020/08/nycpizza2.jpg\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\">Clockwise from foreground left, diners Simone Collins, Bernadette Myers, Gianmarco Saretto and Peter Njenga eat pizza at a table set up in the street in front of Mama’s Too in Manhattan.</small></div><p>The slice has since returned to his menu, just as it has at Mama’s Too, where credit card is preferred for contactless payments. Few pizzerias benefited more from the city’s approval of roadway enclosures for outdoor dining than Mama’s Too. Typically, there are only four stools in Tuttolomondo’s shoe box of a shop. Now, he has increased seating capacity to 10 tables with two chairs at each. He appreciates his lot, aware that others are limited in their options due to fire hydrants and bus stops.</p><p>Rocco Vitalone, 26, is a regular. He lives alone, and noticed the slice’s absence when he walked by one day in March. He considered the pie too much for one and did not eat pizza from March to May. When the slice returned, so did Vitalone.</p><p>On an overcast afternoon in August, he ordered two slices: vodka with whipped ricotta and basil and hot sopressata with honey. He could not see the pizza being prepared, as he could in pre-covid times, but he took the finished product to a table in what is normally a curbside parking space. Though he favored the vodka, calling it “pretty superb,” he lamented how fast the flavorful slice moved when available.</p><p>“Quick seller,” he said. “Sad, sad day when it’s not on the counter.”</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Sat, 05 Sep 2020 03:20:26 +0000","feedId":9034,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"66956b41889ff7fac1c2f4c2c04b455e","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://tabletimages.washingtonpost.com/production/content/66956b41889ff7fac1c2f4c2c04b455e_published_1599273679308_c0263/image/443268e1-0d12-4247-992d-3ba9adb1955a_p.jpeg?ts=1599273679472":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn36@2020_6/2020/09/05/07-56-21-845_04ec5515726587a5.webp","http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/voraciously/wp-content/uploads/sites/68/2020/08/nycpizza-lede.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn76@2020_2/2020/09/05/07-56-41-725_2a9212df4914d0e6.webp","https://img.washingtonpost.com/news/voraciously/wp-content/uploads/sites/68/2020/08/nycpizza1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn15@2020_6/2020/09/05/07-56-33-243_f7cb7757e067342e.webp","https://img.washingtonpost.com/news/voraciously/wp-content/uploads/sites/68/2020/08/nycpizza3.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn77@2020_4/2020/09/05/07-56-32-016_fc0c98d716fd55e7.webp","https://img.washingtonpost.com/news/voraciously/wp-content/uploads/sites/68/2020/08/nycpizza2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn93@2020_5/2020/09/05/07-56-34-736_97564ebb5a93e70a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599292581394},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 15:56:21","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 15:56:21","title":"Prosecutors charged more police after Ferguson but struggled to win convictions.

Every year, The Post has found about 1,000 deadly shootings. Most of the people involved are armed, and shootings by police are usually deemed justified.</p><p>Occasionally, a case draws significant public attention. After Ferguson, officials responded to protests and outrage with promises of reform, adopting new training for police and expanding the use of body cameras.</p><p>Prosecutors began charging more officers with murder and manslaughter for fatal shootings and doing so quickly, breaking with a history of cases that were investigated slowly. Prosecutors were still charging only a small fraction of the police who shot and killed people, but the increase was notable.</p><p>Then, when people stopped paying as much attention to police shootings, prosecutors stopped bringing as many cases.</p><p>In 2015 and 2016, the first two full years after Ferguson, 32 police officers were charged with murder or manslaughter for an on-duty shooting — more than in the seven previous years combined, according to data tallied by Philip Stinson, a criminologist at Bowling Green University. Police shootings were high-profile news events at the time, with cases in Minneapolis, Baton Rouge, Charlotte and other places that prompted outrage and demonstrations.</p><p>Then the national attention waned.</p><p>In 2017 and 2018, the third and fourth years after Ferguson, the number of officers charged with murder or manslaughter was 17 — about half as many as had been charged in the previous two years. Last year, 11 officers were charged.</p><p>So far this year, eight officers have been charged with murder or manslaughter for an on-duty shooting.

(Nate Smallwood/AP)</small></div><p>The reasons have remained largely consistent. Since 2015, four key factors have played a role in many officers being found not guilty or walking free due to hung juries, according to a review by The Post, Stinson’s database and interviews with attorneys involved in the cases, law enforcement officials and family members:</p><p>●Expert witnesses for the officers, who are typically law enforcement veterans themselves, are able to skillfully explain to jurors why officers may have feared for their lives or followed their training.</p><p>●Jurors, who already tend to trust police, bring a more skeptical eye to evidence in cases involving viral videos they saw before joining the jury.</p><p>●Defense attorneys for officers can be successful at casting them as family men defending communities — while also painting bleak pictures of the people shot and killed.</p><p>●And crucially, the Supreme Court’s 1989 decision in <i>Graham v. Connor </i>— which established that officers’ actions must be judged by what a reasonable officer might do under the same circumstances — gives them wide latitude for their actions.</p><p>“Police officers are in different positions than the rest of us,” said Patrick Thomassey, who represented a police officer in East Pittsburgh who was charged with killing a 17-year-old student and acquitted last year. “We as a society give them the right to use deadly force. They have to.”</p><img src=\"https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XZNNKFXDLAI6VAWYLZK5I7UQZI.jpg\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\">A bullet hole is visible in the lower right corner of a window at the office of attorney Patrick Thomassey in Monroeville, Pa., last year.

More common were outcomes like what happened when Deters charged Raymond Tensing, a University of Cincinnati police officer, for shooting and killing Samuel DuBose during a July 2015 stop.</p><p>Tensing pulled DuBose over near the school’s campus for not having a front license plate on his green Honda Accord.

Deters said his office had reviewed many police shootings but never thought one was a murder before.</p><p>“He didn’t do anything violent towards the officer,” Deters, who declined an interview request for this article, said at the time. “He wasn’t dragging him.

Slager was charged with murder the same day that the footage was made public. He was also charged later with a federal civil rights violation.</p><p>Andrew Savage, Slager’s defense attorney, said that the video footage shocked him when he saw it before getting involved.</p><p>“The video was very, very scary from a defense viewpoint,” Savage said in an interview. “If that’s all there was, it was a pretty open-and-shut case.”</p><p>But Savage said there was more to it than that. He said the media had spread “a very false narrative” that depicted the case as a traffic stop ending with a shooting. What happened after the stop, Savage said, was a “200-yard foot chase [and] what we believed was a pretty substantial ground fight” before the shooting.</p><p>Slager testified that he tried to subdue Scott after the driver fled his car and that the two men had a physical struggle. He said that Scott had grabbed his Taser during the struggle and that he felt “total fear” when opening fire.</p><p>Anthony Scott, Walter Scott’s brother, said in an interview that there was no brutal fight, but that “jurors are more apt to believe the testimony of a police officer.” Jurors deadlocked in December 2016.</p><p>Savage said the video being seen so widely helped his client’s case. “When the public perception is the government has an absolutely airtight case, ironically that helps the defense,” Savage said. “Because jurors have expectations.”</p><p>Scarlett Wilson, who prosecuted Slager, agreed. “I worry that people might feel misled by the media’s coverage when the whole story is not told publicly,” Wilson said in written responses to questions. And that can include when “they don’t see the whole video broadcast and are surprised by what else is there.”</p><p>After the mistrial, Wilson vowed to prosecute Slager again. But he also faced the federal charge, which is unusual for a police shooting. After Slager pleaded guilty in that case, which also resolved the state charges, the federal judge sentenced him to 20 years.</p><img src=\"https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GP6WRAXDLII6VAWYLZK5I7UQZI.jpg\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\">Samuel DuBose's son, Aubrey DuBose, right, listens to James Scanlon as he testifies.

The chase began when Robert C. Rooker was clocked on radar going 52 mph in a 45 mph zone.</p><p>When Rooker’s Ford Ranger was pinned between a tree and Jenkins’s vehicle, the deputy opened fire, hitting the man seven times and killing him. No video footage exists of the incident.

They interviewed eyewitnesses who disputed the officer’s account and pointed to inconsistencies in Jenkins’s own shifting account of what happened that night.

(Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)</small></div><p>The White House mobilized rapidly in hopes of preventing the debate from becoming “a major election issue,” one senior official said. More than 10 current and former senior aides — including national security adviser Robert O’Brien and senior adviser Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law — vehemently denied <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/09/trump-americans-who-died-at-war-are-losers-and-suckers/615997/\">the Atlantic’s account</a> of the president’s trip to France in 2018.</p><p>The magazine, citing four anonymous sources, reported late Thursday that Trump had called off a trip to Aisne-Marne American Cemetery, resting site of American and other troops who died in World War I, because he did not want rain to mess up his hair and he believed it was not important to honor the fallen service members.</p><p>But Trump’s aides offered personal testimonies of the president’s concern for the well-being of troops during tactical military operations and his personal attention to wounded veterans during trips to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and Dover Air Force Base.</p><img src=\"https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ID2YAYXPAEI6VNF4HIQJR7DT2Q.jpg\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\">President Trump speaks during a news conference at the White House in Washington on Sept. 4.  (Chris Kleponis/Polaris/Bloomberg)</small></div><p>“It’s a hoax … just like Russia, Russia, Russia,” Trump said of the magazine’s account at a Friday news conference, comparing it to the special counsel’s investigation into his 2016 campaign’s contacts with Russian operatives. “There is nobody who feels more strongly about our soldiers, our wounded warriors, our soldiers that died in war, than I do.”</p><p>The issue has escalated quickly as Biden and his surrogates have sought to undermine a key pillar of Trump’s reelection message — his projection of toughness and patriotism. Trump has boasted of a deep well of mutual admiration and support from military troops and families, while attempting to paint Biden as weak and unable to stand up to foreign leaders. Biden’s campaign seized on the fallout of the Atlantic report to sketch the picture of a president who has a history of mistreating troops and veterans in service of his own political gain.</p><p>White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany disclosed an email from a military officer on the day Trump had been scheduled to visit Belleau Wood stating that bad weather had grounded Marine One, as Trump aides had stated at the time.</p><p>Aides said they elected not to have the president take a lengthy motorcade due to the challenging logistics, an account backed up by former national security adviser John Bolton in his recent memoir.</p><p>McEnany slammed the Atlantic’s reporting as “conspiracy-laden propaganda” peddled by “liberal activists” that was based on “four cowardly anonymous sources that probably do not even exist.”</p><p>Trump said the Secret Service is preparing a report documenting how the trip to the cemetery was canceled due to logistical complications.</p><p>“I said nope, ‘I want to go. I insist on going,’” Trump said he told Secret Service officials. “It would have taken us forever. The Paris police said, ‘Please, you can’t do this.’ They’d have to shut down parts of Paris. It was an impossible situation.”</p><p>Still, the White House found itself on defensive footing as more potentially damaging allegations emerged about Trump’s views of the military, including on Fox News, the cable network that Trump has relied on for favorable coverage. One Fox correspondent reported that Trump had told aides — while planning for an Independence Day celebration on the National Mall last year — that the inclusion of wounded veterans was “not a good look” and that “Americans don’t like that.”</p><p>One former senior administration official told The Washington Post that John F. Kelly, a retired Marine general who was serving as Trump’s chief of staff during the trip to France, grew frustrated on a regular basis with Trump’s lack of basic knowledge about the military and its operations.</p><p>A second former official said Trump would occasionally speak disparagingly of the military, angering Kelly and Jim Mattis, another retired general who served as defense secretary. That former official said Trump often praised top military officials and liked surrounding himself with commanders in uniforms. But the president also would complain that the military leaders were myopic and did not understand the business world he had come from, including the importance of profits and losses.</p><p>The president would occasionally say that people who served in Vietnam should have been smarter to avoid it, said the second former official.</p><p>“He would tire of all the great commendations that people who had fought and served got,” said the second official.</p><p>Both former officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive private conversations. Kelly declined to comment.</p><p>At the Friday news conference, Trump ripped into Kelly, deriding him as unable to meet the demands of his White House job. “He was a tough guy,” Trump said. “By the time he was done, he got eaten up. He was unable to function.”</p><p>White House aides reached out to former officials and others on the Belleau Wood trip to deny the story, one person familiar with the matter said, and aides are fearful that former military officials will continue to dribble out negative details until the election.</p><p>Trump on Friday also reversed a move by the Pentagon to kill funding for Stars and Stripes, the venerable military newspaper. “The president was already facing blowback from the military and it didn’t make sense to do this,” one senior administration official said.</p><p>O’Brien, who served as the State Department’s top hostage negotiator before taking over the National Security Council last year, said Trump showed acute sensitivity to the care for service members and their families. He said the president would ask if U.S. troops could be kept out of some military operations, and he cited Trump’s push to increase funding for the military as an example of his willingness to provide the Pentagon “every tool necessary.”</p><p>“I can’t believe a word of what’s in the Atlantic article,” O’Brien said, “because I’ve had 2½ years working side-by-side with the president. I’ve never seen anything like that.”</p><p>But Biden did not limit his criticism to Trump’s purported remarks in France. Rather, he laid out a litany of examples to build a case that the president’s professed admiration for the Armed Forces is based on political expediency.</p><p>Biden cited Trump’s disparagement of the late senator John McCain (R-Ariz.), who was held captive during the Vietnam War, as a “loser”; his description of concussion-like symptoms of U.S. troops in Iraq after a missile attack by Iran in January as “not very serious”; his decision not to confront Russian President Vladimir Putin over U.S. intelligence reports that Moscow had bribed Taliban forces to kill American troops; and the efforts by military leaders to <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/white-house-wanted-uss-john-mccain-out-of-sight-during-trump-japan-visit-11559173470\">drape a flag over the name</a> of the USS McCain battleship in Japan ahead of Trump’s trip there last year.</p><p>“I just think it is sick. It is deplorable — so un-American, so unpatriotic,” Biden said.</p><p>Biden’s campaign also arranged a conference call for reporters with Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) and Rep. Conor Lamb (D-Pa.), both military veterans, as well as Khizr Khan, the father of an American service member killed in the Iraq War in 2004, who has been critical of Trump.</p><p>“I’d take my wheelchair and titanium legs over Donald Trump’s supposed bone spurs any day,” said Duckworth, who lost both legs during a rocket attack by Iraqi insurgents in 2004. She was referring to <a href=\"https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2019/02/27/trumps-lawyer-no-basis-for-presidents-medical-deferment-from-vietnam/\">the medical diagnosis</a> that reportedly led to a young Trump gaining a medical deferment from service in Vietnam in 1968.</p><p>In districts across the country, Democratic congressional candidates seized on Trump’s comments and chided Republican opponents for refusing to stand up to the president. Nearly every Senate Democratic challenger — including many who served in the military — tweeted about the Atlantic report.</p><p>“As the mother of a son in the Army, this hit close to home — these reports are deeply alarming,” wrote Theresa Greenfield, who is challenging Sen. Joni Ernst (R) for her Iowa seat.</p><p>The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee issued a statement that “not a single Senate Republican has spoken out about Trump’s vile attacks against veterans and service members.”</p><p>Sen. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.), who was appointed to McCain’s seat after he died in 2018 and faces a challenging race, came closest — praising McCain without explicitly mentioning Trump.</p><p>“Senator McSally has no interest in moderating a fight between The Atlantic and the president over anonymously sourced accusations that have been debunked on the record,” a campaign spokeswoman said.</p><p><i>Michael Scherer in Washington and Annie Linskey in Wilmington, Del., contributed to this report.</i></p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Sat, 05 Sep 2020 01:20:26 +0000","feedId":9034,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"275843128a30d4d55de950a34966e667","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://tabletimages.washingtonpost.com/production/content/c12c0fe6-eebe-11ea-99a1-71343d03bc29_published_1599265000966_c3fc9/image/9cb56593-166b-46aa-8084-c73d5a9f8d4c_p.jpeg?ts=1599265001124":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn51@2020_3/2020/09/05/07-56-22-579_6f29015dfc312295.webp","https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BV4W6VXPAUI6VGNBOE2D2A54FE.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn72@2020_1/2020/09/05/07-56-22-411_3f1a11cd8bb04c1f.webp","https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ID2YAYXPAEI6VNF4HIQJR7DT2Q.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn16@2020_6/2020/09/05/07-56-24-018_1e1f10ca03d81430.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599292581394},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 15:56:21","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 15:56:21","title":"Trump’s alleged comments about ‘losers’ buried in military cemeteries leaves military leaders off balance","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/trump-atlantic-military-reaction/2020/09/04/b0fe0690-eec0-11ea-a21a-0fbbe90cfd8c_story.html","description":"<img src=\"http://tabletimages.washingtonpost.com/production/content/b0fe0690-eec0-11ea-a21a-0fbbe90cfd8c_published_1599263394798_8f6cd/image/6e5ed07f-8b5c-4ddc-9a42-b1c5a7c9fc62_p.jpeg?ts=1599263394897\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\"></small></div><div><i>By Dan Lamothe and Missy Ryan</i><br><i>2020.09.05 07:19</i></div><p>Senior and former military leaders appeared to struggle Friday with how to respond to a report that President Trump disparaged U.S. service members killed in combat as “losers,” as the president attacked the allegations as “fake news.”</p><p>The article elicited an array of reactions amid Trump’s history with the military, which includes mocking Sen.

What was in it for them?” while standing with retired Marine Gen. John F. Kelly at the grave of Kelly’s son, Robert, who was killed in Afghanistan. At the time, Kelly was homeland security secretary.</p><p>In the second, the Trump administration canceled the visit to the cemetery in France in bad weather when helicopter travel was questionable and Trump seemingly dismissed the World War I veterans who are buried there.</p><p>“Why should I go to that cemetery?” Trump said, according to the report. “It’s filled with losers.”</p><p>The president vehemently denied the report, attacking the Atlantic as a “third-rate magazine” and criticizing Kelly for not doing a good job as his former chief of staff.</p><p>“This man was totally exhausted. He wasn’t even able to function in the last number of months,” Trump said. He added that he did not know whether Kelly served as a source for the Atlantic’s story, “but it could have been a guy like a John Kelly.”</p><p>Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper defended the president’s work with the military, veterans and their families.</p><p>“President Trump has the highest respect and admiration for our nation’s military members, veterans and families. That is why he has fought for greater pay and more funding for our armed forces,” Esper said in a statement, which did not specifically address the inflammatory comments attributed to Trump.</p><p>A senior defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, said Esper had not heard about the comments attributed to Trump until the Atlantic’s story was published.</p><p>Retired Navy Adm. Jim Stavridis, sharing the Atlantic article on Twitter, described the military’s cemeteries as “sacred shrines to those who have given everything” and suggested that the lack of denials by Kelly and retired Marine Gen. Jim Mattis, Trump’s former defense secretary, were notable.<br /></p><p>“The phrase: ‘shocking if true’ is getting worn out,” Stavridis tweeted. “Lack of denial from my friends Generals Kelly and Mattis suggest the shock is well placed.”</p><p>Stavridis added in an email to The Washington Post that he hopes Kelly and Mattis, “if they do have firsthand knowledge of such quotes, will step up and affirm or deny the story.”</p><p>Mattis and Kelly did not respond to requests for comment Friday. Other retired Marine generals who have worked with them, including Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr. and Gen. John R. Allen, declined to comment.</p><p>Another retired officer, Army Gen. Tony Thomas, criticized former CIA director John Brennan for tweeting that an unnamed four-star general who worked for Trump had called the president “the most loathsome individual” he had ever met.</p><p>“JOB, my former boss, how is this helpful?” Thomas said on Twitter. “Another unnamed General (did he ask you to speak for him)? Actually hurts our profession to have unattributed allegations like this flying around and only serves to stoke both extremes.”</p><p>Another retired Marine said in an interview that Kelly had shared a similar story about Trump’s Memorial Day comments with him after they met by chance at Arlington National Cemetery on a later date. He spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing his current work with the government.</p><p>Kelly’s son, 1st Lt. Robert Kelly, was among three service members who were memorialized by Trump in the ceremony on Memorial Day in 2017.</p><p>The father of one of the others, Spec. Christopher D. Horton, said Friday that Trump greeted his family warmly at Arlington National Cemetery that day and that the comments attributed to the president in the Atlantic did not match his experience.</p><p>“He wanted to know if we wanted some photos, and we said yes,” said the fallen soldier’s father, David. “He said very complimentary things to us like, ‘Your son was a winner. You are all winners,’ which is kind of the way he speaks. I left there feeling very honored and very esteemed.”</p><p>Christopher Horton’s widow, Jane, works in the Pentagon on issues pertaining to the families of deceased service members, first during the Obama administration and now as a Trump appointee.</p><p>Retired Gen. Robert B. Neller, the former commandant of the Marine Corps, said in an email that he had no knowledge of any of the comments attributed to Trump. But he highlighted the sacrifices U.S. troops made during World War I and said France was the first real U.S. ally and “we should not forget that.”</p><p>America has a role and requirement, Neller wrote, to properly recognize the service of its veterans, take care of those who are wounded, and remember those who do not return from combat.</p><p>“I believe we as a Nation do that well,” Neller wrote. “In France, on numerous occasions I have had French citizens thank me for the efforts of Americans in both wars to defend and liberate France. I believe our actions as a Nation were a good and proper thing . . . though the cost was high.”</p><p>The muted reaction from retired officers comes after <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2020/06/03/jim-mattis-blasts-trump-message-that-defends-protesters-says-president-tries-divide-us/\">Mattis lashed out at Trump</a> in an essay in June, accusing the president of trying to divide Americans and taking exception to his interest in using active-duty military forces against U.S. citizens protesting after the police killing of George Floyd.</p><p>“Donald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people — does not even pretend to try,” Mattis wrote. “Instead, he tries to divide us.”</p><p>Mattis’s rebuke was described by some critics as too little, too late, in response to the president, and as an affront by others. John Dowd, a Marine veteran who served as Trump’s lawyer, accused Mattis of being used by politicians and not being able to kill the Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, who died in a drone strike approved by Trump in January.</p><p>“Perhaps, your anger is borne of embarrassment for your own failure as the leader of Central Command,” Dowd wrote in a message that was posted by Trump on Twitter.</p><p>Peter Feaver, a scholar on civil-military relations at Duke University, said that retired senior military leaders were unlikely to speak out now. While Mattis and others took the unusual step of criticizing the president in June, their remarks came after Trump expressed a desire to use the military against civilians and current Pentagon leaders were photographed with him after protesters were cleared with force, he said.</p><p>The current situation is different, Feaver said, because even though the reported comments would be seen as offensive, former leaders would probably prioritize abiding by norms keeping them out of political brawls, especially this close to an election.</p><p>“There’s not a misuse of the military that’s at stake here,” he said.</p><p>The same is even more true for serving military leaders, who are obligated to follow any legal order. Still, Feaver added, the comments could undermine confidence in the commander in chief among service members, who vow to risk their lives in response to orders by national leaders.</p><p>“It is good for the civil-military relationship when the military trusts that the president has their back, that he understands the sacrifice they’re making, and is not cavalier about their death,” Feaver said.</p><p>The reactions to the report stretched to military nonprofit organizations, which were forced to consider how to respond to reported comments that were offensive without clarity on their accuracy.</p><p>The president of the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors (TAPS), a nonpartisan nonprofit organization founded to help families of deceased service members, raised the Atlantic story with the group’s board members Friday, according to an internal email obtained by The Post.</p><p>Bonnie Carroll, who founded TAPS after her husband was killed in a military plane crash, said in the email that TAPS “is standing strong today with our surviving families, and reminding them that America has steadfastly, historically honored those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom.”</p><p>Carroll added that TAPS has reaffirmed to families that it is there for them, and that it would comfort them “on this difficult day and rally around them with care.” The organization confirmed the authenticity of the email.</p><p>TAPS ultimately published a graphic on Twitter stating that Americans have “steadfastly honored those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom,” and that fellow Americans have “draped their caskets with our nation’s flag, and laid them to rest in the hallowed grounds of our national cemeteries.” The group planned to send an email to tens of thousands of members Friday night.</p><p>Brian McGough, a former soldier who was severely wounded when an improvised explosive device exploded near his vehicle in Iraq in 2003, said Trump’s alleged remarks were shocking but not surprising, given his previous public comments.</p><p>McGough said that he wanted military leaders to speak out in support of troops, but that “you don’t get to be a four-star or a general on the Joint Chiefs by speaking out. They’re playing the long game.”</p><p>McGough’s wife, Army veteran Kayla Williams, said she was “appalled” by the report.</p><p>Williams, who now volunteers for a veterans group supporting Joe Biden for president, said fellow veterans, including some who continue to serve as reservists, told her they were shocked by the alleged remarks.</p><p>She said that for her and those fellow veterans the report appeared to show that Trump “does not have any emotional comprehension of the risks they’re willing to make for our country.”</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Sat, 05 Sep 2020 00:21:23 +0000","feedId":9034,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"077ee06535428ed1ffba5fadadf7350d","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://tabletimages.washingtonpost.com/production/content/b0fe0690-eec0-11ea-a21a-0fbbe90cfd8c_published_1599263394798_8f6cd/image/6e5ed07f-8b5c-4ddc-9a42-b1c5a7c9fc62_p.jpeg?ts=1599263394897":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn32@2020_3/2020/09/05/07-56-22-372_119f9e1f705c3f36.webp","https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CG24M7CEUAI6PDPBZ3CZVG7UWE.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn39@2020_2/2020/09/05/07-56-26-191_2a83dd3c4eab075c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599292581394},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 15:56:21","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 15:56:21","title":"Pandemic-fueled illegal gold rush threatens to destroy the Amazon forever","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/in-the-amazon-the-coronavirus-fuels-an-illegal-gold-rush--and-an-environmental-crisis/2020/09/03/0a4c62e6-e624-11ea-970a-64c73a1c2392_story.html","description":"<img src=\"http://tabletimages.washingtonpost.com/production/content/0a4c62e6-e624-11ea-970a-64c73a1c2392_published_1599271175282_757aa/image/d86c7a61-d5eb-4404-8f8d-737918d1abbf_p.jpeg?ts=1599271175398\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\"></small></div><div><i>By Terrence McCoy and Heloísa Traiano</i><br><i>2020.09.04 18:00</i></div><p>RIO DE JANEIRO — Alessandro Souza is a gold hunter. He chases it deep into protected Indigenous lands in the Amazon rainforest, traveling days by foot and canoe, and doesn't emerge until his pockets are full. Sometimes he's gone two months. Sometimes six. The only certainty is that he'll be back, because hunting gold is his business, and business is booming.</p><p>“Today’s market quote,” Souza messaged his WhatsApp group, Goldminers Without Borders, one recent day: Gold was going for nearly $1,800 an ounce.

(Lucas Landau)</small></div><p>Driven by the skyrocketing gold prices, surging unemployment and lax enforcement by a distracted government, people are traveling from all over the country to hundreds of illegal mining sites, invading protected Indigenous lands, stripping swaths of forest bare, poisoning rivers with mercury and laundering illegal gold through mineral shops. And they’re largely getting away with it.</p><p>Much of the activity is concentrated in the vast and underpoliced state of Pará, where Souza lives in the remote mining hub of Itaituba, and where gold exports have risen sharply this year. As Brazil shifted its attention to the pandemic, exports have more than quadrupled, rising to $245 million during the first six months of this year. Deforestation associated with mining on Indigenous lands, where such activity is illegal, has reached record highs.</p><p>In interviews, law enforcement officials, Indigenous leaders, federal inspectors and even gold miners say the administration of President Jair Bolsonaro has neglected its responsibility as steward of the Amazon. At a time when scientists say the forest is being dangerously destabilized by deforestation, Bolsonaro has pushed to scale back enforcement and legalize mining on Indigenous land.</p><p>Bolsonaro, a former army captain, has deputized the military to crack down on environmental destruction, but it has been ineffective. The government’s chief environmental enforcement agency, Ibama, has been constrained by budget cuts, unfilled vacancies and Bolsonaro’s criticism. It has scaled back the destruction of mining equipment found at illegal gold digs — a tactic advocates say is a key deterrent — and reduced operations to curb criminality in the Amazon.</p><img src=\"https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UKGG2KXNGII6VGNBOE2D2A54FE.jpg\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\">Gold is weighed at a shop in Itaituba. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)</small></div><p>“This moment is different,” said Sérgio Leitão, the executive director of the Choices Institute, an environmental organization tracking gold mining during the pandemic.</p><p>“The valuation of gold, the amount of manual labor that will work for almost nothing, the reduction in enforcement, and a government that is supporting the legalization of more gold mining. This is a perfect storm.”</p><p>Bolsonaro’s office did not respond to requests for comment. Environment Minister Ricardo Salles initially agreed to be interviewed by The Washington Post, but then canceled. The Defense Ministry defended the government’s response.</p><p>“The country is unjustly accused of not taking care of the region,” the ministry said in a statement. It cited its recent enforcement operations and stressed the complexities in patrolling a forest “of continental proportions.”</p><p>Few know better than Souza. He has scoured for gold all over the Amazon, unlicensed and on protected land. Poverty and bureaucracy, he said, has left him without a choice: “We don’t have other options.”</p><p>So he does his best to avoid getting caught. This next dig would be so deep into Indigenous forest — six days by canoe and foot — that he didn’t expect to run into anyone else. Just forest and gold.</p><img src=\"https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/K732JXHNGII6VGNBOE2D2A54FE.jpg\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\">Miners search for gold in the Itaituba region. (Lucas Dumphreys/AP)</small></div><p>‘The rivers are never the same’</p><p>Illegal gold mining accounts for only a small fraction of deforestation in the Amazon — far less than agricultural practices — but its effect is more insidious. Mercury is an essential tool in the process, used to collect and purify gold traces found in the soil. Its toxicity seeps into the soil, air and water. Maritime ecologies have collapsed. Indigenous communities have been poisoned. Years after mining, the earth remains barren and lifeless.</p><p>“It ends up killing nature,” said Marilene Nascimento, a cook at illegal gold mining sites outside of Itaituba. “The rivers aren’t the same. The fish die. For years and years, they don’t come back to normal.”</p><p>After years working on digs, Nascimento has grown ambivalent about her work. She can’t forget the environmental devastation she has seen, and last year she swore she wouldn’t go back. But then the pandemic hit, other work opportunities dried up, and a friend was calling, asking if she wanted to make some good money. Nascimento would get 30 grams of gold for one month of working as a mining cook.</p><p>She did a quick calculation using that day’s gold prices, and was stunned. She’d make more than $1,200. Far more than last year. And 10 times more than she could earn in the city.</p><p>“It’s hard to see nature being destroyed,” Nascimento said. “But you make so much money.”</p><img src=\"https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NO7VLUXNGII6VGNBOE2D2A54FE.jpg\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\">Gold sits in a pan after being burned to eliminate any mercury in the Itaituba area. (Lucas Dumphreys/AP)</small></div><p>The forest has long been a safety net for Brazilians. During the economic downturn in the 1980s, as many as 100,000 people descended on the mine known as Serra Pelada. Another wave followed during the global financial crisis in 2009. And again in 2013. The gold miner became a Brazilian archetype: He wandered into the forest with little more than a hammock and hope.</p><p>But that’s not today’s miner. In the last decade, the enterprise has been industrialized and professionalized. Well-financed networks equip miners with expensive, heavy construction equipment like bulldozers and construction trucks. Remote digs have WiFi, cable television and gas stoves. Even some Indigenous people, lured by the technology, have taken it up.</p><p>Bolsonaro, who was elected in 2018, has promised to expand mining even further. The son of a Serra Pelada miner, he says they aren’t criminals, but workers struggling to survive. He has welcomed them into meetings and criticized Ibama for destroying their equipment. Last year the agency burned only 72 heavy mining machines — around a third of <b></b>the number destroyed in 2015. Officials who oversaw one operation were fired. The military canceled another, blocking Ibama from using its helicopters.</p><p>Senior Ibama inspectors, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal, said Bolsonaro’s rhetoric and policies have emboldened gold miners and made their own work all but impossible. When investigators are allowed to go out, they say, illegal miners mock them. They say nothing will stop them. That the gold is coming out of the forest, one way or another. That Bolsonaro is on their side.</p><p>“We’re getting so much political pressure,” one of the officials said. “It’s practically impossible to head out into the field. We’re being assailed constantly. . . . People aren’t being punished.”</p><img src=\"https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SW2WSCHNGII6VGNBOE2D2A54FE.jpg\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\">A miner weighs his gold. (Lucas Dumphreys/AP)</small></div><p>Miners find a champion in Bolsonaro</p><p>That’s common knowledge in Itaituba, a mining town of 100,000 residents deep in the Amazon, where gold is so omnipresent that it’s used as currency. Businesses along Rua do Ouro — “Gold Street” — buy illegally mined gold, authorities say, then launder it into export markets. The mayor, a miner himself, recently erected a monument to gold mining. Local journalists don’t even pretend to be objective.</p><p>“More than 70 percent of the mining is illegal,” said Mauro Torres, the editor of a <a href=\"https://portalmaurotorres.com.br/\">local news site</a>. “But I’m on the side of the gold miner.”</p><p>Miners congregate by the thousands on publicly accessible WhatsApp groups and Facebook pages and, without apparent fear of authorities, openly discuss illegal mines, gold, prostitutes and their fealty to the president.</p><p>“With every video of Bolsonaro, I’m more proud of my vote,” reads a typical tribute.</p><p>Many miners see Bolsonaro as their champion. He has defended them from environmentalists, nongovernment organizations, Indigenous advocates, pressure from foreign leaders and the government itself.</p><p>For years, they say, Brazilian authorities encouraged mining in the forest. The right to mine is enshrined in the constitution. But then the government made registration so arduous, and protected so much territory, miners say, that honest workers were made into environmental criminals.</p><img src=\"https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UMHEKFXNGII6VGNBOE2D2A54FE.jpg\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\">A worker melts gold at a shop in Itaituba. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)</small></div><p>In Bolsonaro, they say, they finally have a president who sees it as they do. Gold mining is a lifeline. And that has never been so clear as during the pandemic, when it has buffered them from the economic fallout.</p><p>“There’s no poverty in Itaituba,” said José Antunes, a prominent local lawyer who represents miners. “There never was. People come here to escape poverty.”</p><p>That was the hope of Ronaldo dos Santos, 30, who traveled 1,000 miles from Lago das Pedras, in the state of Maranhão, to reach the gold mines of Itaituba. It was either that, he said, or watch his four children go hungry in Brazil’s poorest state. Now he says he could make thousands of dollars per month, mining gold by day, sleeping in a forest hammock by night.</p><p>He doesn’t worry much — not about environmental damage, the law or invading Indigenous land. In fact, he said, mining there is better. “Indigenous land is where you get the good gold,” dos Santos said. “Easier to find.”</p><p>That was where Souza was heading. He wasn’t looking forward to it. He hated being away from his children and wife for months. But he said he had little choice.</p><p>“If I stayed in the city to try to find work, I wouldn’t be able to put my kids through school,” he said. “There’s no work.”</p><p>He wished he could tell his family how long he’d be away.</p><p>“The miner knows that he is leaving,” Souza said. “He doesn’t know when he’ll return.”</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Sat, 05 Sep 2020 03:20:26 +0000","feedId":9034,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"33081083d74f6a8a3fb8b056ee54d904","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://tabletimages.washingtonpost.com/production/content/0a4c62e6-e624-11ea-970a-64c73a1c2392_published_1599271175282_757aa/image/d86c7a61-d5eb-4404-8f8d-737918d1abbf_p.jpeg?ts=1599271175398":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn91@2020_6/2020/09/05/07-56-22-747_8469f745c8e5fc39.webp","http://tabletimages.washingtonpost.com/production/content/0a4c62e6-e624-11ea-970a-64c73a1c2392_published_1599271175423_cec9b/image/a3c50e09-26d9-4907-9af5-582a4dfd2809_p.jpeg?ts=1599271175549":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn62@2020_1/2020/09/05/07-56-24-952_463009f9838e800f.webp","https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UKGG2KXNGII6VGNBOE2D2A54FE.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn82@2020_5/2020/09/05/07-56-23-217_c81899747d16c0f1.webp","https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/K732JXHNGII6VGNBOE2D2A54FE.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn19@2020_3/2020/09/05/07-56-23-079_0c2652cd32f03ada.webp","https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NO7VLUXNGII6VGNBOE2D2A54FE.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn95@2020_1/2020/09/05/07-56-24-990_d4b2db300f6d6009.webp","https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SW2WSCHNGII6VGNBOE2D2A54FE.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn5@2020_1/2020/09/05/07-56-26-906_7fcc8777e8a91f8a.webp","https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UMHEKFXNGII6VGNBOE2D2A54FE.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn31@2020_4/2020/09/05/07-56-24-770_f844dd7c11a95dd2.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599292581394},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 15:56:21","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 15:56:21","title":"Listen: The U.S. is deporting Nicaraguan asylum seekers","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/tablet/2020/09/04/us-is-deporting-nicaraguan-asylum-seekers/","description":"<img src=\"http://tabletimages.washingtonpost.com/production/content/dc132f7972b8bd7dd25ce8bb49f9b980_published_1599251064131_8c396/image/17e7c7d4-3c34-4e5e-b510-0c406d9d36ad_p.jpeg?ts=1599251064624\" width=\"100%\"><div><small style=\"color: #999;\"></small></div><div><i>By Martine Powers</i><br><i>2020.09.05 04:15</i></div><p><i>Post Reports is the daily podcast from The Washington Post.
