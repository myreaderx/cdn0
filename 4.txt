Niantic <a href=\"https://pokemongolive.com/en/post/pokemongofest2020-recap/\">says</a> “a record number of millions of trainers” took part from 124 countries and regions around the world, catching nearly a billion pokémon in total.</p>\n<p id=\"jQafqg\">The event involved new quest lines on each day, culminating in players battling Team Rocket leaders and catching Victini, a mythical pokémon that was made available in the game for the first time. Other features of the fest included new shiny pokémon and regional pokémon appearing outside their typical habitats, although not as many as might normally be found...</p>\n  <p>\n    <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21344717/pokemon-go-fest-2020-stats-numbers-niantic\">Continue reading&hellip;</a>\n  </p>\n\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 06:00:28 +0000","feedId":4,"bgimg":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DK4uCpDKP98ThDQmwbZOfhuYJZk=/128x0:896x512/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67119378/pokemongofest2020_recap.0.png","linkMd5":"43cf6a1eefb283d73858f551eabf2559","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn35@2020_6/2020-07-28/1595924367495_add186d814ae01b6.webp","author":"Sam Byford","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DK4uCpDKP98ThDQmwbZOfhuYJZk=/128x0:896x512/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67119378/pokemongofest2020_recap.0.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn35@2020_6/2020-07-28/1595924367495_add186d814ae01b6.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-07-28 16:18:58","updatedTime":"2020-07-28 08:18:58","title":"Logitech’s new Pro X Lightspeed is its latest gaming headset to go wireless","link":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21340342/logitech-g-pro-x-lightspeed-gaming-headset-wireless-pc","description":"  \n    <img alt=\"Logitech G Pro X Lightspeed\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_buARXeeJ1HAXI9AdAq9Z2eCDKI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67119428/proxlightspeed.0.jpg\" />\n\n  <small>Image: Logitech</small>\n\n  <p id=\"vWYIG2\">Logitech has announced a wireless version of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/9/20686749/logitech-g-pro-wired-headset-announcement-pricing-release-date-features\">its 2019 Pro X gaming headset</a> called the <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200728005049/en/Logitech-Launches-PRO-Wireless-Gaming-Headset/?feedref=JjAwJuNHiystnCoBq_hl-Q-tiwWZwkcswR1UZtV7eGe24xL9TZOyQUMS3J72mJlQ7fxFuNFTHSunhvli30RlBNXya2izy9YOgHlBiZQk2LOzmn6JePCpHPCiYGaEx4DL1Rq8pNwkf3AarimpDzQGuQ==\">Pro X Lightspeed</a>. It’s almost identical to the wired version, complete with the same aluminum and steel design, but there are a few key differences. Going wireless isn’t even the biggest perk; it’s actually the USB-C charging. No other wireless gaming headsets that charge via USB-C come to mind, so in this regard, the Pro X Lightspeed in a league of its own. </p>\n<p id=\"i4YzPL\">The other perk, of course, is being wireless. The audio and chat are delivered through its included 2.4GHz USB Type-A wireless receiver, and Logitech claims the headset can remain connected up to 13 meters away — if, for some reason, you find yourself 42 feet away from your PC or gaming console.</p>\n<p id=\"gOMMUE\">L...</p>\n  <p>\n    <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21340342/logitech-g-pro-x-lightspeed-gaming-headset-wireless-pc\">Continue reading&hellip;</a>\n  </p>\n\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 07:14:12 +0000","feedId":4,"bgimg":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_buARXeeJ1HAXI9AdAq9Z2eCDKI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67119428/proxlightspeed.0.jpg","linkMd5":"06e7e3f405d1c60f655005d8175151f1","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn39@2020_5/2020-07-28/1595924338688_c21cabcff9fcb211.webp","author":"Cameron Faulkner","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_buARXeeJ1HAXI9AdAq9Z2eCDKI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67119428/proxlightspeed.0.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn39@2020_5/2020-07-28/1595924338688_c21cabcff9fcb211.webp"}}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-07-28 16:18:58","updatedTime":"2020-07-28 08:18:58","feedId":4,"fetchDate":"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 08:18:58 +0000","fetchMs":155,"handleMs":130,"totalMs":31211,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":9,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"172.16.193.178","hostName":"a88922aa-8c14-422a-a9be-ce730d3e5a4d","requestId":"a05cfbe0cd0341f2bf91766ac50818c0_4","bgimgsTotal":2,"bgimgsGithubTotal":2,"articlesImgsTotal":2,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":2},"extra4":{"start":1595924338148,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":188,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":130,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":0,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"},{"spend":1,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"}]},"extra5":2,"extra6":2}
