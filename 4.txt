The move by The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), publisher of the esteemed <em>Science</em> journals, comes after <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21286924/science-racism-strike-stem-black-lives-matter-protests\">Black scientists came forward</a> to protest racism within academia and the sciences, and organized a strike on June 10th, that AAAS joined. In a letter to its 120,000 members this month, AAAS CEO Sudip Parikh announced that the 172-year-old institution has come up with a plan to hold itself accountable for making itself and the sciences more diverse. By September, it will start sharing data on the diversity of its staff, fellows, and authors published in its journals. </p>\n<div id=\"tZ2BHJ\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">On Wednesday, June 10, AAAS and Science will...</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n  <p>\n    <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21337391/aaas-science-society-journal-systemic-racism-data\">Continue reading&hellip;</a>\n  </p>\n\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 24 Jul 2020 18:21:36 +0000","feedId":4,"bgimg":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kfi9fTu3bNiMjllRDX5Gp-7_2NU=/204x0:4202x2665/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67104471/876658842.jpg.0.jpg","linkMd5":"3d7ae0eed5f33bcdbd679a1a52e2425d","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kfi9fTu3bNiMjllRDX5Gp-7_2NU=/204x0:4202x2665/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67104471/876658842.jpg.0.jpg":null}},{"createdTime":"2020-07-25 07:31:32","updatedTime":"2020-07-24 23:31:32","title":"Some Nest thermostats can no longer connect to the internet, so Google is replacing them","link":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/24/21337669/google-nest-thermostat-w5-wifi-issue-remote-control-disable-replacement","description":"  \n    <img alt=\"Nest E smart thermostat on wall with paisley wallpaper\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mOTz6qOfNUoCv_Qq2k-QFE_UBzI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67105465/jkastrenakes_08242017_1960_0019.0.jpg\" />\n\n  <small>Photo by Jake Kastrenakes / The Verge</small>\n\n  <p id=\"GvjlEJ\">Some users of Nest thermostats can no longer control the devices remotely, and the issue is forcing Google to replace the devices entirely if otherwise standard troubleshooting fails.
