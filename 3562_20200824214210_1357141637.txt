We see these changes reflected in how people are searching on Google. Last month, there were spikes in search interest for household supplies and jigsaw puzzles as people spent more time at home. This month we’ve seen surging interest for sewing machines and baking materials in the U.S., and tetherball sets and chalk in the United Kingdom and Australia. </p><p>Businesses are using a variety of resources to understand changing consumer interests—including Google Trends, social listening, surveys, and their own data—in order to help make decisions on the fly. But if they don’t know what to look for, there isn’t an easy way to understand which product categories are gaining in popularity, and might pose an opportunity.</p><p>That’s why we’re launching a <a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/feature/category-trends?utm_source=googleblog&amp;utm_medium=blog\">rising retail categories tool</a> on Think with Google. It surfaces fast-growing, product-related categories in Google Search, the locations where they’re growing, and the queries associated with them.

Here were some of their ideas for how it could help:<br/></p><ul><li><b>Content creation:</b> A cookware company noticed that “flour” was a growing category in the United States. The team was inspired to explore partnering with a famous local chef to create engaging content about recipes that incorporate flour. </li><li><p><b>Promotion:</b> A jewelry and accessories company noted rising interest in products in the “free weights” category, so the team thought they might partner with fitness influencers who could help promote their products. Similarly, an online business said it would regularly reference the data to inform which products to feature on its homepage throughout the pandemic. </p></li><li><p><b>Product ideas</b>: An apparel company with a fast and flexible production model said its team would use this data to inspire new product line ideas.</p></li></ul><p>For the next few months, we’ll update the tool with fresh data every day and hope this will help businesses of all sizes find new pockets of consumer interest.

Things like social distancing, curbside pickup, and at-home workouts are now commonplace. The necessary measures taken to manage the pandemic have not only disrupted the global economy, but have also altered consumers’ interests, expectations, and purchasing behavior. These shifts are constant and they’re happening rapidly—and we want to help you navigate them. Today, we’ll share five key trends we’re seeing and provide helpful resources for adjusting your media strategy.</p><p><br/></p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>What’s changing with consumers?</h3><p>As of this week, there are over four billion people staying home worldwide. And while we don’t know how or when this crisis will resolve, we do have <a href=\"http://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/2020_covidadsplaybook_en-us_may5.pdf\">new insight</a> into how people’s needs and behaviors are changing:<br/><br/></p><p><b>People are using multiple devices to go online at unprecedented levels.</b></p><p>Connecting with the world online is more important than ever right now, with at-home media consumption increasing dramatically and influencing all aspects of life.</p><ul><li><p>In the U.S., staying home has led to a 60 percent increase in the amount of content watched. Americans are watching roughly 12 hours of media content a day, according to Nielsen data.</p></li><li><p>Consumers across the globe are spending 20 percent more time in apps and games than they did a year ago and app usage in China grew to five hours/day on average (+30 percent year over year), according to App Annie.</p></li></ul><p><b><br/>People are turning to Google for important information and content to meet their essential needs.</b><br/></p><p>With businesses adapting to delivery or online models, people are looking for clear, specific information about where, how, and when they can get what they need.</p><ul><li>According to internal data, searches for “food delivery services” have grown globally by more than 300 percent year over year.</li><li>Americans are watching videos related to recipes and cooking at a rate 31 percent higher than they did the same time last year.</li><li>According to internal data, searches for “online pharmacy” have grown globally by more than 100 percent year over year.</li></ul><p><b><br/>People are discovering new connections and nurturing relationships (virtually).</b><br/></p><p>Even as people physically distance themselves, they’re using technology in new ways to connect with each other.</p><ul><li><p>50 percent of U.S. consumers said they have used video to communicate with family and friends. In fact, as of April, <a href=\"https://apps.google.com/meet/?utm_source=xsell&amp;utm_medium=et&amp;utm_campaign=FY20-Q2-googlemeet-ads-051820blog_meetstat&amp;utm_content=ads_051820_blogpost_stat\">Google Meet</a> is hosting 3 billion minutes of video meetings and adding nearly 3 million new users every day.</p></li><li><p>On YouTube, we’ve seen a rise in “with me” videos, where people film themselves going about ordinary tasks like cleaning and cooking. In the US, views of videos containing “study with me” in the title are 54 percent higher compared to the same period last year.</p></li></ul><p><b><br/>People are adjusting routines to be at-home-first.</b><br/></p><p>As daily routines and schedules adjust to new realities, so have online and at-home habits.</p><ul><li>Search interest for “telecommuting” in the U.S. reached an all-time high on Google and YouTube in mid-March, and continues to grow with no sign of slowing down.</li><li>Workout routines have changed. There’s growing search interest for “stationary bicycle” worldwide since the beginning of the year, especially in Spain and France, and “dumbbell set” in the UK.<br/></li></ul><p><b><br/>People are practicing self-care more. </b><br/></p><p>People are focused on taking care of their own physical and psychological needs, in addition to those of friends and loved ones.</p><ul><li><p>People are turning to online video for help in coping with anxiety and stress. So far in the U.S. this year, views of meditation-related videos are 51 percent higher than the same period in 2019.</p></li><li><p>Parents and students are turning to YouTube to adapt to school closures and at-home education. According to YouTube data, average daily views of videos with “homeschool” or “home school” in the title have increased more than 120 percent globally since March 2020.</p></li><li><p>People are searching for things to do when they’re bored. Searches for “bored” spiked significantly in March, and search interest for “games,” “puzzles,” and “coloring books” have increased since the beginning of the year.</p></li></ul><p><br/>As consumer behavior continues to change, consumer demand will continue to rise and fall. Earlier this month, we introduced the <a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/feature/category-trends/us/month?utm_source=googleblog&amp;utm_medium=blog\">rising retail categories tool</a> on Think with Google to help you gain insight into what consumers are shopping for right now.

This commitment is especially important in times of uncertainty, such as the past few months as the world has confronted COVID-19. </p><p><br/></p><h3>Responding to COVID-19</h3><p>Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, we’ve closely monitored advertiser behavior to protect users from ads looking to take advantage of the crisis. These often come from sophisticated actors attempting to evade our enforcement systems with advanced tactics. For example, as the situation evolved, we saw a sharp spike in fraudulent ads for in-demand products like face masks. These ads promoted products listed significantly above market price, misrepresented the product quality to trick people into making a purchase or were placed by merchants who never fulfilled the orders. </p><p>We have a dedicated COVID-19 task force that’s been working around the clock. They have built new detection technology and have also improved our existing enforcement systems to stop bad actors. These concerted efforts are working. We’ve blocked and removed tens of millions of coronavirus-related ads over the past few months for policy violations including price-gouging, capitalizing on global medical supply shortages, making misleading claims about cures and promoting illegitimate unemployment benefits. <br/></p><p>Simultaneously, the coronavirus has become an important and enduring topic in everyday conversation and we’re working on ways to allow advertisers across industries to share relevant updates with their audiences. Over the past several weeks, for example, we’ve specifically helped NGOs, governments, hospitals and healthcare providers run PSAs. We continue to take a measured approach to adjusting our enforcement to ensure that we are protecting users while prioritizing critical information from trusted advertisers.</p><p><br/></p><h3>Preserving the integrity of the ecosystem</h3><p>Preserving the integrity of the ads on our platforms, as we’re doing during the COVID-19 outbreak, is a continuation of the work we do every day to minimize content that violates our policies and stop malicious actors. We have thousands of people working across our teams to make sure we’re protecting our users and enabling a safe ecosystem for advertisers and publishers, and each year we share a summary of the work we’ve done.</p><p>In 2019, we blocked and removed 2.7 billion bad ads—that’s more than 5,000 bad ads per minute. We also suspended nearly 1 million advertiser accounts for policy violations. On the publisher side, we terminated over 1.2 million accounts and removed ads from over 21 million web pages that are part of our publisher network for violating our policies. Terminating accounts—not just removing an individual ad or page—is an especially effective enforcement tool that we use if advertisers or publishers engage in egregious policy violations or have a history of violating policy.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"2.7 billion taken down.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Bad_Ads_Hero_.gif\"/></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Improving enforcement against phishing and \"trick-to-click\" ads </h3><p>If we find specific categories of ads are more prone to abuse, we prioritize our resources to prevent bad actors from taking advantage of users. One of the areas that we’ve become familiar with is phishing, a common practice used by deceptive players to collect personal information from users under false pretenses. For example, in 2019 we saw more bad actors targeting people seeking to renew their passport. These ads mimicked real ads for renewal sites but their actual intent was to get users to provide sensitive information such as their social security or credit card number. Another common area of abuse is “trick-to-click” ads—which are designed to trick people into interacting with them by using prominent links (for example, “click here”) often designed to look like computer or mobile phone system warnings.</p><p>Because we’ve come to expect certain recurring categories like phishing and “trick-to-click,” we’re able to more effectively fight them. In 2019, we assembled an internal team to track the patterns and signals of these types of fraudulent advertisers so we could identify and remove their ads faster. As a result, we saw nearly a 50 percent decrease of bad ads served in both categories from the previous year. In total, we blocked more than 35 million phishing ads and 19 million “trick-to-click” ads in 2019.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"Top Offenders.png\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Top_Offenders_resized.max-1000x1000.png\"/></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Adapting our policies and technology in real time</h3><p>Certain industries are particularly susceptible to malicious behavior. For example, as more consumers turn to online financial services over brick and mortar locations, we identified an increase in personal loan ads with misleading information on lending terms. To combat this, we broadened our policy to only allow loan-related ads to run if the advertiser clearly states all fees, risks and benefits on their website or app so that users can make informed decisions. This updated policy enabled us to take down 9.6 million of these types of bad ads in 2019, doubling our number from 2018. </p><p>At the end of last year, we also introduced a certification program for debt management advertisers in select countries that offer to negotiate with creditors to remedy debt or credit problems. We know users looking for help with this are often at their most vulnerable and we want to create a safe experience for them. This new program ensures we’re only allowing advertisers who are registered by the local regulatory agencies to serve ads for this type of service. We’re continuing to explore ways to scale this program to more countries to match local finance regulations. </p><p><br/></p><h3>Looking forward</h3><p>Maintaining trust in the digital advertising ecosystem is a top priority for Google. And with global health concerns now top of mind for everyone, preparing for and responding to attempts to take advantage of our users is as important as it has ever been. We know abuse tactics will continue evolving and new societal issues will arise. We'll continue to make sure we’re protecting our users, advertisers and publishers from bad actors across our advertising platforms. </p></div></div></body></html><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/ATHs/~4/jcFUfXlaBp8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 30 Apr 2020 05:00:00 +0000","feedId":3562,"bgimg":"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Bad_Ads_Hero_.gif","linkMd5":"a7564ba261869c3418cf48a4dc0b423a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn89@2020_6/2020/08/24/21-37-57-789_1647590d54a4d46e.webp","destWidth":2000,"destHeight":833,"sourceBytes":640297,"destBytes":298050,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Bad_Ads_Hero_.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn89@2020_6/2020/08/24/21-37-57-789_1647590d54a4d46e.webp","https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Top_Offenders_resized.max-1000x1000.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn26@2020_4/2020/08/24/21-39-39-027_101117918996e915.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/ATHs/~4/jcFUfXlaBp8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn62@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-39-38-552_f9ccb0a08d774392.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598305055221},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 05:37:35","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 05:37:35","title":"Buy on Google is now open and commission-free","link":"https://blog.google/products/shopping/buy-on-google-is-zero-commission/","description":"<html><head></head><body><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Over the past few months, we’ve made significant changes to help businesses reach more consumers and help people find the best products, prices and places to buy online. We made it free for retailers to <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/shopping/its-now-free-to-sell-on-google/\">list products</a>on Google Shopping in the U.S., and we brought these free listings to <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/shopping/bringing-free-retail-listings-google-search/\">Search</a> as well. </p><br/><p>Today, we’re taking another important step to make it easier for retailers to sell on Google. Soon, sellers who participate in our Buy on Google checkout experience will no longer have to pay us a commission fee.

That’s why we’re opening our platform to more digital commerce providers, beginning with Shopify for inventory and order management and PayPal and Shopify for payment processing. So, if a retailer wants to sell directly on Google, they can get started even faster and continue using the tools and services that already work for their business. Or, if they’re new to selling online, they’ll be able to choose from multiple options when they sign up in our Merchant Center.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Import your inventory with just a few clicks</h3><p>To simplify our tools and make them more compatible with merchants’ existing processes, we’re enabling commonly-used <a href=\"https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/9977875#otherchanges\">product feed formats</a>. This means retailers can connect their inventory to sell directly on Google without having to reformat their data.

Consumers are looking for new and delightful products related to the home; for example, searches for “planter box” grew 200 percent year over year globally. They’re finding ways to celebrate from afar, with global searches for “online gift” increasing by over 100 percent year over year, and we saw 600 percent more searches for “click and collect” year over year, indicating shoppers around the world are keen to skip delivery and get what they need right now.</p><p>With so much information and choice available online, the space between the purchase trigger and the purchase itself has become incredibly complex.

This means we don’t allow advertisers to target ads based on categories such as race, religion, ethnicity, or sexual orientation, to name a few. We regularly evaluate and evolve our policies to ensure they are protecting users from behaviors like unlawful discrimination. </p><p>To further improve access to housing, employment, and credit opportunities, we are introducing a new personalized advertising policy for certain types of ads. This policy will prohibit impacted employment, housing, and credit advertisers from targeting or excluding ads based on gender, age, parental status, marital status, or ZIP Code, in addition to our longstanding policies prohibiting personalization based on sensitive categories like race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, national origin or disability. While the changing circumstances of the coronavirus pandemic and business continuity issues for many advertisers make precise timelines difficult, we plan to roll out this update in the U.S. and Canada as soon as possible and, in any event, by the end of this year. We will be providing advertisers with more information about how these changes may impact them in the coming weeks.</p><p>We’ve been working closely with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) on these changes for some time, and we appreciate their guidance in helping us make progress on these important issues. As part of our effort we’ll provide housing advertisers with additional information about fair housing to help ensure they are acting in ways that support access to housing opportunities. We will also continue to work with HUD, civil rights and housing experts, and the broader advertising industry to address concerns around discrimination in ad targeting.

Today, many developers rely solely on waterfall mediation, a tried-and-true way to monetize with multiple advertising sources that can be hard to set up and manage at scale. Waterfall mediation calls ad networks one at a time until one of them returns an ad. Though effective, you could be losing out on additional revenue since networks are prioritized based on historical CPMs, rather than real-time pricing.</p><p>As Google’s in-app bidding solution, Open Bidding puts participating networks in a fair real-time auction to compete for your impressions, so the winner is always the highest paying network. This means you’ll get the highest revenue available for every impression. With Open Bidding, you can find the most popular demand sources to compete for your impressions in real time. Open Bidding makes earning more even easier by eliminating the need to manually set CPMs and reducing the number of SDKs your teams need to integrate and manage. </p><p></p><p></p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"10954_Google_OpenBidding_960x540.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/10954_Google_OpenBidding_960x540.gif\"/></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>CookApps used Open Bidding in order to grow revenue for its match-three puzzle game Candy Blast.

With businesses at various stages of digital transformation—some are online, some are halfway there and others have a long way to go—we’re committed  to helping businesses get online and grow with easy-to-use tools.</p><p>To help businesses quickly improve their online presence, today we’re introducing <a href=\"https://growmystore.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en_us?utm_source=ads-blog&amp;utm_medium=blog-post&amp;utm_campaign=ads-blog-post-17-06-2020-us\">Grow My Store</a> to retailers in the U.S. In Europe, Grow My Store has been an effective way for many small retailers to get quick tips on how to improve their online store and understand how they are doing compared to peers in the industry.

Enter the name of your business and Google will provide personalized suggestions on how to make improvements to your Business Profile on Google. For example, ensuring your opening hours are current, adding curbside pickup information, or uploading a photo that represents your business.</p><p>Finally, to help small business advertisers easily promote their businesses, we’ve expanded <a href=\"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/small-business/new-smart-campaigns-features\">Smart campaigns</a> to 150 countries and now we’re making it easier and faster to sign up using the <a href=\"https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6000265?hl=en\">Google Ads app</a>.

COVID-19 has shown how quickly consumers’ interests, expectations, and purchasing behavior can shift—and with it, an ebb and flow in demand for products and services. Despite these changes, consumer expectations for businesses and brands remain high. In fact, 78 percent of people surveyed say brands should show how they can be helpful in the new everyday life.<sup>1</sup></p><p>Adjusting your media buying and the way your business shows up in these dynamic conditions is difficult, especially when some businesses are having to manage twice the complexity with half the capacity. Today, we’ll explore the unique role automation can play in helping you respond to the impact of COVID-19 in real time.</p><p><br/></p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Get the most out of your budget</h3><p>As conditions change, so do auction dynamics. Communities are in various stages of response to COVID-19 and the things people care about are rapidly shifting. This influences things like location, mobile browsing habits, conversions, and other variables that impact ad performance. It’s in this constant sea of change where <a href=\"https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7065882\">Smart Bidding</a> can help.</p><p>Smart Bidding (also available as Google Ads <a href=\"https://support.google.com/searchads/answer/7459115\">auction-time bidding in Search Ads 360</a>) uses machine learning to automatically calculate bids for each and every auction. Utilizing signals like location, search query, and conversion data, Smart Bidding can optimize bids in real time to hit your performance goal even as query and conversion volume fluctuates. </p><p>It’s important to note that unpredictable changes in conversion rates, for example: shifts in <a href=\"https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6239119\">conversion cycles</a>, cancellation or return rates, are challenging for any bid automation tool. Under these conditions, consider adjusting your cost per acquisition or return on ad spend targets to ensure the best allocation of your budget. For additional flexibility, consider <a href=\"https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2517512\">shared budgets</a> and <a href=\"https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6263058\">portfolio bid strategies</a> which are effective ways to automatically adjust bids and move spend across campaigns based on performance.</p><p><br/></p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Reach new and existing customers<br/></h3><p>From flour to at-home workouts to studying at home, the things people are searching for and how they’re searching for them is evolving. It can be difficult to identify where consumers’ attention and demand is shifting while ensuring you have the right query coverage. <a href=\"https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2471185\">Dynamic Search Ads</a> are an easy way to reach customers who are searching for exactly what you have to offer. Using the content on your website, Dynamic Search Ads automatically delivers relevant ads with headlines and landing pages that are specific to the user’s query. So as consumer behavior shifts, you can ensure your Search ads are adjusting in real time to meet that demand, all while saving time.</p><p>Another way to find keyword opportunities is through the <a href=\"https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/3416396\">Recommendations page</a>. \"Keywords &amp; Targeting\" recommendations help you identify new trends that are relevant to your business. In fact, more than 16 million keyword recommendations in Google Ads are based on market trends alone, with new ones added every day. Consider adding keywords that are projected to drive additional traffic beyond your existing ones, or pausing keywords that are performing poorly.</p><p>Once you’ve applied the recommendations that make the most sense for your business, keep an eye on your <a href=\"https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/9061546\">optimization score</a>. Each recommendation comes with a score uplift, and historically we’ve seen that advertisers who have increased their score by 10 points saw a 10 percent increase in conversions on average.

This gives your customers more flexibility in how they connect with your business.</p><p>When it comes to adjusting the messages in your video ads, time and resources are limiting factors right now. Rather than starting from scratch, consider using <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/ads/youtube-video-builder/\">Video Builder</a>. It’s a free beta tool that animates static assets—images, text and logos—with music from YouTube’s audio library. You can choose from a variety of layouts based on your message and goals, customize colors and font, and quickly generate a short YouTube video.</p><p><br/></p><p></p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Know what’s working</h3><p>As the world moves from responding to recovering from this crisis, it’s important you have the right tools available to understand the impact of COVID-19 on your business. Over the past few weeks, we’ve introduced improvements to attribution in Google Ads to help you understand your Google media better.</p><p>A <a href=\"https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/9764117\">new look</a> for attribution reports helps you quickly see how customers are engaging with your ads so you can select the right <a href=\"https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6259715\">attribution model</a> for your business. One model, <a href=\"https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6394265\">data-driven attribution</a>, uses machine learning to determine how much credit to assign to each click along the customer journey. This ensures your media strategy is accounting for changes in consumer behavior during times of crisis. And with more people turning to YouTube during this pandemic, you can use <a href=\"https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/9296311\">cross-network reports</a> (currently in beta) to understand how customers interact with your Search, Shopping, and YouTube ads—including clicks and video engagements—before converting.</p><p><br/></p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Helpful resources for managing your campaigns</h3><p>We’ve created a single destination for product guidance and business considerations when managing your campaigns through COVID-19.

But in order to get there, we must increase transparency into how digital advertising works, offer users additional controls, and ensure that people’s choices about the use of their data are respected—not worked around or ignored. </p><p>Today we’re sharing updates on our work in these areas, including new tools that provide people more information about the ads they see. We’re also introducing new resources for marketers and publishers that offer guidance on how to navigate today’s privacy environment, along with real-world examples from brands and media companies who are delivering effective, privacy-forward ad experiences that use data responsibly.</p><p><br/></p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Greater transparency, more control</h3><p>For many years Google has offered a feature called Why this ad, where from an icon in a digital ad, users can get more information on some of the factors that were used to select the ad for them, or choose to stop seeing that ad. There are over 15 million user interactions per day with Why this ad as people seek to learn more about and control the ads they see, and we recently extended this feature to ads on connected TVs. </p><p>Over the next few months, we’ll be making improvements to the experience with a new feature called About this ad, which will also show users the <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/ads/advertiser-identity-verification-for-transparency/\">verified name of the advertiser</a> behind each ad. About this ad will initially be available for display ads purchased through Google Ads and Display &amp; Video 360, and we’ll bring it to other ad surfaces throughout 2021.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--medium h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--4 h-c-grid__col--offset-4 \"><img alt=\"About-this-cropped_600pxwide.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/About-this-cropped_600pxwide.gif\"/></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Our commitment to increase transparency and offer users more control goes beyond the ads Google shows. Due to the complexity of the digital ads ecosystem and the large number of entities involved, it’s typically not clear to users which companies are even involved in showing them an ad. To provide people with detailed information about all the ads they see on the web, we’re releasing a new tool called Ads Transparency Spotlight, now available to try out as an alpha extension from the <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ads-transparency-spotligh/gkbmnjmlhjnakmfjcejhlhpnibcbjdnl\">Chrome Web Store</a>. We’ll continue to improve this extension based on feedback from users, and over time we expect to offer additional disclosures about ads, as well as introduce controls. Our hope is that other technology providers will build similar transparency and control capabilities into the experiences they offer as well.</p><p><br/></p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Evolving the ad-supported internet</h3><p>Chrome continues to explore more privacy-forward ways for the web browser to support digital ads with the <a href=\"https://blog.chromium.org/2019/08/potential-uses-for-privacy-sandbox.html\">Privacy Sandbox</a> open standards initiative. As part of the Privacy Sandbox, several proposals have been published for new APIs that would solve for use cases like ad selection, conversion measurement, and fraud protection in a way that doesn’t reveal identifying information about individual users. One of the proposed APIs, for trust tokens that could combat ad fraud by distinguishing between bots and real users, is now available for testing by developers, and more will move to live testing soon.</p><p>Once these approaches have addressed the needs of users, publishers and advertisers, Chrome plans to <a href=\"https://blog.chromium.org/2020/01/building-more-private-web-path-towards.html\">phase out support for third-party cookies</a>. These proposals are being actively discussed in forums like the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/community/web-adv/\">W3C</a>. Our ads team is actively contributing to this <a href=\"https://github.com/w3c/web-advertising/blob/master/README.md\">dialog</a>—as we encourage any interested party to do—and we expect to incorporate the new solutions into our products in the years ahead.</p><p>We’re also exploring a range of other approaches to improve user privacy while ensuring publishers can earn what they need to fund great content and advertisers can reach the right people for their products. For example, we support the use of advertiser and publisher first-party data (based on direct interactions with customers they have relationships with) to deliver more relevant and helpful experiences—as long as users have transparency and control over the use of that data. What is not acceptable is the use of opaque or hidden techniques that transfer data about individual users and allow them to be tracked in a covert manner, such as fingerprinting. We believe that any attempts to track people or obtain information that could identify them, without their knowledge and permission, should be blocked. We’ll continue to take a strong position against these practices.</p><p>Much of the recent conversation about improving the privacy of digital ads has been focused on the web, but there are a range of environments in which people engage with digital ads. Our technical approach and the implementation details may vary based on the unique characteristics of each, but our vision to uplevel user privacy while preserving access to free content is consistent across web, mobile app, connected TV, digital audio—and whatever the next area to emerge may be.</p><p><br/></p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3>Guidance for advertisers and publishers</h3><p>The future state of digital advertising promises new technologies, new standards, and better, more sustainable approaches, but it will take some time to get there. We recognize the unease that many in the industry feel during this period of transition. While there is certainly more change on the horizon, it’s critical that marketers and publishers do not wait to take action. </p><p>To help you prepare, we’ve assembled a number of recommendations for <a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-resources/experience-design/marketing-privacy-playbook/\">marketers</a> and <a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-resources/experience-design/publisher-privacy-landscape/\">publishers</a> to consider today. From best practices for building direct relationships with your customers and managing data, to tips for evaluating your partner and vendor relationships, to actionable examples for using machine learning and the cloud, these playbooks offer practical guidance and numerous real-world examples of companies that are successfully navigating today’s changing privacy landscape. </p><p>We’ll continue our work to move the digital ads industry towards a more privacy-forward future. In the meantime, make sure your organization is having an active discussion about privacy and that you are taking steps now to plan for what lies ahead.</p></div></div></body></html><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/ATHs/~4/JOxeQQwqL88\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 31 Jul 2020 10:00:00 +0000","feedId":3562,"bgimg":"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/About-this-cropped_600pxwide.gif","linkMd5":"0cbfb14a93031d9653ed2bed23aa4d61","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn44@2020_6/2020/08/24/21-38-52-910_62ad40ebe7fa4fcc.webp","destWidth":600,"destHeight":848,"sourceBytes":5248440,"destBytes":5113014,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/About-this-cropped_600pxwide.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn44@2020_6/2020/08/24/21-38-52-910_62ad40ebe7fa4fcc.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/ATHs/~4/JOxeQQwqL88":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn49@2020_2/2020/08/24/21-39-39-546_3322b3eb45c995df.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598305055218},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 05:37:35","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 05:37:35","title":"Tap into intent to generate leads","link":"https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/generate-leads/","description":"<html><head></head><body><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Consumers are more engaged with businesses who can meet their needs from home right now–and they’re more willing to move on to those who can.
