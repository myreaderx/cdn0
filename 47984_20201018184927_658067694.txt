So when her family sits down together for the holiday meals, I know that when they take their first sip of eggnog it will connect them to the history, love, joy and relationship they feel with their mom. That is what favorite recipes do: remind us of decades of shared experiences.</p>\n<p>Not everyone has good memories of family holidays. They can often be a time of stress, conflict and awkward conversations with Uncle Steve about why you are not actually unemployed, but rather have an Internet business. (&#8220;What the hell is that, and when are you going to get a real job like your brother?&#8221;)</p>\n<p>We have a choice about the memories we create for ourselves and our families. You don&#8217;t have to repeat patterns that aren&#8217;t helpful anymore.</p>\n<p>This holiday season, I invite you to reflect on the following questions :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What feeling do I want to create in my home this holiday season? (peace, connection, laughter)</li>\n<li>What do I want to create to bring this feeling to life? (food, music, decorations, solitude)</li>\n<li>What traditions and legacies do I want to make sure endure through the generations?</li>\n<li>What unhealthy, unhelpful or stressful legacies do I want to let go?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When I pause before eating my delicious Thanksgiving meal tomorrow, I will raise my glass to all of you, and the beautiful legacy you are building through your unique bodies of work. I am thankful for our connection, and look forward to seeing what you create in 2014.</p>\n<p>Big hugs,</p>\n<p>-Pam</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/EscapeFromCubicleNation?a=J-uSSKTGaj4:__RkFOxc5P0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/EscapeFromCubicleNation?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/EscapeFromCubicleNation?a=J-uSSKTGaj4:__RkFOxc5P0:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/EscapeFromCubicleNation?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/EscapeFromCubicleNation/~4/J-uSSKTGaj4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 27 Nov 2013 22:19:23 +0000","feedId":47984,"bgimg":"http://www.escapefromcubiclenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/iStock_000009359956Small.jpg","linkMd5":"cd48b49db78f58b9760176390323a62f","author":"Pamela Slim","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://www.escapefromcubiclenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/iStock_000009359956Small.jpg":null,"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f642.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn31@2020_3/2020/10/18/18-47-26-515_63b481a2e19f668f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/EscapeFromCubicleNation?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn28@2020_4/2020/10/18/18-47-26-512_40c20c95e229dab7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/EscapeFromCubicleNation?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn15@2020_6/2020/10/18/18-47-26-594_a65bebd87e1259f3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/EscapeFromCubicleNation/~4/J-uSSKTGaj4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn23@2020_1/2020/10/18/18-47-26-471_abcef33f6a12d1d5.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603046724975}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-10-19 02:45:24","updatedTime":"2020-10-19 02:45:24","feedId":47984,"fetchDate":"Sun, 18 Oct 2020 18:45:24 +0000","fetchMs":60,"handleMs":180320,"totalMs":423383,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"51aec4d1d3c6796dbe003765866f2fcc","hostName":"us-004*","requestId":"1c6779e92b11419ca7ea14d41af93f8b_47984","contentType":"text/xml;
