Its <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://buffaloheritagecarousel.org/\" target=\"_blank\">mission page</a> states that the non-profit organization&#8217;s main goal is to &#8220;provide entertainment and education about renewable energy technologies in a way that stimulates life-long learning&#8221; about the environment and natural resources.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Tesla-solar-roof-Buffalo-Heritage-Carousel-2-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-154175\" srcset=\"https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Tesla-solar-roof-Buffalo-Heritage-Carousel-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Tesla-solar-roof-Buffalo-Heritage-Carousel-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Tesla-solar-roof-Buffalo-Heritage-Carousel-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Tesla-solar-roof-Buffalo-Heritage-Carousel-2.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>(Credit: <a href=\"https://buffalonews.com/news/local/tesla-donates-solar-roof-to-buffalo-heritage-carousel-at-canalside/article_601765c6-0f38-11eb-98fc-07002dedaafe.html\">Buffalo Heritage Carousel</a>)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"in-article-ad\"><script async=\"\" src=\"//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js\"></script><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" style=\"display:block; text-align:center;\" data-ad-layout=\"in-article\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-4672671650557568\" data-ad-slot=\"7845413937\"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;With the support of Tesla, this rare and historic carousel will be powered by the sun and offer a new family recreational and educational attraction located along the boardwalk. We are so proud to be a local showcase for the solar roof tiles that are made in Buffalo, New York,&#8221; said the president of the non-profit organization, Laurie Hauer-LaDuca.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tesla&#8217;s Solar Roof tiles will provide a rather <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-solar-roof-installation-4-days-video/\">futuristic element</a> to Canalside&#8217;s vintage De Angelis carousel, which was designed and built in 1924 by Spillman Engineering. Assemblyman Sean Ryan, who provided $600,000 in state funds to help restore the carousel, reached out to Tesla and urged the company to get involved with the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This winter, I discussed the Buffalo Heritage Carousel project with the people at Tesla and told them it would be a great demonstration of a product made in Buffalo. I&#8217;m so glad people will get to see the fruits of their taxpayer investments&#8211;a beautiful carousel powered by a Solar Roof made three miles down the road,&#8221; Ryan said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, work on the vintage Solar Roof-powered carousel is ongoing, with local artists and artisans recently completing the restoration of the 34 animals in the carousel. Work has now begun on the carousel&#8217;s rounding board paintings, interior scenery panels, and custom-carved chariots. The ride&#8217;s frame and mechanism are currently being restored by an Ohio-based company as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Tesla Solar Roof-powered carousel is expected to be operational by Memorial Day weekend. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tesla is currently operating a Gigafactory in Buffalo, New York. The facility, once dubbed as Gigafactory 2, produces Solar Roof tiles and the company&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-scales-solar-roof-installations-mass-hiring-us/\">Supercharger V3 stalls</a>. </p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-donates-solar-roof-tiles-buffalo-vintage-carousel-restoration/\">Tesla donates Solar Roof tiles for the restoration of a vintage carousel in Buffalo</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.teslarati.com\">TESLARATI</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 23:57:12 +0000","feedId":44441,"bgimg":"https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Tesla-solar-roof-Buffalo-Heritage-Carousel-2-1024x683.jpg","linkMd5":"c4180340b75b658548b602d6c10aa6ad","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn49@2020_2/2020/10/20/05-30-16-227_5ba692516d0e2c73.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":683,"sourceBytes":74216,"destBytes":43998,"author":"Maria Merano","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Tesla-solar-roof-Buffalo-Heritage-Carousel-2-1024x683.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn49@2020_2/2020/10/20/05-30-16-227_5ba692516d0e2c73.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603171634612}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-10-20 13:27:14","updatedTime":"2020-10-20 13:27:14","feedId":44441,"fetchDate":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 05:27:14 +0000","fetchMs":104,"handleMs":7,"totalMs":182652,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"8f41f8a56dca4331062af167bd7997ff","hostName":"europe-56*","requestId":"816d267568d94f9fba345d94eb5aa973_44441","contentType":"application/rss+xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":43998,"bgimgsTotal":1,"bgimgsGithubTotal":1,"articlesImgsTotal":1,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":1,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx11":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 03:34:42","updatedTime":"2020-09-07 05:52:32","id":44441,"name":"TESLARATI","url":"https://www.teslarati.com/feed/","subscriber":72,"website":null,"icon":"https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cropped-Teslarati-iOS-White-Leaf-Icon-512x512-32x32.png","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx61/cdn60@2020_4/2020/09/06/21-52-31-820_5023db806565bad2.png","description":"Exploring the world of Tesla, SpaceX, Elon Musk, and future technologies including the premium electric vehicle market.","weekly":null,"link":null},"noPictureArticleList":[],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":43998,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1603171634497,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":108,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":7,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":0,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"},{"spend":0,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"}]},"extra5":1,"extra6":1,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[{"code":1,"isDone":false,"source":"https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Tesla-solar-roof-Buffalo-Heritage-Carousel-2-1024x683.jpg","sourceStatusCode":200,"destWidth":1024,"destHeight":683,"fixedGithubDest":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn49@2020_2/2020/10/20/05-30-16-227_5ba692516d0e2c73.webp","sourceBytes":74216,"destBytes":43998,"targetWebpQuality":75,"feedId":44441,"totalSpendMs":1014,"convertSpendMs":23,"createdTime":"2020-10-20 13:30:16","host":"us-031*","referer":"https://www.teslarati.com/?p=154171","linkMd5ListStr":"c4180340b75b658548b602d6c10aa6ad,c4180340b75b658548b602d6c10aa6ad","githubUser":"myreaderx11","githubHttpCode":201,"extra22GetBytesInfo":"1、没有Referer字段","extra23historyStatusCode":[200],"sourceSize":"72.5 KB","destSize":"43 KB","compressRate":"59.3%"}],"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx11":1},"failGithubMap":{}}
