And we can help you understand in different ways—through text, your voice or even your phone’s camera. Today, as part of the <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/search/search-on/\">SearchOn</a> event, we’re announcing new ways you can use Google Lens and augmented reality (AR) while learning and shopping.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <h3>Visual tools to help you learn&nbsp;</h3>\n  <p>For many families, adjusting to remote learning hasn’t been easy, but tools like Google Lens can help lighten the load. With Lens, you can search what you see using your camera. Lens can now recognize 15 billion things—up from 1 billion just two years ago—to help you identify plants, animals, landmarks and more. If you’re learning a new language, Lens can also <a href=\"https://support.google.com/translate/answer/6142483?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&amp;hl=en\">translate more than 100 languages</a>, such as Spanish and Arabic, and you can tap to hear words and sentences <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/google-lens/new-google-lens-features-help-you-be-more-productive-home/\">pronounced out loud</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>If you’re a parent, your kids may ask you questions about things you never thought you’d need to remember, like quadratic equations. From the search bar in the Google app on Android and iOS, you can use Lens to get help on a homework problem. With step-by-step guides and videos, you can learn and understand the foundational concepts to solve math, chemistry, biology and physics problems.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \">\n    <img alt=\"Lens Homework\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Lens_Homework_Help.gif\" />\n   </figure>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>Sometimes, seeing is understanding. For instance, visualizing the inner workings of a plant cell or the elements in the periodic table in 3D is more helpful than reading about them in a textbook. AR brings hands-on learning home, letting you <a href=\"https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/9817187?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&amp;hl=en\">explore concepts</a> up close in your space.

With Lens, you can already search for a product by taking a photo or screenshot. Now, we’re making it even easier to discover new products as you browse online on your phone. When you tap and hold an image on the Google app or Chrome on Android, Lens will find the exact or similar items, and suggest ways to style it. This feature is coming soon to the Google app on iOS.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \">\n    <img alt=\"Lens Shopping\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/ShoppinginIphone_v2.gif\" />\n   </figure>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>Lens uses Style Engine technology which combines the world’s largest database of products with millions of style images. Then, it pattern matches to understand concepts like “ruffle sleeves” or “vintage denim” and how they pair with different apparel.&nbsp;</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <h3>Bring the showroom to you with AR</h3>\n  <p>When you can’t go into stores to check out a product up close, AR can bring the showroom to you. If you’re in the market for a new car, for example, you’ll soon be able to search for it on Google and see an AR model right in front of you. You can easily check out what the car looks like in different colors, zoom in to see intricate details like buttons on the dashboard, view it against beautiful backdrops and even see it in your driveway. We’re experimenting with this feature in the U.S. and working with top auto brands, such as Volvo and Porsche, to bring these experiences to you soon.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \">\n    <img alt=\"ColorSwaps_Volvo_560_sq.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/ColorSwaps_Volvo_560_sq.gif\" />\n    <figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \">\n     <div class=\"rich-text\">\n      <p>AR experience of the 2020 Volvo XC40 Recharge</p>\n     </div>\n    </figcaption>\n   </figure>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>Everyone’s journey to understand is different.
