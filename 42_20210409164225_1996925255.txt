Unlike many implantable devices, the sensor can reside in place under the skin for many months without being rejected by the body or losing its functionality. The system uses receptor-studded gold nanoparticles that change color when an analyte of interest binds to them. The researchers can detect this color change non-invasively from outside the body. The technique could lead to long-term biosensing technologies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Implantable biosensors that reside <em>in situ</em> for extended periods would be very useful for clinical applications, including monitoring drug or biomarker concentrations in the body. However, implanted devices typically provoke a foreign body response, resulting in immune attack and fibrous tissue encapsulation that impair sensor function and viability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These limitations inspired this latest sensor, which consists of color-stable gold nanoparticles suspended in a polymeric hydrogel. The hydrogel helps to mitigate the chances of immune rejection and acts as an artificial tissue within the body. The nanoparticles are modified with aptamer receptors that are specific for a substance of interest, such as a drug. Interestingly, rather than being impaired by the growth of tissue over and into it, the new sensor requires it to function.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As blood vessels and cells invade the hydrogel, they bring the analytes nearer to the gold nanoparticles suspended within it, allowing aptamer receptors studded on their surface to bind to the analytes. This causes a color change which varies depending on the concentration of the substance present. The researchers can then detect this color change through the skin minimally invasively. &#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We are used to colored objects bleaching over time. Gold nanoparticles, however, do not bleach but keep their color permanently. As they can be easily coated with various different receptors, they are an ideal platform for implantable sensors,&#8221; said Katharina Kaefer, a researcher involved in the study, via a press release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The hydrogel construct is tiny. &#8220;Our sensor is like an invisible tattoo, not much bigger than a penny and thinner than one millimeter,&#8221; said Carsten Soennichsen, another researcher involved in the study. So far, the research team has tested the sensors by implanting them under the skin in hairless rats. These sensors were primed to detect an antibiotic called kanamycin, and were able to do so for a period of several months, with no significant loss in performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Study in <em>Nano Letters</em>: <a href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.nanolett.1c00887\">Implantable Sensors Based on Gold Nanoparticles for Continuous Long-Term Concentration Monitoring in the Body</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Via: <a href=\"https://www.uni-mainz.de/presse/aktuell/13376_ENG_HTML.php\">Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz</a> &#160;</p>\n<!--TrendMD v2.4.8--><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=SVKoTsVgC1I:ZNc97Ca4B4I:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=SVKoTsVgC1I:ZNc97Ca4B4I:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=SVKoTsVgC1I:ZNc97Ca4B4I:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=SVKoTsVgC1I:ZNc97Ca4B4I:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/SVKoTsVgC1I\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 06 Apr 2021 16:31:00 +0000","feedId":42,"bgimg":"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/gold-skin-sensor-1.jpg","linkMd5":"748ac2bbf7cdd8a47fb7394d7ce9ec1b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn4@2020_4/2021/04/09/16-41-47-071_4b34365d031ffcf3.webp","destWidth":466,"destHeight":470,"sourceBytes":236692,"destBytes":36426,"author":"Conn Hastings","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/gold-skin-sensor-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn4@2020_4/2021/04/09/16-41-47-071_4b34365d031ffcf3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn41@2020_1/2021/04/09/16-42-21-129_1c7ac23360fb6722.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn27@2020_3/2021/04/09/16-41-47-611_03dfa0a5030dd052.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=SVKoTsVgC1I:ZNc97Ca4B4I:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn19@2020_5/2021/04/09/16-41-47-791_a9d2d8346e827ae8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/SVKoTsVgC1I":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn24@2020_4/2021/04/09/16-42-23-077_95bb112f3873c55f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617986506663},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:46","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:46","title":"Sticker on Skin Diagnoses Cystic Fibrosis in Real-time","link":"https://www.medgadget.com/?p=1511565","description":"\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/CF-sticker.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1511581\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/CF-sticker.png 770w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/CF-sticker-300x227.png 300w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/CF-sticker-768x580.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Researchers at Northwestern University have developed a sticker that can measure chloride levels in sweat in real-time through a simple color change. The sticker is applied to the skin and wicks sweat inside itself through a set of microfluidic channels, where an onboard bioassay measures chloride levels, a marker of cystic fibrosis. The technology may end up simplifying cystic fibrosis diagnosis in newborns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disease caused by a malfunctioning chloride channel in epithelial cells. It typically results in very thick mucus in the airways, leading to serious breathing issues and infections, and it can also affect the digestive system. Early diagnosis is important, as patients can suffer malnourishment if they do not receive appropriate treatment soon after birth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At present, diagnosis involves a heel prick test, and if this reveals an abnormality then clinicians place a bulky “sweat collector” bracelet around the child’s wrist, to perform a lab analysis of sweat chloride levels. In theory, the device should be able to collect enough sweat for analysis within about 30 minutes, but it often can’t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Some parents bring their baby in for testing and are sent home without a confirmed result because the device was unable to collect enough sweat,&#8221; said Susanna McColley, a researcher involved in the study, via a press release. &#8220;They go home, without knowing if their baby has a serious disease or not, and their baby cannot yet start treatment. It can be agonizing.&#8221;  </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sticker-for-cf-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1511583\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sticker-for-cf-1.jpg 466w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sticker-for-cf-1-247x300.jpg 247w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 466px) 100vw, 466px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>To address this, these researchers have developed a sticker that can collect and analyze sweat for chloride levels automatically, producing a noticeable color change. Parents can take a picture of the skin sticker once a color changes occurs and send the image to a clinician for analysis. A laboratory is cut out of the picture, allowing for a much easier diagnostic process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The device uses a network of microfluidic channels to collect sweat directly from the skin and route it to chambers to react with chemical reagents,&#8221; said Tyler Ray, another researcher involved in the project. &#8220;Those reagents cause a change in color that correlates to the chloride concentration level. By collecting and analyzing sweat at the point of collection, we can enable an earlier diagnosis. This is crucial for preventing severe complications and improving long-term patient outcomes.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interestingly, the technology may also be useful for cystic fibrosis patients who want to monitor their condition or see if a therapy is helping. &#8220;Because this device is untethered, we plan to use it beyond clinical environments,&#8221; said Roozbeh Ghaffari, another researcher who worked on the study. &#8220;In light of these new capabilities and further clinical validation, cystic fibrosis patients receiving treatment could someday use the sweat sticker at home to track their symptoms and hydration levels during daily living.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out this Northwestern video about the new technology:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"&#039;Sweat sticker&#039; diagnoses cystic fibrosis on the skin in real time\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8p2CylGCE3M?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Study in <em>Science Translational Medicine</em>: <a href=\"https://stm.sciencemag.org/content/13/587/eabd8109\">Soft, skin-interfaced sweat stickers for cystic fibrosis diagnosis and management</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Via: <a href=\"https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2021/03/sweat-sticker-diagnoses-cystic-fibrosis-on-the-skin-in-real-time/\">Northwestern University</a></p>\n<!--TrendMD v2.4.8--><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=kQm6z3qwZHU:UD8eoRrEIWY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=kQm6z3qwZHU:UD8eoRrEIWY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=kQm6z3qwZHU:UD8eoRrEIWY:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=kQm6z3qwZHU:UD8eoRrEIWY:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/kQm6z3qwZHU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 06 Apr 2021 14:51:11 +0000","feedId":42,"bgimg":"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/CF-sticker.png","linkMd5":"e1c4ccf953794a79e3efb3d62f7db60d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn7@2020_4/2021/04/09/16-41-47-191_21b27b88eeca6c7c.webp","destWidth":770,"destHeight":582,"sourceBytes":502994,"destBytes":35974,"author":"Conn Hastings","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/CF-sticker.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn7@2020_4/2021/04/09/16-41-47-191_21b27b88eeca6c7c.webp","https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sticker-for-cf-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn39@2020_4/2021/04/09/16-41-47-926_8f929d5f40ce3995.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn41@2020_1/2021/04/09/16-42-21-129_1c7ac23360fb6722.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn27@2020_3/2021/04/09/16-41-47-611_03dfa0a5030dd052.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=kQm6z3qwZHU:UD8eoRrEIWY:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn38@2020_1/2021/04/09/16-41-49-153_3cfd72bc18954bf5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/kQm6z3qwZHU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn35@2020_3/2021/04/09/16-41-50-137_5fec50ca5fa50924.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617986506663},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:46","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:46","title":"NIRVANA Test Rapidly Identifies and Sequences COVID-19 Viral Variants","link":"https://www.medgadget.com/?p=1511501","description":"\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NIRVANA-test.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1511503\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NIRVANA-test.jpg 770w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NIRVANA-test-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NIRVANA-test-768x513.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Researchers at the Salk Institute in California, working with outside collaborators, have developed a COVID-19 test that can rapidly identify and sequence the causative virus, helping to track new variants. The test, called &#8220;nanopore sequencing of isothermal rapid viral amplification for near real-time analysis,&#8221; (NIRVANA), can also simultaneously test for other viruses, such as influenza, that may cause similar symptoms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As SARS-CoV-2 continues to mutate, health authorities are increasingly concerned about new variants being more dangerous, more transmissible, and more difficult to treat or vaccinate against. At present, a PCR test is required to spot SARS-CoV-2 and then additional genetic sequencing is needed to identify the viral variant, which requires bulky and expensive lab equipment. This new technology aims to combine these results in just one test, which is small and portable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This is a virus detection and surveillance method that doesn&#8217;t require an expensive infrastructure like other approaches,&#8221; said Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte, a researcher involved in the study, via a Salk press release. &#8220;We can accomplish with one portable test the same thing that others are using two or three different tests, with different machines, to do.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The approach is called isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA). It uses proteins to separate and copy DNA strands in as little as 20 minutes, which is different from PCR, which requires temperature cycling to achieve the same thing. The technology also involves a technique called real-time nanopore sequencing, and it allows the researchers to sequence regions of the virus that are prone to mutation, helping them to track variants. Additionally, the test can assess samples for other viruses, such as influenza.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We quickly realized that we could use this technique to not only detect SARS-CoV-2, but other viruses at the same time,&#8221; said Mo Li, another researcher involved in the study. “We can easily adapt it to tackle another pathogen, even something new and emergent.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A small portable field test incorporates the technology, and can analyze 96 samples at a time. It could be useful for rapid screening in airports or schools. &#8220;The pandemic has provided two important lessons: first, test widely and quickly, and second, know your variants. Our NIRVANA method provides a promising solution to these two challenges not only for the current pandemic but also for possible future ones,&#8221; added Izpisua Belmonte.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Study in journal <em>Med</em>: <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/med/pdf/S2666-6340(21)00117-3.pdf?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2666634021001173%3Fshowall%3Dtrue\"><a href=\"https://www.cell.com/med/fulltext/S2666-6340(21)00117-3\">Simultaneous Detection and Mutation Surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 and co-infections of multiple respiratory viruses by Rapid field-deployable sequencing</a></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Via: <a href=\"https://www.salk.edu/news-release/fast-portable-test-can-diagnose-covid-19-and-track-variants/\">Salk Institute</a></p>\n<!--TrendMD v2.4.8--><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=GQQg0kLr1vM:6kREGhSXYnE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=GQQg0kLr1vM:6kREGhSXYnE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=GQQg0kLr1vM:6kREGhSXYnE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=GQQg0kLr1vM:6kREGhSXYnE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/GQQg0kLr1vM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 05 Apr 2021 13:09:36 +0000","feedId":42,"bgimg":"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NIRVANA-test.jpg","linkMd5":"d2b824c96f02ab42ef64109d5434c0aa","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn6@2020_6/2021/04/09/16-41-47-087_41cf245ba9f265df.webp","destWidth":770,"destHeight":514,"sourceBytes":312298,"destBytes":55588,"author":"Conn Hastings","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NIRVANA-test.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn6@2020_6/2021/04/09/16-41-47-087_41cf245ba9f265df.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn41@2020_1/2021/04/09/16-42-21-129_1c7ac23360fb6722.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn27@2020_3/2021/04/09/16-41-47-611_03dfa0a5030dd052.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=GQQg0kLr1vM:6kREGhSXYnE:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn32@2020_4/2021/04/09/16-41-47-857_08a2bf7c24add2d0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/GQQg0kLr1vM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn21@2020_1/2021/04/09/16-42-09-959_682c1f18a732f78c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617986506663},{"createdTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:46","updatedTime":"2021-04-10 00:41:46","title":"3D Printed Microfluidic Bioreactor for Brain Organoid Culture","link":"https://www.medgadget.com/?p=1511636","description":"\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/mini-brain-device.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1511717\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/mini-brain-device.jpg 770w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/mini-brain-device-300x220.jpg 300w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/mini-brain-device-768x563.jpg 768w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/mini-brain-device-190x140.jpg 190w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Researchers at MIT and the Indian Institute of Technology Madras have developed a 3D-printed microfluidic bioreactor that can be used to culture and study brain organoids. The tiny self-organizing nodules of brain tissue are very useful in studying neurological disease and the effects of drugs. However, the bioreactors used to grow brain organoids can be bulky and costly, and do not always allow for easy viewing of the organoids as they grow. This latest technology aims to provide a low-cost organoid bioreactor using the benefits of 3D printing and microfluidics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organoids offer a chance to create ‘mini organs,’ and the medical research opportunities are enormous. However, culturing and studying these structures can pose some serious challenges. Viewing organoids while they are growing may require specialized cell culture equipment, such as expensive glass bottomed plates that are only compatible with specific microscopes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, such cultureware is largely suitable only for viewing the organoids, but is not suitable for long-term culture, which may take place in bulky and expensive bioreactors. These devices allow researchers to replace the nutrient medium around the organoids, and allow the medium to flow around the organoids to influence their growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Microfluidics may offer smaller, more user-friendly bioreactors, but such devices can be difficult or expensive to produce. This latest device combines the benefits of microfluidics and 3D printing to create a low-cost microfluidic bioreactor that allows researchers to easily view the organoids as they are growing. Each unit costs as little as $5, and they&#8217;re reusable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Our design costs are significantly lower than traditional petri dish- or spin-bioreactor-based organoid culture products,&#8221; said Ikram Khan, a researcher involved in the study, via an American Institute of Physics press release. &#8220;In addition, the chip can be washed with distilled water, dried, and autoclaved and is, therefore, reusable.&#8221; &#160;&#160;&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The researchers use a biocompatible resin (which is also used in dentistry) as a printed material and UV light to cure the resin before use. The printed bioreactors contain a glass slide above the wells in which the organoids reside so that they can be easily viewed, and inlet ports so that the researchers can add nutrient medium or drugs that are being studied. &#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The researchers have already been able to successfully culture and observe organoids over extended periods. In fact, the organoids appear to be healthier than those cultured using traditional methods. &#8220;One advantage offered by our microfluidic device is that it allows constant perfusion of the culture chamber, which more closely mimics a physiological tissue perfusion than conventional culture, and thus reduces cell death at the organoid core,&#8221; said Khan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Study in
