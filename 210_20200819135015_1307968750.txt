This coupon only applies to the white version. The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MY8V86Q?mnsid=mbnx33-20&amp;tag=mbnx33-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU92735YYr\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">black version</a> is still discounted to a fairly low price of just $35.21. It's not quite as low but a good discount nonetheless. The white noise machine normally sells for around $45 and often goes as high as $50. The price drop on the white machine is around the lowest we have ever seen it go and about $4 better than the last deal we shared.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>White noise machines are so good if you're like me and have trouble falling asleep. Does every little sound keep you up? Do you wish you could drown out your own thoughts, popping up with all those moments of regret from 20 years ago that you'd otherwise forgotten about just long enough to keep you from closing your eyes? They're also very handy for children, who can often be soothed to sleep by the random sounds. I'm not really sure why that works, but our son definitely used one for a few months. Now his rage puts him to sleep just fine.</p>\n\n<p>The LectroFan Classic has ten fan sounds and ten ambient noise variations, including white, pink, and brown noise. These are unique sounds that never repeat, which is important because repeating noises tend to pull your focus as much as anything else. The non-repeating sound means your mind can't really fixate on a pattern and you drift off easily. You can use the noise to drown out disruptive environmental sounds like cars driving by, dogs barking, and other things.</p>\n\n<p>The machine includes precise volume controls. It can also be powered by both AC and USB. Because of its portable design and the fact that you could power it from a USB port on your laptop, the LectroFan is great for traveling, too. If its hotel rooms that keep you up, this machine can solve that problem.</p></div></div></div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 19 Aug 2020 13:37:30 +0000","feedId":210,"bgimg":"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2020/08/lectrofan-white-white-noise-machine.jpg","linkMd5":"940d6e50d7bf73868af8ab3385ca1b84","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn44@2020_5/2020/08/19/13-48-12-963_0927047ddf914366.webp","metaImg":"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2020/08/lectrofan-white-white-noise-machine.jpg","sourceBytes":36210,"destBytes":36210,"author":"John Levite","publishedOrCreatedDate":1597844890771},{"createdTime":"2020-08-19 21:48:10","updatedTime":"2020-08-19 21:48:10","title":"Moto G9 Plus renders reveal a hole-punch display, 64MP camera","link":"https://www.androidcentral.com/moto-g9-plus-renders-reveal-hole-punch-display-64mp-camera","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p class=\"intro\">The Moto G9 Plus will have a much more design compared to its predecessor.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/moto-g9-plus-renders-reveal-hole-punch-display-64mp-camera\" title=\"Moto G9 Plus renders reveal a hole-punch display, 64MP camera\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/article_images/2020/02/moto-g-power-2020-hands-on-14.jpeg\"></a></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"aside news-summary\">What you need to know</h2>\n\n<ul class=\"end\">\n<li>Leaked renders showing off Motorola's upcoming Moto G9 Plus and Moto E7 Plus phones have surfaced.</li>\n<li>The Moto G9 Plus will come with a hole-punch display and a quad-camera setup on the back.</li>\n<li>Moto E7 Plus, on the other hand, will have a waterdrop notch display and dual rear cameras.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Perennial leaker Evan Blass revealed a few <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/motorola-moto-e7-plus-leak-reveals-snapdragon-460-soc-48mp-camera\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">key specs</a> of Motorola's upcoming Moto E7 Plus earlier this week.

On the back of the phone, we find a quad-camera setup featuring a 64MP main sensor. Unlike recent Motorola budget phones, however, the Moto G9 Plus will not have a fingerprint sensor embedded in the batwing logo at the rear. Instead, the phone is likely to come with a side-mounted fingerprint sensor. While the tech specs of the Moto G9 Plus haven't surfaced yet, a <a href=\"https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/moto-g9-plus-4700mah-battery-30w-fast-charging-support-spotted-tuv-rheinland-certification/\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">TUV Rheinland</a> listing for the phone had revealed last month that it will pack a large 4,700mAh battery and support 30W fast charging.</p>\n\n<p>Moto E7 Plus, on the other hand, will have a waterdrop notch display with a sizeable chin at the bottom. Like most entry-level phones, the Moto E7 Plus will only have two cameras at the rear. As revealed by Blass, the phone will have an impressive 48MP primary sensor and a 5,000mAh battery. It will also be Motorola's first phone to feature Qualcomm's <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/qualcomm-unveils-snapdragon-772-662-and-460-india\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Snapdragon 460</a> chipset, paired with 4GB of RAM and 64GB storage.</p>\n\n<!-- BEGIN RECO-BLOCK MINI -->\n\n<h4 class=\"product reco-block\">Moto G Power</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/moto-g9-plus-renders-reveal-hole-punch-display-64mp-camera\" title=\"Moto G9 Plus renders reveal a hole-punch display, 64MP camera\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2020/04/moto-g-power-2020-cropped.png\"></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Power-Unlocked-Motorola-Camera-Black/dp/B084D89DBF?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU92733YYr\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">$230 at Amazon</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2Fc%2F221109%2F615614%2F10014%3FsubId1%3DUUacUdUnU92733YYr%26subId2%3Ddac%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.bestbuy.com%252Fsite%252Fmotorola-moto-g-power-cell-phone-with-64gb-memory-unlocked-smoke-black%252F6398516.p%253FskuId%253D6398516&amp;token=bwl-aFXE\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">$230 at Best Buy</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1943169%2F612734%2F9383%3Fsharedid%3D159229%26subId1%3DUUacUdUnU92733YYr%26subId2%3Ddac%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.walmart.com%252Fip%252FMoto-G-Power-2020-Unlocked-Smartphone-64GB-Smoke-Black-US-Warranty%252F203553810&amp;token=2r9Ncfn8\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">$230 at Walmart</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"end\">The Moto G Power is among the more impressive phones that Motorola has launched so far this year.

These changes make it possible to construct a similar \"Amex trifecta\" with three cards that complement each other in nearly every way — providing outsized value with a reasonable price tag.</p>\n\n<p>Each of these cards are great on their own, but when taken together they can unlock serious value for even infrequent travelers.

A few years ago, I would have <em>never</em> used a pair of <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/best-true-wireless-headphones\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Bluetooth headphones</a> because of the loss of sound quality compared to a wired pair was too much for my ears to handle. Bluetooth headphones will never sound as good as the <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-headphones\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">best wired headphones</a>, but things have improved so much that now I own several pairs.</p>\n\n<p>There are two things that make a set of Bluetooth Headphones sound awesome, and both are important — one doesn't do much good without the other. Those two things are the internal DAC (Digital to Analog Converter) and its amplifier, along with the streaming audio codec. Huge advancements in both are what have made the difference.</p>\n\n<h2>The DAC is the hardware</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/bluetooth-headphones-can-sound-worse-wired-dont-have-heres-why\" title=\"Bluetooth headphones can sound worse than wired ones, but they don't have to\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/article_images/2020/03/dropthx-panda-headphones-1.jpg\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Speakers, even the small ones inside a pair of headphones, can't make a soundwave our ears can hear using a digital audio file. Most music is stored digitally, though, so something has to convert it from digital to analog. That's the DAC.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"pull left\">\n  <p>Everything that plays digital audio has a DAC and an amp inside of it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/does-my-phone-have-dac-explaining-dacs-and-amps-smartphones-today\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Your phone has a DAC and amplifier</a>, but it doesn't work over Bluetooth because you send the sound information to the headset digitally, so your Bluetooth headphones <em>also</em> have a DAC and amplifier inside. Any wireless device that can make sound, whether it be headphones, a speaker, or even an Amazon Echo, has to have an onboard DAC and amp.</p>\n\n<p>It used to be that Bluetooth headsets had the cheapest DAC and amplifier available, and no engineering went into isolating the circuit to prevent interference from the rest of the electronics. That's important because if something like the power circuit is able to cause electrical noise, you can hear it. It's like the hum you hear in a cheap car stereo, and it's horrible if you notice it.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"pull right\">\n  <p>You need quality parts, but quality engineering is more important.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This engineering is incredibly important if you want high fidelity audio. When a DAC converts a signal, it sends it to the amplifier, because on its own, that signal would be too weak to drive a speaker. Because of the space available, you won't find any fancy amplification methods inside a pair of headphones; instead, there's a transistor-like circuit embedded on a circuit board. This amp has to be built to match the input amplitude to the right output level to prevent clipping and distortion. After that, <strong>then</strong> it needs to be electrically isolated.</p>\n\n<p>It's technical and complicated, but all you need to know is that manufacturers of Bluetooth headphones have done a lot of work to make headsets that use high-quality equipment and engineering talent to make Bluetooth headphones sound really good.</p>\n\n<h2>The codec matters</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/bluetooth-headphones-can-sound-worse-wired-dont-have-heres-why\" title=\"Bluetooth headphones can sound worse than wired ones, but they don't have to\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/article_images/2018/10/sony-wh1000xm3-review-2.jpg\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Bluetooth is complicated when it comes to <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/state-smartphone-audio-codecs-and-other-terms-you-need-know\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">profiles and codecs</a>. Thankfully, the days of phone call-only earbuds are gone, and manufacturers have settled on adding everything you need for stereo audio. But while we don't have to worry about finding a pair of Bluetooth headphones that support the A2DP and AVRCP profiles (I told you it was complicated), if you want the best sound, you still have to buy a pair that support HD codecs.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"pull left\">\n  <p>A codec is an encoder and a decoder, and how it works is super complicated.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A codec is an encoder and decoder. A machine somewhere took a master recording and converted it into an audio file using an <strong>encoder</strong>, and your Bluetooth headphones' hardware turns it into the sound you can hear using the DAC and amp we talked about above. But Bluetooth doesn't have a very high transmission rate, so audio files are compressed at the source even more and decompressed when the stream reaches your headphones. The \"software\" that controls this is known as the codec.</p>\n\n<p>There are four codecs that are important enough to look for the next time you buy a set of headphones — and your <strong>phone</strong> has to have support for them, too! They are aptX, aptX LL, aptX HD, and LDAC.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>aptX</strong> is a proprietary audio codec developed in 2010 because the default Bluetooth stereo codec was really bad. The aptX codec can deliver CD-quality audio (16-bit/44.1kHz) over a Bluetooth stream.</li>\n<li><strong>aptX LL</strong> is a version of the aptX codec designed for low-latency. It sacrifices a little quality in exchange for latency as low as 32 milliseconds, so it appears instant. This is important if you play a lot of games and need audible clues when they happen.</li>\n<li><strong>aptX HD</strong> is a version of the aptX codec that uses newer and better compression and higher transmission rates (24-bit/48kHz), so your audio sounds almost as good as an expensive pair of wired headphones. Most people won't notice audio at any higher quality, so with a well-built circuit inside your headphones, this will sound perfect.</li>\n<li><strong>LDAC</strong> is an audio codec developed by Sony to deliver \"true hi-resolution audio\" over Bluetooth. It transmits a signal at a maximum of 24-bit/96kHz at 990kpbs. Android natively supports LDAC, but you'll find few manufacturers other than Sony sell headphones that support it.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We'll toss out the aptX LL codec because its biggest advantage is the elimination of a few milliseconds of audio lag, which is <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/best-aptx-low-latency-headphones\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">important for gamers</a> but not so much for listening to music. The other three codecs can be ranked by quality like so:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>aptX</strong> sounds really good to most people and is a huge step up over the default Bluetooth stereo codec.</li>\n<li><strong>aptX HD</strong> sounds even better, and most people won't notice any higher quality.</li>\n<li><strong>LDAC</strong> can send more data at once so it can deliver quality even higher than the rest. Your phone supports it, but you'll need to buy <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/best-sony-headphones\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Sony headphones</a> to use it.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For most people, any of these three Bluetooth audio codecs will sound great — even aptX, which is the \"lowest\" quality. If you want audiophile-like quality, you'll want aptX HD or LDAC. But remember, both your phone and your Bluetooth headphones have to support the same codec to make a difference. You'll find this information in the specs of either.</p>\n\n<h2>What really matters</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/bluetooth-headphones-can-sound-worse-wired-dont-have-heres-why\" title=\"Bluetooth headphones can sound worse than wired ones, but they don't have to\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/article_images/2019/10/soundcore-liberty-2-pro-1.jpg\"></a></p>\n\n<p>The good news is that most high-quality (and even <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-true-wireless-earbuds\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">some cheap ones</a>!) Bluetooth headphones support aptX, and aptX HD is becoming more popular. Same with your phone — if you bought it in the last few years, it probably supports aptX and might support aptX HD. You can also go the Sony route, and as long as your phone shipped with Android 8 or higher, LDAC is supported on both ends.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"pull right\">\n  <p>Most Bluetooth headphones sound better than the best did 5 years ago.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Advancements in DAC and amplifier design make it so most Bluetooth headphones are built to take the signal and make the best sound possible from it. Even a cheap pair of earbuds has a DAC/amp combo that's better than anything you could buy five years ago.</p>\n\n<p>All you really need to do is make sure your phone and your headphones support the right codec and find a high-quality source of audio to play or stream, and you're probably going to love the way it sounds!</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"category reco-block\">My favorite 'buds</h3>\n\n<h4 class=\"product\">Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/bluetooth-headphones-can-sound-worse-wired-dont-have-heres-why\" title=\"Bluetooth headphones can sound worse than wired ones, but they don't have to\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2019/10/soundcore-liberty-2-pro-render.jpg\"></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"subtitle\">As good as wired</p>\n\n<p>Anker has built the Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro earbuds the <em>right</em> way, and Bluetooth 5 with aptX support means you'll miss the headphone jack a little less.

They use an active noise-cancelling system that helps eliminate ambient noises. Whether that happens to be children screaming, an airplane's engine, or some other obnoxious sound you want to get rid of, you can focus on just your music with the Q20.</p>\n\n<p>You'll also get some Hi-Res Audio with the large, custom-designed 40mm drivers that produce exceptional sound. The high frequencies can reach up to 40 kHz, and the headphones have BassUp technology which can really get those lower frequencies thumping. It actually analyzes the sounds in real-time to instantly strengthen the bass output so you can feel it in your chest. Just double press the play button to activate it.</p>\n\n<p>On top of all this, the Anker headphones still last for up to 40 hours. That's with Bluetooth and the hybrid active noise-cancelling activated. The Q20 use Bluetooth 5.0 tech so you won't notice any latency in your Bluetooth streaming, but they do come with a 3.5mm aux cable so you can plug in when you need to. That helps preserve the battery, and you can extend the life of the charge up to 60 hours if you wire in and turn off ANC.</p>\n\n<p>The design of the headphones includes memory foam earcups that will mold around your ears every time you put them on. The headband has rotating joints that will fit to the shape of your head, too. There are four built-in microphones so that some of the mics can be used to cancel out background noises and keep your voice crystal clear when you use the headphones to communicate.</p></div></div></div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 19 Aug 2020 12:49:16 +0000","feedId":210,"bgimg":"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article-images/2020/08/anker-soundcore-life-q20-silver-lifestyle-2vww.jpg","linkMd5":"2ce23e3ce72d07ddd24e81a50129d934","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn48@2020_4/2020/08/19/13-48-12-895_2a7a837f92610a12.webp","metaImg":"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article-images/2020/08/anker-soundcore-life-q20-silver-lifestyle-2vww.jpg","sourceBytes":51080,"destBytes":51080,"author":"Adam Oram","publishedOrCreatedDate":1597844890834},{"createdTime":"2020-08-19 21:48:10","updatedTime":"2020-08-19 21:48:10","title":"[Update] It's not just you, Spotify is down right now","link":"https://www.androidcentral.com/spotify-experiencing-streaming-issues","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\">\n <div class=\"field-items\">\n  <div class=\"field-item even\">\n   <p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/spotify-experiencing-streaming-issues\" title=\"[Update] Spotify is experiencing streaming issues\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/article_images/2019/06/spotify-home-tab-s10-greenmat.jpg\" /></a></p> \n   <p class=\"intro\">\"We're aware of some issues right now and are checking them out!
