For Sony Pictures Animation and producers <strong>Phil Lord &#38; Chris Miller</strong>, the answer was something completely original that pushed the boundaries of animation and delivered a heartfelt, exciting story about a dysfunctional family coming together during a robot apocalypse.</p>\n<p>The result was <strong><em>The Mitchells vs. The Machines</em></strong>, a movie from <em>Gravity Falls</em> duo <strong>Michael Rianda</strong> and <strong>Jeff Rowe</strong> that was both out of this world and profoundly personal in a number of ways. In the new book, <strong><em>The Art of The Mitchells vs. The Machines</em></strong>, not only do you learn how this incredible adventure came to be after years of development and animation, but you&#8217;ll see astounding spreads of artwork that reveal how much imagination and creative freedom was put into this movie, including elements that didn&#8217;t make it into the final cut.<span id=\"more-671943\"></span></p>\n\n<a href='https://www.slashfilm.com/the-art-of-the-mitchells-vs-the-machines-book-review/mitchellsvsthemachines-artbook-familysketch/'><img width=\"360\" height=\"465\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mitchellsvsthemachines-artbook-familysketch-360x465.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"The Art of The Mitchells vs The Machines\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mitchellsvsthemachines-artbook-familysketch-360x465.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mitchellsvsthemachines-artbook-familysketch.jpg 700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px\" /></a>\n<a href='https://www.slashfilm.com/the-art-of-the-mitchells-vs-the-machines-book-review/mitchellsvsthemachines-artbook-digitalphoto/'><img width=\"360\" height=\"465\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mitchellsvsthemachines-artbook-digitalphoto-360x465.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"The Art of The Mitchells vs The Machines\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mitchellsvsthemachines-artbook-digitalphoto-360x465.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mitchellsvsthemachines-artbook-digitalphoto.jpg 700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px\" /></a>\n\n<p>With a movie from the producers of <em>Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs</em>, <em>The LEGO Movie</em>, and <em>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</em>, you know you&#8217;re in for a spectacular adventure full of mesmerizing visuals, witty comedy, and a big beating heart. But in the case of <em>The Mitchells vs. The Machines</em>, the movie actually starts with director/co-writer <strong>Michael Rianda</strong> and his <em>Gravity Falls</em> cohort <strong>Jeff Rowe</strong>, who co-directed and co-wrote the film with him.</p>\n<p><em>The Art of The Mitchells vs. The Machines</em> begins by recalling how Rianda and Rowe looked back at their experiences growing up as creative individuals struggling to find a place to belong, something that would appeal to many of the artists working on this movie. Rianda in particular pulled many personal details from his father&#8217;s contentious relationship with technology and love of the outdoors. And both of the filmmakers hoped to tell a story about a family that was far from perfect, one that lived in a messy, middle-class, Michigan home. It just so happens that this family gets caught up in the robot apocalypse and somehow become the only people who can stop it.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-671949 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mitchellsvsthemachines-artwork-livingroom-700x453.jpg\" alt=\"The Art of The Mitchells vs The Machines\" width=\"700\" height=\"453\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mitchellsvsthemachines-artwork-livingroom-700x453.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mitchellsvsthemachines-artwork-livingroom-360x233.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mitchellsvsthemachines-artwork-livingroom-768x497.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mitchellsvsthemachines-artwork-livingroom.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Insights from the development of this sci-fi adventure come from key crew members such as production designer <strong>Lindsey Olivares</strong>, head of story <strong>Guillermo Martinez</strong>, art director <strong>Toby Wilson</strong>, lead color designer <strong>David R. Bleich</strong>, VFX supervisor <strong>Mike Lasker</strong>, and head of character animation <strong>Alan Hawkins</strong>. That&#8217;s all accompanied by a rich tapestry of storyboards, concept art, rough sketches, and more, each piece providing a new look at this eccentric family.</p>\n<p>The artwork that accompanies the behind-the-scenes anecdotes literally illustrates that no idea was too off-the-wall for consideration in <em>The Mitchells vs. The Machines</em>. The character designs for the Mitchell family alone show how much exploration was done to give this film just the right kind of quirk and originality to stand out from the rest of the animated family adventures out there. There&#8217;s a two-page spread in this book that reveals the wide variety of hairstyles, wardrobes, and facial features that were considered for the main character Katie alone (trust me, they&#8217;re more varied than what you see below).</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-671951 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mitchellsvsthemachines-artbook-katie-design-700x425.jpg\" alt=\"The Art of The Mitchells vs The Machines\" width=\"700\" height=\"425\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mitchellsvsthemachines-artbook-katie-design-700x425.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mitchellsvsthemachines-artbook-katie-design-360x219.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mitchellsvsthemachines-artbook-katie-design-768x466.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mitchellsvsthemachines-artbook-katie-design.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><em>The Art of The Mitchells vs. The Machines</em> highlights the progression from naturalistic and irregular imagery representative of The Mitchells to the polished, polygonal design of PAL&#8217;s robots and their techno-world that starts to take over Earth. It explores the traits of the narrative framework of &#8220;Katie-vision&#8221; that emulates the zany style of her wacky homemade films starring Monchi, the bulge-eyed pug. There are even mentions of changes made to the movie as it went through various stages of development, from losing a sequence where the family had to kidnap the President of the United States (Barack Obama at the time) to one of the early titles for the movie, which was <em>Control Alt Escape</em>. Plus, you get a much better look at images that flash by in the blink of an eye, including digital family photos showing the years that the Mitchells have spent together.</p>\n<p>In fact, one of the more fascinating changes in development reveals that there was once an action-packed finale that involved a massive PAL-controlled mech made up of computers, cars, slot machines, appliances, construction vehicles, and pretty much any electronic device that could be controlled by the artificial intelligence gone mad. Another take on the massive mech took a more sleek polygonal approach in the style of the PAL headquarters. Not unlike the various character designs for the Mitchell family, there were endless possibilities proposed for this giant machine that didn&#8217;t even make the cut. In fact, a recently released <a href=\"https://twitter.com/billybobmartinz/status/1393299734991802369\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">storyboard sequence of a deleted scene</a> revealed an unused climax where the mech brought back the giant Furby. It&#8217;s crazy how drastically animated movies change throughout production.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-671946 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mitchellsvstemachines-artbook-katiesroom-700x716.jpg\" alt=\"The Art of The Mitchells vs The Machines\" width=\"700\" height=\"716\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mitchellsvstemachines-artbook-katiesroom.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mitchellsvstemachines-artbook-katiesroom-360x368.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>But I think the best details in <em>The Art of The Mitchells vs. The Machines</em> come from the careful attention to quirky character traits. There are several-page spreads that get up close and personal with these characters and their style, from the explosion of cinema and color in Katie&#8217;s room to the droves of dinosaurs carefully placed around Aaron&#8217;s. There&#8217;s also a special focus on the kind of stuff you&#8217;d never even think about while watching the movie. For example, Katie&#8217;s fingers were given an especially irregular and squishy design and careful attention was paid to how she holds things like her cell phone and camera. Aaron&#8217;s hair tuft could never cover both of his eyebrows, and stray hairs should always be sticking out the back. Even Rick&#8217;s beefy anatomy was broken down in great detail to figure out how to best move him as a character.</p>\n<p>For fans of <em>The Art of The Mitchells vs. The Machines</em>, this is a fascinating deep dive into the creation of one of the most visually engaging and endearing movies in recent memory. For you aspiring animators out there, let this serve as a guide to the endless work that goes into creating animation that serves both story and style. And maybe you&#8217;ll walk away with a little inspiration to color outside the lines, whether that&#8217;s on a sketch pad, computer tablet, or just in your everyday life.</p>\n<p><em>The Art of The Mitchells vs. The Machines</em> is <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/1419747495/?tag=film-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">available for purchase today</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-art-of-the-mitchells-vs-the-machines-book-review/\">&#8216;The Art of The Mitchells vs. The Machines&#8217;

You can have the skyscraper completely enclosed, or you can take the panels off to reveal the offices inside, including the angry J. Jonah Jameson, who surely wants more photos of Spider-Man. Sure, the building itself may not match up with the structures of the LEGO Expert Creator buildings out there, but it&#8217;s still extremely cool.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of fun details sprinkled throughout The Daily Bugle LEGO set, including a little framed picture of Spider-Man in Peter Parker&#8217;s office that&#8217;s clearly callback to the classic animated series from the 1960s. Plus, I love the battle details like Green Goblin blasting away part of the building. And there are over a dozen different newspapers in various places over the playset.</p>\n<p>Of course, there&#8217;s always the bad news of the pricetag. The Daily Bugle LEGO set <a href=\"https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/daily-bugle-76178\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">will cost you $299.99</a>. It&#8217;ll go on sale starting on <strong>June 1</strong> at The LEGO Shop online and at LEGO retail stores.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\"

they&#8217;ve been watching while social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic.)</em></p>\n<p><strong>The Movie:</strong><em> Greenland</em></p>\n<p><strong>Where You Can Stream It:</strong> HBO Max</p>\n<p><strong>The Pitch: </strong>It&#8217;s the end of the world as we know it and <strong>Gerad Butler</strong> does not feel fine.</p>\n<p><strong>Why It&#8217;s Essential Quarantine Viewing: </strong>When <strong><em>Greenland</em> </strong>came out last year, I didn&#8217;t pay it much mind due to both preconceived notions and willful ignorance. I knew it was a disaster movie about a comet hurtling toward Earth, and I knew it starred Gerard Butler. &#8220;Ah,&#8221; I thought. &#8220;That&#8217;ll be dumb!&#8221; Not dumb in a bad way, mind you. But dumb in a way that didn&#8217;t inspire me to rush to see it. But I&#8217;m always the first to admit when I&#8217;m wrong, and I was wrong here. <em>Greenland</em> is not what you expect.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-672128\"></span></p>\n<p>Yes, it&#8217;s a movie about a deadly comet and it does star Gerard Butler. But this isn&#8217;t a mindless disaster pic where Gerard Butler engages in mindless action. Instead, <em>Greenland</em> is a harrowing, often highly disturbing movie that tries to show what would <em>really</em> happen if a comet was headed towards Earth. There are one or two shots of disaster here, but this is not the type of movie that shows us CGI renditions of famous landmarks toppling over. Instead, it&#8217;s about a race against time.</p>\n<p>Butler plays a structural engineer living a normal life with his wife (<strong>Morena Baccarin</strong>) and son (<strong>Roger Dale Floyd</strong>). There&#8217;s a comet headed towards the planet, but no one is really concerned, because all the experts are saying it&#8217;ll crash into the ocean (I was reminded of this movie recently when there was a lot of talk about the Chinese Long March-5b rocket headed toward Earth; experts said that, too, would land in the ocean – and it did. But&#8230;what if it didn&#8217;t?).</p>\n<p>As you can probably guess, the predictions are wrong, and the comet doesn&#8217;t hit the ocean. Instead, it crashes into Tampa, Florida and kills lots of people. And that&#8217;s just the beginning – there are more comets headed towards us, and they&#8217;re going to bring about an extinction-level event. But the government has been planning for this, and they&#8217;ve selected groups of people to hunker down in a bunker in Greenland. Since Butler&#8217;s character is an engineer, he&#8217;s one of the folks chosen to survive – to help rebuild the planet.</p>\n<p>Butler and his family attempt to get on one of the planes flying off to Greenland, but a series of events prevent them from doing so. Now, they have to find a way to get to Greenland on their own before the last of the comets hit. <em>Greenland</em> uses this as a springboard for a series of nail-biting, anxiety-inducing set pieces in which Butler and his family keep running into problems as they try to survive. It&#8217;s incredibly tense, and often quite disturbing. This is not the mindless escapism of a Roland Emmerich disaster pic. It&#8217;s far more chilling – and realistic. And that&#8217;s what gives <em>Greenland</em> its power.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-quarantine-stream-greenland/\">The Quarantine Stream: &#8216;Greenland&#8217; is Not Your Typical Disaster Movie</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=npVy8VkR9EY:83RCmtomZKY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=npVy8VkR9EY:83RCmtomZKY:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=npVy8VkR9EY:83RCmtomZKY:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=npVy8VkR9EY:83RCmtomZKY:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=npVy8VkR9EY:83RCmtomZKY:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=npVy8VkR9EY:83RCmtomZKY:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/npVy8VkR9EY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 19 May 2021 14:00:12 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/quarantine-stream-greenland-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"f252bbd8d18942a575851c003f6118d0","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn30@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-55-44-296_678cf92c9ccb52f1.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":22468,"destBytes":11226,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/quarantine-stream-greenland-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn30@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-55-44-296_678cf92c9ccb52f1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn7@2020_5/2021/05/19/14-56-09-407_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=npVy8VkR9EY:83RCmtomZKY:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn4@2020_5/2021/05/19/14-56-10-257_f337e86a2e454772.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn91@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-10-903_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=npVy8VkR9EY:83RCmtomZKY:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn51@2020_1/2021/05/19/14-56-10-630_766dc3e4ab607c77.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/npVy8VkR9EY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn68@2020_2/2021/05/19/14-56-10-744_d2f40554771f74d5.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1621436143835},{"createdTime":"2021-05-19 22:55:43","updatedTime":"2021-05-19 22:55:43","title":"‘The Hunger’ Remake Coming From ‘Professor Marston and the Wonder Women’ Director Angela Robinson","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=672019","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-hunger-remake.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-672032\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-hunger-remake-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"the hunger remake\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-hunger-remake-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-hunger-remake-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-hunger-remake-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-hunger-remake.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Angela Robinson</strong>, director of the excellent and underseen <em>Professor Marston and the Wonder Women</em>, is in talks to helm a remake of Tony Scott&#8217;s stylish, sexy vampire film <strong><em>The Hunger</em></strong>.

The original film, released in 1983, was directed by the late, great Tony Scott, and starred Catherine Deneuve, David Bowie, and Susan Sarandon. Deneuve played Miriam Blaylock, a vampire over 1000 years old who lives in modern-day (well, modern-day for the 1980s) New York with John (Bowie), a cellist Miriam first met in 18th-century France. John isn&#8217;t technically a vampire, but Miriam told him he would have eternal life as her lover. That turns out to not be true, and John suddenly finds himself aging rapidly. Desperate, John turns to gerontologist Dr. Sarah Roberts (Sarandon) for help. Eventually, John ends up in a state of living death, locked away in Miriam&#8217;s attic. Now lonely, Miriam sets her sights on Sarah as her new lover. The film was an adaptation of a novel by Whitley Strieber. Here&#8217;s the book synopsis:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Eternal youth is a wonderful thing for the few who have it, but for Miriam Blaylock, it is a curse – an existence marred by death and sorrow. Because for the everlasting Miriam, everyone she loves withers and dies. Now, haunted by signs of her adoring husband&#8217;s imminent demise, Miriam sets out in search of a new partner, one who can quench her thirst for love and withstand the test of time. She finds it in the beautiful Sarah Roberts, a brilliant young scientist who may hold the secret to immortality. But one thing stands between the intoxicating Miriam Blaylock and the object of her desire: Dr. Tom Haver&#8230;and he&#8217;s about to realize that love and death to hand in hand.</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>The Hunger</em> wasn&#8217;t really a big hit when it opened but it gained a cult following thanks to its moody, sexy style. While I&#8217;m not sure anyone can recreate Scott&#8217;s visual flair, I&#8217;m a big fan of Angela Robinson&#8217;s <em>Professor Marston and the Wonder Women</em>, a sexy, sweet movie about the creator of Wonder Woman and the long-running polyamorous relationship he enjoyed with his wife and one of his students. That film was criminally underseen, and Robinson hasn&#8217;t helmed a film since its 2017 release. <em>The Hunger</em> remake will be scripted by Jessica Sharzer, who wrote the surprisingly good dark comedy <em>A Simple Favor</em>. Berlanti Schechter&#8217;s Greg Berlanti and Sarah Schechter will produce.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-hunger-remake/\">&#8216;The Hunger&#8217; Remake Coming From &#8216;Professor Marston and the Wonder Women&#8217; Director Angela Robinson</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=YyJp_dcrcAc:wQfo2SsANxE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=YyJp_dcrcAc:wQfo2SsANxE:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=YyJp_dcrcAc:wQfo2SsANxE:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=YyJp_dcrcAc:wQfo2SsANxE:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=YyJp_dcrcAc:wQfo2SsANxE:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=YyJp_dcrcAc:wQfo2SsANxE:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/YyJp_dcrcAc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 18 May 2021 21:30:59 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-hunger-remake-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"d28e1c44b0f4ab2c7ed9787b82b36f9b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn26@2020_1/2021/05/19/14-55-56-485_3a60a5b9f51cd193.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":34827,"destBytes":20038,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-hunger-remake-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn26@2020_1/2021/05/19/14-55-56-485_3a60a5b9f51cd193.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn7@2020_5/2021/05/19/14-56-09-407_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=YyJp_dcrcAc:wQfo2SsANxE:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn68@2020_2/2021/05/19/14-56-08-015_d879d68e08e8e7e1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn91@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-10-903_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=YyJp_dcrcAc:wQfo2SsANxE:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn96@2020_1/2021/05/19/14-56-09-111_9e7b01f2f0d38cbc.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/YyJp_dcrcAc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn3@2020_2/2021/05/19/14-56-08-424_d68b6a6ff87c0e16.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1621436143835},{"createdTime":"2021-05-19 22:55:43","updatedTime":"2021-05-19 22:55:43","title":"‘Stand By Me’ Returning to Theaters For 35th Anniversary","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=671918","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Stand-By-Me-Returning-to-Theaters.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-671926\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Stand-By-Me-Returning-to-Theaters-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"Stand By Me Returning to Theaters\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Stand-By-Me-Returning-to-Theaters-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Stand-By-Me-Returning-to-Theaters-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Stand-By-Me-Returning-to-Theaters-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Stand-By-Me-Returning-to-Theaters.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong><em>Stand By Me</em></strong>, the<strong> Rob Reiner</strong> movie based on <strong>Stephen King</strong>&#8216;s novella &#8220;The Body,&#8221; is headed back to the big screen to mark the movie&#8217;s 35th anniversary.

The film follows &#8220;four boys on a two-day journey. In a treehouse at the edge of Castle Rock, a small, woodsy Oregon town, a budding 12-year-old writer named Gordie LaChance (Wheaton) is about to begin an extraordinary trek into the heart of the northwestern forest, an experience that will alter the course of his life forever. His best friend Vern (O&#8217;Connell) has overheard his older brother and a friend talking about their discovery of a dead body in the woods. Hoping they can get credit for finding the body, Gordie sets off with insecure, frightened Vern, tough guy Chris (Phoenix), and daredevil Teddy (Feldman) on an adventure that becomes an odyssey of self-discovery. Their journey begins innocently with a dream of becoming town heroes, but before it is over, Gordie, Chris, Teddy, and Vern will be tested in ways they had never imagined.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As a director, Rob Reiner can be very hit or miss, but his two Stephen King adaptations – <em>Stand By Me</em> and <em>Misery</em> – are both pretty damn great. King himself once said he thought <em>Stand By Me</em> was the best film based on his work (although he seems to change his mind on that from time to time). &#8220;&#8221;I thought it was true to the book, and because it had the emotional gradient of the story. It was moving,&#8221; King previously <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/stephen-king-the-rolling-stone-interview-20141031\">said</a>. &#8220;I think I scared &#8230; (director) Rob Reiner. He showed it to me in the screening room at the Beverly Hills Hotel. &#8230; And you have to remember that the movie was made on a shoestring. It was supposed to be one of those things that opened in six theaters and then maybe disappeared. And instead it went viral. When the movie was over, I hugged him because I was moved to tears, because it was so autobiographical.&#8221;</p>\n<p>And now Reiner&#8217;s <em>Stand By Me</em> is headed back to the big screen to mark the movie&#8217;s 35th anniversary. The film will screen in select movie theaters nationwide on Sunday, May 23 at 3:00 P.M. and 7:00 P.M.,  and Wednesday, May 26 at 7:00 P.M. (all times local). Screenings will include the featurette &#8220;Walking the Tracks: The Summer of Stand by Me,&#8221; where Stephen King &#8220;recalls what led him to write the stories of his childhood, how they impacted the development of the movie, and Rob Reiner&#8230;reminisces about the casting of the four leads.&#8221; Tickets are available <a href=\"https://ymlptr3.net/52c8bmbqubqadaewuwsaiawshapaybwby/click.php\">here</a>.</p>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/stand-by-me-returning-to-theaters/\">&#8216;Stand By Me&#8217; Returning to Theaters For 35th Anniversary</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=o9O09ZETO0c:p-wl4NYzm9o:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=o9O09ZETO0c:p-wl4NYzm9o:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=o9O09ZETO0c:p-wl4NYzm9o:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=o9O09ZETO0c:p-wl4NYzm9o:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=o9O09ZETO0c:p-wl4NYzm9o:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=o9O09ZETO0c:p-wl4NYzm9o:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/o9O09ZETO0c\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 18 May 2021 23:30:43 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Stand-By-Me-Returning-to-Theaters-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"b64aab2d6612a237bd02e2ed6fe254b4","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn41@2020_4/2021/05/19/14-55-44-205_03821e2b97441222.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":53961,"destBytes":39218,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Stand-By-Me-Returning-to-Theaters-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn41@2020_4/2021/05/19/14-55-44-205_03821e2b97441222.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn7@2020_5/2021/05/19/14-56-09-407_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=o9O09ZETO0c:p-wl4NYzm9o:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn87@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-10-907_be597fb7efbb3423.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn91@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-10-903_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=o9O09ZETO0c:p-wl4NYzm9o:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn92@2020_5/2021/05/19/14-56-08-151_b9ccc63b947f8acd.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/o9O09ZETO0c":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn11@2020_3/2021/05/19/14-56-09-233_635203f25f39b7d9.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1621436143835},{"createdTime":"2021-05-19 22:55:43","updatedTime":"2021-05-19 22:55:43","title":"‘Master of None’ Season 3 Special Look: How ‘Moments in Love’ Changes Up the Netflix Series","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=671849","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-671857\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/master-of-none-2-700x299.jpg\" alt=\"master of none season 3\" width=\"700\" height=\"299\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/master-of-none-2-700x300.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/master-of-none-2-360x154.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/master-of-none-2-768x328.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/master-of-none-2.jpg 1113w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><strong><em>Master of None</em></strong><em> </em>has already mastered its brand of comedy-drama with its first two seasons, so why not change things up in a major way with its long-awaited season 3?

Now, we&#8217;re less than a week away from the show&#8217;s premiere, and Netflix is granting another special look at the series, in a making-of featurette that goes into how the show was made under COVID-19 restrictions, on a single soundstage, with a small crew. The result is something that looks small, intimate, and ultimately very lovely.</p>\n<p>&#8220;On paper, everything sounds like a terrible idea,&#8221; Ansari says in the featurette. &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m not going to be in the show anymore? We&#8217;re just going to just hold on them doing laundry for three minutes? It was a little bit scary, because it was nothing we&#8217;d done before.

Here is the synopsis for <em>Master of None</em> season 3:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The Emmy Award-winning MASTER OF NONE returns with a new season that chronicles the relationship of Denise (Emmy Award winner Lena Waithe) and her partner Alicia (BAFTA winner Naomi Ackie). Directed by series co-creator and Emmy winner Aziz Ansari, and scripted by Ansari and Waithe, this new season is a modern love story that intimately illustrates the ups and downs of marriage, struggles with fertility, and personal growth both together and apart. Fleeting romantic highs meet crushing personal losses while existential questions of love and living are raised. Co-created by Ansari and Emmy Award winner Alan Yang, Season 3 delivers an evolution of the series that remains tethered to previous seasons while breaking new storytelling ground of its own.</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>Master of None</em> season 3 debuts on Netflix Sunday, <strong>May 23, 2021</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/master-of-none-season-3-special-look/\">&#8216;Master of None&#8217; Season 3 Special Look: How &#8216;Moments in Love&#8217; Changes Up the Netflix Series</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=I3kQBFzjYRw:kn0TQF92K4k:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=I3kQBFzjYRw:kn0TQF92K4k:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=I3kQBFzjYRw:kn0TQF92K4k:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=I3kQBFzjYRw:kn0TQF92K4k:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=I3kQBFzjYRw:kn0TQF92K4k:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=I3kQBFzjYRw:kn0TQF92K4k:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/I3kQBFzjYRw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 19 May 2021 00:30:55 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/master-of-none-2-700x299.jpg","linkMd5":"4148f47660943dce1a52611355afd617","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn62@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-55-56-179_388d0ed01b391aa5.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":299,"sourceBytes":22610,"destBytes":10182,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/master-of-none-2-700x299.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn62@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-55-56-179_388d0ed01b391aa5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn7@2020_5/2021/05/19/14-56-09-407_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=I3kQBFzjYRw:kn0TQF92K4k:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn47@2020_3/2021/05/19/14-56-10-564_16bf5f93e72b1adb.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn91@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-10-903_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=I3kQBFzjYRw:kn0TQF92K4k:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn92@2020_3/2021/05/19/14-56-10-146_40f72727398a7846.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/I3kQBFzjYRw":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn51@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-10-002_57582d559793da38.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1621436143838},{"createdTime":"2021-05-19 22:55:43","updatedTime":"2021-05-19 22:55:43","title":"‘Knives Out 2’ Adds ‘Hamilton’ and ‘One Night in Miami’ Star Leslie Odom Jr.","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=672072","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-672073\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/leslie-odom-jr-e1621364931361-700x299.jpeg\" alt=\"knives out 2 cast\" width=\"700\" height=\"299\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/leslie-odom-jr-e1621364931361-700x300.jpeg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/leslie-odom-jr-e1621364931361-360x154.jpeg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/leslie-odom-jr-e1621364931361-768x328.jpeg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/leslie-odom-jr-e1621364931361.jpeg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Rian Johnson</strong> is not throwing away his shot at assembling the best ensemble for a murder mystery movie.

We&#8217;ll likely learn more cast additions as the film prepares to start shooting soon in Greece.</p>\n<p>Rian Johnson is back to direct the sequel as part of a massive deal he signed with Netflix to make both <em>Knives Out 2</em> and <em>Knives Out 3. </em>The deal landed Johnson and producing partner Ram Bergman, under their T-Street banner, $469 million for the two sequels, with the stipulation that “Craig must star in the sequels and that each must have at least the budget of the 2019 movie, which was in the $40 million range.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The first <em>Knives Out</em> was a massive hit when it hit theaters in 2018, raking in $311.4 million at the box office on a $40 million budget and earning acclaim for the phenomenal performances and the razor-sharp writing. If the sequel and its buzzy cast can manage to match the first film&#8217;s sense of fun and mystery (as well as allow Craig to go bananas with his Southern fried accent), then it will be undoubtedly one of the most exciting movies of the year.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/leslie-odom-jr-knives-out-2-cast/\">&#8216;Knives Out 2&#8217; Adds &#8216;Hamilton&#8217; and &#8216;One Night in Miami&#8217; Star Leslie Odom Jr.</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=aOP_qZx4dgw:o03JyiXBduk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=aOP_qZx4dgw:o03JyiXBduk:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=aOP_qZx4dgw:o03JyiXBduk:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=aOP_qZx4dgw:o03JyiXBduk:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=aOP_qZx4dgw:o03JyiXBduk:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=aOP_qZx4dgw:o03JyiXBduk:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/aOP_qZx4dgw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 18 May 2021 19:34:38 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/leslie-odom-jr-e1621364931361-700x299.jpeg","linkMd5":"ff5c0d671b218b7732c6283cd8cf16e6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn14@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-55-56-144_7e727e1fc8a85fa1.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":299,"sourceBytes":27980,"destBytes":17188,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/leslie-odom-jr-e1621364931361-700x299.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn14@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-55-56-144_7e727e1fc8a85fa1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn7@2020_5/2021/05/19/14-56-09-407_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=aOP_qZx4dgw:o03JyiXBduk:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn88@2020_2/2021/05/19/14-56-10-024_70fbdeaa9e2e6046.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn91@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-10-903_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=aOP_qZx4dgw:o03JyiXBduk:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn44@2020_1/2021/05/19/14-56-10-537_3b73d804e87db089.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/aOP_qZx4dgw":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn35@2020_4/2021/05/19/14-56-09-497_af3d99699a972b28.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1621436143838},{"createdTime":"2021-05-19 22:55:43","updatedTime":"2021-05-19 22:55:43","title":"‘Only Murders in the Building’ Trailer: Steve Martin, Martin Short, and Selena Gomez Find Out Whodunit in This New Hulu Series","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=672030","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-672033\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/only-murders-in-the-building-700x328.jpg\" alt=\"only murders in the building trailer\" width=\"700\" height=\"328\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/only-murders-in-the-building-700x328.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/only-murders-in-the-building-360x169.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/only-murders-in-the-building-768x359.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/only-murders-in-the-building.jpg 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Steve Martin</strong> and <strong>Martin Short</strong> are comedy legends whose decades-spanning friendship has been going on for almost as long as their absence from the screen (barring the occasional <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/steve-martin-and-martin-short-netflix-special-trailer/\">stand-up special</a>).

It&#8217;s a long time to keep us waiting for the Martin and Short reunion, but you can&#8217;t blame Hulu for keeping us in suspense. The series looks like a heightened and stylish comedy series that taps into Martin and Short&#8217;s goofy brand of humor, while appealing to the young-un&#8217;s with Gomez, who pulls from her Disney sitcom roots to keep up with the comedy masters. The three of them play a group of true-crime obsessives who investigate the grisly death of a neighbor in their Upper West Side apartment, leading them to bite off more than they can chew.</p>\n<p>Also joining Martin, Short, and Gomez in the cast are <strong>Aaron Dominguez</strong> and <strong>Amy Ryan</strong>. Martin co-wrote and co-created the series alongside <strong>John Hoffman</strong>, who is probably best known for his work on series such as <em>Looking</em> and <em>Grace &#38; Grankie</em>.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the synopsis for <em>Only Murders in the Building</em>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>From the minds of Steve Martin, Dan Fogelman and John Hoffman comes a comedic murder-mystery series for the ages. &#8220;Only Murders in the Building&#8221; follows three strangers (Steve Martin, Martin Short and Selena Gomez) who share an obsession with true crime and suddenly find themselves wrapped up in one. When a grisly death occurs inside their exclusive Upper West Side apartment building, the trio suspects murder and employs their precise knowledge of true crime to investigate the truth. As they record a podcast of their own to document the case, the three unravel the complex secrets of the building which stretch back years. Perhaps even more explosive are the lies they tell one another. Soon, the endangered trio comes to realize a killer might be living amongst them as they race to decipher the mounting clues before it’s too late.</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>Only Murders in the</em> <em>Building</em> arrives on Hulu on <strong>August 31, 2021</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/only-murders-in-the-building-trailer/\">&#8216;Only Murders in the Building&#8217; Trailer: Steve Martin, Martin Short, and Selena Gomez Find Out Whodunit in This New Hulu Series</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Ox46NVWfBM8:BeN42BmeG-g:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Ox46NVWfBM8:BeN42BmeG-g:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Ox46NVWfBM8:BeN42BmeG-g:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Ox46NVWfBM8:BeN42BmeG-g:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=Ox46NVWfBM8:BeN42BmeG-g:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Ox46NVWfBM8:BeN42BmeG-g:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/Ox46NVWfBM8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 18 May 2021 20:30:00 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/only-murders-in-the-building-700x328.jpg","linkMd5":"939841c7c94fcb2cb5a97feb7c60576e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn4@2020_4/2021/05/19/14-55-44-212_70c91697fbe4860b.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":328,"sourceBytes":26987,"destBytes":15764,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/only-murders-in-the-building-700x328.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn4@2020_4/2021/05/19/14-55-44-212_70c91697fbe4860b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn7@2020_5/2021/05/19/14-56-09-407_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Ox46NVWfBM8:BeN42BmeG-g:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn8@2020_2/2021/05/19/14-56-08-352_940d09c966dfdd15.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn91@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-10-903_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=Ox46NVWfBM8:BeN42BmeG-g:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/Ox46NVWfBM8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn15@2020_4/2021/05/19/14-56-10-370_7d3f91afc7afec23.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1621436143838},{"createdTime":"2021-05-19 22:55:43","updatedTime":"2021-05-19 22:55:43","title":"‘Immigrant’: Kumail Nanjiani Will Star in Hulu Series About the Founder of Chippendales","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=672035","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Immigrant-Series-Kumail-Nanjiani.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-672057\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Immigrant-Series-Kumail-Nanjiani-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"Immigrant Series Kumail Nanjiani\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Immigrant-Series-Kumail-Nanjiani-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Immigrant-Series-Kumail-Nanjiani-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Immigrant-Series-Kumail-Nanjiani-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Immigrant-Series-Kumail-Nanjiani.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Kumail Nanjiani</strong> is using his recently acquired swole-ness to star in the Hulu limited series <strong><em>Immigrant</em></strong>. Nanjiani will play Somen &#8220;Steve&#8221; Banerjee, the creator of the male stripper dance troupe Chippendales. Chippendales rocketed Banerjee to fame and fortune, but he also was later caught up in a criminal scandal and went on to plead guilty to attempted arson, racketeering, and murder for hire.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-672035\"></span></p>\n<p>Hulu has given a straight-to-series order for <em>Immigrant</em>, an 8-episode limited series created by <strong>Robert Siegel</strong> and executive produced by and starring Kumail Nanjiani. The series is based on the &#8220;true story of Somen &#8216;Steve&#8217; Banerjee (played by Nanjiani), the Indian-American entrepreneur who started Chippendales. The series will detail the insane, darkly comedic, crime-ridden story behind the unique male revue that became a cultural phenomenon.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Banerjee emigrated from India to Los Angeles with dreams of fame and fortune. He found it with the creation of Chippendales, a dance troupe of male exocit dancers. Soon he was pulling in $8 million a year – but it would eventually all come crashing down due to a series of criminal activities. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somen_Banerjee\">Wikipedia</a> has some more info on that:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Banerjee was later charged with having enlisted the aid of Ray Colon, in 1990 and 1991, to help carry out a plot to kill Michael Fullington, a former Chippendales dancer and choreographer, and two other ex-Chippendales dancers, who Banerjee felt were competition to the Chippendales franchise. He was also indicted for allegedly orchestrating the 1987 murder of his former choreographer/added partner Nick De Noia. It was also alleged that it was his intent to also have Nahin murdered. He eventually pleaded guilty to attempted arson, racketeering, and murder for hire. He entered into a plea agreement that would have led to 26 years in prison, loss of his share of the Chippendales’ parent company (Nahin retaining his share), and most of his estate.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Hulu&#8217;s <em>Immigrant</em> will be written by Robert Siegel and executive produced by Siegel, Nanjiani, Dylan Sellers, and Emily V. Gordon as well as Rajiv Joseph and Mehar Sethi who will also write on the series.</p>\n<p>Interestingly enough, <em>Immigrant</em> isn&#8217;t the only project about Banerjee in the works. In 2020 it was <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/chippendales-murder-movie/\">announced</a> that <em>I, Tonya</em> and <em>Cruella</em> director Craig Gillespie would direct a movie about the Chippendales founder, with Dev Patel playing the role. However, there&#8217;s been almost no news about that since the announcement, so it&#8217;s unclear if it&#8217;s still moving forward at this point.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/immigrant-series-kumail-nanjiani/\">&#8216;Immigrant&#8217;: Kumail Nanjiani Will Star in Hulu Series About the Founder of Chippendales</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=MAvRpD6t5jI:ZCFaD6Tic_o:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=MAvRpD6t5jI:ZCFaD6Tic_o:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=MAvRpD6t5jI:ZCFaD6Tic_o:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=MAvRpD6t5jI:ZCFaD6Tic_o:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=MAvRpD6t5jI:ZCFaD6Tic_o:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=MAvRpD6t5jI:ZCFaD6Tic_o:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/MAvRpD6t5jI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 18 May 2021 20:00:55 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Immigrant-Series-Kumail-Nanjiani-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"eda799576d096cd6b86533148b7d0359","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn23@2020_4/2021/05/19/14-55-56-307_260e290e0ca77bdd.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":25305,"destBytes":12970,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Immigrant-Series-Kumail-Nanjiani-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn23@2020_4/2021/05/19/14-55-56-307_260e290e0ca77bdd.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn7@2020_5/2021/05/19/14-56-09-407_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=MAvRpD6t5jI:ZCFaD6Tic_o:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn23@2020_2/2021/05/19/14-56-09-374_e02f4d5897f42d77.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn91@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-10-903_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=MAvRpD6t5jI:ZCFaD6Tic_o:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn36@2020_2/2021/05/19/14-56-08-532_74e93be84c55cf31.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/MAvRpD6t5jI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn52@2020_1/2021/05/19/14-56-08-718_de7944955dab15de.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1621436143835},{"createdTime":"2021-05-19 22:55:43","updatedTime":"2021-05-19 22:55:43","title":"Charles Grodin, Star of ‘The Heartbreak Kid’, ‘Beethoven’, ‘Midnight Run’, and More, Has Died at 86","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=672046","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-672054 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Charles-Grodin-dead-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Charles Grodin dead\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Charles-Grodin-dead.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Charles-Grodin-dead-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Charles Grodin</strong>, the actor who appeared in the <em>Beethoven</em> films, <em>Midnight Run</em>, <em>The Heartbreak Kid</em>, and <em>The Great Muppet Caper</em>, to name just a few credits, has passed away at the age of 86. Grodin&#8217;s son told <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/18/movies/charles-grodin-dead.html?smid=tw-nytimesarts&#38;smtyp=cur\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The New York Times</a> that his father&#8217;s cause of death was bone marrow cancer.<span id=\"more-672046\"></span></p>\n<p>After starting his career with an uncredited role in Disney&#8217;s <em>20,000 Leagues Under the Sea</em> in the mid-1950s, Grodin dropped out of college to pursue acting, writing, and directing for the stage, appearing in several Broadway productions and directing multiple Broadway shows as well. He developed the kind of All-American good looks which made him a versatile cinematic asset during the latter half of the twentieth century, and always appeared to be equally comfortable in supporting roles as leading ones. Grodin was one of those actors who made everything he did look easy, and he was especially adept at playing guys who got in over their heads. His deadpan comedic reactions and ability to portray put-upon or frustrated characters made him stand out from his contemporaries, and he was a guy I was always personally delighted to see pop up in any capacity whatsoever – even in a brief cameo in <em>So I Married an Axe Murderer</em>.</p>\n<p>As his Hollywood career began, Grodin chipped his way through small roles in popular television shows like <em>The F.B.I.</em> and <em>The Virginian</em>, and then played Dr. Hill in Roman Polanski&#8217;s horror classic <em>Rosemary&#8217;s Baby</em>. He then worked with the acclaimed comedy duo of Nichols and May, appearing in Mike Nichols&#8217; 1970 adaptation of <em>Catch-22</em> and later starring as Lenny Cantrow in Elaine May&#8217;s 1972 comedy <em>The Heartbreak Kid</em>, in which he played a total scumbag who ditches his wife for a younger blonde. That character should be completely irredeemable on the page, but through his excellent performance, Grodin somehow manages to grasp onto the tiniest bit of the audience&#8217;s sympathy.</p>\n<p>Roles in films like the <em>King Kong</em> remake, <em>Heaven Can Wait</em>, and <em>The Incredible Shrinking Woman</em> followed, as well as a memorable turn as the over-the-top villain in 1981&#8217;s <em>The Great Muppet Caper</em>, which is a terrific, scenery-chewing performance that doesn&#8217;t get the credit it deserves for the way it walks the perfect tonal high wire without missing a beat. <em>The Woman in Red</em> and <em>Ishtar</em> are a couple of other notable credits for him on the way to <em>Midnight Run</em>, which pitted Grodin against Robert De Niro and which became a beloved cross-country buddy movie staple.</p>\n<p>That gave way to the next stage of his career, where he perfected the &#8220;put-upon dad&#8221; archetype and introduced himself to a whole new generation in movies like <em>Beethoven</em>, <em>Beethoven&#8217;s 2nd</em>, and <em>Clifford</em>. There was a 12 year period between the mid-90s and the mid-2000s where he didn&#8217;t appear in anything, but then his career picked back up again with appearances in <em>The Ex</em>, <em>The Humbling</em>, Noah Baumbach&#8217;s <em>While We&#8217;re Young</em>, the FX series <em>Louie</em>, the <em>Madoff</em> miniseries, and more.</p>\n<p>Rest in peace, Mr. Grodin – you will be deeply missed.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/charles-grodin-dead/\">Charles Grodin, Star of &#8216;The Heartbreak Kid&#8217;, &#8216;Beethoven&#8217;, &#8216;Midnight Run&#8217;, and More, Has Died at 86</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=sqpR8_TQwAU:PTR2_5sI1z4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=sqpR8_TQwAU:PTR2_5sI1z4:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=sqpR8_TQwAU:PTR2_5sI1z4:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=sqpR8_TQwAU:PTR2_5sI1z4:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=sqpR8_TQwAU:PTR2_5sI1z4:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=sqpR8_TQwAU:PTR2_5sI1z4:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/sqpR8_TQwAU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 18 May 2021 18:30:57 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Charles-Grodin-dead-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"a5fe004f92bd3ae59cbeebc3f01c22f3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn17@2020_1/2021/05/19/14-55-45-297_adef90626f3310f6.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":27300,"destBytes":14446,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Charles-Grodin-dead-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn17@2020_1/2021/05/19/14-55-45-297_adef90626f3310f6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn7@2020_5/2021/05/19/14-56-09-407_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=sqpR8_TQwAU:PTR2_5sI1z4:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn16@2020_5/2021/05/19/14-56-08-555_820b4953d7bf274e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn91@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-10-903_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=sqpR8_TQwAU:PTR2_5sI1z4:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn23@2020_4/2021/05/19/14-56-10-492_b3fe5857230eb2fb.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/sqpR8_TQwAU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn59@2020_2/2021/05/19/14-56-09-912_26e42513d5741166.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1621436143835},{"createdTime":"2021-05-19 22:55:43","updatedTime":"2021-05-19 22:55:43","title":"Superhero Bits: ‘Batman: The Long Halloween Part II’ Trailer, James Gunn Gets Death Threats About ‘The Suicide Squad’ & More","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=672027","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-672110 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/batman-longhalloween-part2-villains-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Batman: The Long Halloween Part II Trailer\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/batman-longhalloween-part2-villains.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/batman-longhalloween-part2-villains-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Want to see the trailer for <strong><em>Batman: The Long Halloween Part II</em></strong> animated movie?

But when one of those letters ends up in the pocket of a fellow student who commits suicide, Evan Hansen ends up caught in a lie that finally affords him all the friends and affection he&#8217;d been craving — but at the cost of pretending to be someone he&#8217;s not.</p>\n<p><em>Dear Evan Hansen</em> was a deeply polarizing musical when it debuted in 2015 for exactly the reasons you probably think, having just read that premise. But despite the criticisms over its story, <em>Dear Evan Hansen</em> went on to win six Tony Awards, including Best Actor for Platt, who reprises the role of the teenaged Evan Hansen at a fresh-faced 27 (please free this man from playing high schoolers for the rest of his life, he got so close with <em>Pitch Perfect</em>). But regardless what you think of the musical, it&#8217;s undeniably got some good songs, composed by the Tony-winning songwriting team <strong>Benj Pasek &#38; Justin Paul</strong>, the hit makers behind the songs from <em>La La Land</em> and <em>The Greatest Showman.</em> The Tony-winning writer <strong>Steven Levenson</strong> also adapts the book for the screen.</p>\n<p><em>Dear Evan Hansen</em> stars <strong>Amy Adams</strong>, <strong>Julianne Moore</strong>, <strong>Kaitlyn Dever</strong> (<em>Booksmart</em>), <strong>Amandla Stenberg</strong> (<em>The Hate U Give</em>), <strong>Colton Ryan</strong> (Apple TV+’s <em>Little Voice)</em>, <strong>Nik Dodani</strong> (Netflix’s <em>Atypical</em>), <strong>DeMarius Copes</strong> (Broadway’s <em>Mean Girls</em>), and <strong>Danny Pino</strong> (<em>Law &#38; Order: Special Victims Unit</em>). It&#8217;s produced by Marc Platt (<em>La La Land, Into the Woods, Mary Poppins Returns</em>) and Adam Siegel (<em>2 Guns, Drive</em>), and is executive produced by Michael Bederman, Steven Levenson, Benj Pasek and Justin Paul.</p>\n<p>Here is the synopsis for <em>Dear Evan Hansen</em>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The breathtaking, generation-defining Broadway phenomenon becomes a soaring cinematic event as Tony, Grammy and Emmy Award winner Ben Platt reprises his role as an anxious, isolated high schooler aching for understanding and belonging amid the chaos and cruelty of the social-media age.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Universal has set <em>Dear Evan Hansen</em> to open in theaters <strong>September 24, 2021</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/dear-evan-hansen-trailer/\">&#8216;Dear Evan Hansen&#8217; Trailer: Ben Platt Brings the Tony-Winning Musical to the Big Screen</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=J5oP5rsIpCE:Mhge7S_s4_I:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=J5oP5rsIpCE:Mhge7S_s4_I:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=J5oP5rsIpCE:Mhge7S_s4_I:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=J5oP5rsIpCE:Mhge7S_s4_I:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=J5oP5rsIpCE:Mhge7S_s4_I:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=J5oP5rsIpCE:Mhge7S_s4_I:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/J5oP5rsIpCE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 18 May 2021 17:30:11 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/dear-evan-hansen-700x292.jpg","linkMd5":"e7dd2a6a5f142d943680096802c6ce80","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn48@2020_3/2021/05/19/14-55-45-289_9dd43985855d5086.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":292,"sourceBytes":14236,"destBytes":6584,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/dear-evan-hansen-700x292.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn48@2020_3/2021/05/19/14-55-45-289_9dd43985855d5086.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn7@2020_5/2021/05/19/14-56-09-407_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=J5oP5rsIpCE:Mhge7S_s4_I:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn76@2020_3/2021/05/19/14-56-08-963_04559e6dd482abc0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn91@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-10-903_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=J5oP5rsIpCE:Mhge7S_s4_I:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn64@2020_2/2021/05/19/14-56-09-948_02c71766ff57294d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/J5oP5rsIpCE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn55@2020_5/2021/05/19/14-56-07-982_3737aac19a688576.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1621436143838},{"createdTime":"2021-05-19 22:55:43","updatedTime":"2021-05-19 22:55:43","title":"‘Good on Paper’ Trailer: Iliza Shlesinger’s New Boyfriend May Not Be What He Seems","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=672086","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-672090 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Good-on-Paper-trailer-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Good on Paper trailer\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Good-on-Paper-trailer.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Good-on-Paper-trailer-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a long cinematic tradition of comedians making movies based on events in their own lives, from Woody Allen to Judd Apatow.

Shlesinger has a comfortable relationship with Netflix already, having released five comedy specials and a sketch show and appeared in Netflix originals like <em>Girlboss</em>, <em>Pieces of a Woman</em>, and <em>Spenser Confidential</em>, so this feels like a natural home for her.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Ryan Hansen broke out playing the lovable jerk Dick Casablancas on <em>Veronica Mars</em>, and he parlayed that into a role in the ensemble of another beloved TV series, the cancelled-too-soon Starz comedy <em>Party Down</em>. (Fun fact: <em>Party Down</em> is <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/party-down-revival-starz/\">getting a revival</a>, although last we heard, it wasn&#8217;t clear which actors were returning for it.)</p>\n<p><strong>Kimmy Gatewood</strong> is directing this film, which will be her feature debut after directing tons of television, including shows like The CW&#8217;s <em>Crazy Ex-Girlfriend</em>, Netflix&#8217;s <em>The Baby-Sitter&#8217;s Club</em> revival, and the Peacock original comedy series <em>Girls5eva</em>. Veteran comedian <strong>Margaret Cho</strong> (<em>Drop Dead Diva</em>) and actress <strong>Rebecca Rittenhouse</strong> (<em>Unfriended: Dark Web</em>, <em>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</em>) round out the rest of the film&#8217;s cast.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the official synopsis for <em>Good on Paper</em>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Andrea Singer always put her stand-up career first, and while dating came easy, love wasn&#8217;t a priority&#8230; that is until she meets Dennis, a quirky nerd with disarming charm who coaxes her into letting her guard down. Her best friend Margot isn’t convinced he’s all he seems and she urges Andrea to embark on a wild goose chase to uncover who Dennis really is. Based on a mostly true story, GOOD ON PAPER is written by and stars the hilariously sharp-witted Iliza Shlesinger. Also starring Ryan Hansen, Margaret Cho, and Rebecca Rittenhouse.</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>Good on Paper</em> will be available to stream on Netflix starting <strong>June 23</strong>, <strong>2021</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/good-on-paper-trailer/\">&#8216;Good on Paper&#8217; Trailer: Iliza Shlesinger&#8217;s New Boyfriend May Not Be What He Seems</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=d3WOJm0kwTk:x5jZ3ET33jQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=d3WOJm0kwTk:x5jZ3ET33jQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=d3WOJm0kwTk:x5jZ3ET33jQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=d3WOJm0kwTk:x5jZ3ET33jQ:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=d3WOJm0kwTk:x5jZ3ET33jQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=d3WOJm0kwTk:x5jZ3ET33jQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/d3WOJm0kwTk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 18 May 2021 22:00:27 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Good-on-Paper-trailer-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"eee6dce07909886eb956e696bd1c7d73","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn5@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-00-205_3dee979ad108fc22.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":28549,"destBytes":16876,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Good-on-Paper-trailer-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn5@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-00-205_3dee979ad108fc22.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn7@2020_5/2021/05/19/14-56-09-407_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=d3WOJm0kwTk:x5jZ3ET33jQ:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn95@2020_3/2021/05/19/14-56-10-288_e39437640e3a9907.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn91@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-10-903_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=d3WOJm0kwTk:x5jZ3ET33jQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn28@2020_5/2021/05/19/14-56-09-698_08a8e720600513f6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/d3WOJm0kwTk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn56@2020_5/2021/05/19/14-56-10-687_49d87da937a4570b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1621436143835},{"createdTime":"2021-05-19 22:55:43","updatedTime":"2021-05-19 22:55:43","title":"‘The Ice Road’ Trailer: It’s Basically ‘Armageddon’ on Ice, Starring Liam Neeson","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=672031","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-672058 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Ice-Road-trailer-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"The Ice Road trailer\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Ice-Road-trailer.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/The-Ice-Road-trailer-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Liam Neeson</strong> movie characters have faced some pretty extreme challenges over the past decade or so: a missing daughter, surviving a plane crash, releasing the Kraken, fighting aliens on a battleship, and stopping bad guys on various forms of transportation, including a plane, a train, and a snow plow.

But he also wrote the famous spec script <em>Simon Says</em>, which was eventually made as <em>Die Hard with a Vengeance</em>, and wrote the scripts for <em>Jumanji</em> and the Nic Cage film <em>Next</em>, while writing and directing <em>Kill the Irishman</em> and the 2004 adaptation of <em>The Punisher</em>, which starred Thomas Jane in the lead role.</p>\n<p>Netflix has <strong>Benjamin Walker</strong> (<em>Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter</em>), <strong>Amber Midthunder</strong> (<em>Legion</em>), and <strong>Marcus Thomas</strong> (<em>Drowning Mona</em>) listed as additional cast members, but IMDb says <strong>Holt McCallany</strong> (<em>Mindhunter</em>, <em>Lights Out</em>) is also on board, so I&#8217;m curious to see if that ends up being true.</p>\n<p>Here is the film&#8217;s official synopsis:</p>\n<div>\n<blockquote>\n<div>After a remote diamond mine collapses in far northern Canada, a ‘big-rig’ ice road driver (Neeson) must lead an impossible rescue mission over a frozen ocean to save the trapped miners.

In fact, NBC has completely abandoned comedy this fall, opting instead to turn Thursday into an all-<em>Law &#38; Order</em> line-up with <em>For the Defense</em>, <em>Organized Crime</em> and <em>SVU</em> taking over the evening.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-659621 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Paramount-Plus-logo-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Paramount Plus Movies\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Paramount-Plus-logo.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Paramount-Plus-logo-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Finally, even though ViacomCBS isn&#8217;t having their upfronts presentation until later this week, word on the street is that CBS will be sending the <em>Silence of the Lambs</em> sequel series <em><strong>Clarice</strong></em> <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2021/05/evil-move-cbs-paramount-plus-1234758581/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">to Paramount+</a> along with the long-running military drama <strong><em>SEAL Team</em></strong> and the supernatural series <strong><em>Evil</em></strong>. What does this mean for the future of CBS network television? We&#8217;re not entirely sure, but ViacomCBS putting an emphasis on streaming at Paramount+ likely means their more exciting shows won&#8217;t shoot for CBS. We&#8217;ll find out after they have their upfronts presentation.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/tv-upfronts-abc-fox-and-nbc-announce-renewals-cancellations-and-series-orders-clarice-more-heading-to-paramount/\">TV Upfronts: ABC, FOX, and NBC Announce Renewals, Cancellations, and Series Orders, &#8216;Clarice&#8217;

Read our interview below.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-671684\"></span></p>\n<p><strong>What has it been like seeing the movie you worked on for over a year now, finally shared with the public through its release on Disney+?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Carlos Lopez Estrada: </strong>It&#8217;s been surreal on every possible level. Seeing it in theaters was wild, being able to talk to so many people. I think, just for so long, we really wanted to have the conversation that comes from people watching the movie. And I feel like now that people are going to be able to own it as a tangible thing in their homes and like, maybe able to have it up on a shelf somewhere. Otherwise, it just continues to make this journey more and more special</p>\n<p><strong>Fawn Veerasunthron:</strong> Initially, because I couldn&#8217;t go out to the experience with people, then I did wait for the theater. And then I felt the energy from the people watching the film was awesome. I think the most awesome thing is to see my how much my daughter is into dressing up as Raya around the house. She was someone who had all the princess dresses before, and the energy has shifted to the warrior vibe.</p>\n<p><strong>Osnat Shurer: </strong>I think for me, it&#8217;s different than the one experience because we&#8217;re not going to theater and traveling, we&#8217;re having conversations with people from home, that it just sort of comes in through socials. I&#8217;ve got friends sending me texts, you know, my two twin boys, [tell me they&#8217;ve watched it] seven [times]. And that is just because I&#8217;m having a real conversation. You know, I was on the phone for four years. So it&#8217;s really, really exciting.</p>\n<p><strong>Carlos, I&#8217;ve actually been wanting to ask you: what was it like going from making a hit indie movie like <em>Blindspotting</em> to co-directing <em>Raya</em>?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Estrada:</strong>  For me, I think getting to work on a movie with 500 people or getting to work in a community of artists that&#8217;s like 900 people and more, getting to work on stories that is so timely, but also just timeless, and getting to work with artists in this building, who are responsible for many of the movies that I grew up watching… it&#8217;s just beyond anything I could ever imagine.</p>\n<p><strong>Speaking of the reach that this movie has and how it represents the main people on screen, Carlos, did you have any reservations about tackling a culture or group of cultures that you personally weren&#8217;t as familiar with?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Estrada:</strong> I mean, I wouldn&#8217;t say reservations, but there&#8217;s definitely a sense of responsibility that we have as filmmakers. And honestly, you brought up <em>Blindspotting, </em>it was very similar questions when entering that world. Because I remember talking to [writers and stars] Daveed [Diggs] and Rafael [Casal], saying, &#8220;Hey, are you sure that I&#8217;m the right person to tell your story? Wouldn&#8217;t you want somebody from Oakland or a Black filmmaker?&#8221; And they just put their trust in me in a way that was really empowering. They said, &#8220;Look you understand us, we understand what you do, we trust you and we have a standing relationship with you, and we believe that you&#8217;re going to explore our world with a lot of respect and a lot of responsibility.&#8221; I feel like it&#8217;s a very similar situation here.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m from Mexico, and I would like to think that not only Mexican filmmakers can tell stories about my culture. I feel like that would limit the stories — like they would be rich and authentic, but they would be limited in a way. So I would love to think that anyone can come and tell a story about my culture. But I also like to think that those people would really handle that responsibility, and know that they need to evolve the people that they&#8217;re talking about, and that they have to learn as much as possible and know that we really have to immerse themselves into it in order to depict it accurately. So I would like to think that our role here is similar, that I got to learn so much about these cultures, from people like Fawn for people in our crew like Qui, Kelly who could speak directly to it. And I think for that reason, it&#8217;s just good to be conscious and aware of the responsibility that we have.</p>\n<p><strong>A lot has been discussed about<em> Raya</em> and Southeast Asian representation, but I want to talk about another piece of representation that has been central to discussions of this movie: LGBTQ. Kelly Marie Tran has said that she thinks of Raya as gay, and lots has been said about the central relationship between Raya and Namaari. Can any of you speak on whether those LGBTQ themes should be read as explicit?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Shurer: </strong>I think what Kelly said, which I loved, was this idea that if you see yourself represented on the screen, that&#8217;s a good thing. That means we told an authentic story. We thought a lot about Raya and Namaari, we didn&#8217;t really explore Raya&#8217;s sexuality in this film. But we thought a lot about Raya and Namaari as friends, as two people who in some ways were a reflection of each other, almost could have been each other if they&#8217;d grown up differently. We spent a lot of time thinking about how we establish that friendship in the short amount of screen space we have, and those are the terms we thought about it in. But I feel the same as Kelly does. If that&#8217;s what I see in that story, more power to me, it&#8217;s awesome. It&#8217;s a great thing the more we see ourselves in our stories. So I think that&#8217;s where I land on it.</p>\n<p><strong>From what Disney animators have shared online, Namaari in her final form was a later addition, but that found family around Raya was always there. How did each member of the group start out, and how did they settle into what we see with the final product? Was there a point when something clicked and you thought, &#8221; Oh, this is what the character was&#8221;?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Shurer: </strong>There&#8217;s a lot of characters, I think we always knew Raya [who] of course evolved over time. And Sisu was actually one of the first sketches and certainly, we had a sense of her. Though, again, they both evolved over time. Some of the characters started out as someone else. Tong was a grandmother earlier on and was connected with Baby Noi.</p>\n<p>As the story evolved, each one sort of found their seat and how they connect both psychologically, culturally to the land they come from. That was really important to us, because in the end, each is representing one of the lands when we all come together. And then each character sort of found their place. I think Namaari was always there, but she was a whole different character. She used to lead the Druun, and the Druun were sentient, and all sorts of other versions of what the threat is. And each one evolved under a real clear thematic from what we were aiming at. And I think Namaari was there, but that depth of the relationship, the real thing that goes between those two of &#8220;could they be friends?&#8221; — we all have friendships like that, where you meet somebody and you like the same bands, and there&#8217;s an intensity to those kind of relationships, especially between girls that we were excited to dig into. But I think each character carries something that speaks to the land that they&#8217;re from.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you talk about some of the cut sequences or storylines for <em>Raya and the Last Dragon</em>, like the mythical sword that Raya at one point was supposed to wield?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Veerasunthron:</strong> Yeah, in the early, early versions, we were trying to figure out how she lived on her own for those past four years, and what was that backstory? So we had a lot of backstory that materialized in this mystic sword that she wields. But then we found that if we were to restrict the Druun in the physical form, it takes a lot of screentime to try to explain that. And at some point, we had the leader of the Druuns and it got really complicated. I think with her sword, it was more emotional that it was something passed on from her dad. Because we talked a lot about, this is the start of someone who feels responsibility for her family. And we take the definition of family to the broader aspect, of her making something that represents that and highlight what she&#8217;s fighting for. She&#8217;s fighting to bring dad back, and eventually fighting to bring the world back.</p>\n<p><strong>Speaking of those fights, let&#8217;s talk about the intense fight scenes of <em>Raya and the Last Dragon</em>. There was some sort of talk, mostly in jest, about how <em>Raya</em> might have been R-rated, but those fight scenes are intense enough to be convincing. Was there ever a part where you thought, &#8220;We have to pull back or we might scare the kids?&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Estrada:</strong> I think it was a little bit of both. And part of the development process was gaging that balance of how far can you push something and keep it relatable. It goes the same for the comedic scenes, you try to make them funnier and sometimes you realize you&#8217;re pushing too hard. And to our surprise, we thought that the action elements, the fights in particular were potentially going to be too graphic and we would get pushback, first from the test audiences and then from the studio.</p>\n<p>But we screened the movie, expecting to get those notes and no one really seemed to have a problem with it. I would like to think it was a testament to the story building that we did, making sure those moments felt earned and that they felt like an extension of the journeys of the characters, but we screened it for the studio and we got lots of notes on other things, but not the fights. Then we screened it for test audiences, spanning some tiny people, some not-so-tiny people in terms of age, and they were commenting on other character traits, they were commenting on Sisu&#8217;s humor, and they were commenting on everything and anything except the graphic nature of the fights. I think that for us just meant that we could just move forward and continue developing the characters, it really felt like the fight moments were earned. But we were never doing like a fight just for action&#8217;s sake, or because you know, like an action spike in the story, like it just really felt like these weren&#8217;t necessary moments that were speaking to the truth of the character.</p>\n<p><strong>Speaking of things that may have needed to be reined back for children, have you guys read the New York Times piece about hot animation dads, with <em>Raya</em>&#8216;s Chief Benja at the center? How did you guys react to that piece, and was his hotness a happy accident?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Estrada:</strong> We did! We&#8217;re very proud of he movie in many ways, but I think we may be the most proud of Benja [<em>Laughs</em>]. Because it was a very deliberate choice to make. Adele Lim, one of our screenwriters, deserves a lot of credit because she had that moment of [asking], &#8220;Why can&#8217;t Benja be hotter?&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Shurer:</strong> Why can&#8217;t he?!</p>\n<p><strong>Estrada:</strong> And that just snowballed. We opened up the model conversation, our technical team came back, we looked at muscles. We were like, &#8220;Hey, look at Daniel Dae Kim, he&#8217;s like the most attractive human on Earth.&#8221; And we just really used him as a direct reference for what Benja would look like. So we know that people had commented it, but to be to be so openly validated about it, I think was really, really good surprise.</p>\n<p><strong>Veerasunthron</strong>: There was a lot of hard work going into that, and for us, I think it was important for the Asian male representation, right? [<em>Laughs</em>] Like, &#8220;Hey, we want someone to look up to, or look like the role model, and Benja has all those qualities, so we should match this appearance to those qualities.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Well, I hope there&#8217;s whole featurettes on the Blu ray about how hot Benja is.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Estrada:</strong> Well you know what, I&#8217;ll just say… Many times last year, putting the movie together, you get to see shots in unfinished form. Sometimes, you know people show up without hair. And there are a few shots that Benja showed up without a shirt, just because the clothes wouldn&#8217;t come through in the render, and I would say it got really, really steamy reactions from people in the crew. People were taking screenshots, people were demanding more shots to come through incomplete in that department. That&#8217;s the real thing that happened.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p><em>Raya and the Last Dragon</em> is available on 4K, Blu-ray and DVD on now.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/raya-and-the-last-dragon-cut-storylines-interview/\">Details About &#8216;Raya and the Last Dragon&#8217; Cut Storylines, and How Hot Benja Sent the Crew Into a Frenzy [Interview]</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=PCqCmR_vROY:jPbYCB08vfs:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=PCqCmR_vROY:jPbYCB08vfs:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=PCqCmR_vROY:jPbYCB08vfs:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=PCqCmR_vROY:jPbYCB08vfs:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=PCqCmR_vROY:jPbYCB08vfs:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=PCqCmR_vROY:jPbYCB08vfs:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/PCqCmR_vROY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 18 May 2021 19:00:35 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/raya-and-the-last-dragon-benja-e1621214897208-700x299.jpeg","linkMd5":"ef7ade394624711656a260a7bbf5b6a7","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn32@2020_1/2021/05/19/14-55-45-108_84c8201e81479818.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":299,"sourceBytes":31238,"destBytes":20920,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/raya-and-the-last-dragon-benja-e1621214897208-700x299.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn32@2020_1/2021/05/19/14-55-45-108_84c8201e81479818.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn7@2020_5/2021/05/19/14-56-09-407_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=PCqCmR_vROY:jPbYCB08vfs:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn12@2020_2/2021/05/19/14-56-10-445_ddbcff1c03eee5c2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn91@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-10-903_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=PCqCmR_vROY:jPbYCB08vfs:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn11@2020_6/2021/05/19/14-56-08-365_166655cb4af1d174.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/PCqCmR_vROY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn35@2020_4/2021/05/19/14-56-10-594_fe0a1ae3304a9614.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1621436143835},{"createdTime":"2021-05-19 22:55:43","updatedTime":"2021-05-19 22:55:43","title":"‘Fear Street Trilogy’ Teaser: R.L.

What fun to see the horrors of Shadyside come to life!&#8221;</p>\n<p>All three <em>Fear Street</em> films are directed by Janiak. <strong>Phil Graziadei</strong> &#38; <strong>Leigh Janiak</strong> wrote <em>Part 1: 1994</em>, <strong>Zak Olkewicz</strong> and Leigh Janiak penned <em>Part 2: 1978</em>, and Phil Graziadei &#38; Leigh Janiak and <strong>Kate Trefry</strong> wrote the script for <em>Part 3: 1666</em>. The cast for all three films include stars such as <strong>Maya Hawke</strong>, <strong>Sadie Sink</strong>, <strong>Gillian Jacobs</strong>, and more.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the synopsis for the <em>Fear Street Trilogy</em>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In 1994, a group of teenagers discovers that the terrifying events that have haunted their town for generations may all be connected — and that they may be the next targets. Based on R.L. Stine’s best selling horror series, the trilogy follows the nightmare through Shadyside’s sinister history.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The <em>Fear Street Trilogy</em> begins streaming on Netflix on <strong>July 2, 2021.</strong></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-672171\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/FearStreet_Teaser_9x16-700x1244.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"1244\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/FearStreet_Teaser_9x16-700x1244.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/FearStreet_Teaser_9x16-281x500.jpg 281w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/FearStreet_Teaser_9x16-768x1365.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/FearStreet_Teaser_9x16.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/fear-street-trilogy-teaser/\">&#8216;Fear Street Trilogy&#8217; Teaser: R.L.

With the Marvel Legends Series Nano Gauntlet, fans of the era-defining Marvel Cinematic Universe can own a premium electronic roleplay item worthy of superheroes like Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, and Captain Marvel.</p>\n<p>Bring home an iconic piece of Avengers movie lore. Featuring 5 highly articulated electronic fingers, 6 Infinity Stone accessories with pulsating light effects, movie-inspired sound FX including the climactic snap! and a sleek open hand display mode, this premium Iron Man Nano Gauntlet roleplay item makes a great gift for fans of Marvel’s Infinity Saga.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The flexible material in the glove that allows for the final snap by Tony Stark is a nice touch. Unfortunately it means that the gloves looks a little odd when in a snapping motion because it gets wrinkly in the thumb. But it&#8217;s a small price to pay for a prop replica that lets you recreate the iconic conclusion from <em>Avengers: Endgame</em>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-672147 aligncenter\"
