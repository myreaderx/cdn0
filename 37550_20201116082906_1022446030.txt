No vote watchers or observers allowed, vote tabulated by a radical left privately owned company, Dominion, with a bad reputation &#38; bum equipment that couldn’t even qualify for Texas (which I won by a lot!), the Fake &#38; Silent Media, &#38; more!” Trump tweeted.</p>\n<p>&#8220;All of the mechanical &#8216;glitches&#8217; that took place on Election Night were really them getting caught trying to steal votes. They succeeded plenty, however, without getting caught,&#8221; the president added in a subsequent tweet. &#8220;Mail-in elections are a sick joke!&#8221;</p>\n<p>The tweets, like many of Trump’s recent posts about the election, were flagged by Twitter as containing disputed claims about election fraud.</p>\n<p>Reacting to the Republican president’s tweets on Sunday, Biden’s incoming Chief of Staff Ron Klain said the election result was a decision made by the American people and that he accepted the tweets “as a further confirmation of the reality that Joe Biden won the election.”</p>\n<p>Klain went on to say that, “He won because he got more votes, in the popular vote by a lot and he won the same number of electoral votes that President Trump called a landslide four years ago.”</p>\n<p>The top aide also called on the federal government to approve transition this week so that Biden’s team could access national security briefings.</p>\n<p>“What we really want to see this week is the General Services Administration (GSA) issue that ascertainment,” Klain said, which would enable Biden’s team to meet with public health officials and receive intelligence briefings. “That’s really the measure of how this is moving forward this week, I think.”</p>\n<p>Trump later in the morning said his tweet was not meant as a concession and backtracked after saying Biden had “won.”</p>\n<p>“He only won in the eyes of the FAKE NEWS MEDIA. I concede NOTHING! We have a long way to go,” Trump said in a follow-up post.</p>\n<p>Biden won the US presidential election on November 3 and solidified his victory on Friday with a projected win in the state of Georgia, becoming the first Democratic candidate to take the state since 1992.</p>\n<p>Biden now enjoys 306 votes in the Electoral College and far exceeds the 270 threshold to win presidency.</p>\n<p>However, Trump has so far refused to concede defeat to his Democratic rival and launched a flurry of legal challenges in key states, making unsubstantiated allegations of widespread electoral fraud though his efforts have yet to yield any fruit.</p>\n<p>Several US states have over the past two weeks been the scene of rival protests on a daily basis, which has led to the further deepening of a political chasm among American politicians long defending the US election system and polarizing the chaos-ridden US society.</p>\n<p>A coalition of state and federal election officials on Thursday released a statement saying that there was “no evidence” that any voting system was compromised or votes lost during the recent general election. They underlined that the vote was the most secure election in American history.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 08:18:42 +0000","feedId":37550,"bgimg":"https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2020/09/manar-06126720016010220891.jpg","linkMd5":"105c015e4416304d9b0237b833b37449","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn24@2020_3/2020/11/16/08-29-05-593_704c71d1bfbd09d3.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":576,"sourceBytes":186459,"destBytes":28008,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2020/09/manar-06126720016010220891.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn24@2020_3/2020/11/16/08-29-05-593_704c71d1bfbd09d3.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605515343719}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-11-16 16:29:03","updatedTime":"2020-11-16 16:29:03","feedId":37550,"fetchDate":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 08:29:03 +0000","fetchMs":63755,"handleMs":7,"totalMs":66703,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"40ace73c106547fe13d820d5a8d040ba","hostName":"us-037*","requestId":"68546822922d4cdd965423ffa344e4bc_37550","contentType":"application/rss+xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":28008,"bgimgsTotal":1,"bgimgsGithubTotal":1,"articlesImgsTotal":1,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":1,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx15":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 03:11:16","updatedTime":"2020-09-07 05:26:08","id":37550,"name":"Al-Manar TV Lebanon","url":"http://www.almanar.com.lb/english/rss.php","subscriber":86,"website":null,"icon":"http://english.almanar.com.lb/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx64/cdn82@2020_4/2020/09/06/21-26-07-340_3b702dfbe6af5085.jpg","description":"","weekly":null,"link":null},"noPictureArticleList":[],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":28008,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1605515279951,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":63761,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":7,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":1,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":1,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"}]},"extra5":1,"extra6":1,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[{"code":1,"isDone":false,"source":"https://english.almanar.com.lb/framework/includes/uploads/2020/09/manar-06126720016010220891.jpg","sourceStatusCode":200,"destWidth":1024,"destHeight":576,"fixedGithubDest":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn24@2020_3/2020/11/16/08-29-05-593_704c71d1bfbd09d3.webp","sourceBytes":186459,"destBytes":28008,"targetWebpQuality":75,"feedId":37550,"totalSpendMs":2786,"convertSpendMs":27,"createdTime":"2020-11-16 16:29:03","host":"europe63*","referer":"http://external.english.almanar.com.lb/?p=1198573","linkMd5ListStr":"105c015e4416304d9b0237b833b37449,105c015e4416304d9b0237b833b37449","githubUser":"myreaderx15","githubHttpCode":201,"extra22GetBytesInfo":"1、没有Referer字段","extra23historyStatusCode":[200],"destSize":"27.4 KB","compressRate":"15%","sourceSize":"182.1 KB"}],"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx15":1},"failGithubMap":{}}
