Being gang raped when I was 17 really didn&#8217;t help. Got in with the wrong crowd, there were seven of them, they would take one of us into the wood and basically all rape us one by one. And then you&#8217;d go back and they&#8217;d take the next girl and do the same with her. You could fight and scream as mych as you want but you were in a wood and no one could hear. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It screws you up and you learn not to trust men. You have all those feelings that you had when it was happening, anger, fear, pain, all of those and they stay with you. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I became a Christian, I joined a local church, I didn&#8217;t have sex for 40 years. I prayed, &#8216;Dear God help me with this.&#8217; I got to the point where I thought, &#8216;if there is a God, he doesn&#8217;t give a s**t about me&#8217;.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_12486048\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-24-at-15.06.22-1.png?strip=all&#38;w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-12486048\" width=\"960\" height=\"960\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>Channel 4</figcredit></figure>Siobhan tells filmmakers she was last gifted flowers when a friend popped round to show her the size of his penis[/caption]\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier in the programme Siobhan had left viewers gobsmacked using X-rated language as she spoke of her insatiable sex drive and showed off her &#8220;playroom&#8221; and bag of sex toys.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Siobhan told filmmakers she was gifted flowers when a friend popped round to show her the size of his penis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The most sessions I&#8217;ve had in a day is probably three or four,&#8221; Siobhan says in the documentary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;One reason why I may not have married is I think I may get bored just with one person.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her &#8220;playroom&#8221; has floral bedsheets and looks like a normal spare room with violet painted walls and teddy bears on the bed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There, she has as many as eight men in their 20s over for debauched orgies.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_12485952\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-24-at-15.04.52.png?strip=all&#38;w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-12485952\" width=\"960\" height=\"824\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>Channel 4</figcredit></figure>Siobhan, 67, shared the intimate details of her swinger sex life in a new Channel 4 documentary called Swingers[/caption]\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;When I first did this I couldn‚Äôt believe a twenty-year-old would want to have sex with a sixty something year old, but they do, and I‚Äôm happy to oblige,&#8221; she says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She adds: ‚ÄúSwinging is very empowering.

He was diagnosed with cancer and spent a couple of years on the couch unwell. I‚Äôd do little performances for him. He‚Äôd encourage me to sing and dance for him and I‚Äôd massage his feet.</p> \n<p>‚ÄúI have lots of lovely memories of him.

You just get on with it. This is why I think therapy might have been a good thing because you don‚Äôt know what you hold in from your childhood.‚Äù</p> \n<p>Her dad Colin died in December 2016 and Sheridan explains: ‚ÄúI just didn‚Äôt handle the news well at all. Maybe it was because it was what my brother died of as well.</p> \n<p>‚ÄúIt caused a bit of an explosion mentally. It was like a bomb went off in my head.‚Äù</p> \n<p>The meltdown came as she peaked as a West End star, playing Fanny Brice in Funny Girl. Having appeared on TV shows such as The Royle Family and Two Pints of Lager and a Packets of Crisps, she was also lauded in the lead role of Elle Woods in London musical Legally Blonde from 2009.</p> \n<figure id=\"attachment_12489627\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 601px\">\n <img src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000460480901.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=591\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-12489627\" width=\"591\" height=\"959\" />\n <figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption>\n <figcredit>\n  ITV\n </figcredit>\n</figure>Actress Sheridan says she just wants to be a good mum[/caption] \n<p>But it was during the hit run that she started to suffer anxiety.</p> \n<p>Sheridan said: ‚ÄúI was going to different psychiatrists, getting different diagnoses.

I could just see my whole life unravelling.‚Äù</p> \n<p>Over the past three years, she‚Äôs done more TV including BBC1‚Äôs The Moorside and ITV‚Äôs Cleaning Up.

\n<p>Married to a hotshot film producer, building her own business empire and still dazzling with her beauty, Claudia is finally at ease with herself.</p> \n<p>She said: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a reason we have cakes and parties on our birthdays, and I feel the same way about getting older each year.</p> \n<p>‚ÄúI am so happy to be turning 50 and have never felt more confident or happy. I don‚Äôt try to look or feel younger. I embrace now.‚Äù</p> \n<p>The blonde bombshell was first scouted aged just 17 while partying in a <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11733711/nursery-teacher-arrested-murder-old-jobs/\">Dusseldorf nightclub</a> with a pal. Despite shooting to fame, the 5ft 11in teen was plagued with doubt over her modelling career.</p> \n<p>She said: ‚ÄúI thought they were making a mistake and would find out I was the wrong girl and send me home once I arrived in Paris.‚Äù</p> \n<h2>FINALLY AT EASE</h2> \n<p>But soon, Claudia was one of the most in-demand models on the ‚Äô90s catwalks, modelling for <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/12397872/gucci-chanel-louis-vuitton-most-ripped-off-brands-spot-real-fake/\">Chanel</a>, Versace and Yves Saint Laurent and fronting an ad campaign for Guess Jeans.</p> \n<p>In her career, she has appeared on more than 1,000 magazine covers. But Claudia admitted she struggled with being in the spotlight.</p> \n<p>She said: ‚ÄúThe nerves before a catwalk show could be intense sometimes. I enjoyed them when they were over and we were all celebrating, but before I did not enjoy it.</p> \n<p>‚ÄúAnd getting there, I literally had to convince myself to go to each one. It was a very fast learning curve. Suddenly I was thrown into this world. I just thought, ‚ÄòClose your eyes and jump in‚Äô.‚Äù</p> \n<p>Known as the good girl of modelling, Claudia wasn‚Äôt tempted by the drink and drugs which swirled around the industry.</p> \n<figure id=\"attachment_12489258\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 10px\">\n <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000603261275.jpg\"><img src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000603261275.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=634\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-12489258\" /></a>\n <figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n  Claudia snapped in 1989 walking for Chanel\n </figcaption>\n <figcredit>\n  Getty Images - Getty\n </figcredit>\n</figure> \n<figure id=\"attachment_12489293\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 10px\">\n <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000463604144-e1598301979515.jpg\"><img src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000463604144-e1598301979515.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=616\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-12489293\" /></a>\n <figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n  The stunning model showed off her impressive figure in this catwalk snap from 1994\n </figcaption>\n <figcredit>\n  Rex Features\n </figcredit>\n</figure> \n<p>She said: ‚ÄúIn the beginning I didn‚Äôt even notice. I came from such a clean home. I was so naive. People would tell me afterwards that everybody in the studio was stoned except me, and I had no idea.</p> \n<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like to lose control over myself. I don‚Äôt like the feeling of not controlling what I‚Äôm saying or thinking.‚Äù</p> \n<p>Although she was relatively conservative by <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/models/\">model standards</a>, Schiffer soon became a sex symbol with her sultry looks.</p> \n<p>She said: ‚ÄúIt was insane, like being a rock star. You couldn‚Äôt get to your car unless a path was carved for you.</p> \n<p>‚ÄúPeople would cut holes in the fashion tents and try to take pictures of us. We had security at every fashion show.‚Äù</p> \n<h2>‚ÄòALL THE GHOSTS IN OUR HOUSE ARE LOVELY‚Äô</h2> \n<p>At the height of her <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10406097/the-sun-most-popular-website/\">popularity</a> she even employed a guard to keep an eye on her lingerie.</p> \n<p>Claudia said: ‚ÄúWhen I was out on the runway I‚Äôd come back and my underwear would be gone ‚Äî my bra, my knickers, gone!‚Äù</p> \n<p>While she could have her pick of any men, aged just 23, she found love with magician <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10809719/david-copperfield-more-fun-classic/\">David Copperfield</a> ‚Äî 13 years her senior ‚Äî after appearing on stage as his assistant.</p> \n<p>During their five-year engagement, David lived in New York and Claudia in Monaco. The pair eventually split in 1999. She soon met Lock, Stock and Snatch producer Matthew Vaughn, and in 2002 they married at St George‚Äôs Church in Shimpling, Suffolk.</p> \n<p>She said: ‚ÄúI just thought there‚Äôs no perfect man out there.

environment.</p>\n<p>Sixty-nine percent of those surveyed said they find being environmentally friendly an attractive trait in a partner.</p>\n<p>Conducted by OnePoll on behalf of&#160;<a

list for things respondents want to have in common with their partner was future/long-term plans, followed by having shared values and a complementary sense of humor.</p>\n<p><figure

that‚Äôs being a homebody or going out in the evenings.</p>\n<p>A third believe it‚Äôs important to share political opinions, while 27% want to have similar levels of political actions.</p>\n<p>And part of their political actions is how environmentally friendly they are: results revealed 53% believe a desire to protect the planet is sexy ‚Äî and 55% said it would be a dealbreaker if a potential partner believed climate change was a hoax.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúListening is fundamental to any partnership,‚Äù said Avocado Mattress cofounder and CMO Mark Abrials. ‚ÄúNot hearing the very real threats of climate change or dismissing our individual responsibility on this planet jeopardizes more than our relationships.

I had problems with addiction and fruit machines so I spent a lot of time in pubs with ne‚Äôer-do-wells but I found them fascinating.</p> \n<p>I didn‚Äôt know why I was watching these people but it turned out perfect because it all fed what I ended up doing. You have to live a life before you do comedy.</p> \n<p><strong>Thomson:</strong> I was doing character stand-up when they approached me. As an actor, what better platform is there for all your skill sets? I‚Äôd rather do a sketch show than any movie. It‚Äôs so nice to open up the dressing-up box and get the wigs on.</p> \n<p><strong>Weir:</strong> I‚Äôd acted on shows with Harry Enfield, Alexei Sayle and Lenny Henry. It would often say on the script, ‚ÄòWoman in sketch‚Äô or ‚ÄòMum‚Äô, so I didn‚Äôt feel like one of the gang for the first series.</p> \n<p>John, Caroline and Simon had done stand-up and I hadn‚Äôt, and Mark was very sure of himself. I had impostor syndrome.</p> \n<p><strong>Williams:</strong> I‚Äôd done Harry Enfield so I knew Paul and Charlie. Before that I‚Äôd been in the Royal Shakespeare Company.</p> \n<figure id=\"attachment_12488897\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\">\n <img src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000249124328.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-12488897\" width=\"960\" height=\"640\" />\n <figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption>\n <figcredit>\n  PA:Press Association\n </figcredit>\n</figure>The cast in 1997 with Caroline seated, second from right[/caption] \n<h3><strong>HOW DID THE IDEA COME ABOUT?</strong></h3> \n<p><strong>Higson: </strong>We wanted to have our own show but we weren‚Äôt sure how to make it different enough from Harry‚Äôs.</p> \n<p>Then we saw a highlights reel that Harry‚Äôs producer Geoffrey Perkins had made for the press and we thought, ‚ÄòWhy don‚Äôt we make a whole show like this? Get the characters on, cut it right to the bone and just show the funny bits‚Äô.</p> \n<p><strong>Whitehouse: </strong>We pretty much kept to that, although ironically the most popular characters were Ted and Ralph, which were quite long, slow sketches with no catchphrases.</p> \n<p><strong>Williams: </strong>I was very enthusiastic about the idea. I thought the sketch show was looking a bit stretched but I‚Äôd been brought up on Monty Python and Spike Milligan so I loved the idea of freshening it up.</p> \n<p><strong>Day: </strong>At the time, a lot of TV sketches were written by Cambridge types and they took the mickey out of politicians and we were the first ones who really did normal life.</p> \n<figure id=\"attachment_12488896\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\">\n <img src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000093661158.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-12488896\" width=\"960\" height=\"640\" />\n <figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption>\n <figcredit>\n  BBC\n </figcredit>\n</figure>Charlie as smoothie car salesman Toni in the 90s[/caption] \n<h3><strong>YOU ALL WROTE SKETCHES. HOW MUCH OF A TEAM EFFORT WAS IT?</strong></h3> \n<p><strong>Day: </strong>It‚Äôs like putting together a football team. You‚Äôve got to make sure it‚Äôs well balanced and not just 11 Messis or Ronaldos. Mark did the very quick ones, whereas my stuff was much more wordy.</p> \n<p><strong>Williams:</strong> We all wrote, and Paul and Charlie would referee who got to act in them. But we all wanted to be them all. We all wanted to be Ted and Ralph in particular. It was like trying to get yourself picked for the football team.</p> \n<p><strong>Weir:</strong> It‚Äôs like the old rock and roll thing ‚Äî you might not have written Jumpin‚Äô Jack Flash if you hadn‚Äôt all been in the room. Paul and Charlie had worked with other people and been the also-rans and they thought, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre not going to do that to someone else‚Äô.</p> \n<figure id=\"attachment_12488891\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\">\n <img src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000089236490-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-12488891\" width=\"960\" height=\"640\" />\n <figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption>\n <figcredit>\n  BBC\n </figcredit>\n</figure>Paul and Charlie as Ted and Ralph[/caption] \n<h3>WHEN DID YOU REALISE HOW BIG IT HAD BECOME?</h3> \n<p><strong>Thomson:</strong> It was a grower. It‚Äôs edgy and a bit cult. Quite a few bands loved The Fast Show because it was the go-to tour bus DVD.</p> \n<p>I was in the Groucho Club with Shaun Ryder and Bez (from the Happy Mondays) and the manager came up and I was told Johnny Depp wanted to meet me. I stayed up until 4am talking to him.</p> \n<p><strong>Whitehouse:</strong> A lot of musicians liked The Fast Show because they were always off their nuts after a gig and didn‚Äôt realise it was pretty much the same sketch every week.</p> \n<figure id=\"attachment_12488893\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 650px\">\n <img src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000093700900.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=640\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-12488893\" width=\"640\" height=\"960\" />\n <figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption>\n <figcredit>\n  Handout\n </figcredit>\n</figure>The Jazz Club guy is played by John Thomson[/caption] \n<h3>DID YOU HAVE ANY TREPIDATION ABOUT MAKING NEW SKETCHES FOR THE REUNION SHOW?</h3> \n<p><strong>Higson: </strong>We‚Äôve always tried to keep as high a quality control as possible, which is how we‚Äôve ended up making less money than people who just bash them out!</p> \n<p><strong>Weir: </strong>I don‚Äôt want to pay ¬£200 to see Madonna and see an old woman with a Zimmer frame, I want to see her deliver. So of course you approach this with some trepidation. The Fast Show is the genesis of us all going up a level in our careers so if we just went, ‚ÄòSure, let‚Äôs phone it in for a few quid‚Äô, it would be like treating your first-born badly.</p> \n<figure id=\"attachment_12488894\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 694px\">\n <img src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000435506537.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=684\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-12488894\" width=\"684\" height=\"960\" />\n <figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption>\n <figcredit>\n  PA:Press Association\n </figcredit>\n</figure>Comedians Paul Whitehouse and Charlie Higson also star in the show[/caption] \n<h3>WERE THERE ANY CHARACTERS YOU LEFT OUT BECAUSE THEY HAVEN‚ÄôT AGED WELL?</h3> \n<p><strong>Higson:</strong> Ted and Ralph. We did think about doing something where maybe Ted had died, but then we thought, ‚ÄòNo, let‚Äôs just leave it there as a good memory rather than trample all over that‚Äô. In my mind they are still there, not managing to talk to each other. Their relationship can never be and will never be resolved.</p> \n<p><strong>Day: </strong>I don‚Äôt really do Dave Angel these days because global warming isn‚Äôt funny any more. But bringing Greta Thunberg into it was an obvious way of doing it.</p> \n<figure id=\"attachment_12488888\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 762px\">\n <img src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000000045863.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=752\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-12488888\" width=\"752\" height=\"960\" />\n <figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption>\n <figcredit>\n  BBC\n </figcredit>\n</figure>Paul Whitehouse‚Äôs Fast Show creation Ron Manager[/caption] \n<h3>WHICH IS YOUR MOST POPULAR CHARACTER?</h3> \n<p><strong>Higson: </strong>Swiss Toni. People are always saying things are like making love to a beautiful woman. And actually the depressed artist too.</p> \n<p><strong>Day: </strong>Dave Angel ‚Äî people love his walk. And Competitive Dad. So many dads come up to me. I didn‚Äôt know at the time he would be so popular.</p> \n<p><strong>Thomson:</strong> Jazz Club guy. People still say ‚ÄòNice‚Äô to me all the time. People think the catchphrase is ‚ÄòJazz‚Äô but I never say that! It‚Äôs ‚ÄòNice‚Äô or ‚ÄòGreat‚Äô.</p> \n<figure id=\"attachment_12488886\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 714px\">\n <img src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000000038657.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=704\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-12488886\" width=\"704\" height=\"960\" />\n <figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption>\n <figcredit>\n  BBC\n </figcredit>\n</figure>Mark Williams says he has always been very enthusiastic about the show[/caption] \n<h3>DID YOU EVER MEET THE REAL-LIFE PEOPLE WHO INSPIRED SOME OF YOUR SKETCHES?</h3> \n<p><strong>Day: </strong>I know someone who met (comedian and EastEnders star) Mike Reid and did a Dave Angel impression and apparently he went, ‚ÄòOi, we don‚Äôt talk about that around here‚Äô. If I‚Äôd met him I‚Äôd have been terrified.</p> \n<p>The witch doctor was based on Jay Kay from Jamiroquai. I‚Äôve heard members of the band thought it was very funny but Jay Kay wasn‚Äôt keen. I think he was probably a bit starry.</p> \n<p><strong>Whitehouse: </strong>Not The Fast Show, but there were one or two DJs who didn‚Äôt like Smashy and Nicey that me and Harry used to do. Dave Lee Travis didn‚Äôt like it. He did some tirade about how c**p they were.</p> \n<figure id=\"attachment_12488887\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\">\n <img src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000001306280.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-12488887\" width=\"960\" height=\"824\" />\n <figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption>\n <figcredit>\n  BBC\n </figcredit>\n</figure>Paul Whitehouse as ‚ÄòBrilliant‚Äô in The Fast Show[/caption] \n<h2>WHAT ARE YOUR MEMORIES OF THE FAST SHOW‚ÄôS LIVE TOUR?</h2> \n<p><strong>Higson: </strong>We did a 32-night residency with Shooting Stars at the Hammersmith Apollo, then a tour of stadiums.</p> \n<p>It was like a major rock tour with three huge lorries, a coach, a make-up team and supporting artists. Our promotor had Peter Kay on tour at the same time and that was just him and a sound man in a car with a microphone. Who do you think made more money? But it was huge fun.</p> \n<p><strong>Weir: </strong>It was a bit too ‚Äòlads on tour‚Äô because they were in nightclubs ‚Äôtil 3am whereas I was driving 250 miles back home every night so I could be there for the children in the morning.</p> \n<p>It was very punishing with young children but nothing comes close to the feeling when you walk out on stage and before you‚Äôve said anything, 4,000 people start cheering.</p> \n<!--googleoff: all--> \n<div class=\"sun-grid-container sun-grid-container--white\"> \n <div class=\"sun-row \"> \n  <div class=\"col sun-col-6\"> \n   <div class=\"rail

while referring to a 2018 incident the two had when <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/aramroston/jerry-falwell-jr-michael-cohen-pool-attendant-lawsuit\">they launched a business togethe</a>r, only for Trump&#8217;s fixer Michael Cohen to get involved when Granda claimed he had been wrongly cut out.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Over the course of the last few months this person&#8217;s behavior has reached a level that we have decided the only way to stop this predatory behavior is to go public,&#8221;

sweltering heat for making mistakes in a dance routine practice, her family claim.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Phornphiphat Eaddam, 20, was taking part in an event on the volleyball court at the Phuket Ratchapat University in southern <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/thailand/\">Thailand</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_12489133\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img

died in hospital the following day [/caption]\n\n\n\n<p>But she reportedly made mistakes during the routine and was ordered to run eight laps of the court in the heat without any water.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Phornphiphat, whose nickname was &#8216;Mint&#8217;, collapsed on the seventh lap and was rushed to the Vachira Phuket Hospital where she was treated in the intensive care unit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next day the student&#8217;s heart stopped functioning for 16 minutes and medics were unable to revive her.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Phornphiphat&#8217;s devastated family have now made a police complaint after university bosses allegedly wrongly told them that she had died from fainting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her older sister Wilawan said that doctors found Phornphiphat&#8217;s lungs were bleeding and that she died of extreme physical exertion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Phornphiphat had had no pre-existing medical conditions, her family say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her grieving father, Kanong Eaddam, 43, said the family was told his daughter was rushed to hospital after cheerleading practice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‚ÄúWe drove to the hospital and found my daughter was already in intensive care. She could not make it, she later died after she had been given CPR,‚Äù he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kanong said he wants the university and the cheerleading team to tell the truth about his daughter&#8217;s death.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The university dean Theerapong Noochaikaew claimed that Phornphiphat&#8217;s &#160;death was not related to &#8221;hazing&#8221;, a form of university initiation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We need to wait for the post-mortem examination, and during this time we will question more witnesses. It was not university hazing, it was just one of the sports activities,‚Äù he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‚ÄúThe finding of the inquiry will be made public later.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n\t<!--googleoff:

slowly approaching the youngster who somehow managed to stay sitting calmly on her blow-up steed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An amazing video captured the moment she was safely plucked from the sea and rescued by the ferry team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://greekcitytimes.com/2020/08/25/girl-floating-on-unicorn-saved-by/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Greek City Times reports</a> she

club&#8217;s usual philosophy with players over 30[/caption]\n\n\n\n<p>The club have just seen his fellow Brazilian, winger Willian ‚Äî 32 and still one of their best performers ‚Äî <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/12400669/arsenal-transfer-news-willian-free-chelsea/\">quit to join Arsenal because of ageism</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He wanted a three-year contract but was only offered two, so walked into the welcoming arms of a major rival.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spanish forward Pedro, 33, one of the most highly decorated players in the world,<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/12232107/pedro-leaves-chelsea-roma/\"> left last month and has since joined Roma</a> on a free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stamford Bridge is no country for old men ‚Äî unless your defence is an embarrassment and needs a quick fix.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this explains why Chelsea are so <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/12488259/chelsea-agree-thiago-silva-deal/\">keen to wave ‚ÄòHello‚Äô to Thiago Silva</a> before the door has even shut behind Willian and Pedro.</p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/AD-SPORT-GRAPHIC-Chelsea-Top-Fixtures.jpg\"><img

head, battle-scarred but refusing to call it quits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frank Lampard does not have an issue with age.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He was desperate to keep Willian but it is the people upstairs who dig in when &#160;it comes to holding on to old soldiers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be closer to 40 than 30 and playing all 90 minutes of a Champions League final says more than any commentator could.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fact PSG manager Thomas Tuchel wants Silva to stay, when the defender‚Äôs age could be trumped up as a reason behind the defeat by Bayern Munich, is another tell-tale sign.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<h3><strong><a

by making a play for him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chelsea‚Äôs defence tired towards the end of the last, elongated season and mistakes crept in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They were done over by West Ham, humiliated at Sheffield United, taken to the brink by Crystal Palace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Antonio Rudiger remains highly regarded but a freak injury led to a twisted groin and time on the sidelines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He was supposed to be the mainstay at the back but became more unreliable as the season went on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Andreas Christensen has failed to convince Lamps on a consistent basis that he can lead the defence into the next ten years.</p>\n\n\n\n\t<!--googleoff: all-->\n\t\t<div class=\"sun-grid-container sun-grid-container--white\">\n\t\n\t<div class=\"sun-row \">\n\t\t<div class=\"col

a way to sign Lionel Messi this summer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Barcelona superstar has indicated that he may decide to leave Camp Nou, if he concludes that he can&#8217;t win the game&#8217;s biggest trophies there in the remainder of his peak.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_12489703\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img

looking into whether they could feasibly pounce to sign the 33-year-old within the rules of Financial Fair Play.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Barca have so far indicated that they would demand his ¬£631million release clause to be paid in full in order to let him go, <a

talisman, should it allow them to reinvest in the rest of their team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Messi last week met with new coach Ronald Koeman, amid his frustration at their recent Champions League exits at the hands of AS Roma, Liverpool and worst of all Bayern Munich.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with just a year remaining on his contract, his future hangs in the balance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Financial experts believe that the deal would be impossible to do, however, given the current situation with the coronavirus pandemic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But City will leave no stone unturned &#8211; even given the scrutiny they are under following their triumph over Uefa in the Court of Arbitration for Sport.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Barcelona wait nervously as Messi continues to remain silent publicly in the wake of his

To agree economic restrictions to prevent us undercutting them and keep us under their thumb.</p> \n<p>They simply must change the record <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12489673/brussels-gloom-about-clinching-brexit-trade-deal-as-talks-enter-final-three-weeks-before-deadline/\">if they‚Äôre genuinely worried</a> about the potential hardship of us trading on WTO terms ‚Äî and them copping the blame. No objective person will fault Britain for sticking to its guns on principles so fundamental.</p> \n<p>Michel Barnier won‚Äôt get his way. He and those pulling his strings seem strangely unable to digest that the Theresa May regime is gone, that voters threw out the Remainer Parliament and installed committed Brexiteers instead.</p> \n<p>We do agree with Barnier that negotiations seem dead in the water and a ‚Äúno deal‚Äù looks nailed on.

But if that is the impetus they need as a last resort to conquer their Covid fear, so be it.</strong></p> \n<p>Normal sanctions must apply once schools go back, as even Labour agrees they must. The five-month hiatus has been a disaster for many kids‚Äô education and mental health and widened further the gap between state and private schools.</p> \n<figure id=\"attachment_12490072\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\">\n <img src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000571772971.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-12490072\" width=\"960\" height=\"640\" />\n <figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption>\n <figcredit>\n  Alamy\n </figcredit>\n</figure>The Government is ramping up the campaign to get all kids back to school [/caption] \n<p>It is vital that we also maintain calm perspective if the virus does break out in some schools, as it inevitably will.</p> \n<p>Too many are terrified simply by an uptick in cases.

Doing so only manipulates history and creates confusion.</strong></p> \n<p>The BBC was last night facing a storm of anger over a proposal to drop Rule, Britannia! and Land Of Hope And Glory from the Last Night of the Proms.</p> \n<figure id=\"attachment_12489510\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\">\n <img src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000246710375.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-12489510\" width=\"960\" height=\"639\" />\n <figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption>\n <figcredit>\n  PA:Press Association\n </figcredit>\n</figure>We shouldn‚Äôt be bothering ourselves about whether those songs should now be removed, says Geoff Palmer[/caption] \n<p>Finnish conductor Dalia Stasevska, 35, is said to be keen to modernise the show and cut its patriotic elements, while critics accuse the Beeb of <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/uknews/12476359/rule-britannia-land-hope-glory-black-lives-matter-bbc-proms/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">pandering to the woke cancel culture and of ignoring the history of the anthems.</a></p> \n<p>Both the PM and his culture secretary Oliver Dowden involved themselves in the row, with the latter saying he believed that Rule, Britannia! and Land Of Hope And Glory are ‚Äòhighlights‚Äô of the performance while adding: ‚ÄúConfident, forward-looking nations don‚Äôt erase their history, they add to it.‚Äù</p> \n<p>But then late in the day the BBC took the side of the woke cancel brigade in an extraordinary fudge.</p> \n<p>The orchestra will play the tunes of both songs ‚Äî but nobody will sing the all-important words. Usually there is at least a soloist, if not a full choir leading the audience, but of course this year the public seats in the hall will be empty because of the virus, and the voices on stage silenced.</p> \n<p>Now, the lyrics of both songs are pro-colonial. If you <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12486053/bbc-rule-britannia-land-of-hope-and-glory-proms-woke-blm/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ban them from the Last Night of the Proms,</a> ending a tradition going back decades, what consequences will that have?</p> \n<p>Certainly, someone 100 years from now will say we shouldn‚Äôt have done that.</p> \n<p>It is the same argument for not taking down statues. If you remove statues because that person stands for something evil in their past, you are removing the deed too.</p> \n<p>Manipulating history only adds to mistrust among the black community.</p> \n<p>I would like to see the survey that says the public want these two songs taken out of the Proms programme, because it appears to me that the public hasn‚Äôt been consulted.</p> \n<p>Rule, Britannia! was written by Scottish poet James Thomson and he features on the famous Scott Monument in Edinburgh, near where I live.</p> \n<h2>‚ÄòWE SHOULDN‚ÄôT HIDE IT‚Äô</h2> \n<p>He is also commemorated in Westminster Abbey‚Äôs Poets‚Äô Corner, next to William Shakespeare.</p> \n<p>If we say we must remove his words from the Proms, do we then remove the memorials too?</p> \n<p>Rule, Britannia!, written and set to music in 1740, was mentioned in James Joyce‚Äôs novel, Ulysses. It is part of my history and my culture. If we take it away, we take away part of my culture.</p> \n<p>It‚Äôs a song about the power structure at the time, and the arrogance and hypocrisy of Britain vowing to ‚Äúnever be slaves‚Äù while at the same time owning and benefiting from about 800,000 black chattel slaves in the West Indies who were called ‚Äòproperty‚Äô.</p> \n<p>Of course, people are sensitive to its meaning, as well as Land Of Hope And Glory, the music of which was written by Edward Elgar.</p> \n<p>It doesn‚Äôt mean we should hide it.</p> \n<p>I personally don‚Äôt find the lyrics offensive because they are a true representation of the terrible truth at the time.</p> \n<p>If you take that away, then you are replacing history with a fairy story.</p> \n<p>There is also the possibility that it was written to show the evil of the time, rather than glorifying it.</p> \n<p>The objection is that Rule, Britannia! is used by flag-waving ‚Äúprommers‚Äù as a jubilant finale at the Proms.</p> \n<h2>‚ÄòJUBILANT FINALE‚Äô</h2> \n<p>It is used in the wrong context, and that is part of the ignorance of our society of our history.</p> \n<p>It‚Äôs the same with Amazing Grace, which was written by a slaver of black people and is sung as a religious anthem.</p> \n<p>Recently, it was proposed that we should ban Swing Low, Sweet Chariot at rugby matches due to its link to slavery. That came to nothing.</p> \n<p>Instead of banning such songs or stripping away their lyrics, we need to educate people on the history of slavery, starting with putting it on the history curriculum.</p> \n<p>From speaking to people about slavery, the one constant reaction is always: ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt anyone tell us this before?‚Äù</p> \n<p>At the Proms, instead of taking the words away, we should put an explanation in the programme. We should tell people it‚Äôs about enslaving black people, making money from them, giving them a short life span and then compensating the slave owners when it was abolished because slaves were regarded as ‚Äòproperty‚Äô.</p> \n<p>If they want to sing it after reading that, then fine, go ahead and sing it. But I bet they won‚Äôt sing it as joyfully as they might have done before.</p> \n<p>When I worked in research, I once had a lovely technician who worked for me. She looked after me so well, and she went to the Proms.</p> \n<p>If she knew the history of those two songs, being my friend, I doubt she would have sung along.</p> \n<p>It wasn‚Äôt her fault that she didn‚Äôt know the history.</p> \n<p>Those songs didn‚Äôt have a place in the Proms in the first place, they are there because of people‚Äôs ignorance. I would challenge anyone to know their meanings and still sing them in a frivolous capacity.</p> \n<!--googleoff: all--> \n<div class=\"sun-grid-container sun-grid-container--white\"> \n <div

Or dab the stain with milk, let it soak for a few hours and put in the washing machine as normal.</p> \n<p><strong>2) DYE FADED UNIFORMS</strong>: Refresh clothes with inexpensive dyes in your washing machine. Cotton and nylon show the best results, whereas polyester and acetate are more difficult to colour.</p> \n<p><strong>3) CLEAN TUPPERWARE WITH BAKING SODA</strong>: This magical household essential removes yellow stains from <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/food/8720946/lunchbox-plastic-stains-minutes-cleaning-hack/\">plastic lunchboxes</a>.</p> \n<p>Add water to make a thick paste and rub it into the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/12268637/clean-tupperware-stains-under-a-minute-no-scrubbing/\">Tupperware</a>, leave overnight, then rinse.</p> \n<p><strong>4) FRESHEN SMELLY BOOTS WITH</strong> <strong>TEABAGS</strong>: Place a dry teabag into shoes then leave them in a warm place overnight.</p> \n<p>Put one at the bottom of a school bag to absorb any odours.

Leave on for 20 minutes, then comb out the lice and nits.</p> \n<p><strong>13) REMOVE GRASS STAINS WITH VINEGAR:</strong> Apply a paste of baking soda and water to the stains, then scrub with a brush dipped in <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/11365458/paul-ogrady-coronavirus-vinegar/\">vinegar</a>.

The dividers will help you get at what you need quickly and easily.</p> \n<p><strong>16) NAIL VARNISH STOPS BUTTONS PINGING OFF:</strong> Put away your sewing kit and instead dab clear nail varnish over the front of the buttons to strengthen the thread.

Prosecutors said he pulled her into his truck as she skated on rollerblades back to her Kansas home after buying some cookies.</p>\n<p>Nelson‚Äôs execution is scheduled for August 28. The execution of Lezmond Mitchell, the only Native American on federal death row, is set for August 26. His lawyers have made similar arguments.</p>\n<p>The American Civil Liberties Union called the recent re-start of federal executions &#8220;a truly dark period for our country,&#8221; and criticized the federal government for executing Purkey.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There was no reason for this administration to restart federal executions now &#8212; after a nearly two-decade hiatus, during the worst public health crisis of our lifetime &#8212; except to distract from its mainly failings, particularly its failure to keep people safe during this pandemic,&#8221; Cassandra Stubbs, director of the ACLU&#8217;s Capital Punishment Project said.</p>\n<p>Department of Justice spokesperson Kerri Kupec defended the administration&#8217;s resumption of the federal death penalty, saying: &#8220;After many years of litigation following the death of his victims, in which he lived and was afforded every due process of law under our Constitution, Purkey has finally faced justice.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The death penalty has been upheld by the federal courts, supported on a bipartisan basis by Congress, and approved by Attorneys General under both Democratic and Republican administrations as the appropriate sentence for the most egregious federal crimes,&#8221; Kupec said.</p>\n<p>Previous court rulings have concluded pentobarbital injections are humane.</p>\n<p>And even if some pain is involved, that doesn‚Äôt render an execution method inhumane, government attorneys argued, citing a 2008 Supreme Court ruling.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúSimply because an execution method may result in pain, either by accident or as an inescapable consequence of death, does not establish the sort of ‚Äòobjectively intolerable risk of harm‚Äô that qualifies as cruel and unusual,‚Äù the high court said.</p>\n<p>\t\t<!-- Start of Brightcove Player -->\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"display: block; position: relative; min-width: 0px; max-width: 640px;\">\n\t\t\t\t<div style=\"padding-top: 56%; \">\n\t\t\t\t\t<video\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdata-video-id=\"6171556538001\" data-account=\"5067014667001\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdata-player=\"pV1KxHf2t\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdata-usage=\"cms:wordpress:5.4.2:1.7.0:javascript\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdata-embed=\"default\" class=\"video-js\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcontrols  \t\t\t\t\t\t\tstyle=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; top: 0; bottom: 0; right: 0; left: 0;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t</video>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<script src=\"https://players.brightcove.net/5067014667001/pV1KxHf2t_default/index.min.js\"></script>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t<!-- End of Brightcove Player -->\n\n\t\t</p>\n<p>Nelson‚Äôs lawyers are seeking all executions to be permanently suspended.

transfer target for Paris Saint-Germain[/caption]\n\n\n\n<p>Thilo Kehrer played the position in the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/12479502/psg-bayern-coman-champions-league-neymar/\">defeat to Bayern Munich in Lisbon</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas Meunier left as a free agent upon the end of his contract in June before <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/11954473/thomas-meunier-borussia-dortmund-free-transfer-four-year-deal/\">joining Borussia Dortmund</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/team/1250213/paris-saint-germain/\">PSG</a> boss Thomas Tuchel does have France Under-21 international Colin Dagba in his squad. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, according to <a href=\"https://rmcsport.bfmtv.com/football/mercato-en-direct-les-infos-et-rumeurs-du-lundi-24-aout-4641.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">RMC Sport</a>, Arsenal star <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/hector-bellerin/\">Bellerin</a> is one name on the Ligue 1 champions&#8217; radar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Spanish defender, 25, joined <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/team/1196653/arsenal/\">Arsenal</a> from the Barcelona academy in 2011, and has gone on to make 204 appearances in all competitions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But he has endured a difficult time in recent seasons with lengthy injury lay-offs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/12065419/arsenal-transfer-news-bellerin-sevilla-juventus-inter-milan/\">Bellerin was also linked with Atletico Madrid, Juventus, Sevilla, Inter Milan and Bayern Munich</a> this summer &#8211; although the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/12105499/arsenal-bellerin-desperate-transfer-bayern-munich/\">Germans reportedly snubbed him over concerns about his defensive qualities</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the Arsenal vice-captain &#8211; under contract until 2023 &#8211; is Mikel Arteta&#8217;s first-choice right-back, in both a back four and a back five.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/12116744/arsenal-transfer-news-live-willian-aubameyang-partey/\"><strong>ARSENAL NEWS LIVE: Click here for the latest Gunners news</strong></a></h3>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it is unlikely the Gunners boss would be willing to let Bellerin go, especially with only Cedric Soares the only direct replacement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ainsley Maitland-Niles previously filled in at right-back but will leave the Emirates in the current transfer window, with Wolves closing in on a deal</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Arsenal hero <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/12464849/arsenal-transfer-hector-bellerin-charlie-nicholas/\">Charlie Nicholas believes his former side should consider flogging Bellerin</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\t<!--googleoff: all-->\n\t\t<div class=\"sun-grid-container sun-grid-container--white\">\n\t\n\t<div

He is keen for the Manchester United centre-back to feature but there is no way he could be selected if found guilty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Liverpool duo&#160;Jordan Henderson and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain &#160;have both been sidelined with knee injuries, while Ben Chilwell of Leicester has a foot problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a

first squad in 15 months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Southgate has not ruled out once again using a back three in the same way he did in the 2018 World Cup, when England reached the semi-finals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And

left-back issue, with Chilwell crocked and Luke Shaw returning from injury, there could be a shock selection for United‚Äôs Brandon Williams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aston Villa skipper Jack Grealish will hope to get a call-up by Southgate, who has also been checking with Arsenal regarding the medical record of Ainsley Maitland-Niles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The England boss was given another headache with Raheem Sterling attending a Covid-hit party in Jamaica for sprint legend Usain Bolt‚Äôs birthday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The City forward, 25, will be named in the squad but will be tested before he is allowed to join up with the group.</p>\n\n\n\n\t<!--googleoff: all-->\n\t\t<div class=\"sun-grid-container sun-grid-container--white\">\n\t\n\t<div class=\"sun-row \">\n\t\t<div class=\"col

family</figcaption><figcredit></figcredit></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Although, apparently, Maguire doesn‚Äôt have a taste for the shorts and shots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a piece about the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/12473969/harry-maguire-bar-bill-mykonos-arrest-punching-cop-sister-stabbed/\">bar bill amassed before his arrest on the Greek island of Mykonos</a>, while his pals quaff Dom Perignon, Maguire sticks mainly to beer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like a proper salt-of-the-earth bloke.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the summer of 2018, when old ‚ÄòSlab Head‚Äôs‚Äô massive bonce propelled England towards their first World Cup semi-final in 28 years, <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/harry-maguire/\">Maguire</a> was rivalling his manager Gareth Southgate for the title of ‚Äògreatest living Englishman‚Äô.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>England were far better at that tournament than they had been since Euro 2004 or even Euro 96.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They didn‚Äôt beat any genuine world-class opposition, though, and yet the wide-held feeling that their campaign had been an absolute triumph was partly down to the likeability of Southgate‚Äôs players and their connection with the public.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The manager enjoyed telling his players, and the wider world, that they were a bunch of genuine lads, many of whom had played in the lower leagues, and had not lost touch with their roots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many current England players enjoy ‚Äòconnecting‚Äô with fans and come across well on social media.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<h2><strong><a

class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, it was Kyle Walker who originally took the mick out of a photo of Maguire‚Äôs girlfriend looking adoringly at the defender after England‚Äôs win over Tunisia, which then went viral.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All good ‚Äòbantz‚Äô, if you like that kind of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now the tail-end of Southgate‚Äôs England playing career coincided with the rise of the ‚ÄòGolden Generation‚Äô and the media circus which surrounded them and, in particular, David Beckham.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Southgate hated all of that and was acutely aware that those <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/team/1196702/england/\">England</a> players were often regarded as sneering, roped-off poseurs ‚Äî even though he did not believe that was true of many of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And he has been keen for his own squad to be viewed more favourably.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hence, Maguire enjoying his&#160;status as a ‚Äòman of the people‚Äô. Even after he became the world‚Äôs most expensive defender at ¬£85million and captain of <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/team/1196656/manchester-united/\">Manchester United</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there is a problem with being a ‚Äòman of the people‚Äô ‚Äî <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/12482644/harry-maguire-security-idiots-mykonos-brawl-danny-murphy/\">a significant minority of ‚Äòthe people‚Äô can be absolute toerags</a>, especially after drinking heavily in the sun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This appears to be one issue which led to <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/12468340/harry-maguire-arrested-greece-police-man-utd/\">Maguire‚Äôs arrest</a>.

</figcredit>\n</figure>Drinking coffee or tea during pregnancy puts the unborn child‚Äôs health at risk, according to new research[/caption] \n<p>They found the mind-altering substance is linked to an increased risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, low birth weight and leukaemia.</p> \n<p>It may also raise the odds of childhood obesity.</p> \n<p>NHS guidelines say 200mg of caffeine a day ‚Äì equivalent to two cups of instant coffee ‚Äì will not cause harm.</p> \n<p>But Prof Jack James, from Reykjavik University, in Iceland, has called for the advice to be ‚Äúradically revised‚Äù following his appraisal.</p> \n<p>He analysed 48 previous studies from the past two decades that looked at <a href=\"https://www.thesun.ie/fabulous/3618214/drinking-tea-while-pregnant-harms-your-unborn-baby/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the impact of caffeine on pregnancy outcomes</a>.</p> \n<p>Any caffeine risks harming the baby but the dangers increase as more is consumed, the study suggests.</p> \n<p>Even 200mg a day appeared to <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/7813526/drinking-tea-coffee-pregnant-reduces-baby-size-increases-premature-birth/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">raise the risk of miscarriage </a>by up 28 per cent and stillbirth by up to 38 per cent.</p> \n<p>Prof James said: ‚ÄúCurrent evidence does not support assumptions about safe levels of maternal caffeine consumption.</p> \n<p>‚ÄúThe cumulative scientific evidence supports advice to pregnant women and women contemplating pregnancy to avoid caffeine.‚Äù </p> \n<p>The expert admits women who consume caffeine may be more likely to have other harmful habits, such as smoking.</p> \n<h2>‚ÄòAVOID CAFFEINE‚Äô</h2> \n<p>Caffeine is found naturally in some foods and drinks, such as tea, coffee and chocolate.</p> \n<p>It is also added to some energy drinks, cold and flu remedies and some soft drinks.</p> \n<p>Medics warn many substances in a normal diet can be harmful in high doses and there is little evidence a small amount of caffeine is dangerous.</p> \n<p>Dr Daghni Rajasingham, from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said: ‚ÄúThe findings of this study add to the large body of evidence that supports limited caffeine intake during pregnancy.</p> \n<p>‚ÄúBut pregnant <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/5568064/coffee-when-pregnant-how-many-cups/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">women do not need to completely cut out caffeine</a>, as this paper suggests.</p> \n<p>‚ÄúHigh levels of caffeine during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage and babies having a low birth weight and may lead to excess weight gain in the child‚Äôs early years, which can increase risk of health problems later in life.</p> \n<p>‚ÄúHowever, as other ‚Äì and potentially more reliable ‚Äì research has found, pregnant women do not need to cut caffeine out entirely because these risks are extremely small, even if the recommended caffeine limits are exceeded.</p> \n<!--googleoff: all--> \n<div class=\"sun-grid-container sun-grid-container--white\"> \n <div

reports it comes as costs to upgrade the 227 Challenger 2 tanks and 366 Warriors has soared.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last year the Ministry of Defence said cybercapabilities, space and other technologies should get more investment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A government source told The Times: ‚ÄúWe know that a number of bold decisions need to be taken in order to properly protect British security and rebalance defence interests to meet the new threats we face.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is thought the idea to scrap a number of tanks has been floated with senior US army members and Nato.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the option of upgrading the Challenger 2 or purchasing German Leopard 2 tanks still remains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Discussions are also said to have taken place on shutting down the British Army&#8217;s training base in Canada.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>¬†A Ministry of Defence spokesperson said: ‚ÄúOur commitment to NATO is unwavering, and the UK recognises that as a global military power our greatest strength remains our alliances.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‚ÄúWe are engaging our international allies and industry partners as we develop and shape defence‚Äôs contribution to the Integrated Review.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>TANKED UP</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Challenger 2 is the British Army&#8217;s main battle tank &#8211; it is based on the Challenger 1 tank, which served in the Gulf War and the Balkans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These tanks have thermal imaging, a laser range finder and a chain gun that can fire 4,000 rounds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Warrior infantry fighting vehicle is fast, heavily armoured and can keep up on the most difficult terrain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They have heat rockets, a mounted cannon and a chain gun.</p>\n\n\n\n\t<!--googleoff: all-->\n\t\t<div class=\"sun-grid-container

drinking and smoking throughout the hotel in breach of rules.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>People were smoking and drinking in the pool, including throwing their cigarette butts in the water, despite signs banning smoking in the area but management were uninterested in stopping them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A large number of young people were gathered in the hallway outside his

They start with, &#8216;How you doing?&#8217; They match you to start a game, then start messaging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;They play very badly, so you win the game.

This is not a dating site&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In one unusual message, one apparently human scammer confessed to using his son&#8217;s picture on the app as he was &#8220;more attractive&#8221;.

had one son together &#8211; who allegedly collapsed when he heard that his dad was going to prison.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first she knew of the child sex abuse charges was when a social worker called her

Mr Barnier fears talks are headed for a bitter breakdown.</p> \n<p>He believes <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/downing-street/\">Downing Street</a> is laying the ground for a vicious ‚Äúblame game‚Äù over who is responsible for the stalemate.</p> \n<p>In a gloomy briefing to diplomats, the grumpy Frenchman claimed that last week‚Äôs tetchy round of talks have made things worse.</p> \n<h2>‚ÄòCOLD BLOODED‚Äô APPROACH</h2> \n<p>The UK‚Äôs negotiator David Frost had put forward a draft text last week in the hope of speeding up the discussions. But <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/michel-barnier/\">Mr Barnier</a> dismissed it as ‚Äúunrealistic‚Äù and urged EU states to stay ‚Äúcold blooded‚Äù.</p> \n<p>He insisted that the UK‚Äôs ‚Äúclear strategy‚Äù will be to ‚Äútrade off‚Äù fishing access for freedom from <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12425148/brexit-bosses-gear-up-fight/\">EU rules</a> at the last minute.</p> \n<p>An EU source said: ‚ÄúWe expect the mood to switch rapidly to contingency planning in expectation the UK will throw itself into the blame game rather than the endgame.‚Äù</p> \n<p>A British official hit back, saying: ‚ÄúThe UK has consistently pushed for detailed textual discussions on the core elements of a trade agreement.</p> \n<p>‚ÄúIf the EU continues to stall progress because of its unrealistic asks on fish and subsidies, we will quickly run out of time.‚Äù</p> \n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\">Barnier ploy will cost EU big time</h2> \n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>By David Davis, Ex Brexit Secretary</strong></p> \n<p>WELL now I‚Äôve seen everything. The gullible British Remainer Press report breathlessly that Michel Barnier is telling us (yet again) the Brexit negotiations are ‚Äúrunning out of time‚Äù.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/michel-barnier/\">Barnier</a> is desperate to resolve his red line issues before we get to the critical endgame. I‚Äôve always said the last three weeks will matter more than the first three years.</p> \n<figure id=\"attachment_12489645\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 10px\">\n <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000432213479-2.jpg\"><img src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000432213479-2.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=620\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-12489645\" /></a>\n <figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">\n  Michel Barnier‚Äôs ploy will cost the EU big time, warns David Davis\n </figcaption>\n <figcredit></figcredit>\n</figure> \n<p>But there will come a time very shortly when we will have to shift the thrust of our preparations towards No Deal. The reason for this is that the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2099807/what-is-brexit-uk-eu/\">European Union</a> always runs out the clock.</p> \n<p>When it is bullying some smaller state this works to its advantage. In the Brexit negotiation what will happen in the last few weeks is that the nation states of <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/europe/\">Europe</a> will have to come to terms with the size of the risks that Barnier is taking.</p> \n<p>If we end up with a no deal scenario ‚Äî and it is possible ‚Äî the Europeans stand to lose a large and very profitable marketplace, namely the UK.</p> \n<p>It is clear that there are only two options now for leaving at the end of the transition period, a no deal exit or a zero-tariff deal. All sensible business owners will be preparing for both.</p> \n<p>Deferral and delay is the only thing that affects certainty. Certainty is what business and the country as a whole require.</p> \n<!--googleoff: all--> \n<div class=\"sun-grid-container sun-grid-container--white\"> \n <div class=\"sun-row \"> \n  <div

the shared hostility in such a deadly way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mr Heywood added: &#8220;It really boils down doesn&#8217;t it to a very small group of people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s common ground that this arises from Grahame Park estate, from a history of antagonism, violence between people there and the Efey family.</p>\n\n\n\n\t<!--googleoff: all-->\n\t\t<div class=\"sun-grid-container sun-grid-container--white\">\n\t\n\t<div class=\"sun-row \">\n\t\t<div class=\"col sun-col-6\">\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"rail rail--classic  rail--trending theme-news\" data-slide-count=\"4\" data-slide-count-tablet=\"4\">\t\t\t\t<div class=\"swiper-container\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rail__header\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"rail__title theme__after-color\">Most read in News</h3>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"swiper-pagination theme__swiper-pagination\"></div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"swiper-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div class=\"rail__item swiper-slide\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rail__item-image\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12485742/brit-schoolgirl-nora-quoirin-not-kidnapped-inquest-told/\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"delayed-image-load-landscape\" data-src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/dk-comp-nora.jpg?strip=all&#038;w=300&#038;h=192&#038;crop=1\"></div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"delayed-image-load-mobile\" data-src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/dk-comp-nora.jpg?strip=all&#038;w=300&#038;h=192&#038;crop=1\"></div>\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!-- Add video indicator if article has feature video. -->\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rail__item-play theme__background-color-rgba-80\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span></span>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .rail__item-image -->\n\t\n\t<div class=\"rail__item-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"rail__item-headline theme__copy-color\">\n\t\t\t\tJUNGLE RIDDLE\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"rail__item-sub\">\n\t\t\t\tBrit girl found dead naked in Malaysian jungle WASN&#039;T kidnapped, inquest told\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</div><!-- .rail__item-content -->\n\t<div class=\"rail__item-gradient-light\">\n\n\t</div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12485742/brit-schoolgirl-nora-quoirin-not-kidnapped-inquest-told/\" class=\"rail__item-anchor\"></a>\n\n</div><!-- .rail__item .swiper-slide -->\n\n<div class=\"rail__item swiper-slide\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rail__item-image\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12480805/couple-take-kip-car-staycation-from-hell/\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"delayed-image-load-landscape\" data-src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/JS-COMP-TENT.jpg?strip=all&#038;w=300&#038;h=192&#038;crop=1\"></div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"delayed-image-load-mobile\" data-src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/JS-COMP-TENT.jpg?strip=all&#038;w=300&#038;h=192&#038;crop=1\"></div>\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .rail__item-image -->\n\t\n\t<div class=\"rail__item-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"rail__item-headline theme__copy-color\">\n\t\t\t\tVROOM WITH A VIEW\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"rail__item-sub\">\n\t\t\t\tCouple forced to take a kip on roof of their car during staycation hell\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t</div><!-- .rail__item-content -->\n\t<div class=\"rail__item-gradient-light\">\n\n\t</div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12480805/couple-take-kip-car-staycation-from-hell/\" class=\"rail__item-anchor\"></a>\n\n</div><!-- .rail__item .swiper-slide -->\n\n<div class=\"rail__item swiper-slide\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rail__item-image\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12477043/girl-transform-camper-van-tiny-home/\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"delayed-image-load-landscape\" data-src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/CM-COMP-VAN-V2-3.jpg?strip=all&#038;w=300&#038;h=192&#038;crop=1\"></div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"delayed-image-load-mobile\" data-src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/CM-COMP-VAN-V2-3.jpg?strip=all&#038;w=300&#038;h=192&#038;crop=1\"></div>\n\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!-- Add video indicator if article has feature video. -->\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"rail__item-play theme__background-color-rgba-80\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span></span>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .rail__item-image -->\n\t\n\t<div class=\"rail__item-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"rail__item-headline theme__copy-color\">\n\t\t\t\tGLAMPER VAN\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"rail__item-sub\">\n\t\t\t\tGirl, 11, transforms old camper van into her very own &#039;tiny home&#039;

UK[/caption]\n\n\n\n<p>Headteachers have the power to impose fines of up to ¬£120 per parent &#8211; which can in some extreme cases be inflated to ¬£2,500 and three months jail time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, unions have said they believe fines are &#8220;counterproductive&#8221; and they won&#8217;t be encouraging their members to use them, reports the <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/08/24/exclusive-head-teachers-signal-will-not-fine-parentswhose-children2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Telegraph</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Paul Whiteman, General Secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: &#8220;We think fines will be counterproductive now. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Where families have deep concerns about coming back, we hope that through engaging with schools, their fears are allayed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Talking about fines now is unhelpful. They have always been there and have always been used sparingly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Members cannot say don&#8217;t use them but they are more motivated by cooperation rather than coercion.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added it was premature to talk about fines, saying we need to see &#8220;how successful we are in getting children back, then review where we are&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Patrick Roach, general secretary of the NAS/UWT, the second biggest teaching union, said: ‚ÄúThe Government needs to support schools to apply a sensitive approach that recognises the unprecedented nature of the pandemic, and that&#160;some parents will have genuine safety concerns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‚ÄúSchools will need to be supported to apply the rules in a way which encourages children to attend school while working constructively with parents to overcome their concerns.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Downing Street has reminded the nation that education is &#8220;compulsory&#8221; and warned parents risk fines if they <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/schools-reopening/\">keep their children home</a> despite the <a

Johnson has said he understands that parents are &#8220;a bit worried about their children&#8221; but stressed the danger is &#8220;very, very, very small&#8221;. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added: &#8220;I think it&#8217;s vital that parents understand that schools are safe and that teachers have gone to great lengths to get schools ready.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Education Secretary Gavin Williamson &#8211; <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12407041/education-secretary-gavin-williamson-fighting-for-job-a-levels/\">who has come under fire for the exams fiasco</a> &#8211;  said fines would only be used as a &#8220;last resort&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: &#8220;In terms of fining we would ask all schools to work with those parents and encourage them to bring those children back.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Schools standards minister <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/politics/12482418/fines-school-next-week-last-resort/\">Nick Gibb stressed that going to school was not optional</a> and also warned mums and dads they will face fines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: &#8220;We live in a country where education is compulsory and I think parents can be reassured that the measures that schools are taking to make sure that we minimise the risk of the transmission of the virus are very effective.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<a

parents its safe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Masks on the way into school, extra handwashing, sanitiser and other measures are being put into place to help the smooth return.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Children will be in classroom bubbles as much as possible and will stay 2m away from their teachers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the weekend the four chief medical officers across&#160;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12475154/medical-expert-chris-whitty-green-light-schools-reopen-september/\">the UK issued a joint statement stressing that kids should be back in classrooms.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>They gave it the green light because absence from the classroom fuels inequality across Britain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Evidence shows there is an ‚Äúexceptionally small risk‚Äù of child deaths from Covid-19, with there being a <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12481835/higher-risk-road-accident-coronavirus/\">higher risk of suffering a car crash</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The

will be up to individual heads to decide if they want to use them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Parents with concerns about coronavirus and schools have been encouraged to talk to their kids&#8217; teachers and leaders to try and allay their concerns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mr Johnson today released a video clip making the argument for the <a
