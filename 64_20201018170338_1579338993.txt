However, if you are a real coffee lover or an aspiring one, you can’t just pour milk into espresso shots and call it day, we have to do it right &#8211; cappuccinos, lattes, flat whites, macchiatos, etc. all require a different milk texture to really bring out the best in your cup. That is why we love the coffee made by baristas, the velvety texture and foam really takes your drink to the next level. Now you can achieve that high-quality coffee at home without investing in expensive machines with this nifty NanoFoamer!</p>\n<p>This year we are spending most of our time indoors and while cafes are still open for to-go orders, you can enjoy freshly brewed coffee with foamy milk from the comfort of your WFH corner or couch which is far better than drinking while driving. NanoFoamer upgrades your existing coffee setup without taking up counter space. While handheld frothers are not new, NanoFoamer is far superior to the existing ones in the market because it comes with two NanoScreens that let you choose the kind of microfoam you want &#8211; this is what marks the difference between cappuccinos and lattes, now we are really leveling up from coffee addicts to coffee connoisseurs! The fine and super-fine NanoScreens give different foam densities unlike other handheld frothers and the result is latte-art quality milk instead of a dollop of milk bubbles that go flat. Microfoam holds stiffly and that is how the latte art stays in place, with NanoFoamer you can make handcrafted drinks anywhere.</p>\n<p>The team also tested it with milk alternatives keeping in mind that plant-based consumption is on the rise and that should be no reason for you to miss out on a foamy cup of coffee. &#8220;By popular demand, we tested the NanoScreens with three different types of milk alternatives. Soy, Oat, and Coconut. The NanoFoamer performed really well on all three, the texture was always superfine and smooth, only the amount of microfoam you can make is sometimes less than if you use regular milk,&#8221; said the team. For the first time, milk can be heated without an espresso machine for making microfoam &#8211; simply warm your milk to 55°C on any stovetop before foaming with NanoFoamer. The different NanoScreens sizes will yield different foam densities and textures depending on how long you run the device for &#8211; the top foam layer can be as thin or thick as you like based on how quick or slow you churn. If you want that foam mustache, I would recommend the fine NanoScreens and a slow churn for a minute.</p>\n<p>Choose between the fine and superfine screen, churn your milk at a speed of 10,000 RPM till you are happy with the amount of foam, and then pour the milk into your espresso. In as little as 20 seconds you can get milk that pours as smooth as paint! “The NanoFoamer creates microfoam that seamlessly blends with your espresso, enhancing the flavor profiles and mouthfeel of the drink &#8211; the bubbles are so fine you can’t even see them. Milk frothers on the other hand simply whisk the milk creating dry foam or junk-foam as we call it, a big bubbly substance that quickly separates into layers. Dry foam does not mix with espresso and crema, instead, it sits on top creating separate layers of milk and coffee flavors,” says the team while explaining why the NanoFoamer is essential if you want to make the most of your coffee. Mount it on the wall or let it stand by your coffee station for easy access. It is waterproof and easy to clean, plus since it runs on batteries you can carry it with you anywhere for a perfect coffee each time!</p>\n<p>Designer: Dominic Symons of Subminimal</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/subminimal/nanofoamer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Click Here to Buy Now: $66.</strong></a> Hurry, only 27/950 left!

On the home’s AI technology, one of its creators, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Michaela Pankova says, “The house is like a brain,” and the home certainly is smart. Aware of where everyone is inside the house, Villa Sophia’s AI system listens and adapts to the growing needs of the home’s residents so that just by inhabiting the home, everyone can enjoy the benefits that come with technological living. Room temperatures will adjust as soon as someone makes note of the cold. Come sunset, blue lighting dissipates so that the house provides optimal lighting for sleep. Deliveries always make it inside as the smart home can unlock and open doors after assessing who’s knocking. The home has as many technological capabilities as the human has thoughts, in this way, artificial and human intelligence work in tandem. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Considering the home’s catalog of intellectual technology, sustainability </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and interconnection still breathe inside and outside Villa Sophia. The home is just as eco-friendly as it is tech-savvy, with responsibly sourced wood material and polyurethane floor finishing, the interior design makes the overall home that much more efficient and eco-conscious. From the rich, walnut wood finishes to the living space’s accessible ramp that slithers through a sloped chunk of the staircase, a seamless fusion of distinguished technological innovation with an acute awareness of the human’s urge to control pervade this villa.</span></p>\n<p>Designer: <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Michaela Pankova and Karel Panek of</span> <a

screens","link":"https://www.yankodesign.com/?p=282475","description":"<p><iframe title=\"The Ellodee Sound Companion\" src=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/julieliddell/the-ellodee-sound-companion/widget/video.html\" height=\"590.625\" width=\"1050\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p>As controversial as this statement is, hear me out, and let me know what you sincerely think. Things that can have a detrimental effect on humans often come with a set of guidelines. Certain TV shows and movies have warnings for adult content, alcoholic establishments enforce a strict age rule for patrons, but there&#8217;s nothing stopping harmful addictive technology from getting into the hands of a two-year old. It&#8217;s incredibly simple for a child below the age of 13 to make a Facebook account (even though kids below 13 aren&#8217;t allowed to be on Facebook), and your smartphone or smart-speaker doesn&#8217;t explicitly stop kids from exploring the internet and getting hooked to tech that was built to be addictive.</p>\n<p>While it&#8217;s much more difficult to hold big-tech accountable and actually have them build these parental controls into their devices, two young parents are setting the record straight by designing tech that&#8217;s made for kids. Founded by Andy and Julie Liddell, Ellodee doesn&#8217;t alienate kids from tech, but rather gives them a healthy introduction to it. Designed to be a smart-speaker without an addictive interactive display, or privacy-infringing hardware like cameras and microphones, the Ellodee is a smart speaker that allows kids to listen to music, stories, playlists, and even podcasts using a medium that&#8217;s designed to be child-friendly and non-addictive.</p>\n<p>The Ellodee comes with a design that makes its features and functions instantly apparent, with an aesthetic that seems well in line with the smart-home tech already on the market today. Designed by Fred Bould, founder of Bould Design &#8211; the design studio which gave us the GoPro and the Nest Thermostat), the Ellodee looks incredibly contemporary, and features 6 colorful buttons and a rotary knob to access the speaker&#8217;s library. An Ellodee app for the smartphone (used by the parents) lets them select the audio libraries a kid can listen to, and once you set the library, it instantly gets stored offline on the Ellodee speaker, so a child doesn&#8217;t need the internet to use the speaker. Kids can navigate through content using the colored wheel of buttons, and alternating between options using the rotary wheel. A small circular screen helps display album art, and Ellodee&#8217;s library of 60 million songs, podcasts, and audiobooks ensures kids have an entire world of parent-approved educational and entertaining content to browse through&#8230; that too in an audio format which has proven to be incredibly effective at helping children grow smarter, without the side-effects of screen addiction.</p>\n<p>The Ellodee smart-speaker is designed to be entirely operated by kids, but moderated by parents. The fact that it doesn&#8217;t itself allow children to connect to the internet means parents can rest assured knowing that their kids are within a safe-space, and Ellodee&#8217;s ability to download selected libraries onto the device means kids can use the speaker anywhere without needing an internet connection or a hotspot. The Ellodee&#8217;s design, as contemporary as it is, considers children as its prime audience, with a rugged body that can take being accidentally dropped, and a handle that allows kids to carry it around wherever they go. Moreover, the Ellodee deliberately comes without any cameras or microphones too, allowing kids to interact with tech, while ensuring their data is never mined or privacy infringed!</p>\n<p>Designers: Fred Bould &#38; Ellodee</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://yanko.fnd.to/ellodee\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Click Here to Buy Now: $199</strong> </a><del datetime=\"2020-10-17T05:18:32+00:00\">$297</del> (33% off).

Nintendo Entertainment System. The game has seen generations of players battling it together over the years for pure fun, it is indeed nostalgia personified in every sense. The game has evolved in the last decade or so – becoming a staple for a gaming console and mobile device users alike. So what would have been the next big leap for <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/nintendo/\">Nintendo</a> to take?</p>\n<p>Bring the game environment to the real-world in a mixed reality experience which sees you and your pals racing for supremacy in the cozy confines of your home this Holiday Season. Yes, that’s true as you can turn your living room into a race track for the most exciting entertainment because binge-watching Netflix is so mainstream! Nintendo calls it Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit which fuses classic kart racing in the real-world with an augmented reality environment. It is actually a two-part acquisition – one you have to download the game from Nintendo Switch eShop which solves the gaming interface bit, and the other a $99.99 RC kart (with either Mario or Luigi) and a stack of 4 cardboard gates which shape the racing track in any space inside your home. These cardboards are the checkpoints for the race circuit and the kart needs to pass through them, till the last one to register a complete lap. The track&#8217;s turns and straights are left to your creative building &#8211; using things like sofas, tables, kids’ toys, or coffee cups for instance to craft the race track in a space as small as 15 x 15 feet!</p>\n<p>The kart has an on-board camera for the live feed on your Nintendo Switch to get the close-up racing action. Mixed with the augmented reality elements, the experience promises countless hours of fun with up to three other players. The only requirement being – each player needs to have a separate Switch to participate in live races against each other. The idea is purely fun and resonates with everyone stuck indoors who loves the sense of adventure. Of course, there are things like your grumpy cat (who doesn’t like things moving on wheels) to consider which brings an unexpected twist to the racing environment. Nintendo has got this right and the prospect of getting creative indoors in such a volatile environment outside will keep you hooked for hours at end!</p>\n<p>Designer: <a

class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-282594\"

height=\"700\" /></p>\n<p>When time is of the essence in event of a medical emergency, seconds also matter. Any delay in transporting a critical patient to the nearest medical facility can be fatal, that’s why an ambulance which can ensure timely transportation of the patient sans any delays can help save countless lives. More so in crowded cities where delays are imminent. The only way to eliminate, or at least diminish the probability of such delays comes in the form of an advanced ambulance which is built in a manner that ensures human life gets a second chance it deserves.</p>\n<p>ERKA Autonomous Ambulance is designed keeping in mind the future of mobility in busy city streets plagued by traffic jams and a dearth of parking spots. The minds behind the concept design &#8211; Roman Ignatowski (transportation industrial designer) and Maja Bryniarska (engineer architect and industrial designer) – envision a self-driving ambulance that’s propelled by clean energy. The end goal is to have an autonomous emergency medical service that concentrates on the comfort and safety of the patients. The duo identified the current shortcomings in EMS vehicles, thereby designing a compact ambulance that evolves from a small-transport car into a professional vehicle with all the medical facilities.</p>\n<p>ERKA is fitted with 90-degrees turning wheels which also act as signal indicators for pedestrians. This ensures maneuverability in tight spaces and lesser parking woes. For a smooth ride, the ambulance has a hydraulic suspension system and for easy accessibility, there is a ramp too. On the inside, there are display screens to keep a tab on the vital statistics of the patient who lies on a comfortable platform during the ride. For more flexibility, the autonomous ambulance has a solar panel roof with a drone that flies ahead and above the traffic to clear way for the ambulance faster. Roman and Maja have put a lot of thought into the dynamics of the design and with more improvements in the ideation, this concept could one day take shape in the real world.</p>\n<p>Designer: Roman
