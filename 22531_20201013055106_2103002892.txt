The introduced Ti dopant showed potential as a promising\r\noxygen vacancy suppressor. Additionally, the results showed that the 0.1 wt% Ti-doped SnO 2 TFT had\r\na field-effect mobility of 10.21 cm 2 V −1 s −1 , a subthreshold swing of 0.87, and an I on / I off\r\nvalue of ∼1 × 10 8 , as well as good negative bias stress characteristics. The success of the Ti\r\ndoping could be attributed to its small ionic size, high Lewis acid strength, and strong bonding\r\nstrength. Therefore, the introduced sol–gel-processed Ti-doped SnO 2 TFTs stand as promising\r\ncandidates with potential for application in transparent displays as well as larger area electronics\r\napplicat...","descriptionType":"text/plain","publishedDate":"Mon, 12 Oct 2020 23:00:00 +0000","feedId":22531,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"f08d08af011977d908be027174f5e44a","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Won-Yong Lee, Hyunjae Lee, Seunghyun Ha, Changmin Lee, Jin-Hyuk Bae, In-Man Kang and Jaewon Jang","publishedOrCreatedDate":1602568266315}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-10-13 13:51:06","updatedTime":"2020-10-13 13:51:06","feedId":22531,"fetchDate":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 05:51:06 +0000","fetchMs":25324,"handleMs":4,"totalMs":25337,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"d28287f36c8b0815640352f152cc1c11","hostName":"us-030*","requestId":"88dd719d2b4248f1baa1204b0d28639a_22531","contentType":"application/xml;charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":0,"bgimgsTotal":0,"bgimgsGithubTotal":0,"articlesImgsTotal":0,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":0,"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 02:27:56","updatedTime":"2020-09-07 04:18:44","id":22531,"name":"Semiconductor Science and Technology - latest papers","url":"http://iopscience.iop.org/0268-1242/?rss=1","subscriber":147,"website":null,"icon":"http://iopscience.iop.org/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx64/cdn45@2020_2/2020/09/06/20-18-43-535_89e2c9662d839ba1.ico","description":"Latest articles for Semiconductor Science and Technology","weekly":null,"link":null},"noPictureArticleList":[],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1602568240986,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":25325,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":4,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":1,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"},{"spend":0,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"}]},"extra5":0,"extra6":0,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[],"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}}
