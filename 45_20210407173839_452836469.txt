This chassis will serve as the backbone for a robotic spacecraft that will explore a metallic asteroid for the first time. This ambitious mission, named Psyche after the eponymous asteroid it will explore, is due to launch next summer on a Falcon Heavy rocket.</p>\n<p>Once in space, the spacecraft will use an innovative means of propulsion, known as Hall thrusters, to reach the asteroid. This will be the first time a spacecraft has ventured into deep space using Hall thrusters, and absent this technology, the Psyche mission probably wouldn't be happening—certainly not at its cost of just less than $1 billion.</p>\n<p>For David Oh, the large, boxy chassis represents one of those \"full circle\" moments in life. More than two decades ago, he worked on Hall thruster technology as a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He would go on to work for Space Systems/Loral, which first put the propulsive technology on large commercial satellites and would later be acquired by Maxar.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1754021#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1754021&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=wR8d6Sd9B1w:l5PM2lZWd6k:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=wR8d6Sd9B1w:l5PM2lZWd6k:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=wR8d6Sd9B1w:l5PM2lZWd6k:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=wR8d6Sd9B1w:l5PM2lZWd6k:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=wR8d6Sd9B1w:l5PM2lZWd6k:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=wR8d6Sd9B1w:l5PM2lZWd6k:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 06 Apr 2021 12:28:47 +0000","feedId":45,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MAIN_PIA24474-psyche_and_dolly-1st_in_slidesh.width-1320-980x653.jpg","linkMd5":"690be8b18ea44b2fc0483776d11aa128","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn16@2020_6/2021/04/07/17-38-10-994_c7c648aaa2160c7d.webp","destWidth":980,"destHeight":653,"sourceBytes":89922,"destBytes":68708,"author":"Eric Berger","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MAIN_PIA24474-psyche_and_dolly-1st_in_slidesh.width-1320-980x653.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn16@2020_6/2021/04/07/17-38-10-994_c7c648aaa2160c7d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=wR8d6Sd9B1w:l5PM2lZWd6k:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn15@2020_4/2021/04/07/17-38-38-924_e93329f6814bf217.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=wR8d6Sd9B1w:l5PM2lZWd6k:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn95@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-38-38-907_741a18993af11437.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn75@2020_2/2021/04/07/17-38-38-717_f99fea21595d408b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn92@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-38-38-887_ca95730524b4751b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617817071987},{"createdTime":"2021-04-08 01:37:51","updatedTime":"2021-04-08 01:37:51","title":"Honeywell releases details of its ion trap quantum computer","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1755088","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/hon-AB-quantum-computer-offerings-800x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Image of a small electronic device.\"><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/hon-AB-quantum-computer-offerings.jpeg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"472\" data-width=\"900\">Enlarge</a> <span class=\"sep\">/</span> The line down the middle is where the trapped ions reside.

Back in 2001, an earlier run of the experiment at Brookhaven National Laboratory found a <a href=\"https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.73.072003\">slight discrepancy</a>, hinting at possible new physics, but that <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/35066698\">controversial</a> result fell short of the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2011/12/rolling-the-dice-understanding-how-physicists-hunt-for-the-higgs/\">critical threshold</a> required to claim discovery.</p>\n<p>Now, Fermilab physicists have completed their initial analysis of data from the updated Muon g-2 experiment, showing \"excellent agreement\" with the discrepancy Brookhaven recorded. The results were announced today in <a href=\"https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.126.141801\">a new paper</a> published in the journal Physical Review Letters.</p>\n<p>As I <a href=\"https://nautil.us/blog/the-quirky-muon-just-might-spur-a-physics-breakthroughagain\">wrote at Nautilus</a> in 2013, before the muon was first discovered in 1936, physicists thought their model of particle physics was pretty much complete. Then Caltech physicists Carl Anderson and Seth Neddermeyer, who were studying cosmic rays, noticed that some particles didn’t curve as expected when they passed through a magnetic field. A year later, cloud chamber experiments confirmed that these particles were, indeed, new. It was such a surprising development that I.I. Rabi famously declared, “Who ordered <i>that</i>?”</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1754973#p3\">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1754973&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=AbO8Cc_Aah0:xtuJlMys-GA:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=AbO8Cc_Aah0:xtuJlMys-GA:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=AbO8Cc_Aah0:xtuJlMys-GA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=AbO8Cc_Aah0:xtuJlMys-GA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=AbO8Cc_Aah0:xtuJlMys-GA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=AbO8Cc_Aah0:xtuJlMys-GA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 07 Apr 2021 17:12:42 +0000","feedId":45,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/muonTOP-800x533.jpg","linkMd5":"748824595c02d6f77f729a65e110e750","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn3@2020_6/2021/04/07/17-37-57-287_e803283a6cac224b.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":533,"sourceBytes":51944,"destBytes":34464,"author":"Jennifer Ouellette","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/muonTOP-800x533.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn3@2020_6/2021/04/07/17-37-57-287_e803283a6cac224b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=AbO8Cc_Aah0:xtuJlMys-GA:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn69@2020_6/2021/04/07/17-38-38-933_4dbab916d9968106.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=AbO8Cc_Aah0:xtuJlMys-GA:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn26@2020_5/2021/04/07/17-38-38-837_17731d3ddb8ea9e5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn75@2020_2/2021/04/07/17-38-38-717_f99fea21595d408b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn92@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-38-38-887_ca95730524b4751b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617817071980},{"createdTime":"2021-04-08 01:37:51","updatedTime":"2021-04-08 01:37:51","title":"Want to worry about the next pandemic?

Collectively, the PREDICT project did a massive survey of animal viruses, using over a half-million individual samples taken from 75,000 animals. Out of that data, the project identified over 700 new viruses, including one that had never been seen in the animal in which it was found.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1754733#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1754733&comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=N8FMg35qnSI:-JgViukOPZg:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=N8FMg35qnSI:-JgViukOPZg:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=N8FMg35qnSI:-JgViukOPZg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=N8FMg35qnSI:-JgViukOPZg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=N8FMg35qnSI:-JgViukOPZg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?a=N8FMg35qnSI:-JgViukOPZg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 06 Apr 2021 10:45:07 +0000","feedId":45,"bgimg":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SteveJordan_GettyIimages_HAZMATGuys_Cropped-1-800x603.jpeg","linkMd5":"5c6d50b8357c0f9103df19e6d7b11b47","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn14@2020_2/2021/04/07/17-38-21-267_31a59d5c9f3338e5.webp","destWidth":760,"destHeight":535,"sourceBytes":72493,"destBytes":42118,"author":"John Timmer","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SteveJordan_GettyIimages_HAZMATGuys_Cropped-1-800x603.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn14@2020_2/2021/04/07/17-38-21-267_31a59d5c9f3338e5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=N8FMg35qnSI:-JgViukOPZg:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn99@2020_4/2021/04/07/17-38-38-868_f544a5b8fc444942.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?i=N8FMg35qnSI:-JgViukOPZg:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn36@2020_6/2021/04/07/17-38-38-999_55ad8599f046670e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn75@2020_2/2021/04/07/17-38-38-717_f99fea21595d408b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/science?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn92@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-38-38-887_ca95730524b4751b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617817071980},{"createdTime":"2021-04-08 01:37:51","updatedTime":"2021-04-08 01:37:51","title":"Coronavirus variant that spreads easily doesn’t do so by surviving in air better","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1754714","description":"<div id=\"rss-wrap\">\n<figure class=\"intro-image intro-left\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-1225475566-800x532.jpeg\" alt=\"People practice social distancing in white circles in Domino Park in Williamsburg during the coronavirus pandemic on May 17, 2020, in New York City. \"><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-1225475566.jpeg\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"4024\" data-width=\"6048\">Enlarge</a> <span class=\"sep\">/</span> People practice social distancing in white circles in Domino Park in Williamsburg during the coronavirus pandemic on May 17, 2020, in New York City.
