A Simple Logo Design Is Often Better<br>\n</h3><p>Learn towards a simple logo design: one that is easier to work with, allows for flexible use, and is designed for multiple media use.</p><p>You need your logo to work well, not just with your company name and tagline present, but also as a memorable visual mark on its own. The Apple icon and Nike swoosh stand on their own. So do a number of brands you buy from on a regular basis, both large and small. Simple but powerful logos dominate the world of business.</p><p>Also, you’re going to need your logo to work well and look professional at tiny pixel sizes on screen, as well as on print materials, apps, and more. It must look great on various backgrounds and fit well in multiple mediums and at numerous sizes.</p><p>A simple logo is a whole lot easier to use throughout multiple marketing materials as you expand your brand. Learn about the basics of branding: </p><ul class=\"roundup-block__contents posts--half-width roundup-block--list\"><li class=\"roundup-block__content\"><a class=\"roundup-block__content-link\" href=\"https://business.tutsplus.com/tutorials/what-is-branding--cms-25897\"><img class=\"roundup-block__preview-image\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/23/posts/25897/preview_image/branding-preview.jpg\"><div class=\"roundup-block__primary-category topic-business\">Branding</div>\n<div class=\"roundup-block__content-title\">What Is Branding?</div>\n<div class=\"roundup-block__author\">Julia Melymbrose</div></a></li></ul><h3>2. Make Your Logo Mark Memorable</h3><p>You want your logo to be easy to identify, so that when potential customers come across it they remember your business. It’s a trigger that tells them this is your company. Keeping your logo design simple makes it easier to identify and recall.</p><p>Also, keep in mind that your logo is a visual metaphor: it’s the visual representation of your company and represents your entire brand story. You need a logo that really pulls together <a href=\"https://business.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-define-your-core-brand-values-and-why-you-should--cms-26301\">what your business stands for</a> and what you want your customers to think of when they see it.</p><p>We’ve featured professional logos that have creative design and minimal style in this article for a reason. That’s because a beautiful and memorable logo is both minimal and mixed with just a dash of uniqueness, such as:</p><ul>\n<li>Made up of simple circles, but pulled together into an <a href=\"https://graphicriver.net/item/colorful-bird-logo/13993225\">elegant bird mark</a>.<br>\n</li>\n<li>Designed as a <a href=\"https://graphicriver.net/item/visiopixel-logo/14042058\">creative eye logomark</a> that’s made from simple shapes.<br>\n</li>\n<li>Created with <a href=\"https://graphicriver.net/item/brave-logo-template/16821137\">flowing colors of a lion’s mane</a>, as it roars through white space.</li>\n</ul><p>Your logo should combine a creative touch with a symbol that's easy to identify. Every logo has a story to tell, and you want your audience to immediately identify with yours.</p><h3>3. Fill Your Logo With Personality</h3><p>A logo has a character that speaks to your audience. As an extension of your <a href=\"https://business.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-define-your-core-brand-values-and-why-you-should--cms-26301\">company mission</a> and <a href=\"https://business.tutsplus.com/tutorials/brand-voice-how-the-right-tone-of-voice-can-boost-your-business--cms-26380\">brand voice</a>, you need a logo that captures the energy of your brand. Consider the characteristics of your logo design that will impact your audience.</p><p>If your company works with data and wants to project security and analysis, then <a href=\"https://graphicriver.net/item/mount-stat-logo-for-business/500310\">Mount Stat - Data Style Logo</a> is a great choice. Its triangular peaks represent the security of a long-standing mountain, while the angular designs and simple measured lines feel analytical.</p><p>On the other hand, if you’re an online business that wants to communicate creativity, innovation, and want your brand to represent your processes in active motion, then <a href=\"https://graphicriver.net/item/color-stroke-logo/7549688\">Color Stroke - Spiraling Logo Design</a> is an on-target choice. It looks like a modern digital brush stroke set in motion, as it changes colors while it dynamically paints through the air like a spiral of controlled creativity—with a well-crafted hand behind it.<br></p><p>When looking for a logo that matches your company, consider how it uses space dynamically, as well as its proportions and symmetry. Should your logo be more stable and grounded or should it feel as if it’s moving swiftly through space? Should it look current and digital or more timeless and classic? Which fits your business brand best?</p><p>Every logo has personality, and the best logos match design characteristics to their brand’s character. One more feature to consider is color. Let’s take a look at that in more depth. First, learn more about defining your brand values: </p><ul class=\"roundup-block__contents posts--half-width roundup-block--list\"><li class=\"roundup-block__content\"><a class=\"roundup-block__content-link\" href=\"https://business.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-define-your-core-brand-values-and-why-you-should--cms-26301\"><img class=\"roundup-block__preview-image\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/23/posts/26301/preview_image/brand-values.jpg\"><div class=\"roundup-block__primary-category topic-business\">Branding</div>\n<div class=\"roundup-block__content-title\">How to Define Your Core Brand Values (And Why You Should)</div>\n<div class=\"roundup-block__author\">Julia Melymbrose</div></a></li></ul><h3>4. Remember, Color Choice Is Important</h3><p>Your logo color palette communicates quite a bit and is not a superficial consideration. Color carries meaning and needs to fit all your branding materials and business message.</p><p>Considering your brand’s personality, would bright colors fit it better? They will grab attention more quickly, but could come across as out of place or too harsh for your brand. What about more muted colors, which can speak to elegance or sophistication, but could easily not stand out enough?</p><p>Every color, and color combination, gives distinction and detail to your brand. Don’t give your logo the wrong colors and misalign your business brand with your audience’s expectations. While it's not an exact science, here’s a good guide to start considering the implications of color choice in your business brand:</p><ul class=\"roundup-block__contents posts--half-width roundup-block--list\"><li class=\"roundup-block__content\"><a class=\"roundup-block__content-link\" href=\"https://business.tutsplus.com/articles/color-psychology-what-color-says-about-you--fsw-29098\"><img class=\"roundup-block__preview-image\" src=\"https://cdn.tutsplus.com/business/uploads/legacy/previewimages/2012/Color-Psychology-What-Color-Says-About-You.jpg\"><div class=\"roundup-block__primary-category topic-business\">Color Psychology</div>\n<div class=\"roundup-block__content-title\">Color Psychology: What Color Says About You</div>\n<div class=\"roundup-block__author\">Melanie Brooks</div></a></li></ul><p>Keep in mind, all of the <a href=\"https://graphicriver.net/category/logo-templates\">logo design templates</a> featured in this article can readily fit any color scheme, and can quickly be modified to fit your company’s brand identity. So grab a logo, fire up Illustrator, and customize your logo design colors to best match your brand.</p><h3>5. Understand Your Bigger Branding Goals</h3><p>In addition to fitting your business mission, your logo should work well throughout your branding and marketing materials and across media types. Your logo will need to be placed on business cards, print collateral, your website, social media, potentially to open videos, and used throughout your marketing materials.</p><p>Contrary to popular belief, your logo need not be fixed in stone, though. It should fit your business branding goals today and work well for the near future. But, as your company grows, so too will your brand, and your logo can grow and evolve along with you.</p><p>Starting with a logo design template gives you an attractive and professional initial design at an affordable price, at around $29–$35. It also allows you to pick a pre-designed logo that fits your company well.</p><p>However, if you have the budget to get a completely custom logo design, then look through the creative folios of one of our <a href=\"https://studio.envato.com/explore/logo-design-branding\">hand-picked logo designers on Envato Studio</a>.
