Now, these quick tips will help you create a truly responsive and mobile-ready website. You'll learn about the importance of navigation and image size for loading speed. I'll also share with you some useful tools to improve your Shopify website. Let's go!</p>\n<h3>1. Think Mobile First</h3>\n<figure class=\"post_image\"><a href=\"https://elements.envato.com/jms-elpis-responsive-shopify-theme-TA6AP7\" target=\"_self\"><img src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/988/posts/35919/image/shopify-mobile-themes-JM-Elpis.jpg\" alt=\"Shopify Mobile Theme JMS Elpis\"></a>\n<figcaption>The <a href=\"https://elements.envato.com/jms-elpis-responsive-shopify-theme-TA6AP7\" target=\"_self\">JMS Elpis Responsive Shopify Theme</a> from Envato Elements is mobile friendly.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>The first step to create a responsive eCommerce website is to plan the design. And a great tip is to design the mobile version first. This way, you'll see how everything looks on a mobile device screen.</p>\n<p>One great tool to create a website prototype is <a href=\"https://www.invisionapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>InVision</strong></a>. It allows you to see how your website would look and edit it.</p>\n<h3>2. Create a Layout Hierarchy </h3>\n<p>The layout hierarchy on mobile design is really important. Screens on mobile devices have less space than desktops or laptops. </p>\n<p>This is why you need to think on what you want your visitors to see first. Maybe you want to display a special offer. Or coupons. Or the newest items. </p>\n<p><strong>Plan the mobile layout hierarchy accordingly to what you want to display first.</strong></p>\n<h3>3. Navigation Is Key</h3>\n<p>This is how your visitors use your website. The website menu on desktop is usually visible. But on mobile, you've got to save space.</p>\n<p>The most common practice and best tip is to use a hamburger icon and hide links behind it. </p>\n<figure class=\"post_image\"><a href=\"https://elements.envato.com/madison-flowers-plant-gardening-shopify-theme-NXP2ASE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/2659/posts/35919/image/floral%20responsive%20Shopify%20theme.jpg\" alt=\"Madison - Flowers Plant Gardening Shopify Theme\"></a>\n<figcaption>See how the navigation is adapted in the mobile screen of <a href=\"https://elements.envato.com/madison-flowers-plant-gardening-shopify-theme-NXP2ASE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this responsive Shopify theme</a></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3>4. Optimize Your Images</h3>\n<p>This is perhaps the most important tip in responsive design. If you use high-resolution (heavy) images, they'll take longer to load. Visitors won't wait for a slow website. </p>\n<p>The best tip is to use tools like <strong><a href=\"https://tinypng.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TinyJPG</a></strong> or <a href=\"https://imagecompressor.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Image Compressor</strong></a> to reduce the file size. </p>\n<h3>5. Test Your Responsive Website</h3>\n<p>You've created a trending, modern eCommerce website. You've designed the website following mobile design principles. What's left? To test it!</p>\n<figure class=\"post_image\"><a href=\"https://quirktools.com/screenfly/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/2659/posts/35919/image/screenfly-test-website.jpg\" alt=\"Screenfly allows you to test your responsive Shopify theme\"></a>\n<figcaption>Screenfly allows you to test your responsive Shopify theme</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>There are many tools to test if your website is truly responsive:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong><a href=\"https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mobile Friendly Test by Google</a></strong>. It's the most popular and easy to use. Just enter your URL and click Analyze.

It won't give you suggestions, but you can choose from various mobile and tablet models. </li>\n<li>\n<strong><a href=\"http://mobiletest.me/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MobileTest.me.</a></strong> It allows you to choose a mobile device and interact with your site as if you're on that specific device. Test every button and link and experience how your visitors will use your website.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Want to learn more about responsive website design?

Follow these trends and you'll have a stunning online store that'll help you drive customers and sales:</p>\n<h3>1. Social Media and Mobile Sales</h3>\n<p>This is one of 2020/2021's biggest trends. If you're on any social media platform, then you've seen how it's easier than ever to buy any product directly on the app in your phone. This is because the most important rule of User Experience Design (UX) is to have your user do as little work as possible. </p>\n<p>Invest on a Shopify theme that's fully responsive to any screen resolution and works on all desktop and mobile devices. Let your visitors complete the transaction without even leaving your app or mobile website on their phones. This translates to more sales for you.</p>\n<p>This is a good example of a responsive UX Shopify theme: </p>\n<figure class=\"post_image\"><a href=\"https://elements.envato.com/funify-minimal-responsive-furnitur-shopify-theme-5NNFD3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener\"><img src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/2659/posts/34968/image/shopify%20themes%20envato%20mobile%20responsive.jpg\" alt=\"Funify - Minimal Responsive Furniture Shopify Theme\"></a>\n<figcaption>This Shopify theme is optimized to work on mobile devices, which is a big 2020/2021 trend</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3>2. Motion Design </h3>\n<p>Use video whenever you can. Many of our eCommerce templates include the option to add video, a feature in motion design that's trending in 2020/2021. Whether it’s adding GIFs to your website or incorporating a video into the website header, motion can help to bring your products to life. </p>\n<h3>3. Personal Product Descriptions</h3>\n<p>Another big eCommerce design trend is to choose personalization and a more human approach to address your customers. Add a more personal touch to your product descriptions by including appealing sections. Usage advice, testimonials or even product recommendation quizzes are great.</p>\n<h3>4. Unique Different Grid Layouts</h3>\n<p>For many years, the structured grid layout has been the standard in eCommerce stores. Now, going off the grid has many advantages and it's a big trend.</p>\n<p>Forget the rows and columns and your store will stand out with a different design. Also, your brand will have a modern and edgy look. </p>\n<p>Keep this in mind: <em>this trend works better with a limited product range.</em> If you sell a lot of products, this setup may complicate the shopping process for your customers.</p>\n<figure class=\"post_image\"><a href=\"https://elements.envato.com/skate-board-fullscreen-sports-shopify-theme-M5CSA7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener\"><img src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/2659/posts/34968/image/shopify%20themes%20envato%20widescreen_.jpg\" alt=\"Skate board - Fullscreen Sports Shopify Theme\"></a>\n<figcaption>A widescreen Shopify theme is a great way to use an unconventional grid layout</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3>5. Branded Shipping Boxes</h3>\n<p>One rule of marketing is to never miss an opportunity. For online stores there’s one often ignored opportunity: <em>the shipping box itself</em>. Don't miss the chance to promote your brand by adding a unique design to your shipping package.</p>\n<h2>Discover More Shopify Themes From Envato</h2>\n<p>We hope you've liked the Shopify themes we've shown you.

It can also be used as an incentive to grow your email list so you can follow up with them and invite them back to your store</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Include a List of Related or Similar Products. </strong>Sometimes your visitors may come for a particular product, add it to the cart, and checkout. But if you show them a related product, they may buy that item too. Use a theme like <a href=\"https://themeforest.net/item/fastest-shopify-themes-smart-responsive-with-16-unique-themes-fashiontee-drop-ship-shopping/20450209\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener\">Fastest</a> to easily add this feature to your store.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Simplify Your Checkout Process. </strong>A<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://baymard.com/lists/cart-abandonment-rate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">complicated checkout process</a> is often the reason why people abandon their carts. Consider enabling a one-page checkout or adding tabs that clearly show how many steps there are before their order is placed.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Add Live Chat.</strong> Adding a live chat option on your site allows you to reach out to visitors and answer any questions they might have. This can help eliminate any doubt and convince them to proceed with the purchase.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Use Proof.</strong> Social proof is always a great incentive. Consider using an app like <a href=\"https://useproof.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener\">Proof</a> that shows recent purchases on your site. Seeing other people buy an item from your store helps visitors see that you're a reputable business. This increases the chances of new prospects completing a purchase.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Where to Find the Best Mobile Shopify Themes in 2020/2021 (Envato Elements vs ThemeForest)</h2>\n<p>Both Envato Elements and ThemeForest have the best Shopify themes built by professional authors.

Perhaps you're looking how to start your own online store. Well, it's normal to have some questions about eCommerce platforms. Let me help you with some answers:</p>\n<h3>1. What Is eCommerce? </h3>\n<p>Let's start with the basic definitions. eCommerce refers to business transactions conducted through the Internet. It involves any purchase from an online website. Perhaps its biggest advantage is that you don't need a physical store to start an eCommerce business. You just need a product that you can sell online.</p>\n<p>Interesting, right? We've got more about it here: </p>\n<ul class=\"roundup-block__contents posts--half-width roundup-block--list\"><li class=\"roundup-block__content\"><a class=\"roundup-block__content-link\" href=\"https://business.tutsplus.com/tutorials/what-is-ecommerce--cms-25820\"><img class=\"roundup-block__preview-image\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/23/posts/25820/preview_image/preview-ecommerce-illustration.jpg\"><div class=\"roundup-block__primary-category topic-business\">eCommerce</div>\n<div class=\"roundup-block__content-title\">What Is eCommerce?</div>\n<div class=\"roundup-block__author\">Laura Spencer</div></a></li></ul>\n<h3>2. How Do I Start My Own Online Store?</h3>\n<p>Gone are the days when establishing an online store was a long, complex process. With the new platforms and technologies, today is easier to start your own online business. We suggest you follow these steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>First, research market demand and product fit.</li>\n<li>Analyze online eCommerce platforms and choose the best for you.</li>\n<li>Plan your marketing and sales strategy.</li>\n<li>And launch your store.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul class=\"roundup-block__contents posts--half-width roundup-block--list\"><li class=\"roundup-block__content\"><a class=\"roundup-block__content-link\" href=\"https://business.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-start-your-own-online-store--cms-26951\"><img class=\"roundup-block__preview-image\" src=\"https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/23/posts/26951/preview_image/how-to-start-an-online-store.jpg\"><div class=\"roundup-block__primary-category topic-business\">eCommerce</div>\n<div class=\"roundup-block__content-title\">How to Start Your Own Online Store (Beginner Guide)</div>\n<div class=\"roundup-block__author\">Brad Smith</div></a></li></ul>\n<h3>3. Which eCommerce Platforms Are There?</h3>\n<p>There are a few main eCommerce platforms that you can choose from to set up your store:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Magento. </strong>This is commonly used by big companies because it offers the most customization options for larger sites. But keep in mind that Magento is also the least user-friendly. It may not be your best option if you're just starting your business and you're new to eCommerce. Check our <a href=\"https://themeforest.net/category/ecommerce/magento\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener\">Magento themes.</a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>WordPress (WooCommerce).</strong> WooCommerce is a good option because it gives you a better mix of custom flexibility and user friendliness. Also, WooCommerce powers most of the WordPress eCommerce sites. See our <a href=\"https://themeforest.net/category/wordpress/ecommerce/woocommerce\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener\">WooCommerce themes.</a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Shopify. </strong>This is the most user-friendly platform. This makes it perfect for smaller, simpler online stores. Their stores come ‘pre-built’ with many useful options like Shopify Payments, so you don’t have to worry about complex issues. Check our <a href=\"https://themeforest.net/category/ecommerce/shopify\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener\">Shopify themes here.</a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>BigCommerce.</strong> This platform, which had a major makeover, is the only eCommerce software that works directly with Google’s Merchant Center.
