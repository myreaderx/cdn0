It is great way to quickly highlight parts of speech so you can identify weak verbs or superfluous adjectives. As it relied on language libraries built into Apple devices, we didn’t have way to offer this on Windows. So we built it ourselves.</p> \n   <p>Using machine learning operating on a large corpus of English text<sup id=\"fnref-6526-1\"><a href=\"https://ia.net/?post_type=ia5_writer_posts&amp;p=6526#fn-6526-1\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup>, we trained the app to be able to identify parts of speech and then highlight them appropriately. It is English-only for now, but it’s theoretically possible to train it using any language in the future.</p> \n  </div> \n </div> \n</section> \n<section class=\"article__box\"> \n <div class=\"article__box-heading\"> \n  <div> \n   <h2>Individual Scroll</h2> \n  </div> \n </div> \n <div class=\"article__box-text\"> \n  <div> \n   <p>We’ve drastically improved the algorithm used to keep the Editor and Preview aligned. Now, even if your text contains large elements like tables or images, the top element in the Editor always matches the top of the Preview. For long documents with varying element sizes, this is a lifesaver.</p> \n   <div class=\"article__img\"> \n    <img src=\"http://stagingx.ia.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ia-writer-scrolling-windows.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-41\" /> \n    <figcaption>\n      Keep it in Sync \n    </figcaption> \n   </div> \n  </div> \n </div> \n</section> \n<section class=\"article__box\"> \n <div class=\"article__box-heading\"> \n  <div> \n   <h2>Snippets</h2> \n  </div> \n </div> \n <div class=\"article__box-text\"> \n  <div> \n   <p>Snippets allow you to write a small keyword which will be expanded into a larger text. We’re fans of text replacement on Mac and iOS and wanted to bring that capability to Windows. Even better, Snippets in iA Writer for Windows allow for dynamic contents like the date or text from the current clipboard. You can create and modify your own snippets via the menu: Edit → Snippets.</p> \n   <div class=\"article__img\"> \n    <img src=\"https://ia.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/iA-Writer-Windows-Snippets.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-41\" /> \n    <figcaption>\n      Create Macros \n    </figcaption> \n   </div> \n  </div> \n </div> \n</section> \n<section class=\"article__box\"> \n <div class=\"article__box-heading\"> \n  <div> \n   <h2>Smart Tables</h2> \n  </div> \n </div> \n <div class=\"article__box-text\"> \n  <div> \n   <p>Markdown tables are always a bit of a pain, so we’ve added improvements that makes managing them easier.

On top of this autosaving to the intended location, iA Writer now creates backups of your documents on a defined schedule. This means that if, for any reason, iA Writer cannot save to the intended location—say a network folder or cloud service—a backup is still saved.</p> \n   <p>To access your backups, right-click any File or Folder in the left-pane of the Library and choose “Browse Backups”.</p> \n  </div> \n </div> \n</section> \n<section class=\"article__box\"> \n <div class=\"article__box-heading\"> \n  <div> \n   <h2>Backend Improvements</h2> \n  </div> \n </div> \n <div class=\"article__box-text\"> \n  <div> \n   <p>1.3 comes with a truckload of improvements under the hood, too.</p> \n   <ul> \n    <li>Updated Chromium to version 79, which adds a host of new benefits to the Preview and Export</li> \n    <li>Adopted the new Paddle SDK for Windows</li> \n    <li>Improved AutoMarkdown in the Editor</li> \n    <li>File List scrolling optimization</li> \n    <li>KaTeX update to support <code>copy-tex</code> and <code>mchem</code> modules</li> \n    <li>XSS filtering</li> \n    <li>and much more</li> \n   </ul> \n   <p>If you haven’t already updated to 1.3, restart the app and it will ask you to install the update on the next launch.
