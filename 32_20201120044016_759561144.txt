Claims about human nature can easily be repackaged as claims about people living in similar cultures and vice versa.  </p><p> Current debates over sex, gender, and what behaviors are biologically influenced fall into this category. Claims that masculinity and femininity are biologically fixed often point to their seeming universality as evidence. However, as mentioned, these claims often rely on people raised in cultures that encourage or discourage people from taking on those traits. It is a bit of a chicken and egg problem.  </p><p> One way to try and get around these problems is to find a culture that is markedly different from others. A new study on women's health has taken this route; it discovered that granting women autonomy typically given only to men leads to better health outcomes.</p><h3>\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n The\nKingdom of Women</h3><br/><p> The <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/photography/proof/2017/08/portraits-of-chinese-Mosuo-matriarchs/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mosuo</a> people are an ethnic group that lives in the Yunnan and Sichuan regions of China, next door to Tibet. Long isolated from other parts of China—and insulated against the occasional upheavals that impacted other cultures—they continue to maintain cultural institutions commonly described as matriarchal or matrilineal. </p><p>Children take the name of their mother's family, who they live with all their lives. Households are run by matriarchs, often the grandmother, and inheritance goes from mother to <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/rough/2005/07/introduction_tolinks.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">daughter</a>. The matriarch makes all major household decisions, including financial ones, and women do work often doled out to men in other cultures. <br/> <br/> They are also known to practice a unique form of marriage known as a \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosuo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">walking marriage</a>.\" In this system, a couple decides to carry on a relationship by mutual consent. They do not live together, remaining in the homes of their respective families. The man, instead, \"walks\" over to the woman's house for romantic rendezvous. Men have to return home by sunrise.  </p><p> The relationship is carried on for as long as both parties want but carries no social or economic obligations. It is ended at any time with little difficulty. Many people often confuse this with <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2016/11/26/501012446/the-place-in-china-where-the-women-lead\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">promiscuity</a>, but most anthropologists report it as a kind of serial monogamy, and many relationships that take this form are long term. Any children resulting from these marriages are raised by the mother's family, though the father may play a role as agreed upon by all involved. Typically, the child's uncles will play the role of father figure.  </p><p> It is worth noting that men do have some power in this society; they are in charge of all things death-related, including funerals and the killing of animals. They also have some political <a href=\"http://public.gettysburg.edu/~dperry/Class%20Readings%20Scanned%20Documents/Intro/Yuan.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">power</a>, though women often have most of it. <br/> <br/> Cases like these are common among matriarchal societies, with men retaining some measure of control over their lives even if they aren't at the top often unknown to women in patriarchal societies. A variety of sources indicate that the men in this society, who are well aware of the alternatives, are often content with their situation. Mosuo villages with patrilineal traditions also exist.</p><p>Even with these caveats, it is fair to say that the women of the Mosuo are highly autonomous and have a long history of personal freedom beyond that which is known to women in many other cultures.  </p><h3>\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\nMedical\nconsiderations of\nmatriarchy</h3><br><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5PMxxtUq5dc\" width=\"730\"></iframe><p> Most of you will know that women tend to outlive men. Fewer of you will know that women tend to have higher morbidity than men do in spite of this.  </p><p> Two manifestations of this are that women tend to have higher blood pressure than men after reaching post-reproductive age and that women of all ages tend to experience more inflammation than men. Both of these are important markers of long-term health and are commonly associated with other serious conditions.  </p><p> While these issues have often been calked up to biology, a team of researchers led by Adam Reynolds of the University of New Mexico set out to see if they also existed in Mosuo society. The team recorded health measures in Mosuo individuals living in either a matrilineal or patrilineal society and compared them using statistical methods. The <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/11/10/2014403117\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">findings</a> have been published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.<br/> <br/> Levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), a biomarker that can indicate the presence of inflammation, were measured in the blood of 371 Mosuo participants. A mere 3.6 percent of the women living in the matriarchal areas were found to suffer from high inflammation levels unrelated to other conditions. In the patrilineal communities, the prevalence of chronic inflammation in women was 8.3 percent.<br/> <br/> Blood pressure tests showed similar results after nearly a thousand people were tested. Of the women living in matrilineal areas, only 25.6 percent had hypertension. A third of women in the comparison areas had the condition.</p><p>In a surprising find, not only did the Mosuo women living in the areas where they have control over their lives enjoy lower rates of these conditions than other women, they are healthier than their men as well. Mosuo men living in the matriarchal areas tested for high levels of CRP at double the rate of the women. They also had more hypertension, though the rate was only a slightly higher 27.8 percent.<br/> <br/> Now, the men don't suddenly all have high blood pressure because they don't run everything. They have high blood pressure at a rate of only one percent higher than those from the patrilineal culture. If there is an adverse health effect for them caused by living in a matriarchal society, it isn't much of one.  </p><h3>\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\nIt\nturns out autonomy might be good for you</h3><br><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KmZoXQ0noDA\" width=\"730\"></iframe><p> Speaking to <a href=\"https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/mosuo-matriarchy-womens-health-gender-roles\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Inverse</a>, senior author Siobhán Mary Mattison explained their interpretation of the findings:<br/> <br/> \"Women in these matrilineal communities have a great deal of autonomy in decision-making and excellent social support. Given that women tend to be at greater risk of chronic disease worldwide, the fact that they actually do better than men in this realm of health is telling.\" <br/> <br/> The other authors of the study agree. They conclude that:</p><p> \"Our data provide partial support for the hypothesis that the effect of matriliny on women's health is associated with increased autonomy and resource control... While patriliny has been linked to reduced autonomy and resource access for women, we demonstrate that these inequalities can have tangible biological effects that contribute to gender disparities in health.\"<br/> <br/> They further note that being head of the household is inversely associated with elevated CRP levels, suggesting that autonomy grants a \"protective\" effect against inflammation. Lastly, they suggest that the impact of culture, resource control, and autonomy on health all be given further study to capitalize on these findings.  </p><p> These interpretations would be in line with other findings that suggest racism, which similarly limits human autonomy, is terrible for people's health. The stresses of racism are linked to babies with low birth weight, heart <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2017/10/28/560444290/racism-is-literally-bad-for-your-health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">disease</a>, and poorer health <a href=\"https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/racism-is-literally-bad-for-our-health/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">outcomes</a>.  </p><p> While a study on a single, small, isolated group of people isn't going to be the final word on the subject, it does point towards the idea that our health is impacted by our culture and the limitations it puts on us. As we consider ways to improve the world and better understand ourselves, this study and the example of the Mosuo more generally, must be remembered. </p></br></br><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/1sspeZS1aPU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 19 Nov 2020 16:42:53 +0000","feedId":32,"bgimg":"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc5NDc0NS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYyNDEzOTUzN30.542GejRG9SqXuighK5rdbtT7wMGovqUz24Wx95GdypE/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=432%2C1097%2C288%2C87&height=700","linkMd5":"b360cdd711a3d5b13836b65b441feb27","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn26@2020_2/2020/11/20/04-39-47-247_69a8c8be134e7466.webp","destWidth":1245,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":75572,"destBytes":75572,"author":"Scotty Hendricks","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc5NDc0NS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYyNDEzOTUzN30.542GejRG9SqXuighK5rdbtT7wMGovqUz24Wx95GdypE/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=432%2C1097%2C288%2C87&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn26@2020_2/2020/11/20/04-39-47-247_69a8c8be134e7466.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/1sspeZS1aPU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn83@2020_4/2020/11/20/04-39-53-543_42242b3c8f4dd18b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605847183738},{"createdTime":"2020-11-20 12:39:43","updatedTime":"2020-11-20 12:39:43","title":"Experts fear Thanksgiving COVID spikes—Can you have your turkey and stay healthy too\n?","link":"https://bigthink.com/coronavirus/thanksgiving-covid-19","description":"<img src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc5MDgyMC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1NTIzMzM1M30.IOBMkhVgaR8egvy4fTBp7nyDNTRNNpbCWS_xKzYengI/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C771&height=700\"/><br/><br/><li>Holiday travel and family gatherings will bolster America's already growing number of coronavirus cases, experts warn.</li><li>The CDC recommends families celebrating with people outside their quarantine households follow extra precautions.</li><li>For families staying physically distant, there remain many ways to connect with each other this Thanksgiving.</li><hr/><ul class=\"ee-ul\"></ul><h3></h3><br/><p>Like any holiday, Thanksgiving has always had challenges mixed in with the fun.

But this year, families must face an unprecedented challenge: managing family expectations and safety during the pandemic.</p><p>After 2020's contentious news cycle and a <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-running-list-of-record-breaking-natural-disasters-in-2020/\" target=\"_blank\">record-breaking number of disasters</a>, Americans want a dollop of normality to go along with their pumpkin pie. Unfortunately, this desire has grown in tandem with <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">COVID-19 cases</a>. As of this writing, the United States is climbing its third pandemic peak and has endured more than 11 million cases and nearly 250,000 deaths (more than any other country). According to Johns Hopkins data, last week saw the U.S.'s highest seven-day average at 78,738 cases per day.</p><p>\"We're at a point where the epidemic is accelerating across the country. We're right at the beginning of the steep part of the epidemic curve,\" Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former U.S. Food and Drug Administration commissioner, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/31/us-reports-record-99321-new-covid-cases-as-scientists-warn-of-difficult-winter-.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">said on CNBC</a>.

Dr. James Phillips, chief of disaster medicine at George Washington University Hospital, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/14/health/us-coronavirus-saturday/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">told CNN</a> that he expects cases to spike after Thanksgiving, further stressing the health care system and prompting harsher restrictions. If Americans do not learn from Thanksgiving, he forecasts another spike at Christmas.</p><p>Dr. Iahn Gonsenhauser, chief quality and patient safety officer at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, concurs. As he <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/thanksgiving-gathering-safely-coronavirus.html\" target=\"_blank\">told Live Science</a><u>:</u> \"Most experts would agree that we're expecting to see a spike after Thanksgiving and that's a spike on top of already very discouraging and very scary numbers. By far the safest choice that anybody can make this Thanksgiving holiday and likely stretching into the other winter holidays that are coming up is to host your celebration virtually.\"</p><p>While many Americans may recognize Dr. Gonsenhauser's advice as sage, it's equally unwelcomed. <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/us-surgeon-general-pandemic-fatigue-record-covid-929e5cd3-d42a-4bab-b541-5e3d79abe242.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Pandemic fatigue</a> is depleting the nation's willpower and <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/license-shine/202009/six-tips-reduce-covid-decision-fatigue\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">clouding its judgment</a>. Add to that a longing to see family and friends—many of which we may have been separated from for close to a year—and it's easy to see why so many Americans are heading home for the holidays.</p><p>According to a TripAdvisor survey, <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/thanksgiving-holiday-travel-covid-19-surge/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">56 percent of Americans plan to travel</a> this Thanksgiving—less than previous years but a substantial amount nonetheless. Airlines are adding more flights to meet the demand, and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/21525068/covid-19-airplane-risk-coronavirus-pandemic-airports\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">more people in airports</a> will increase the likelihood of transmission. Many other Americans will travel by car, popularly seen as the safer option but one that still increases one's risk of exposure at restaurants, gas stations, and public restrooms.</p><p>In response, governors have instated a patchwork of restrictions. They've closed nonessential indoor businesses, limited restaurants to pick-up orders, and made face masks a requirement when out and about. <a href=\"https://www.govtech.com/em/safety/As-Thanksgiving-Holiday-Looms-Hospitals-Gear-up-for-COVID-Surge-.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Hospitals have also geared up</a> for an influx of new patients while facing their own holiday challenges. Many are already caring for large swaths of COVID patients while the winter weather is making physical-distancing tactics, such as outdoor tents, more difficult to manage. </p><p>\"We don't really want to see mamaw at Thanksgiving and bury her by Christmas,\" Dr. Mark Horne, president of the Mississippi State Medical Association, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/travel-family-gatherings-coronavirus-pandemic-thanksgiving-holidays-3c759ab924a0d9de27803527ddf36c1c\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">told the Associated Press</a>. \"It's going to happen.

As such, every family must perform a risk calculation to decide how to spend Thanksgiving.</p><p>\"[G]iven the fluid and dynamic nature of what's going on right now in the spread and the uptick of infections, I think people should be very careful and prudent about social gatherings, particularly when members of the family might be at a risk because of their age or their underlying condition,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, said on <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fauci-thanksgiving-covid-different/\" target=\"_blank\">CBS Evening News</a>. </p><p>He added, \"When you're talking about relatives that are getting on a plane, being exposed in an airport, being exposed in a plane, then walk in the door and say 'Happy Thanksgiving' — that you have to be careful about.\"</p><p>To help families make their decisions, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/holidays/thanksgiving.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has released Thanksgiving considerations</a> to supplement safety alongside local rules and regulations. The agency lists several factors to consider in any risk calculation. These include local levels of COVID-19, potential travel exposure, the number of people attending, the health risks of those attendees, and the duration of the gathering as well as its location.</p><p>If people from outside the household will attend, the CDC recommends the following actions to increase safety and limit viral transmission:</p><ul><li>Ensure everyone wears a mask when not eating or drinking;</li><li>Keep people who do not live together at least 6 feet apart;</li><li>Have people bring their own food, drinks, utensils, etc. No potluck-style dinners;</li><li>Host the gathering outdoors or increase indoor ventilation;</li><li>Keep music levels down to prevent shouting or speaking too loudly;</li><li>Encourage good handwashing; </li><li>Clean and disinfect commonly touched surfaces often.</li></ul><p>You can find more information on the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/holidays.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">CDC's Holidays website</a>.

Certainly an option, but one that should be spiced up for the holiday meal.</p><p>You can, for example, integrate your preferred telecommunication app can into shared experiences. Family members can work meal prep together or teach each other their signature dishes. Activities like crafts, decorating, and thankfulness trees can be coordinated by the kids and shared with the family simultaneously. You can cook up the same meal, light the same scented candles, and listen to the same music to create a common sensual environment.</p><p>You can also find telecommunication apps designed to be used alongside specific activities. <a href=\"https://discord.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Discord</a> is a favorite among gamers for video games. Even if battle royales aren't your family's speed, it works perfectly well for <a href=\"https://bigthink.com/personal-growth/board-games-for-kids\" target=\"_self\">board games</a>, and your family's favorite likely has a digital version available. Similarly, <a href=\"https://www.netflixparty.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Netflix's Teleparty</a> provides an online space to watch and chat about movies together. If Black Friday was your family's bonding tradition, try scouring for the savings together online and share a cocktail afterward to toast a successful shop. There is also the platform <a href=\"https://gather.town/\" target=\"_blank\">Gather</a>, which allows for proximity video chatting in a customizable 2D world.</p><p>If your family wishes to disconnect from the binary realm, try beginning a new holiday tradition this Thanksgiving. You can write holiday letters to distant family members. We're talking physical letters, which <a href=\"https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/343131\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">preliminary research suggests</a> has the salubrious bonus of reducing stress and anxiety for the writer.

The marine protection zone is three times the size of the United Kingdom and will protect a wide variety of animal species and prevent unsustainable fishing and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/tristan-da-cunha-rockhopper-penguins-39c5e5d74120972e871327b04f823114\" target=\"_blank\">extraction operations</a>.<h3>Tristan da where now?\n\n</h3><br/><p> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tristan_da_Cunha\" target=\"_blank\">Tristan da Cunha</a> is a British Overseas Territory consisting of an archipelago in the south Atlantic. The titular island is the largest in the group at about 100 square kilometers. Those hoping to visit will have to get there by a week-long boat ride from Cape Town. The island's government gleefully notes that it takes longer to get there than it takes astronauts to get to the Moon. <br/> <br/> The marine protection zone will cover 627,247 square kilometers (over 242,000 miles) of the ocean around the islands. It will be the \"gold standard\" in ocean conservation, with neither fishing nor other extractive activities allowed, often referred to as \"no-take.\" It will be the largest no-take zone in the Atlantic, and the fourth largest anywhere in the world. <br/> <br/> The zone includes small areas just off the inhabited islands in which sustainable fishing will be allowed, but these areas are a small fraction of the no-take area's size. Given the historical reliance of the island's economy on the sea, this consideration is quite understandable. <br/> <br/> These protected areas join many others covered by the United Kingdoms' <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-blue-belt-programme\" target=\"_blank\">Blue Belt Programme</a> of marine protection, which aims to preserve 30 percent of the world's oceans by 2030. </p><h3></h3><br><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yObCpYLLJSk\" width=\"730\"></iframe><p> <strong><br/> </strong>In a <a href=\"https://www.tristandc.com/government/news-2020-11-12-mpzgov13nov2020.php\" target=\"_blank\">press release</a> issued by the government of Tristan da Cunha, the chief executive of the <a href=\"https://www.rspb.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Royal Society for the Protection of Birds</a>, Beccy Speight, left no doubt as to the environmental significance of this protection zone:</p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\"This is a story two decades in the making, starting with the RSPB and Government of Tristan da Cunha commencing a conservation partnership, and culminating in the creation of this globally important protected area,\" Speight said. \"The waters that surround this remote UK Overseas Territory are some of the richest in the world. Tens of millions of seabirds soar above the waves, penguins and seals cram onto the beaches, threatened sharks breed offshore and mysterious whales feed in the deep-water canyons. From today, we can say all of this is protected.\"</p><p>Speight added that in 2020, the need for these protections is greater than ever. \"While Tristan da Cunha may be far away in distance it is still close to our hearts and protecting it is still the UK's responsibility. Closer to home, the crisis facing nature is also huge. So huge that our wellbeing, our economic future, and our very survival depend on the choices we make now about the natural world.\" Speight also used the statement to issue a call to action. \"We need politicians to emulate the leadership of this small community to help us build the world we all want to live in. We hope today's fantastic announcement is the first of many more that help revive our world.\"</p><p>For the less romantic, there are also human-centered reasons why we ought to protect the oceans. A recent <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/117/45/28134\" target=\"_blank\">study</a> suggests that keeping fishing boats out of a mere five percent of the ocean can raise catches everywhere else by a 20 percent. As it turns out, protecting the planet we live on provides benefits.<br/></p><h3>Most\nimportant of all, what animals are protected by this?</h3><br><p> The now protected fish that inhabit the waters are a vital food source for many kinds of animals, all of which will benefit from not having to share their food supply with humans.  </p><p>The vast area is home to many species of whales, sharks, and seals. Endangered species of albatross also drop by. Many birds that live on the islands and cannot be found elsewhere, such as the Wilkins bunting and the Inaccessible rail, also stand to benefit from the new protections.  </p><p>Most adorable of all, the endangered northern <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockhopper_penguin\" target=\"_blank\">rockhopper penguins</a> make a home on one of the archipelago islands. With luck, they may not be endangered much longer.  </p></br></br><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/tm4wjVTNVHA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 18 Nov 2020 16:00:32 +0000","feedId":32,"bgimg":"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc4ODEwMi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzNzg2MDI5OX0.kEFAMASz-i2mmIg6KI3nO671XEyigGaWeCIdEHXKxIM/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C19%2C0%2C87&height=700","linkMd5":"84993438efcd5fe65b38a2df85885885","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn22@2020_5/2020/11/20/04-39-47-199_23889f79b29811e6.webp","destWidth":1245,"destHeight":702,"sourceBytes":37644,"destBytes":37644,"author":"Scotty Hendricks","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc4ODEwMi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzNzg2MDI5OX0.kEFAMASz-i2mmIg6KI3nO671XEyigGaWeCIdEHXKxIM/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C19%2C0%2C87&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn22@2020_5/2020/11/20/04-39-47-199_23889f79b29811e6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/tm4wjVTNVHA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn91@2020_3/2020/11/20/04-39-53-553_e0dfb5cab1a62f43.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605847183738},{"createdTime":"2020-11-20 12:39:43","updatedTime":"2020-11-20 12:39:43","title":"The universe works like a huge human brain, discover scientists","link":"https://bigthink.com/surprising-science/the-universe-works-like-a-huge-human-brain-discover-scientists","description":"<img src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc5NDg5Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYyMDkxNDUzN30.XSJO9_B3RLDf8426mzavQZeQjsU7U5Irz1K--qe1Geg/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C377%2C0%2C378&height=700\"/><br/><br/><ul class=\"ee-ul\"><li>A new study finds similarities between the structures and processes of the human brain and the cosmic web.</li><li>The research was carried out by an astrophysicist and a neurosurgeon.</li><li>The two systems are vastly different in size but resemble each other in several key areas.</li></ul><hr/><h3></h3><br/><p>Scientists found similarities in the workings of two systems completely different in scale – the network of neuronal cells in the human brain and the cosmic web of galaxies. </p><p>Researchers studied the two systems from a variety of angles, looking at structure, morphology, memory capacity, and other properties.

To pick one example, the<a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy\" target=\"_blank\"> U.S. life expectancy</a> in 1950 was 68.2 years. We've since added 10 years to that average. Social programs have helped the young and elderly, two of the most health-vulnerable populations, receive unprecedented levels of care and attention. And telemedicine has decoupled many Americans' health support and monitoring from brick-and-mortar hospitals, expanding access to care.</p><p>Yet, despite these advances and despite handily<a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/research/a-dozen-facts-about-the-economics-of-the-u-s-health-care-system/\" target=\"_blank\"> outspending other OECD nations on health care</a>, the United States preserves vast health disparities. As James Madara, CEO and executive vice president of the American Medical Association,<a href=\"https://www.ama-assn.org/about/leadership/america-s-health-care-crisis-much-deeper-covid-19\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> </a>wrote on the organization's site: \"The U.S. health system that exists today is a hodgepodge of ideas, programs, and regulations that is both extraordinarily expensive and highly inefficient. And despite its size and technological advancements, our health system is beset by tremendous gaps and inequities that favor some groups while unfairly disadvantaging others.\"</p><p>Our current predicament has its origins in tectonic sociohistorical forces that have shifted and fractured the health care landscape. For those at the peaks, access to superior care, education, resources, and social networks serve to protect their health. For those in the canyons, the ground continues to weather away with each past and ongoing crisis—consider, for example, the disproportionate fallout from<a href=\"https://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/60/11/2667\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2013/09/29/ronald_reagans_shameful_legacy_violence_the_homeless_mental_illness/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the dissolution of the Mental Health Systems Act</a>.</p><p>Then came COVID-19.</p><h3>COVID-19 deepens U.S. health disparities</h3><br/><p>Communities on the pernicious side of America's health disparities have their unique histories, environments, and social structures. They are spread across the United States, but they all have one thing in common.</p><p>\"There is one common divide in American communities, and that is poverty,\" said <a href=\"https://www.northwell.edu/about/leadership/debbie-salas-lopez\" target=\"_blank\">Debbie Salas-Lopez, MD, MPH</a>, senior vice president of community and population health at Northwell Health. \"That is the undercurrent that manifests poor health, poor health outcomes, or poor health prognoses for future wellbeing.\"</p><p>Social determinants have far-reaching effects on health, and poor communities have unfavorable social determinants. To pick one of many examples, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/09/27/913612554/a-crisis-within-a-crisis-food-insecurity-and-covid-19\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">food insecurity</a> reduces access to quality food, leading to poor health and communal endemics of chronic medical conditions. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has identified some of these conditions, such as obesity and Type 2 diabetes, as increasing the risk of developing a severe case of coronavirus.</p><p>The pandemic didn't create poverty or food insecurity, but it exacerbated both, and the results have been catastrophic. A study published this summer in the <em><a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11606-020-05971-3\" target=\"_blank\">Journal of General Internal Medicine</a></em> suggested that \"social factors such as income inequality may explain why some parts of the USA are hit harder by the COVID-19 pandemic than others.\"</p><p>That's not to say better-off families in the U.S. weren't harmed. A <a href=\"https://voxeu.org/article/poverty-inequality-and-covid-19-us\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">paper from the Centre for Economic Policy Research</a> noted that families in counties with a higher median income experienced adjustment costs associated with the pandemic—for example, lowering income-earning interactions to align with social distancing policies. However, the paper found that the costs of social distancing were much greater for poorer families, who cannot easily alter their living circumstances, which often include more individuals living in one home and a reliance on mass transit to reach work and grocery stores. They are also disproportionately represented in essential jobs, such as retail, transportation, and health care, where maintaining physical distance can be all but impossible.</p><p>The paper also cited a positive correlation between higher income inequality and higher rates of coronavirus infection. \"Our interpretation is that poorer people are less able to protect themselves, which leads them to different choices—they face a steeper trade-off between their health and their economic welfare in the context of the threats posed by COVID-19,\" the authors wrote.</p><p>\"There are so many pandemics that this pandemic has exacerbated,\" Dr. Salas-Lopez noted.</p><p>One example is the health-wealth gap. The mental stressors of maintaining a low socioeconomic status, especially in the face of extreme affluence, can have a physically degrading impact on health. <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/index.cfm/_api/render/file/?method=inline&fileID=123ECD96-EF81-46F6-983D2AE9A45FA354\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Writing on this gap</a>, Robert Sapolsky, professor of biology and neurology at Stanford University, notes that socioeconomic stressors can increase blood pressure, reduce insulin response, increase chronic inflammation, and impair the prefrontal cortex and other brain functions through anxiety, depression, and cognitive load. </p><p>\"Thus, from the macro level of entire body systems to the micro level of individual chromosomes, poverty finds a way to produce wear and tear,\" Sapolsky writes. \"It is outrageous that if children are born into the wrong family, they will be predisposed toward poor health by the time they start to learn the alphabet.\"</p>Research on the economic and mental health fallout of COVID-19 is showing two things: That unemployment is hitting <a href=\"https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2020/09/24/economic-fallout-from-covid-19-continues-to-hit-lower-income-americans-the-hardest/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">low-income and young Americans</a> most during the pandemic, potentially widening the health-wealth gap further; and that the pandemic not only exacerbates mental health stressors, but is doing so at clinically relevant levels.

These social determinants make the pandemic more dangerous, and erode communities' and families' abilities to heal from health crises that pre-date the pandemic.</p><p>How do we eliminate these divides? Dr. Salas-Lopez says the first step is recognition. \"We have to open our eyes to see the suffering around us,\" she said. \"Northwell has not shied away from that.\"</p><p>\"We are steadfast in improving health outcomes for our vulnerable and underrepresented communities that have suffered because of the prevalence of chronic disease, a problem that led to the disproportionately higher death rate among African-Americans and Latinos during the COVID-19 pandemic,\" said Michael Dowling, Northwell's president and CEO. \"We are committed to using every tool at our disposal—as a provider of health care, employer, purchaser and investor—to combat disparities and ensure the <a href=\"https://www.northwell.edu/education-and-resources/community-engagement/center-for-equity-of-care\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">equity of care</a> that everyone deserves.\" </p><p>With the need recognized, Dr. Salas-Lopez calls for health care systems to travel upstream and be proactive in those hard-hit communities. This requires health care systems to play a strong role, but not a unilateral one. They must build <a href=\"https://www.northwell.edu/news/insights/faith-based-leaders-are-the-key-to-improving-community-health\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">partnerships with leaders in those communities</a> and utilize those to ensure relationships last beyond the current crisis. </p><p>\"We must meet with community leaders and talk to them to get their perspective on what they believe the community needs are and should be for the future. Together, we can co-create a plan to measurably improve [community] health and also to be ready for whatever comes next,\" she said.</p><p>Northwell has built relationships with local faith-based and community organizations in underserved communities of color. Those partnerships enabled Northwell to test more than 65,000 people across the metro New York region. The health system also offered education on coronavirus and precautions to curb its spread.</p><p>These initiatives began the process of building trust—trust that Northwell has counted on to return to these communities to administer flu vaccines to prepare for what experts fear may be a difficult flu season.</p><p>While Northwell has begun building bridges across the divides of the New York area, much will still need to be done to cure U.S. health care overall. There is hope that the COVID pandemic will awaken us to the deep disparities in the US.</p><p>\"COVID has changed our world. We have to seize this opportunity, this pandemic, this crisis to do better,\" Dr. Salas-Lopez said. \"Provide better care. Provide better health. Be better partners. Be better community citizens.

In this case a time capsule with hafnium, which comes from Mars' early crust, which existed around 100 million years before the oldest zircon in Black Beauty was created. Thus, Mars got an early start in comparison with Earth, whose solid crust was created much later.\"</p><h3>Breaking Black Beauty</h3><br/><p>Big Think readers may recall that the meteorite — known as \"Black Beauty,\" though its official name is \"Northwest Africa 7533\" — cost the university $500,000 dollars for 50 grams of its 319.8-gram volume. As such, deciding to perform any sort of analysis that requires damaging the precious rock is not a decision taken lightly, as when, say, zircons are found in the stone.</p><p>\"One of the big challenges,\" <a href=\"https://snm.ku.dk/english/news/all_news/2018/2018.6/the-meteorite-black-beauty-expands-the-window-for-when-life-might-have-existed-on-mars/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>says</u></a> Bizzarro, \"has been that the zircons in Black Beauty are extremely small. This called for a courageous strategy: We crushed our precious meteorite. Or to be precise: We crushed 5 grams.\"</p><p>The decision paid off, says Bizzarro: \"Today, I'm glad we chose that strategy. It released seven zircons, one of which is the oldest known zircon from Mars. And from the zircons and their content of hafnium, we can now conclude that the crystallization of the surface of Mars went extremely fast: already 20 million years after the formation of the solar system, Mars had a solid crust that could potentially could house oceans and perhaps also life.\"</p><p>Eventually, the team would crush 15 grams of Black Beauty, extracting 60 zircons.</p><h3>Old and young zircons</h3><br/><img class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"cdb506ceff0db1132127e2c5aac1ff6a\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"2feeb\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc5NDYzNS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1NjI5MDg3OX0.AJwFBV9m2ygMbq-78hXqwUy359wi_V-VJzV6iHXZ9mk/img.jpg?width=980\"/><p>\"Zircon is a very solid mineral that is ideal for making such an absolute dating of time. In this regard, zircon can be used as a portal to pinpoint a time frame for the history of crust formation on Mars.\" Dating of Black Beauty's zircons shed new light on the planet's history. Most of the minerals were dated back to roughly 4.5 billion years ago, the earliest days of the planet.</p><p>Unexpectedly, though, some of the zircons were more recently formed, a period from about 1,500 million years ago to 300 million years. \"These young ages were a great surprise,\" recalls Bizzarro.</p><p>That finding may have to do with where the rock came from. \"The Black Beauty meteorite is believed to come from the southern hemisphere of Mars, which does not have any young volcanic terrains. The only possible source for these young zircons is the Tharsis volcanic province located in the northern hemisphere of the planet, which contains large volcanoes that were recently active,\" Martin Bizzarro adds.</p><p>That province, known as the Tharsis bulge, is a huge volcanic area that's got the largest volcanoes, up to 21 kilometers (13 miles) high, yet seen anywhere in the solar system. It's believed that since Mars lacks plate tectonics, volcanoes gather in a single area, beneath which a massive reservoir of magma is likely located.</p><p>First author of the study is Mafalda Costa , who says, \"Having samples of the deep interior of Mars is key. This means that we can now use these zircons to probe the origin of the volatile elements on Mars, including its water, and see how it compares with Earth and other planets in the Solar System.\"</p><p>The most important element the zircons contain for the purpose of looking into Mars history is hafnium. Bizzarro explains that hafnium \"retains a memory of where the zircon formed. We found that the hafnium isotope composition of the young zircons is unlike any of the known Martian meteorites, which indicates that the young zircons come from a primitive reservoir that we did not know existed in the interior of Mars.\"</p><p class=\"\"><br/></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/1Q-N1iOsuJ0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 19 Nov 2020 20:00:00 +0000","feedId":32,"bgimg":"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc5NTEyNi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYwNzc5MTcxNH0.SwGH4abOV5kAQes_aXyMgxRUErRc44mt0D_pefaKM5s/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=26%2C0%2C27%2C0&height=700","linkMd5":"b00b247d723b4edef9e1f4d6cc1fe9ba","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn35@2020_2/2020/11/20/04-39-44-169_a39f353eae7f9179.webp","destWidth":1245,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":63914,"destBytes":63914,"author":"Robby Berman","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc5NTEyNi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYwNzc5MTcxNH0.SwGH4abOV5kAQes_aXyMgxRUErRc44mt0D_pefaKM5s/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=26%2C0%2C27%2C0&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn35@2020_2/2020/11/20/04-39-44-169_a39f353eae7f9179.webp","https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc5NDYyNi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1NDU1NzI1OH0.URoz_gzrLswB109_j2MJha-A5a_S0wx2n75HlYZ2esk/img.jpg?width=980":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn79@2020_5/2020/11/20/04-39-53-640_61509cb940175422.webp","https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc5NDYzNS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1NjI5MDg3OX0.AJwFBV9m2ygMbq-78hXqwUy359wi_V-VJzV6iHXZ9mk/img.jpg?width=980":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn71@2020_5/2020/11/20/04-39-53-655_2feeb8cca63e8b33.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/1Q-N1iOsuJ0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn82@2020_4/2020/11/20/04-39-53-953_7b47c3107ee5f0d9.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605847183737},{"createdTime":"2020-11-20 12:39:43","updatedTime":"2020-11-20 12:39:43","title":"'Muscular bonding': The strange psychological effects of moving together","link":"https://bigthink.com/mind-brain/muscular-bonding","description":"<img src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNDc4OTAwNC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1MTcwNzA2MX0.Wt6bMQmKRpEcswm63lQ0QbQa4fXXBy-Q5HCmPv0rqNM/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C292%2C0%2C292&height=700\"/><br/><br/><ul class=\"ee-ul\"><li>Muscular bonding, a term coined by the veteran and historian William McNeill, describes how individuals engaged in synchronous movement often experience feelings of euphoria and connection to the group.</li><li>Psychologists have proposed that muscular bonding, or interpersonal entrainment, is a group-level adaptation that helped early human groups outcompete other groups.</li><li>Muscular bonding can help people form cohesive groups, but it could come at cost.</li></ul><hr/><h3></h3><br/><p>Humans have a penchant for moving together in unison. From ancient cultures dancing around campfires to modern armies marching in lockstep, synchronized movement often emerges in groups, even when there's no obvious benefit. But why?</p>\n<p>In his 1995 book \"<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674502302/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=farnamstreet-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0674502302&linkId=9002b54bbaf082c1666a7add18217a86\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Keeping Together in Time: Dance and Drill in Human History</a>\", historian and veteran William McNeill recalled the strange, euphoric feelings he experienced while participating in military drills as a young man:</p>\n<p>\"Marching aimlessly about on the drill field, swaggering in conformity with prescribed military postures, conscious only of keeping in step so as to make the next move correctly and in time somehow felt good.\"</p>\n<p>McNeill noted that military drills seem utterly \"useless\" in the modern context. After all, soldiers no longer arrange themselves in tight columns to fire muskets at each other in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volley_fire\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">volley fire-style</a> attacks. Yet incessant drilling has remained a fundamental part of military culture. </p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<h3>Muscular bonding and the 'hive switch'</h3><br><p>McNeill thought there was more to drilling than meets the eye, something beyond forcing soldiers into compliance and conformity. He called it \"muscular bonding.\" The term describes how individuals engaged in synchronous movement experience feelings of euphoria and connection to the group.</p><p>This phenomenon, McNeill said, is \"far older than language and critically important in human history, because the emotion it arouses constitutes an indefinitely expansible basis for social cohesion among any and every group that keeps together in time.\"</p><p>Since McNeill first described muscular bonding, researchers have been trying to better understand the phenomenon and how it affects group dynamics. In the book \"The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion\", the social psychologist Jonathan Haidt proposed a bold hypothesis: muscular bonding serves as a kind of \"switch\" that, when activated, helps individuals transcend selfishness to act in the interests of their group.</p><p>To illustrate this idea, Haidt said humans are a lot like chimpanzees (self-interested) and a bit like bees (group-interested, existing to sustain the hive). He framed muscular bonding as a \"hive switch\" that pushes us away from chimp-like behavior toward bee-like behaviors. This ability to \"lose ourselves (temporarily and ecstatically)\" would help explain why people, under the right conditions, can come together in an \"all for one, one for all\" mentality. It'd help explain why some soldiers sacrifice themselves in battle for the group.</p><h3>Forming cohesive groups</h3><br/><p>Over the past two decades, psychologists have conducted various experiments on muscular bonding, also called interpersonal entrainment. These studies generally involved groups of people doing physical activities (or simply imagining them) synchronously or asynchronously, and then playing economic games with each other, or rating how much they like or trust the people with whom they've entrained.</p><p>A <a href=\"https://www.degruyter.com/view/journals/psych/1/1/article-p273.xml\" target=\"_blank\">2019 review of research on interpersonal entrainment</a> (IPE) found that people generally report higher levels of deindividualization after engaging in IPE. In other words, they view themselves more as a group member than an individual. What's more, some studies suggest that engaging in IPE can also increase performance in domains related to memory, attention and physical movement.</p><p>Together, the research suggests that muscular bonding helps individuals form cohesive and effective groups. It's easy to see how this would be an advantageous group-level adaptation in human evolution: The tribe who's better able to move together toward shared goals is likely to outcompete less coherent tribes. Then, individuals in the successful group passed down genetic traits, making future generations more likely to engage in the same kinds of cohesive behaviors.

We aren't talking here about the first night with a new lover, because then there are other variables at play that might give false results in the study we want to conduct.</p><p>The phenomenon of FNE, or 'first night effect', has been known of for a long time. Thus far, scientists haven't been able to come up with a reasonable explanation for it, which has kept sleep researcher Masako Tamaki awake at night. So, she brought together a team of experts in human brain processes and began to look for answers. After examining dozens of brains of people while they slept in a new place, it turned out that the activity of both hemispheres of the brain was significantly different from normal.</p><h3></h3><br/><p>In a new place, we sleep a little like some animals. One hemisphere gives in to the embrace of Morpheus, but the other remains alert. This is what happens with, for example, dolphins. In humans, the second hemisphere also goes to sleep, but this is an unusually shallow and vigilant sleep. This is in order to react to potential threats. Of course, in the majority of cases, we are not at risk of being torn apart by a tiger, but evolutionary changes have not kept pace with our lifestyle changes. This is why, during the first night in a new environment, almost any noise can wake us up; the creaking of a door, or the distant barking of a puppy. In most cases, the left hemisphere is on night watch. Will we always be like this? Another scientist, Yuki Sasaki, claims that, because of the relative peace and security of our existence, over time this function of the human brain will be extinguished as unnecessary.</p><p>Meanwhile, when turning out the light in a new place, it's best to give up on any hope of a good night's sleep. Evolution works slowly.</p><p><em>Translated from <a href=\"https://przekroj.pl/nauka/koszmar-senny-raczej-niedogodnosc-jakub-bas\" target=\"_blank\">the Polish</a> by Annie Jaroszewicz</em></p><p>Reprinted with permission of <a href=\"https://przekroj.pl/en/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Przekrój</a>.
