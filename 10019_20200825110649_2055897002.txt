health risk to anyone with an allergy or food intolerance to these ingredients.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>People who are severely allergic to molluscs or fish can experience anaphylactic shock, while an intolerance to milk and gluten can cause digestive issues such as stomach cramps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spar advises anyone with an allergy to these foods to return the paella to their nearest store for a full refund.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can find your nearest Spar shop by using its <a href=\"https://www.spar.co.uk/store-locator\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">online store locator

important means of protecting consumers from dangerous goods.\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div>\n<p>As a general rule, if a recall involves a branded product, the manufacturer would usually have lead responsibility for the recall action.</p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s often left up to supermarkets to notify customers when products could put them at risk.</p>\n<p>If you are concerned about the safety of a product you own, always check the manufacturer’s website to see if a safety notice has been issued.</p>\n<p>When it comes to appliances, rather than just food items, the onus is usually on you &#8211; the customer &#8211; to register the appliance with the manufacturer as if you don&#8217;t there is no way of contacting you to tell you about a fault.</p>\n<p>If you become aware that an item you own has been recalled or has any safety noticed issued against it, make sure you follow the instructions given to you by the manufacturer.</p>\n<p>They should usually provide you with more information and a contact number on its safety notice.</p>\n<p>In some cases, the manufacturer might ask you to return the item for a full refund or arrange for the faulty product to be collected.</p>\n<p>You should not be charged for any recall work &#8211; such as a repair, replacement or collection of the recalled item.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\n\n\n\n<p>Spar has recalled the paella as a precautionary measure &#8211; it hasn’t reported any illnesses from this product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No other Spar products are affected by the recall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A notice on the <a href=\"https://www.food.gov.uk/news-alerts/alert/fsa-aa-46-2020\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">Food Standards Agency</a> website reads: &#8220;Spar is recalling Spar Chicken and Prawn paella because it contains fish, molluscs, milk and wheat (gluten), which are not mentioned on the label. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This means the product is a possible health risk for anyone with an allergy to fish, and/or molluscs, and/or an allergy or intolerance to milk or milk constituents, and/or to wheat (gluten).&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Sun has contacted Spar for more information and we&#8217;ll update this article when we get a response.</p>\n\n\n\n\t<!--googleoff: all-->\n\t\t<div class=\"sun-grid-container sun-grid-container--white\">\n\t\n\t<div class=\"sun-row

lockdown rules are tightened to stop the spread of coronavirus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The City Council today revealed tough new powers to try and stop the city from going into a full lockdown.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/26a0.png\" alt=\"⚠\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> Read our <a

aren&#8217;t coronavirus-secure in Birmingham</figcaption><figcredit></figcredit></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It means police will be able to stop people going in restaurants or bars which aren&#8217;t covid-secure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And some large events such as weddings and funerals could be cancelled too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cops will also have the power to close public outdoor spaces to stop people gatehring there too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The measures are partly to stop the spread of the virus so that schools don&#8217;t have to shut and kids&#8217; education won&#8217;t be harmed any further, leaders said today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It comes after a Gold Command meeting with Matt Hancock and local leaders in Birmingham last week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The city became an &#8220;area of concern&#8221; and will now become an &#8220;area of enhanced support&#8221; after a spike in cases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, today it was claimed that rates of infection have been going down over recent days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The news also comes as cops broke up SEVENTY illegal parties in Brum last weekend <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/uknews/12476595/rave-police-huddersfield-birmingham-party-local-lockdown/\">despite the threat of tighter measures.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Police across the UK<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/politics/12440914/ravers-face-huge-fines-illegal-parties/\"> now have the power to slap ravers with £10,000 fines for hosting illegal parties</a> too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Councillor Ian Ward, Leader of Birmingham City Council said today: “While the recent figures show our rates are going down, we cannot be complacent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We must all continue to follow all the relevant safety guidance in order to protect our families, friends and work colleagues. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Most importantly staying disciplined now is a price worth paying when compared to the cost of damaging the future life chances of our City’s children – which may happen if there is a spike in the rate of infections and schools have to close, or parents do not send them due to concerns about the potential risks . </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Whilst the impact of Covid-19 may be felt over the next few years, the negative impacts upon children not being present at school will last a lifetime.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new powers mean cops will be able to intervene to keep citizens safe and stop them from spreading the infection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Members of the public can let the council or police aware of any concerns they have by ringing a special hotline or filling in a form online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Offending businesses will be issued with written warnings and served with a closure of notice if they refuse to comply.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The current rules for pubs and other hospitality venues include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Customers must give their details to the venue so track and trace can alert them if there&#8217;s a potential case</li><li>No more than six people from a max of two households should be meeting up</li><li>People must stay apart from other groups</li><li>Wearing a face covering where required &#8211; unless eating or drinking in</li></ul>\n\n\n\n\t<!--googleoff: all-->\n\t\t<div class=\"sun-grid-container

wasn’t wearing shoes when she went missing, had no injuries to her feet despite being found one kilometre away from the villa.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“She was found unclothed, without footwear yet there were no serious scars or injuries to her soles?” the lawyer said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Nora&#8217;s parents, the teenager could not walk 20ft on her own, <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/nora-quoirin-teen-found-dead-22573429\">The Mirror</a> reports.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mohamad Nor Marzukee Besar, the police superintendent who covers the Dusun Resort district said: &#8220;A preliminary interview with Nora Anne&#8217;s family led us to conclude due to the victim&#8217;s special condition, she was not able to go beyond 20ft on foot when on her own.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mohamad Mat Yusop, the local police chief, was the first witness to be called to the inquest in Seremban.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mr Yusop agreed with the family’s lawyer and said that Nora had &#8220;only some minor bruises&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Mr Yusop added: “There was no indication the victim was kidnapped.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We did not receive any telephone calls &#8211; usually in this kind of case we will get a call to say the victim has been kidnapped and is in the hands of certain people, and they would demand a ransom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I believe the missing person actually climbed out of the window.”</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/nora-map.jpg?strip=all&#38;w=567\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone

reported missing by her devastated mum and dad Meabh and Sebastian Quoirin back in August 2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She vanished from her bedroom at the Dusun Resort, surrounded by thick <a

starved to death in the period of time she was missing, and died from internal bleeding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Nora&#8217;s heartbroken parents Meabh and Sebastien argued their daughter would never have wandered away alone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They demanded an inquest which opened yesterday.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>&#8216;Nothing suspicious&#8217;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Police chief Yusop, who was in charge of the hunt for Nora, said at the time he inspected the family&#8217;s holiday bungalow and found nothing suspicious.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the resort&#8217;s owner, Haanim Ahmed Bamadhaj, said the window that Nora is said to have climbed from had a broken latch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It had been disassembled and presented to the court.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bungalow did not have any CCTV.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mr Mat Yusop added: &#8220;The family was distraught when I met them. I assured the father we will use all our resources to find the missing girl.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mr and Mrs Quoirin pushed for the inquest, and are due to give evidence via videolink later this week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10573689/nora-quoirin-parents-malaysia-criminal-justice/\">The couple said previously they believe &#8220;crucial time&#8221; was lost at the beginning of the search for Nora</a>, who was born with the brain defect holoprosencephaly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>&#8216;Criminal element&#8217;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking&#160;<a href=\"https://www.rte.ie/news/2019/1217/1101725-we-want-truth-and-justice-for-nora-quoirin-family/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">to RTE News in Ireland</a>, Meabh said: &#8220;I think it wouldn&#8217;t be out of character, for us it would be impossible physically, mentally to imagine that she could have got any distance at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;And for us, something very complex happened.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve insisted from the beginning that we believe there was a criminal element to what happened.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;And crucially we were struggling because it was difficult to get the resources in place fast enough to explore a criminal angle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;And, you know, we believe that crucial time and evidence was lost in the beginning.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/9737783/nora-quoirin-news-mccann-cop-jim-gamble-malaysia/\">The parents&#8217;

to add everything to their basket, only to get an error page at the payment screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They tweeted: &#8220;Your website is a shambles. Just taken a couple of hours to put an order in and now your site is down just as I was adding the last item!&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another said: &#8220;I&#8217;ve just spent ages adding it all to my basket will not be amused if i lose it completely. So many people on website no chance of rebooking.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Tescodwon1.png?strip=all&#38;w=582\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-12492918\" width=\"582\" height=\"134\" />\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Tescodown2.png?strip=all&#38;w=562\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-12492921\" width=\"562\" height=\"161\" />\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Tescodown3.png?strip=all&#38;w=576\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-12492924\" width=\"576\" height=\"223\" />\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_12492994\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 587px\"><img src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-187.png?strip=all&#38;w=577\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-12492994\" width=\"577\" height=\"135\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tesco customers have been tweeting the supermarket</figcaption><figcredit></figcredit></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A third tweeted: &#8220;Have been trying to checkout my Tesco online order for the last 15 minutes and constantly getting an error that the payment page is unavailable. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Tried on phone, same problem. Am running out of time for my slot. What&#8217;s up with your website?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A fourth asked: &#8220;Is your website not working? I have an grocery order I&#8217;ve just done but it won’t let me go through to the payment page?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shoppers are now concerned they&#8217;ll have to start their order all over again, as well as worrying that their timed delivery slot won&#8217;t still be reserved when they can get back online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/tesco/\">Tesco</a> has replied to several customers saying that if they already added items to their basket, their order should still be there when the website is back up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, shoppers may need to find a new delivery slot if their original time is no longer available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Replying to one customer on Twitter, Tesco said: &#8220;Your shopping basket should not empty, but you will need to look for a new slot once the website is fixed.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Customers say they can&#8217;t complete orders on both the desktop and mobile Tesco websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The supermarket hasn&#8217;t revealed the cause of the problem, or how many shoppers are affected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It appears the website went down around an hour ago, based on when customers started tweeting Tesco.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A notice on the Tesco desktop website reads: &#8220;Because our site is so busy right now, you may experience some delays.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Please wait and refresh this page occasionally, as it won&#8217;t refresh automatically. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re sorry for any inconvenience and thank you for your patience.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tesco confirmed to The Sun that it&#8217;s looking into the issue &#8211; we&#8217;ll update this article when we get more information.</p>\n\n\n\n\t<!--googleoff: all-->\n\t\t<div class=\"sun-grid-container

roles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Starfire star Anna Diop explained how she overcame the criticism she experienced: &#8220;There was a lot of backlash because some people were upset that it was a Black woman that they cast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;And I had to lean into my friends and my family and my faith in a way that I haven&#8217;t really had to do before.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She added: &#8220;But, it&#8217;s incredible to see what that meant for a lot of people, a lot of marginalised people reached out to me, be it Black or gay or trans or whatever, and it&#8217;s incredible to be even some small inspiration for them.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_12492040\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img

&#8220;I&#8217;m really honoured to play this role of the first Black lesbian superhero.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Because when I think of that, I think of all the Black lesbians who have not been able to visually see themselves when they go to the cinema or they watch their favourite TV shows.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She continued: &#8220;And for me, it&#8217;s one thing knowing that there is a role for it, but when you&#8217;re in that role and you&#8217;re getting feedback, you realise the importance of it and how much it is necessary and how much you need it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n\t<div

how she was able to feed her family for a week using the service &#8211; which offers shoppers discounted food which is past the &#8220;best before&#8221; date but is still fine to eat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alice said: &#8220;I knew that at the least I would get enough vegetables for soup and so on for us to last a couple of days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This was my fourth box, and I

href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/12483983/chelsea-transfer-kai-havertz-agreed/\">Havertz will cost considerably more</a>, with Bayer Leverkusen insisting on an up-front fee of £90m</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But despite forking out a massive amount on the German, <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/team/1196660/chelsea/\">Chelsea</a> will <strong>STILL</strong> only have to find £4m.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s because, since the summer of 2019, Chelsea have actually made a net <strong>PROFIT</strong> of £86m, thanks in no small part to being under a transfer ban last summer.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<h3><strong><a

transfer[/caption]\n\n\n\n<p>The Blues sold Hazard to Real Madrid a year ago in a deal worth £88m up front, potentially rising to £150m.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As things stand, Hazard has made the Blues around £100m &#8211; which has helped bankroll a major 2020 splurge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chelsea also waved goodbye to Alvaro Morata in January 2019, on an 18-month loan deal to Atletico Madrid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Six months in, Atleti agreed to take on the Spaniard permanently at the end of the loan, meaning they should have now paid the £58m fee this summer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since last summer, the Blues have also sold Mario Pasalic (Atalanta, £14m), David Luiz (Arsenal, £8m) and Ola Aina (Torino, £9m).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tomas Kalas (Bristol City, £8m), Michael Hector (Fulham, £5m) and Kenneth Omeruo (Leganes, £5m) have also been moved on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chelsea have therefore raked in £203m in sales since last summer.</p>\n\n\n\n<a

landing Werner and Ziyech.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All-in-all, the West Londoners have spent just £121m.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That means, they are currently £86m in <strong>PROFIT</strong> ahead of moves for Havertz and Silva.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once those deals are done, Chelsea will have spent just £4m in their year-long squad overhaul.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/12467729/chelsea-leicester-ben-chilwell-transfer-medical/\">Ben Chilwell is tipped to join in a £50m deal</a>, with Declan Rice on the cards for a fee of

still to spend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Flop goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga is set to be sold and replaced this summer.</p>\n\n\n\n\t<!--googleoff: all-->\n\t\t<div class=\"sun-grid-container

told the High Court passenger demand had &#8220;plummeted to a level that would until recently have been unthinkable&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added the company would “run out of money altogether” by the final week of the month if help wasn’t granted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If successful, another UK court hearing will be held on Sept 2 to approve the plan, and a procedural hearing is scheduled for Sept 3

include overseeing Britney’s business affairs, some personal assets, legal matters and family law issues.</p>\n<p>He also negotiated his daughter’s 2012 stint as a judge on the US X Factor

episodes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We will see how the pair get on as they face various challenges during their first year of marriage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Screenwriter Peter Bowker, who wrote <a

of The A Word to increase representation and diversity both on and off screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Equally exciting is the opportunity to work again with two young actors as talented as Leon and Sarah.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added: &#8220;It is a tribute to their performances in The A Word that the BBC have commissioned this series.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_12491475\"

given a modern makeover in 2019, with grey cabinets and brass handles, patterned tiling on the walls and open shelving.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also has marble worktops while it is filled with all the

happened?</h2> \n<p>Thousands of users have already reported issues with Slack to online outage tracker Down Detector.</p> \n<p>And a global outage map suggests the app is affected globally, although primarily in the UK and Western Europe.</p> \n<p>It’s possible that the USA may also be affected once business hours begin there.</p> \n<figure id=\"attachment_12493006\" class=\"wp-caption

\n<p>It’s currently unclear what has caused the outage.</p> \n<h2>Slack not working – what are users saying?</h2> \n<p>Users have flocked to Twitter to complain about their Slack woes.</p> \n<p>One wrote: “Slack is down and I’m completely unproductive all of a sudden.”</p> \n<p>Another said: “Slack is down and I feel completely cut off from everything and everyone.”</p> \n<p>However, some users are still able to send messages.</p> \n<p>One user wrote: “The iron of asking/telling folks that Slack is down on Slack itself is palpable.”</p> \n<figure id=\"attachment_12493008\" class=\"wp-caption

app.</p> \n<p>In a statement sent to The Sun, a Slack representative said: “We’re very sorry for the inconvenience, but Slack is experiencing some difficulties right now.</p> \n<p>‘We’re working hard to resolve the issue as quickly as possible and we’ll update you as soon as we have more information.”</p> \n<p>The official Slack status page confirms that there are problems with connecting, sending messages, and creating posts or uploading files.</p> \n<p>But all other areas of Slack are reported as being operational, including search, calls and log-in.</p> \n<p><em>More to come…</em></p>

the Switch came out in 2017 – but has a major upgrade in the works, according to <a

\n<p>Bloomberg also reports that a “slew of games from Nintendo itself and related outside studios”&nbsp;are coming next year.</p> \n<p>If an upgraded Switch console is in the works, it’s safe to assume that a handful of those new games will support 4K resolution.</p> \n<p>The report does not provide an exact release date for the rumoured console, nor does it hint at how much the high-powered machine will cost.</p> \n<p>The Sun has reached out to Nintendo for comment.</p> \n<div class=\"article-boxout\"> \n <div class=\"article-boxout__header theme__background-color\"> \n  <h3 class=\"article-boxout__headline\">What is 4K, Ultra HD and UHD?</h3> \n </div> \n <div class=\"article-boxout__content theme__background-color-rgba-20\"> \n  <p class=\"article__content--intro\"> Here's an easy guide to what 4K means... </p> \n  <div> \n   <ul> \n    <li>4K, Ultra HD and UHD are all different names for the same type of TV screen. 4K refers to the number of pixels on your TV screen – or the “image resolution”</li> \n    <li>The pixels are the tiny dots of colour that make up the image you see on your telly. A pixellated image is one where the pixels are really obvious, because there aren’t many. But images with lots of pixels – like a 4K movie – generally look sharper and clearer</li> \n    <li>A true 4K screen has 4096 x 2160 pixels. That means on your TV screen there are 3840 pixels across, and 2160 pixels vertically. That’s roughly 8.3 million pixels on the display in total</li> \n    <li>4K gets it’s name because it’s got four times the number of pixels as a standard Full HD TV</li> \n    <li>Full HD (or 1080p) screens have 1920 pixels across, and 1080 pixels going upwards – for around two million pixels in total. So 4K just means your TV has many more pixels on the screen compared to a more common Full HD display</li> \n    <li>Ultra HD, or UHD, is basically the same as 4K. If you buy a UHD telly in a shop, you’ll be able to watch 4K content on it with no bother</li> \n    <li>But there is a small difference. Almost every TV you ever buy has an aspect ratio of 16:9. That means for every 16 pixels horizontally, there are 9 vertically</li> \n    <li>True 4K footage doesn’t quite fit in with that ratio, so you won’t often find TVs with 4096 x 2160 pixels. Instead, to fit with the 16:9 ratio, most 4K TVs will have 3840 x 2160 pixels instead</li> \n    <li>If it doesn’t make sense, grab a calculator and divide 2160 by 9. Then multiply it by 16, and you’ll get 3840. That’s the aspect ratio working its magic. So when you see an Ultra HD TV, it just means it’s a 4K image with slightly fewer vertical pixels</li> \n    <li>If you try watching a 4K video on a non-4K TV, the video will still play – but it won’t be in 4K quality. To watch a 4K video in 4K quality, you’ll need to fork out for a 4K TV. Similarly, if you’re watching standard or HD footage on a 4K TV, it won’t magically become 4K quality</li> \n    <li>Some TVs promise “4K upscaling”, which converts your standard or HD footage to near-4K quality. This works by using software to guess what colours would fill the extra empty pixels missing in HD footage, and then filling them in.

months[/caption]\n\n\n\n<p>The second grant opened for applications on August 17, 2020, but you can still apply now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re eligible, you&#8217;ll need to make a claim by 19 October, 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s what you need to know:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is the grant?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Under the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11261513/self-employed-coronavirus-help-rishi-sunak/\">self-employed income support scheme (SEISS)</a>, the government will cover up to 70 per cent of your trading profits over three months. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s capped at £2,190 a month so the maximum you will be able to claim in total is £6,750. </p>\n\n\n\n\t<div class=\"article-boxout\">\n\t\t<div class=\"article-boxout__header theme__background-color\">\n\t\t\t<h3 class=\"article-boxout__headline\">What other help is there for self-employed workers?</h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"article-boxout__content theme__background-color-rgba-20\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"article__content--intro\">\n\t\t\t\t\tTHE government has also introduced the following measures to help self-employed workers and businesses during the coronavirus outbreak:\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div>\n<p><strong>Income-tax deferrals</strong>: Self-assessment income tax payments, that were due in July, can be deferred to the end of January next year.</p>\n<p><strong>Rent support:</strong>&#160;Businesses who are struggling to pay their rents are protected from eviction until the end of June.</p>\n<p><strong>Coronavirus business interruption loan scheme:</strong>&#160;SMEs can get&#160;loans and overdrafts of up to £5million&#160;for up to six years and the government will guarantee up to 80 per of these.</p>\n<p><strong>Grants of up to £10,000:</strong>&#160;Small firms can get&#160;grants of up to £10,000&#160;to help with ongoing business costs.</p>\n<p><strong>VAT payments:&#160;</strong>VAT payments can be deferred&#160;for three months.</p>\n<p><strong>Tax bill help:&#160;</strong>SMEs that cannot afford their tax bills can ask HMRC for a “time to pay” arrangement so any debt collection is suspended.</p>\n<p><strong>Business rates holiday:&#160;</strong>A 12-month&#160;business rates holiday&#160;has been introduced for many businesses.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\n\n\n\n<p>The idea is to give businesses some breathing space if they are operating fine now, but start to struggle later on in the year, say in September, when they may be able to still apply for the grant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don&#8217;t have to repay the grant if you’re eligible, but it will be subject to income tax and&#160;<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/self-employed-national-insurance-rates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">self-employed national insurance</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the second grant launched for self-employed people. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first three-month grant was available until July 13 and it&#8217;s been assumed that it covered three months&#8217; worth of loss of earnings in March, April and May. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It paid a larger <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/11678104/self-employed-workers-seiss-bank-accounts/\">80 per cent</a> of earnings, with the total paid capped at a higher £7,500. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/11885052/self-employed-grant-business-help/\">loophole in when the second grant launches means that loss of earnings</a> in June and half of July is not covered by the government support. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Am I eligible to claim? </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to claim the second payout, self-employed workers have to <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/11885052/self-employed-grant-business-help/\">prove they have been adversely affected</a> by coronavirus on or after July 14, 2020. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be eligible, you also must have filed a tax return for 2018/19, meaning you must have been self-employed before April 6, 2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The grants are calculated based on an average of your profits over three tax years &#8211; 2016/17, 2017/18 and 2018/19. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you didn&#8217;t trade in 2016/17, then it will be based on your average profits in 2017/18 and 2018/19, or in 2018/19 if that&#8217;s the only year you traded. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You must also earn more than half of your total income from self-employment and your trading profit must be less than £50,000 a year to qualify.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Self-employed workers who are company directors or run their businesses as limited companies <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/11625195/self-employed-workers-missing-out-grant/\">cannot apply</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you claim maternity allowance this will not affect your eligibility for the grant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can be eligible for the second grant regardless of whether or not you claimed the first payment. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there are growing fears that some businesses will miss out on the second grant if they can&#8217;t prove their work has been disrupted after mid-July &#8211; even if they&#8217;re already struggling.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How do I claim? </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can make your claim via the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/claim-a-grant-through-the-self-employment-income-support-scheme\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Gov.uk website</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Self-employed workers will need the following info to claim:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Self-assessment unique taxpayer reference (UTR) – if you do not have this&#160;<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/find-lost-utr-number\">find out how to get your lost&#160;<abbr title=\"Unique Taxpayer Reference\">UTR</abbr></a></li><li>National insurance number – if you do not have this&#160;<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/lost-national-insurance-number\">find out how to get your lost national insurance number</a></li><li>Government Gateway user ID and password – if you do not have a user ID, you can create one when you make your claim</li><li>UK bank details (only provide bank account details where a Bacs payment can be accepted).</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is the deadline to claim?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/11726224/self-employed-grant-extended-furlough-october/\">You have until October 19, 2020 to apply</a> for the second SEISS grant. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Grants will then be paid into your bank account in the next six working days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first grant has already closed so you can no longer apply. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Self-employed

bank balance on a regular basis &#8211;</strong>&#160;Knowing your spending patterns is the first step to managing your money.</p>\n<p><strong>Work out your budget &#8211;&#160;</strong>By writing down your income and taking away your essential bills such as food and transport. If you have money left over, plan in advance what else you’ll spend or save. If you don’t, look at ways to cut your costs.</p>\n<p><strong>Pay off more than the minimum &#8211;</strong>&#160;If you’ve got credit card debts aim to pay off more than the minimum amount on your credit card each month to bring down your bill quicker.</p>\n<p><strong>Pay your most expensive credit card sooner &#8211;</strong>&#160;If you have more than one credit card and can’t pay them off in full each month, prioritise the most expensive card (the one with the highest interest rate).</p>\n<p><strong>Prioritise your debts</strong>&#160;&#8211; If you’ve got several debts and you can’t afford to pay them all it’s important to prioritise them. Your rent, mortgage, council tax and energy bills should be paid first because the consequences can be more serious if you don&#8217;t pay.</p>\n<p><strong>Get advice</strong>&#160;&#8211; If you’re struggling to pay your debts month after month it’s important you get advice as soon as possible, before they build up even further. </p>\n<p>Speak to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a

&#8220;adored&#8221; her little boy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The baby boy, who was found crying and weakened from starvation beside his mum&#8217;s body, is now being cared for by his father, who is understood to be an asylum seeker.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pals raised the alarm after not hearing from Mercy for four days and police made the grim discovery on August 22.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On August 11, Mercy had got in touch with charity Positive Action for Housing, to get help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No cause of death has yet been established.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>&#8216;AMAZING MOTHER&#8217;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A

first, especially her son.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Her smile made everyone so welcome and comfortable.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robina Qureshi, Director of Positive Action in Housing said: “This is the third tragedy to affect the city’s refugee population in as many months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Mercy contacted our charity on August 11 and said she was not getting any financial support yet had made an application to MigrantHelp. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Had she lived she would have been a high priority for a crisis payment from our Emergency Relief Fund like hundreds of others left functionally destitute by the asylum system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The question remains, why are mothers and babies being left to go hungry in this city, why is it being left to charities and volunteers to pick up the pieces? Does society have anything to say about that other than call them a drain on society?</p>\n\n\n\n\t<!--googleoff: all-->\n\t\t<div class=\"sun-grid-container sun-grid-container--white\">\n\t\n\t<div

href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/kim-jong-un/\">36-year-old dictator</a> has rarely has rarely been sighted since a reported botched heart operation in April.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suspicions first arose after he failed to attend celebrations for the Day of the Sun, an important annual event marking the birth of Kim Il-sung, North Korea&#8217;s founder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He later re-emerged, but has since only appeared in public intermittently, and is reported to be suffering ongoing health problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rumours have sparked renewed speculation about <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11443508/kim-jong-un-death-successors-sister/\">the power struggle </a>that could follow in the event of his death. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kim Yo Jong has become and increasingly central figure in the regime in recent years and is currently thought to be the front-runner to replace her brother. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Maxwell is a retired US Army colonel and previously worked with the Pentagon on a contingency plan to prepare for any collapse of the North Korean regime. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking to the <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/08/24/kim-yo-jong-could-be-north-koreas-worst-dictator-yet-experts-say/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">New York Post</a>, he said that Kim Yo Jong remained an unknown quantity, but added: &#8220;My speculation — given the reputation and history of the family — is that she would rule with an iron fist.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said many experts believed before Kim Jong-un took power that he would be more open to the outside world than his father, but that that hope hadn&#8217;t been realised. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I think we have to assume that every successor is worse than the last,&#8221; he said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Discussion about a likely successor first began again after Chang Song-min, an ex-aide to late South Korean president Kim Dae-Jung, told local media that he believed senior North Korean officials were trying to conceal the truth about Kim Jong-un&#8217;s recent health. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I assess him to be in a coma, but his life has not ended,&#8221; he said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“A complete succession structure has not been formed, so Kim Yo-jong is being brought to the fore as the vacuum cannot be maintained for a prolonged period.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>&#8216;AMBITIOUS AND SMART&#8217;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sung-Yoon Lee, a professor at Tufts University’s Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, told the Post that the claims were wholly unsubstantiated, but said Kim Yo Jong was clearly being prepped to take her brother&#8217;s place should it become necessary. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said she was &#8220;ambitious and smart&#8221; but that the nature of the role would demand &#8220;she be ruthless, especially in the first few years.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The way for her to build up her credibility and net worth, that is, the way for her to get respect, is not to play nice but be a cruel dictator to her people and a credible nuclear threat to the US,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“She may prove herself fiercer and more tyrannical than her brother, father, or grandfather.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>North Korea is known to be pursuing a nuclear weapons programme, and talks between the regime and the Trump administration have so far failed to produce any agreement on disarmament. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another possible successor is Kim Pyong II, uncle to the siblings, who returned to the country in 2019 after spending years working as a diplomat in Europe. </p>\n\n\n\n\t<!--googleoff: all-->\n\t\t<div class=\"sun-grid-container sun-grid-container--white\">\n\t\n\t<div class=\"sun-row \">\n\t\t<div class=\"col

Manchester United snap up Jadon Sancho this summer.</p>\n<p>The English superstar &#8211; who&#8217;s valued at £110million by Borussia Dortmund &#8211; is edging closer by the day to a move to Old Trafford and he&#8217;s sure to be an exciting addition to next season&#8217;s Dream Team game.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_12311849\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 10px\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-12311849 size-thesun-article-image\" src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000580017071.jpg?strip=all&#38;w=960\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\"

team?</h2>\n<p>We&#8217;ve had all of the speculation and hearsay &#8211; from discussions about Sancho&#8217;s wages to whether or not he&#8217;d wear the iconic No.7 shirt at United.</p>\n<p>But the only thing fans of Dream Team want to know is when we&#8217;ll sign &#8211; and what he could bring to fantasy football and the Premier League next season.</p>\n<p>Sancho is certainly a talent; last term he notched 19 goals and 18 assists across the Bundesliga and Champions League, and using WhoScored&#8217;s rating&#8217;s system we&#8217;ve worked out he would&#8217;ve finished the season with <strong>253 points</strong> on Dream Team.</p>\n<p>To put that into context, only Raheem Sterling and Kevin De Bruyne notched more points than Sancho by the end of the season, with Mohamed Salah just behind him with 251 points.</p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-boxout\">\n\t\t<div class=\"article-boxout__header theme__background-color\">\n\t\t\t<h3 class=\"article-boxout__headline\">Why you should

&#8211; he hasn&#8217;t even moved to the Man United at this point &#8211; we can still have fun speculating while using other, similar players as a rough guideline.</p>\n<p>Sterling, for example, started last season at £6.5m and was a midfielder, while Salah was slightly more expensive at £7.5m and was a striker.</p>\n<p>However, as Sancho is unproven in the Premier League, he might start out a little bit cheaper than Sterling&#8217;s price, while my best guess is that he&#8217;ll be down as a midfielder on the game &#8211; similar to Sterling, Sadio Mane and Eden Hazard before.</p>\n<h2>When does fantasy football start for the new season?</h2>\n<p>We anticipate that registration for Dream Team will open around <strong>mid-August </strong>&#8211; I know, it&#8217;s a quick turnaround!</p>\n<p>It’s completely free to play as ever and there’ll be a hefty jackpot up for grabs.</p>\n<p>The season itself will start on <strong>September 12th</strong>.</p>\n<hr

exercising and climbing on furniture in his cell at the same time he was appearing in court in a wheelchair. </p>\n<p>Joseph DeAngelo Jr, 74, was last week handed multiple life sentences without the possibility of parole after being convicted for a string of rapes and murders committed in California between 1976 and 1986. </p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_12491520\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"

statements[/caption]</p>\n<p>DeAngelo, a former police officer, was arrested in April 2018 after DNA evidence was used along with a genealogy database to link him to the crimes decades after they were committed. </p>\n<p>In June, he admitted to 13 counts of first-degree murder in a deal intended to avoid the death penalty.</p>\n<p>He is also believed to be responsible for dozens of other rapes and burglaries. </p>\n<p>Following his arrest, DeAngelo frequently appeared at court hearings looking frail and confused and being pushed in a wheelchair, an appearance he maintained throughout his trial. </p>\n<p>But footage released by prosecutors after his sentencing shows him walking freely around his cell, even clambering onto a high sill above his bed. </p>\n<p>He is also seen lifting his foam mattress and moving it across his cell, lifting his arms above his head for exercise, and using cardboard to meticulously block out a light and make his cell darker. </p>\n<p>Sacramento County District Attorney Anne Marie Schubert said the videos illustrated that DeAngelo was not the person he had sought to present himself as during his trial. </p>\n<p>&#8220;When you look back in time four decades, and you now stand in the presence of 2020, you can see that Joseph DeAngelo is no different today than when he was 45 years ago,&#8221; she said. </p>\n<p>&#8220;[The videos] simply demonstrate&#8230; his mental acuity, his dexterity, his ability to deceive or attempt to deceive the entire world into believing he is a feeble old man. </p>\n<p>&#8220;These are just snippets into the window of the mind of a sociopath. </p>\n<p>&#8220;He is, quite simply, the definition of one. He has and always will be a sociopath in action.&#8221;</p>\n<p>After listening silently to witness testimony and shortly before being sentenced on Friday, DeAngelo stood and told the court: &#8220;I&#8217;ve listened to all of your statements. Each one of them. And I&#8217;m really sorry for everyone I&#8217;ve hurt.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The sentencing took place in a university ballroom because a normal courtroom would have been too small to accommodate the many victims and victims&#8217; families who wanted to attend. </p>\n<p>The sentences DeAngelo received mean he will almost certainly die in prison. </p>\n<p>\t<!--googleoff: all-->\n\t\t<div

been compared to Real Madrid&#8217;s Varane and Liverpool star Van Dijk. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vannuchi said: &#8220;A mix of the two styles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;With Varane because of his speed and power, and with Van Dijk it is the interceptions, the positioning on the pitch.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/12490696/arsenal-transfer-gabriel-magalhaes-agent/\">Saliba will

concerns over the rising number of coronavirus cases and the flouting of safety rules, including illegal parties and people ignoring the face mask rules.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The regional government is asking the security forces to step up controls on all the islands, which includes Tenerife, Lanzarote and Gran Canaria, the latter of which has the highest number of cases.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure

Canaria, where many of the guests were not wearing masks or observing social distancing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two other parties advertised on the social networks were also banned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spain has 420,809 overall cases, the highest in Europe, while the Canaries have had nearly 5,000 since the crisis began.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Health chiefs say there have been 2,031 infections in the last 15 days, representing a cumulative incidence of 94.32 cases diagnosed per 100,000 inhabitants, while in the last seven days there are 1,282 cases in the islands, with an incidence of 59.53.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both of these put the islands well over the UK&#8217;s rate of 20 &#8211; countries above this are at risk of being put onto the quarantine list.</p>\n\n\n\n<a

forces and increase surveillance to prevent contagions.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Canary Islands are battling to get British holidaymakers back and to persuade the UK government to <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/politics/12461240/islands-canary-ibiza-mallorca-quarantine-list-regional/\">lift its 14-day quarantine ban</a> when they return from Spain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But efforts are being hampered by new outbreaks of coronavirus. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the latest is on the quiet island of El Hierro where 30 people have been isolated whilst awaiting test results following their contact with two positives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the space of 24 hours from Sunday to Monday, the Canaries registered 136 new cases and there has been one new death in the last week, bringing the total to 168 since the pandemic began in Spain.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_12492567\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img

positive cases within one day, Gran Canaria accounted for 89, followed by Tenerife (29),  Lanzarote (15), Fuerteventura (one) and El Hierro (four).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is also a severe setback for the tourist interests of the archipelago as 50 was the window set as the &#8220;safe point&#8221; by several countries wanting to send tourists to the islands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thousands of coronavirus tests are being carried out throughout the Canaries which will have contributed to the increased figures and nearly 160 trackers are working to find contacts with all new positive cases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But island leaders are expressing concerns that not everyone is sticking to the rules and wants to clampdown on people <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/travel/12421177/tenerife-lanzarote-gran-canaria-beach-face-masks/\">who don&#8217;t wear masks</a>, flout social distancing and insist on attending illegal parties. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Canaries have also adopted new rules with effect from August 14 which are being applied across Spain. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/travel/12401882/tenerife-lanzarote-smoking-ban-face-masks-clubs-canary-islands/\">These include</a> the closure of all nightclubs and 1am curfews for pubs and

new ITV drama called Viewpoint that tracks voyeurs and undercover police in Manchester.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The gripping five-part drama follows a tense surveillance investigation into a tight knit community and explores whether it is ever possible to observe the lives of others with true objectivity and zero effect.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_12492805\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"

drama[/caption]\n\n\n\n<p>The all-star cast features recognisable faces including Bulletproof’s Noel Clarke, No Offence’s Alexandra Roach and Corrie’s very own Catherine Tyldesley.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The show is based on an idea by Fleabag and Emmy award-winning director, Harry Bradbeer [Killing Eve, No Offence] and co-created and written by Edgar award-winner Ed Whitmore [Safe House, Manhunt].</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clarke plays surveillance detective, DC Martin King, who sets up his observation post in the home of single mum and secret voyeur, Zoe Sterling, played by Roach.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From Zoe’s window there is a panoramic view of Westbury Square, and more importantly provides a direct sightline into the home of missing primary school teacher, Gemma Hillman.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_12492848\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img

Drama, Tiger Aspect Productions and Executive Producer, Lucy Bedford said: “Harry and Ed have crafted a compelling, tense, claustrophobic thriller that turns the spotlight on the observer rather than the observed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;With the incredible Noel Clarke and Alexandra Roach leading the cast, we are extremely excited to be back in production.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Filming has begun in Manchester and is the first ITV drama to begin filming since all UK production went into lockdown due to Coronavirus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Catherine, who played Cobbles barmaid Eva Price, has been making best use of her time away from screen amid the coronavirus pandemic with some home renovation.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_12492842\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img

Cheryl Fergison &#8211; eight years after Heather Trott&#8217;s death[/caption]\n\n\n\n<p>Last night Linda was joined by her on-screen sister Tina, who is played by Luisa Bradshaw-White, on Stacey Dooley&#8217;s EastEnders: Secrets From The Square.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the 30 minute programme, the pair reminisced over their time on the soap with various clips of scenes with a number of different actors they&#8217;ve worked with. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Linda got emotional when the trio rewatched a clip of Shirley and &#8216;Hev&#8217; dancing around in the Laundrette with Pat Butcher&#8217;s underwear on. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the camera panned back on her in the studio, Linda said: &#8220;Broke my heart when they got rid of Cheryl.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_12491589\"

[/caption]\n\n\n\n<p>As they all giggled away about the scene, the soap star reassured fans that they still are very much friends despite not working with each other any more. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>She added: &#8220;We still see each other, we go on holiday with each other, every day was a lovely day at work with her.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Linda&#8217;s best pal, Heather, died in March 2012 when she was accidentally killed by Ben Mitchell.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ben hit her on the head with a picture frame, causing her to call back and hit her head on her kitchen counter.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure

forgiven him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The George Michael fan left behind her son George, who was named after her favourite singer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shirley was given the role as one of his godparents and looked

playing the hardfaced, tough nut Walford resident &#8211; and fans couldn&#8217;t believe how different she is in real life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stacey asked: &#8220;What have you been doing in lockdown?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Linda replied: &#8220;I&#8217;ve just been at home, I live with my husband and my dog Johnny.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_12491766\" class=\"wp-caption

to see her family, Linda and the rest of the cast were told not to go into work to try and help stop the spread of the deadly bug. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in March, producers of the soap cancelled filming due to the coronavirus pandemic and cut down to two episodes a week. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Filming&#160;started back up again on June 29, more than three months after lockdown forced a pause in production.</p>\n\n\n\n\t<!--googleoff: all-->\n\t\t<div class=\"sun-grid-container sun-grid-container--white\">\n\t\n\t<div class=\"sun-row \">\n\t\t<div class=\"col sun-col-6\">\n\n\t\t\t<div

Later Maguire and his group are said to have gone to a party at a swanky private villa hired out by a Greek businessman.</p> \n<p>Cops were eventually called to break it up at 4.15am.</p> \n<p>A partygoer claimed: “Harry was there, but he managed to get out when the police came. Harry was enjoying himself with his friends. He wasn’t misbehaving.’’</p> \n<p>In the early hours of Friday morning, Maguire and two pals were accused of brawling with another group and cops outside a nightclub.</p> \n<p>Police said they continued scrapping at the station before allegedly offering officers bribes to drop the case.</p> \n<p>A spokesperson for the Greek police said: “Patrolling police officers in the area of Mykonos intervened to settle a dispute between a group.</p> \n<p>“However, three foreigners involved in the incident turned against them, insulting and hitting a police officer with fists.</p>

consumes the flammable material around it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While that is largely the case here as well, there have been many reports of some of the newest wildfires breaking out because of recent lightning strikes from the tropical storm.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<!-- Start of Brightcove Player -->\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"display: block; position: relative; min-width: 0px; max-width:

increase.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In England and Wales there were 9,392 deaths from all causes in the week ending August 14.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This equates to more than 447 deaths compared to the previous week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This took the number of deaths that week to 3.4 per cent above the average for this time of year over the past five years &#8211; the first time the average has been exceeded since June 12</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Data from the ONS revealed that deaths from Covid-19 are continuing to fall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were 139 deaths registered in the week ending August 14 that mentioned &#8220;novel coronavirus&#8221;, an 8.6 per cent fall from the 152 deaths in the previous week.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_12492463\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img

decreased[/caption]\n\n\n\n<p>This is the lowest count since before the nation went into lockdown in March.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ONS stated that in week 33, 12.1 per cent of all deaths mentioned &#8220;influenza and pneumonua&#8221;, Covid-19 or both, compared to just 13 per cent in week 13.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It said it had included influenza and pneumonia for comparison &#8220;as a well-understood cause of death involving respiratory infection that is likely to have somewhat similar risk factors to Covid-19.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In week 32 influenza and pneumonia were mentioned 1,013 times on death certificates and in week 33 this figure was 1,002.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking at Covid-19 and this was mentioned 152 times in week 32 and 139 times in week 33.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the last several weeks, deaths from flu and influenza have been between 900 and 1,000 a week, but dropped to 879 in week 29.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Data from the ONS revealed that over the last eight weeks, influenza and pneumonia have been mentioned on the death certificate 7,639 times, while Covid has been mentioned 2,500.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It comes just days after the ONS also revealed that the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12462917/coronavirus-eighth-biggest-killer-england-four-times-died-dementia/\">coronavirus had dropped to the eighth biggest killer</a> in the UK.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conditions such as dementia and heart disease have now overtaken the virus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In July there were 38,179 deaths registered in England, with the coronavirus accounting for just 2.6 per cent of all deaths.</p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph-24-AUG-1.jpg\"><img

Wales.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Commenting on its most recent report published today the ONS said the rise in deaths in week 32 and 33 coincided with soaring temperatures across the country.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Heatwave warnings were issued by NHS England and experts warned the vulnerable and those who have recovered from coronavirus to stay inside.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ONS added: &#8220;The increased number of deaths, and the rise above the five-year average, were likely due to the heatwave; the coronavirus did not drive the increase, as deaths involving Covid-19 continued to decrease in week 33.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n\t<!--googleoff: all-->\n\t\t<div class=\"sun-grid-container sun-grid-container--white\">\n\t\n\t<div class=\"sun-row \">\n\t\t<div class=\"col

catch Todd but instead found a woman who claimed she had simply found his phone and was trying to make a quick buck.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It spurred the trio into trying to find Todd with Billy approaching police officer Craig Tinker to see if he could find anything out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last night Craig broke the news to Todd&#8217;s ex Billy that he had already spoken to officers about the assault charge and was free and clear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That means Todd has been staying away from the cobbles for other reasons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Actor Gareth Pierce will take over the role three years after disgraced star Bruno Langley was sacked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>New soap star Gareth said: &#8220;I’m thrilled to be joining such an iconic show, and to have been entrusted with taking Todd forward into some really exciting storylines. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_12358644\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img

team in such unprecedented times.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Todd was written out of the ITV soap after Bruno, 37, was convicted of sexually assaulting two women in a bar in Manchester in 2017.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Viewers were told Todd had assaulted a police officer and &#8220;gone on the run&#8221; and he has been sparingly mentioned over the last three years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In recent months, the soap has&#160;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/11255950/coronation-street-todd-grimshaw-return/\">dropped a couple of hints that Todd could be on his way back to

just a 60-second telephone call from Koeman with radio silence from club president Josep Maria Bartomeu on the matter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suarez has reportedly vowed not to make life difficult for Barcelona if he is to leave.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet he has already voiced his anger <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/12471049/furious-luis-suarez-barcelona-board-transfer-ajax/\"

It remains to be seen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I also want the best for the club and my idea today is to continue, but if the club decides that I am expendable, I have no problem talking to those who decide.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>NOT SO FOND FAREWELL</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Blaugrana are expected to green light his exit on a free transfer, with the player now 33 and suffering from an increasingly troublesome injury record.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Spanish radio station <a

Suarez&#8217;s preference to be released from his contract.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That would mean paying off the final year of his deal, thought to be worth a considerable £405,000-a-week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suarez has been a consistent goalscoring force since signing from Liverpool in 2014, netting almost 200 times for Barcelona.</p>\n\n\n\n\t<!--googleoff: all-->\n\t\t<div

minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sharing amazing before-and-after images, she added: &#8220;It worked so well! I rinsed the stain with water and squeezed the extra out as much as I could so the colour didn&#8217;t run.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What&#8217;s more, the mum claims the essential oil &#8211; which is a natural disinfectant &#8211; removed &#8220;90 per cent&#8221; of the stain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To finish off, she poured bleach over the area, popped it in the washing machine and says the white hoodie looks as good as new.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_12491254\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 539px\"><img src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000603984267.jpg?strip=all&#38;w=529\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-12491254\" width=\"529\" height=\"559\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>Holland&#38;Barrett</figcredit></figure>You can pick up eucalyptus oil for just £6.75 in Holland &#38; Barrett[/caption]\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Miaroma Eucalyptus Essential Oil, £6.75 for 20ml from Holland &#38; Barrett &#8211; <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=34784X928880&#38;xs=1&#38;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hollandandbarrett.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2Fmiaroma-eucalyptus-essential-oil-60043894%3Fskuid%3D043894%26utm_campaign%3Dshopping%26utm_medium%3Dcpc%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26%26gclid%3DCj0KCQjw7ZL6BRCmARIsAH6XFDKwboEOWvyhbrMRtuKBvBp5a5XL-22tt--gRUaR8FusPDbpOXifBZgaAip-EALw_wcB%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">buy now</a></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Needless to say, other members of the group were amazed by how well it worked &#8211; and her post racked up over 1,600 &#8220;likes&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t have thought you could get that stain out,&#8221; one wrote. &#8220;Great work!&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another added: &#8220;Oh my gosh!

to replicate his 2018 World Cup form in the following season in North London.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But he enjoyed an impressive resurgence at LaLiga giants Atletico Madrid following his £20million move last summer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/team/1196670/aston-villa/\">Aston Villa</a> are now keen to bring Trippier back to the Premier League after avoiding relegation by the skin of their teeth in 2019-20, according to <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2020/08/23/aston-villa-keen-sign-kieran-trippier-atletico-madrid-bolster/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Telegraph</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Boss Dean Smith has made signing a new right-back a priority this summer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frederic Guilbert, Ezri Konsa and Ahmed Elmohamady all played in that position last season, but Smith wants a genuine star right-back to slot into his squad for 2020-21.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div

back to the Premier League could be just the ticket for the defender, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trippier is still very much in Gareth Southgate&#8217;s England plans &#8211; with his latest squad set to be named on Tuesday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But with Trent Alexander-Arnold, Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Kyle Walker and Reece James all competing for places, Trippier will have to prove he is still up to the

UK, experts have revealed.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Charities are now calling for more investment in order to speed up cancer detection and diagnosis after it was found that &#8220;less survivable cancers&#8221; make up half of all common cancer deaths in the UK.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DD-COMPOSITE-CANCER-TABLE.jpg\"><img src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DD-COMPOSITE-CANCER-TABLE.jpg?strip=all&#38;w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-12491316\" width=\"960\" height=\"640\" /></a>\n\n\n\n<p>Data from the the Less Survivable Cancers Taskforce (LSCT) found that lung cancer was the deadliest in the UK, followed by brain, head and neck tumours, pancreatic cancer, oesophageal cancer, stomach cancer and liver cancer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report found that just one third of patients diagnosed with one of these cancers will be diagnosed after an emergency admission to hospital.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This included when symptoms included coughing up blood or vomiting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>LSCT says this accounts for thousands of &#8220;catastrophic prognoses&#8221; for thousands of people each year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But how can you spot if you have signs of one of the six deadliest cancers and what are the symptoms you should never ignore?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1. Lung cancer</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The report states that lung cancer is the most common cancer in the world and in the UK 35,300 people die from the illness every year, while 47,800 people are diagnosed per year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer, but it is not the only cause and 28 per cent of cases are not caused by smoking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It does however mean that smokers and ex-smokers have an increased risk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lung cancer develops when the growth of abnormal cells starts in one or both lungs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Healthy cells are needed to develop into healthy lung tissue and the abnormal cells are not able to carry out this function.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What to look out for?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The key symptoms of lung cancer include a cough that does not go away or gets worse, coughing up blood, weight loss and loss of appetite and feeling tired or weak.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may also experience a chest pain which is worse when you breath deeply, hoarseness and shortness of breath.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_12491877\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000536085394.jpg?strip=all&#38;w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-12491877\" width=\"960\" height=\"641\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>Getty - Contributor</figcredit></figure>Symptoms of lung cancer include a chest pain which is worse when you take deep breaths[/caption]\n\n\n\n<h2>2. Brain, head and neck tumours</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Brain, head and neck tumours account for 5,300 deaths a year in the UK.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is the ninth most common cancer in the UK and 60 per cent of those diagnoses with a high-grade tumour will die within a year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just 12 per cent will survive for five years or more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tumours are a growth of cells that multiple in an uncontrollable way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What to look out for?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Key symptoms include headaches, mental or behavioural changes, vision and speech issues and nausea and vomiting.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_12491887\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000600644720-1.jpg?strip=all&#38;w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-12491887\" width=\"960\" height=\"640\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>Getty Images - Getty</figcredit></figure>Consistent headaches are a key symptom of brain tumours [/caption]\n\n\n\n<h2>3. Pancreatic cancer</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the UK 60 per cent of people with pancreatic cancer are not diagnosed until the cancer is at an advanced stage &#8211; so it&#8217;s important to know the signs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Less than seven per cent of people with this cancer will survive beyond five years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pancreatic cancer is found in the pancreas &#8211; which is the organ in the top part of your stomach which helps you digest food.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What to look out for?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are experiencing pain in the stomach or back and unexpected weight loss then you may have pancreatic cancer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other symptoms include jaundice which is when the skin and the whites of the eyes turn yellow.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_12491899\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000458730425.jpg?strip=all&#38;w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-12491899\" width=\"960\" height=\"669\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>Getty - Contributor</figcredit></figure>Losing weight without trying is a key symptom of  pancreatic cancer [/caption]\n\n\n\n<h2>4. Oesophageal cancer</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Oesophageal cancer impacts the gullet &#8211; which is the long tube that carries food from the throat to the stomach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each year in the UK there are around 9,100 cases of this cancer and just 15 per cent of patients survive the cancer for five years or more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What to look out for?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have oesophageal cancer you may experience symptoms such as persistent indigestion or heartburn and you may find it difficult to swallow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other symptoms include a loss of appetite and weight loss, vomiting, pain in the stomach, chest or back, persistent cough, tiredness, shortness of breath and hoarseness.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5. Stomach cancer</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Around 40 per cent of people who develop stomach cancer will survive for one year or more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This cancer is more common in men than women and 50 per cent of cases occur in people over the age of 75.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stomach cancer occurs when malignant cells form in the lining of the stomach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Age and diet are both factors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What to look out for?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suffering from symptoms such as indigestion, feeling full faster, feeling bloated and feeling sick may mean you have stomach cancer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other symptoms include difficulty swallowing and stomach pain.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_12491922\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000454095174-2.jpg?strip=all&#38;w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-12491922\" width=\"960\" height=\"641\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>Getty - Contributor</figcredit></figure>If you have stomach cancer then you may experience stomach pains [/caption]\n\n\n\n<h2>6. Liver cancer</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Liver cancer begins in the cells of your liver &#8211; which is the football sized organ that sits in the upper right portion of your abdomen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is the sixth most common cancer and accounts for seven per cent of all cancer deaths.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Deaths from this cancer have soared by 50 per cent in the last ten years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What to look out for?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have liver cancer then you may have symptoms such as swelling in your abdomen, jaundice and itchy skin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other symptoms include unintentional weight loss and loss of appetite, feeling full after eating or feeling and being sick.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_12491943\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000561934256.jpg?strip=all&#38;w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-12491943\" width=\"960\" height=\"643\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>Getty Images - Getty</figcredit></figure>A loss of appetite is a symptom of liver cancer[/caption]\n\n\n\n<h2>The signs you should never ignore</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While each individual cancer has specific symptoms to look out for, some symptoms are common across all six deadly cancers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are three symptoms that were found across four of the six most deadliest cancers and these are the ones that you should take extra caution around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have any of these symptoms then you should visit your GP.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1. Weight loss and loss of appetite</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have recently experienced unintentional weight loss &#8211; this means when you have lost weight without trying a diet or weight loss plan, then you may have one of the deadly cancers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as this a loss of appetite was also common across various cancers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A loss of appetite is when you don&#8217;t feel hungry even if you haven&#8217;t been eating at regular intervals.</p>\n\n\n\n\t<!--googleoff: all-->\n\t\t<div class=\"sun-grid-container sun-grid-container--white\">\n\t\n\t<div class=\"sun-row

Poultry in Attleborough, Norfolk is the latest at a factory[/caption]\n\n\n\n<p>Production is continuing at the plant, which processes around 650,000 chickens a week at its 12-acre site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All seven staff struck down with Covid are self-isolating for 14 days. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The five workers waiting for their results are also isolating as testing of more the workforce of around 600 is carried out as “a precautionary measure”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Louise Smith, director of public health for Norfolk, said health officials were “monitoring the situation and taking action” to prevent further transmission.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>FACTORY OUTBREAK</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: “We are working with colleagues at Public Health England, the NHS and Breckland Council following an outbreak of&#160;coronavirus&#160;at Banham Poultry in Attleborough.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The management team at Banham Poultry has acted quickly to help prevent the spread of the virus and is working closely with us to trace the contacts of those who have tested positive.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s the latest food processing plant to report an outbreak, sparking fears over the spread of COVID-19 in chilled factories.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An outbreak at a chicken factory in Scotland hit more than 150 people with a further 42 positive tests.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>VIRUS SURGE</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The number of positive <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/coronavirus/\">Covid-19</a> cases linked to the 2 Sisters food processing plant in Coupar Angus, Perthshire reached 152 &#8211; with 134 employees and 18 of their contacts affected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result of the plant&#8217;s shutdown, 110,000 chickens will be slaughtered, it&#8217;s reported.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, four workers at a medical factory that make products vital in the fight against Covid-19, have tested positive for coronavirus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Becton Dickinson BD (UK) confirmed the four employees had positive tests out of a workforce of 750.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The firm, based at Roborough, near Plymouth, Devon, said half of the workers who had close contact with the affected workers had tested negative with more results pending.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Banham Poultry managing director Blaine van Rensburg said: “The safety of our staff, customers, and the wider public is really important to us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> &#8220;We are working with public health authorities to make sure we are doing absolutely everything we can and following all of the correct procedures.</p>\n\n\n\n\t<!--googleoff: all-->\n\t\t<div

been compounded after being <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/12488053/antonio-conte-recover-27m-scammer/\">scammed out of £27million</a> &#8211; hinted at

for me to be the coach of <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/team/1302935/inter-milan/\">Inter</a>, I thank the owners who allowed me to go through this great experience.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;If some situations end up affecting my family, that is no longer enough for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Everything has its limits, I have to see where my limits

businesses","link":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12491298/business-owners-relatives-quarter-bosses-recruitment/","description":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>ALMOST a quarter of business owners have employed relatives in recent months – sparking a revival of traditional family businesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The study of 500 small business owners found that of the 23 per cent who took on a family member, 46 per cent hired their partner, while 55 per cent recruited a sibling.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_12491630\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img

height=\"552\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>Getty Images - Getty</figcredit></figure>A study found that of the 23 per cent of businesses who took on a family member, 46 per cent hired their partner, while 55 per cent recruited a sibling[/caption]\n\n\n\n<p>And one in 10 even asked for help from their in-laws.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Almost half (46 per cent) employed relatives during lockdown because they needed extra help, while 34 per cent felt their loved ones had the skills they were looking for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other reasons included the family member wanting to gain work experience or because they were struggling to find work after finishing education during the pandemic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The research, commissioned by Funding Circle, found the family employment typically lasted seven weeks, but 68 per cent still have their relative working for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And while 21 per cent are considering taking them on full time following this experience, 45 per cent would look at hiring more relatives in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also emerged that as a result of this, more than a fifth would like to see more traditional family businesses making a comeback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lisa Jacobs, Funding Circle&#8217;s UK managing director, said: &#8220;Family sits at the heart of many successful small businesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;One of the silver linings of this crisis might be a revival of the traditional family business, with relatives spending more time together as business colleagues and partners as well as at home.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>HARD WORKERS</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The research also found more than a third of small business owners admitted their relative worked harder than they expected them to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More than a quarter said their relative’s working attitude was respectful and 22 per cent said they seemed enthusiastic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, 32 per cent of owners said working with their relation was fun and 30 per cent felt it was motivating, yet 12 per cent described it as difficult at times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And although 31 per cent of those polled said taking on their loved one was positive for their family relationship, three in 10 struggled to be ‘boss’ to them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it came to family perks, 41 per cent of bosses admitted they gave their family member flexible hours, 24 per cent offered longer breaks and 30 per cent even gave them a free lunch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The findings come after a separate study of 1,500 relatives of small business owners found that of the 23 per cent who were taken on by their family, a third found it motivating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Popular family businesses were found to fall into the sectors of retail, business, consulting and management, and creative arts and design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for 62 per cent of ‘employees’ the new role with their relative was something completely different to their usual job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a fifth, their new ‘boss’ was their dad, while a tenth had their mum to answer to and 14 per cent were ‘hired’ by their uncle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More than a third even said the experience has made them want to be more involved with the family business and 31 per cent feel encouraged to start their own company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But 44 per cent admitted they now realise how much work goes into running a business, according to the OnePoll figures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More than a quarter found themselves helping out a relative because they were on furlough, while 28 per cent had always had an interest in it and now had the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Positives of working for a family member included being able to act completely themselves (35 per cent), spending more time with family (40 per cent) and feeling less pressure (30 per cent).</p>\n\n\n\n\t<!--googleoff: all-->\n\t\t<div class=\"sun-grid-container sun-grid-container--white\">\n\t\n\t<div class=\"sun-row \">\n\t\t<div

down to £36m.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_12492531\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img

both in Valencia to wrap up the move.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 29-year-old has caught the eye in <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/la-liga/\">LaLiga</a> and has fired in 59 goals for the Spanish side during his six years there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He was linked with a switch to Barcelona earlier this year before the Nou Camp outfit opted <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/11271390/barcelona-looking-to-sell-martin-braithwaite/\">to move for Martin Braithwaite</a> instead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now Rodrigo could be lining up for Leeds in the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/premierleague/\">Premier League</a> instead despite the Gunners also being keen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcelo Bielsa is desperate to bolster his attack ahead of their return to the top-flight following a 16-year absence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it appears that the Brazil-born Spain international is the man he wants to lead his forward line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as playing in a traditional No9 role, Rodrigo is equally at home playing on the wing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Valencia have been forced to put their entire squad up for sale due to the financial difficulties caused by the coronavirus pandemic.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"

Brits can sing along to Rule Britannia! and Land of Hope and Glory, a Cabinet minister said today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Business secretary Alok Sharma told Times Radio that he thought the BBC could put subtitles on the screen for Last Night of the Proms so people could sing along at home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/26a0.png\" alt=\"⚠\"

height=\"639\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Beeb is facing calls to pub the subtitles on for the famous bash next month</figcaption><figcredit></figcredit></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It comes after the Beeb faced fury for axing the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12489411/bbc-ban-words-land-of-hope-and-glory-proms/\">singing at the bash, which will take place next month.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beeb bosses instead announced they would feature — but only as orchestral versions amid fears of a backlash from <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/black-lives-matter/\">Black Lives Matter</a> campaigners due to lyrical connotations about the British Empire.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The annual Royal Albert Hall concert, beamed around the world, traditionally ends with the&#160;<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/uknews/12476359/rule-britannia-land-hope-glory-black-lives-matter-bbc-proms/\">flag-waving anthems</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But organisers were said to be concerned about their links to the British Empire, and lyrics including: “Britons never will be slaves.”&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One BBC source described the handling of the line-up as “white guys in a panic,” trying to appease the movement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Government had expressed its displeasure with the move.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Culture Sec Oliver Dowden told the BBC that “confident, forward-looking nations don’t erase their history”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Boris Johnson said that while he understands the emotions involved, “we need to tackle the substance of problems, not the symbols”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this morning Mr Sharma said, &#8220;I think the Last Night of the Proms brings a huge amount of pleasure to millions of people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I personally think it&#8217;s a very joyful occasion, I think it will be quite strange without a live audience there. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve heard the BBC&#8217;s position that they will maintain the traditions. Personally I would like to see the lyrics sung and of course it is always possible to put lyrics up as subtitles on the screen so if people want to they can join in at home.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It came as leader Sir Keir Starmer has weighed into the BBC Proms row defending the “pomp and pageantry” as “a staple of British summer.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Asked if he backed the move to censor the words to Rule Britannia, a Labour spokesman said “enjoying patriotic songs does not &#8211; and should not &#8211; present a barrier to examining our past and learning lessons from it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But they stopped short if demanding a uturn, insisting the running order was a matter for the organisers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The spokesperson said: &#8220;The running order is a matter for organisers &#38; the BBC, but enjoying patriotic songs does not&#8230; present a barrier to examining our past.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Labour&#8217;s Lord Adonis said today: “It’s part of being English, I don’t understand what the problem is. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It seems almost laughable to think we are going to start censoring some of these great national songs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;What are they going to next, the national anthem? It’s ridiculous this whole thing.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Labour’s catastrophic election defeat last year was partly down to the party’s ‘patriotism problem’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Party insiders said furious voters repeatedly raised the issue on the doorstep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sir Keir Starmer had promised to change all that and called for the party to finally embrace patriotism.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking in April this year, he said:&#160;“I’m really proud of my country and I wouldn’t be leader of the Labour party if I wasn’t patriotic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#160;“What I desperately want for our country is for our country to get better. In the Labour party we should be proud of being patriotic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We’re all working, knocking on doors in the rain or shine, to try to put in place a team that can go into government to improve the country we live in because we love the country we live in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I don’t think we should shy away from that. That is a really good thing to be proud of, and to want your country to be the best it possibly can be.”</p>\n\n\n\n\t<div class=\"article-boxout\">\n\t\t<div class=\"article-boxout__header

indefinitely[/caption] \n<p>It comes just over a week after Apple removed Fortnite from its App Store for breaking the rules.</p> \n<p>Apple takes a 30% cut of money earned by apps through the App Store – and Epic Games tried to dodge this fee.</p> \n<p>Both firms are now embroiled in a legal dispute over the ban.</p> \n<p>US District Court Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said Apple was fine to ban Fortnite.</p> \n<figure id=\"attachment_12492103\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\">\n <img

<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption>\n <figcredit>\n  Alamy\n </figcredit>\n</figure>Apple and Google cited a direct payment feature rolled out on the Fortnite app as the violation[/caption] \n<p>But the judge ruled that Apple couldn’t block Epic Games’ developer accounts.</p> \n<p>The judge also said Apple couldn’t prevent developers from using Epic Games’ very popular Unreal Engine – a tool used to make video games.</p> \n<p>“The record shows potential significant damage to both the Unreal Engine platform itself, and to the gaming industry generally, including on both third-party developers and gamers,” the judge warned.</p> \n<p>“Apple has chosen to act severely, and by doing so, has impacted non-parties, and a third-party developer ecosystem.”</p> \n<p>Epic Games will now have to comply with the App Store rules, or live with Fortnite being permanently banned from the iPhone.</p> \n<p>As part of an ongoing PR war, Epic Games recently <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/12463977/fortnite-free-cup-anti-apple-prizes-how-to-compete-weekend/\">held a #FreeFortnite tournament</a> with “anti-Apple” prizes – including Samsung gadgets.</p> \n<p>Apple and rival tech giant Google have come under fire in recent years for operating alleged “monopolies” in which they stifle competition and take colossal&nbsp;cuts on sales made through their app stores.</p> \n<p>“Apple has become what it once railed against: The behemoth seeking to control markets, block competition, and stifle innovation,” Epic said in its lawsuit against Apple, filed in the Northern District of California.</p> \n<p>“Apple is bigger, more powerful, more entrenched, and more pernicious than the monopolists of yesteryear.”</p> \n<figure id=\"attachment_12492164\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\">\n <img src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-66.jpeg?strip=all&amp;w=960\" alt=\"\"

</figcredit>\n</figure>Fortnite is waging a PR war against Apple[/caption] \n<p>In a separate lawsuit against Google, Epic referenced the company’s now-infamous mantra, “Don’t Be Evil”.</p> \n<p>“Twenty-two years later, Google has relegated its motto to nearly an afterthought.”</p> \n<p>Epic also attacked Apple on social media, launching a campaign with the hashtag #FreeFortnite.</p> \n<p>The company urged players to seek refunds from Apple if they lost access to the game, and created a parody of Apple’s famous “1984” television ad.</p> \n<p>In the parody, which quickly garnered hundreds of thousands of views, a female Fortnite fighter hurls a unicorn-shaped club to smash a screen on which an Apple-headed character speaks of “the anniversary of the platform unification directives.”</p> \n<p>Apple takes a cut of between 15 and 30 per cent for most app subscriptions and payments made inside apps.</p> \n<p>There are some exceptions for companies that already have a credit card on file for iPhone customers if they also offer an in-app payment that would benefit Apple.</p> \n<p>Analysts believe games are the biggest contributor to spending inside the App Store, which is in turn the largest component of Apple’s $46billion-per-year (£35billion) services segment.</p> \n<p>In a statement, Apple said Fortnite was removed because Epic had launched the payment feature with the “express intent of violating the App Store guidelines” after having had apps in the store for a decade.</p> \n<p>“The fact that their (Epic) business interests now lead them to push for a special arrangement does not change the fact that these guidelines create a level playing field for all developers and make the store safe for all users,” Apple said.</p> \n<figure

Jackson declined to comment on the lawsuit when contacted by Reuters.</p> \n<p>“However, we welcome the opportunity to continue our discussions with Epic and bring Fortnite back to Google Play,” he said in a statement.</p> \n<p>The recent ban means it’s impossible to download Fortnite through the official Apple and Google stores.</p> \n<p>However, handsets with Fortnite still installed are&nbsp;<a

sold for thousands of pounds</a>&nbsp;online.</p> \n<p>Most of the listings fall somewhere between $2,000 and $7,000.</p> \n<p>That’s far above the typical price of a used iPhone, which could range from just a few hundred pounds to slightly north of $1,000, depending on the model.</p> \n<p>It seems few “Fortnite handsets” are actually selling at these vastly inflated prices.</p> \n<p>But The Sun has seen a “completed listing” – which means the product has sold and shipped – for $3,800 in the US.</p> \n<!-- Start of Brightcove Player --> \n<div style=\"display: block; position: relative;

Does society have anything to say other than call them a drain on society?</p> \n<p>“The fact is there is no safety net if you are a refugee or migrant. You are left destitute and without resources, and people are being silenced and shamed by far right rhetoric for being forced to ask for help.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://bit.ly/2QxJhCI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/07/SCOTTIS_IG_BANNER.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large\" /></a></p> \n<p>“Would this mother be alive if she was not forced out of her job by this cruel system that stops you from working and paying your way because a piece of paper says your leave to remain has expired? I’m sure Mercy’s son will want to ask this and other questions once he is old enough.</p> \n<p>“All our efforts since Lockdown began have been focussed on trying to help people just survive and retain hope. Home Office asylum policy has created unimaginable hardship for refugees and migrant households in this city. </p> \n<p>“People are literally depressed – and the system seems designed to break spirits. It is a matter of when – not if – the next tragedy occurs and this reinforces our resolve for a public inquiry and to get rid of any pretence that the Home Office wants to find out the pain it is causing with it’s evaluation which seven Glasgow MPs are now boycotting. </p> \n<p>“We demand a public inquiry and Mercy’s death to be investigated along side Adnan Walid Elbi, the Park Inn tragedy and the accommodation crisis created by Mears insensitive hotel moves. We call on the Church of Scotland and all of civic society to support our call for an independent public inquiry.”</p> \n<p> \n <!--googleoff: all--> \n <div class=\"sun-grid-container sun-grid-container--white\"> \n  <div class=\"sun-row \"> \n   <div class=\"col sun-col-6\"> \n    <div class=\"rail rail--classic  rail--trending theme-news\" data-slide-count=\"4\" data-slide-count-tablet=\"4\"> \n     <div class=\"swiper-container\"> \n      <div class=\"rail__header\"> \n       <h3 class=\"rail__title theme__after-color\">Most read in News</h3> \n      </div> \n      <div class=\"swiper-pagination theme__swiper-pagination\"></div> \n      <div class=\"swiper-wrapper\"> \n       <div class=\"rail__item swiper-slide\"> \n        <div class=\"rail__item-image\"> \n         <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/uncategorized/11755984/competition-musso-ssangyong-win-truck-pickup-car-2-2/\"> \n          <div class=\"delayed-image-load-landscape\" data-src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/white-f3_4FINAL-copy.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=300&amp;h=192&amp;crop=1\"></div> \n          <div class=\"delayed-image-load-mobile\" data-src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/white-f3_4FINAL-copy.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=300&amp;h=192&amp;crop=1\"></div> </a> \n        </div>\n        <!-- .rail__item-image --> \n        <div class=\"rail__item-content\"> \n         <h3 class=\"rail__item-headline theme__copy-color\"> FEELING TRUCKY? </h3> \n         <span class=\"rail__item-sub\"> Win a SsangYong Musso pick-up truck worth £26,394 - with a 7-year warranty! </span> \n        </div>\n        <!-- .rail__item-content --> \n        <div class=\"rail__item-gradient-light\"> \n        </div> \n        <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/uncategorized/11755984/competition-musso-ssangyong-win-truck-pickup-car-2-2/\" class=\"rail__item-anchor\"></a> \n       </div>\n       <!-- .rail__item .swiper-slide --> \n       <div class=\"rail__item swiper-slide\"> \n        <div class=\"rail__item-image\"> \n         <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/uncategorized/4062426/dear-deidre-sanders-agony-aunt-advice/\"> \n          <div class=\"delayed-image-load-landscape\" data-src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/nintchdbpict000333815765.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=300&amp;h=192&amp;crop=1\"></div> \n          <div class=\"delayed-image-load-mobile\" data-src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/nintchdbpict000333815765.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=300&amp;h=192&amp;crop=1\"></div> </a> \n        </div>\n        <!-- .rail__item-image --> \n        <div class=\"rail__item-content\"> \n         <h3 class=\"rail__item-headline theme__copy-color\"> FESTI-FAIL </h3> \n         <span class=\"rail__item-sub\"> I had hot sex at Glastonbury... but I was the 20th guy she'd bedded that weekend </span> \n        </div>\n        <!-- .rail__item-content --> \n        <div class=\"rail__item-gradient-light\"> \n        </div> \n        <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/uncategorized/4062426/dear-deidre-sanders-agony-aunt-advice/\" class=\"rail__item-anchor\"></a> \n       </div>\n       <!-- .rail__item .swiper-slide --> \n       <div class=\"rail__item swiper-slide\"> \n        <div class=\"rail__item-image\"> \n         <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/uncategorized/3938845/thought-britain-was-free-from-biting-spiders-these-are-the-poisonous-and-aggressive-species-to-watch-out-for/\"> \n          <div class=\"delayed-image-load-landscape\" data-src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/rr-composite-spider.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=300&amp;h=192&amp;crop=1\"></div> \n          <div class=\"delayed-image-load-mobile\" data-src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/rr-composite-spider.jpg?strip=all&amp;w=300&amp;h=192&amp;crop=1\"></div> </a> \n         <!-- Add video indicator if article has feature video. --> \n         <div class=\"rail__item-play theme__background-color-rgba-80\"> \n          <span></span> \n         </div> \n        </div>\n        <!-- .rail__item-image --> \n        <div class=\"rail__item-content\"> \n         <h3 class=\"rail__item-headline theme__copy-color\"> LEG IT </h3> \n         <span class=\"rail__item-sub\"> Thought Britain was free from biting spiders?

Sunday[/caption]</p>\n<p>The issues of racism in America and police brutality towards black people have been inflamed by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May.</p>\n<p>Police officer Derek Chauvin was filmed holding his knee on the neck of Mr Floyd – who died minutes later &#8211; who appeared distressed and repeatedly said he was struggling to breath.</p>\n<p>Since then, BLM protests have erupted nationwide and the shooting of Jacob Blake has further enraged the movement.</p>\n<p>The Kenosha incident happened on Sunday at about 5pm local time as officers were responding to a &#8220;domestic incident&#8221;.</p>\n<p>A video circulating on social media showed the man walking towards a car followed by two officers and one of them shooting him in front of his kids as he opens the car door.</p>\n<p>Witnesses said Blake was trying to break up an argument between women in a home nearby.</p>\n<p>The 29-year-old is recovering in hospital and is expected to survive.</p>\n<p>\t<!--googleoff: all-->\n\t\t<div class=\"sun-grid-container sun-grid-container--white\">\n\t\n\t<div class=\"sun-row \">\n\t\t<div class=\"col sun-col-6\">\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"rail

fans were stunned to see both of the Ballon d&#8217;Or rivals taking centre stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One said: &#8220;Now this game is officially the GOAT.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another added: &#8220;Looks like PES2021 couldn&#8217;t quite decide on a cover star &#8211; but they didn&#8217;t let that stop them.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Messi featured on the cover of the 2020 version of the game, but Ronaldo has not been picked since 2013.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Surprisingly, Ronaldo was on the cover alongside Michael Owen in 2008.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fans had hoped to see Messi and Ronaldo line-up alongside each other this season. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Barcelona ace was tipped to leave the Nou Camp after their disastrous 8-2 defeat to Bayern Munich.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the Spanish giants will demand clubs meet his £631million release clause if he hands in a transfer request. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/12489576/man-city-lionel-messi-afford/\">Manchester City are said to be

finally finally chose who to marry in the heart-wrenching end of the series.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The BBC drama, based on Vikram Seth&#8217;s 1993 novel of the same name, follows the story of Lata, a student coming of age in North India.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_12491755\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img

height=\"640\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"></figcaption><figcredit>BBC</figcredit></figure>Lata chose cutie pie Haresh to be her husband[/caption]\n\n\n\n<p>The six-part drama partly follows Lata Mehra, played by Tanya Maniktala, a spirited and intelligent university student who has to choose between three potential suitors.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Find herself a ‘suitable boy’.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s the &#8220;honourable&#8221; shoe manufacturer Haresh, played by Namit Das, aspiring writer Amit (and awful poet), played by Mikhail Sen, and Muslim hunk Kabir, played by Danesh Razvi.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Monday night’s finale saw Lata finally make her decision – Haresh – and viewers were divided about if she had made the right choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure

poetry[/caption]\n\n\n\n<p>“That wasn&#8217;t the one she was meant to be with!!!! SO disappointed!!!!,” exclaimed one viewer.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A second moaned: “Totally loved #ASuitableBoy. She chose a sweetie in the end, but my heart ached for Kabir <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f62d.png\" alt=\"😭\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However many were pleased with Lata’s love choice, with one writing: “What a delightful ending to A Suitable Boy: Lata made the right decision in choosing Harish – the sweetest, most honourable and solid man imaginable – &#8216;he&#8217;s so real&#8230; his feet touch the ground&#8217;.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In the end Lata was a shrewd business woman. Love was not as important to her as a secure and stable future,&#8221; another added. &#8220;She rarely uttered words of love and compassion. For Lata, love was just transactional.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_12491797\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 650px\"><img

It was due for publication in 2017. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an interview in 2018, Seth said that e was still working on the sequel as well as more material to accompany&#160;A Suitable Boy&#160;&#8211; to be collectively called&#160;A Bridge of Leaves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It seems that there is plenty of scope for a sequel to the BBC series after all.</p>\n\n\n<div></div>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 09:17:09 +0000","feedId":10019,"bgimg":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000603998842.jpg?strip=all&w=960","linkMd5":"bc016097a57f6d81d108839e660fdb9c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn82@2020_3/2020/08/25/11-06-26-726_617638891ec7a3ad.webp","destWidth":960,"destHeight":640,"sourceBytes":50692,"destBytes":50692,"author":"Eve Wagstaff","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000603998842.jpg?strip=all&w=960":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn82@2020_3/2020/08/25/11-06-26-726_617638891ec7a3ad.webp","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000603998839.jpg?strip=all&w=960":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn63@2020_2/2020/08/25/11-06-33-929_c346c2d98ccfa828.webp","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000598660347-3.jpg?strip=all&w=960":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn62@2020_4/2020/08/25/11-06-40-788_1d58bd5493afbd07.webp","https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f62d.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn29@2020_2/2020/08/25/11-06-37-550_3c0760d831523709.webp","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000601930763-1.jpg?strip=all&w=640":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn41@2020_3/2020/08/25/11-06-38-292_a16dc64b0806036c.webp","https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000596964814.jpg?strip=all&w=678":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn77@2020_6/2020/08/25/11-06-44-890_c50157a325171442.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598353584715},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 19:06:24","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 19:06:24","title":"How to make your CV stand out by giving it a makeover using free online tools","link":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/12485000/cv-stand-out-free-online-tools/","description":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>THE first impression you give an employer is from a CV so it&#8217;s important to make yours stand out from the crowd. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/12433497/retail-jobs-axed-start-lockdown-coronavirus/\">Thousands of jobs have been axed</a> following the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/coronavirus/\">coronavirus</a> pandemic making the market very competitive &#8211;

it could be the difference between you getting the job or continuing the hunt. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Use free tools to create an eye catching design</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You don&#8217;t have to be an designer to achieve a good-looking CV (unless you&#8217;re applying for a job as a designer) and there are a whole host of of free tools out there that will help you do this. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Websites like <a href=\"https://resume.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">Resume.io</a>, <a href=\"https://www.canva.com/en_gb/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">Canva</a> and <a href=\"https://cvdesignr.com/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">CVdesignr.com</a> have a range of different templates you can adapt to suit your own application. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Hiring managers will likely be sifting through CVs even faster than usual, so initial appearances mean everything,&#8221; said Menno Olsthoorn from Resume.io. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;How a&#160;CV&#160;appears is just as important as the information it provides. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Keep your&#160;CV&#160;concise with a mix of formats and the important information obvious &#8211; this visual balance will mean the reader focuses on what matters the most: your credentials.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve included two examples in this article of how a CV can look before and after you&#8217;ve given it a revamp using one of the online tools. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_12486166\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 970px\"><img src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ac-graph-money-revamp-your-CV-2.jpg?strip=all&#38;w=960\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-thesun-article-image wp-image-12486166\" width=\"960\" height=\"656\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">You don&#8217;t have to include a photo of yourself if you&#8217;re applying for a job</figcaption><figcredit></figcredit></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The first draft is bland, with a lot of white space, and could easily be overlooked in a pile of other applications. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second version of the same CV is more noticeable and adds a pop of colour. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laying out your work experience like a timeline is interesting to look out while the contact details are easy to pick out. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your eyes are also drawn to the skill set too, which will help future employers see immediately what you are capable of achieving. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In both examples, the job seeker has added a photo of themselves, as well as their age. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not necessary to include these sorts of personal details when applying for a job, nor do you have to specify your nationality, marital status or political or religious beliefs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Daniel Ball from creative recruitment firm <a href=\"https://wearewiser.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Wiser</a> said: &#8220;Ultimately, the purpose of a CV is to convey your skills and attributes &#8211; not your appearance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;A high quality employer won’t hire based on looks, so why include a photo?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Build an online portfolio </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>An online portfolio of work may give you the edge you need over others applying for the same job, even if you&#8217;ve only been asked to supply a cover letter and CV. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This will give you more opportunity to shout about your achievements and for potential employers to find out more about your skills. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These can be done for free too and one of the easiest ways is by signing up to LinkedIn &#8211; a social network for the jobs world. </p>\n\n\n\n\t<div class=\"article-boxout\">\n\t\t<div class=\"article-boxout__header theme__background-color\">\n\t\t\t<h3 class=\"article-boxout__headline\">Top 15 CV faux pas</h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"article-boxout__content theme__background-color-rgba-20\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"article__content--intro\">\n\t\t\t\t\tTHESE are the top 15 CV faux pas that you want to avoid when applying for a job:\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div>\n<ol>\n<li>Telling lies</li>\n<li>Spelling errors</li>\n<li>Including a selfie as a picture</li>\n<li>Having a rude or inappropriate email address</li>\n<li>Making spelling, punctuation or grammar mistakes</li>\n<li>Using clichés such as &#8216;always go the extra mile&#8217;</li>\n<li>No contact details</li>\n<li>Getting a company&#8217;s name wrong</li>\n<li>Suspiciously long gaps between jobs</li>\n<li>Going across more than two pages of A4</li>\n<li>CVs which aren&#8217;t CVs, such as a website or blog instead of a printed CV</li>\n<li>Layouts which are hard to understand/read</li>\n<li>Having hobbies which don&#8217;t constitute as hobbies such as &#8216;hanging out with friends&#8217;</li>\n<li>Using big fonts or strange layouts to make the CV look longer than it is</li>\n<li>Including part-time jobs which are no longer relevant</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\n\n\n\n<p>Here, you can add extra details about your work history and achievements, and you can upload videos too. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mr Olsthoorn added: &#8220;Regularly update [your profile] by showcasing the latest research as well as personal achievements – shouting about your success is a sure-fire way to grab someone’s attention, especially if it’s in refreshing ways like promo videos, collaborations and more.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some tools, like Resume.io will let you add hyperlinks on your CV that takes you to online content, such as LinkedIn. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the second example CV above, some of the white space has been replaced with screen grabs of samples of their work. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ll want to make it clear that they link out though or else the images will be too small to read. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What you should avoid </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Other things you&#8217;ll want to bear in mind when going the extra mile to make your CV look eye-catching is to keep the fonts professional. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Avoid using &#8220;fun&#8221; ones like comic sans because they&#8217;re hard to read and don&#8217;t give a serious impression.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If  you do opt to use a free template, make sure you mix it up a bit otherwise you risk making it look the same as everyone else&#8217;s again. </p>\n\n\n\n\t<div class=\"article-boxout\">\n\t\t<div class=\"article-boxout__header theme__background-color\">\n\t\t\t<h3 class=\"article-boxout__headline\">Tools to help you write your CV</h3>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"article-boxout__content theme__background-color-rgba-20\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"article__content--intro\">\n\t\t\t\t\tHERE are some tools and apps that can help you put together your CV:\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Resume app:</strong>&#160;If you struggle formatting your CV, you can choose from 21 templates in the Resume app to help you.

were pulled just hours before they were set to be released</a> &#8211; but here&#8217;s all you need to know.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_undefined\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 10px\"><img src=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/7faaa4e3-8822-4b39-bfdc-e819512ea657.jpg?w=670&strip=all\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large\" /><figcaption

started to receive their revised grades on Tuesday 25 August &#8211; after their results were delayed by a week and a half.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pearsons, the awarding body, decided to pull BTEC results just HOURS before results day so that they could be reassessed and brought in line with A-Levels and GCSEs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Students awaiting grades for university places have been prioritised in the remark.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All 450,000 BTEC pupils should get their results by the end of the week.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_undefined\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 10px\"><img

students are calling for the Education Secretary, Gavin Williamson&#8217;s resignation</figcaption><figcredit></figcredit></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why have results been delayed?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The grades were delayed after BTEC board Person pulled them HOURS before the release date. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It follows the Government&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/politics/12423084/gcse-a-level-grades-england-scrapped/\">U-turn that GCSE and A-level students would this year be able to receive grades based on teachers&#8217; estimates</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BTEC exam board Person said the decision to delay the grades followed perceived &#8220;unfairness&#8221;compared with results of those who took A-level and GCSE exams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a statement, a spokesperson for Pearson said: &#8220;BTEC qualification results have been been generally consistent with teacher and learner expectations, but we have become concerned about unfairness in relation to what are now significantly higher outcomes for GCSE and A-levels.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some 450,000 pupils were left in the lurch, including 250,000 who received their results last week. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furious headteachers said the BTEC board&#8217;s U-turn was &#8220;incomprehensible&#8221; at this time, while students said they felt &#8220;forgotten.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_undefined\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 10px\"><img

has been branded a &#8216;U-turn&#8217; on A-level results</figcaption><figcredit></figcredit></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>How have grades been decided?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Exam board Pearson confirmed all BTECs would be regraded to bring them in line with A-levels and GCSE results.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A spokeswoman for Pearson, the provider of BTECs, said: &#8220;Following Ofqual&#8217;s announcement that A-level and GCSE students are to receive centre-assessed grades, we will be applying the same principles for students receiving BTEC results this summer.</p>\n\n\n\n\t<!--googleoff: all-->\n\t\t<div

href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/5341352/ivana-trump-age-married-donald-children/\">Ivana</a>, who is from the Czech Republic.</p>\n<p>The fluent Czech speaker was very close to his maternal grandfather growing up.</p>\n<p>The 42-year-old was born in New York and gained a degree in economics from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania before going to work for his father&#8217;s businesses.</p>\n<p>He is the executive vice president of The Trump Organisation.</p>\n<p>He was introduced to <a

plus tips as a dock attendant at Trump castle.</p>\n<p>In 2001, having gained his degree, he returned to the family business and cut his teeth with the development of Trump Place at West Side Yards, New York.</p>\n<p>He now oversees new projects and development of the company&#8217;s real estate, hotels, golf courses and more &#8211; and has led projects in Chicago, Las Vegas, Scotland and India.</p>\n<p>And he&#8217;s appeared regularly on The Apprentice alongside his <a

Forbes.</p>\n<p>The major venture in which the President has included his family appears to be the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., where his three eldest kids—Donald Jr, Ivanka and Eric—each owns a 7.5% stake, worth about $6 million apiece.</p>\n<p>Most of his money appears to have come from hefty salaries he has earned as longtime executives at the Trump Organization.</p>\n<p>When father Trump was inaugurated, <a

href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/3999845/vanessa-trump-donald-jrs-wife-somethings-gotta-give/\">model Vanessa Haydon</a>, by his father at a fashion show in 2003.</p>\n<p>They met six weeks later via a mutual friend and married in 2005 at the President&#8217;s Florida resort.</p>\n<p>The pair have five children Donald Trump III, Tristan Milos, Spencer Frederick, Kai Madison and Chloe Sophia.</p>\n<p>Vanessa, 42, who once dated movie star Leonardo Di Caprio, is a former model who had her own handbag line La Poshett.</p>\n<h2>What did he say at the Republican National Convention?</h2>\n<p>In the speech at the RNC, Trump Jr came to his dad&#8217;s defence, and called candidate Joe Biden the <a
