Now, it tracks your bedtime schedule and sleep cycles using apps like Sleep As Android.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/1._Google_Fit_Home_Screen__Sleep.gif\" alt=\"Google Fit homescreen and sleep\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The primary focus of the new interface is to provide you with at-a-glance information</strong> for your heart rate, weight, and blood pressure trends over time as well as showing you if you&#8217;re meeting your daily and weekly Heart Point and step goals. Every major update this month across Fit, Maps, Search, and more has shown that Google has an incredible pinpoint focus on helping users prepare for the holidays and protect their health by building good habits using their services.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I may very well be the only one who thinks Google should bring Fit&#8217;s web interface back from the dead. It made sense to get rid of it since tracking occurs from a mobile device and more often than not, users will glance at this information on their phones and smartwatches, but as someone who loves planning my week from my Chromebook, I wish I could still see my exercise and sleep stats on a larger screen from the comfort of my home. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>I also wish that Google Fit would allow me full food and calorie tracking so that I could finally dump MyFitnessPal, but now I&#8217;m just dreaming, right?</strong> Perhaps the upcoming Fitbit acquisition will allow Google to make this a reality, but we shall see. A few other features with this update are a redesigned weather interface which provides a more bold look that&#8217;s easier on the eyes and a new Breathe Tile to help with guided breathing exercises. If you don&#8217;t see any of these features or the redesign yet, you can be sure to see them over the next few days. Unlike the normal &#8220;few weeks&#8221; estimate Google gives for their staged rollouts, this one ought to be quick.</p>\n\n\n\n<a class=\"isButton\" href=\"https://fave.co/3oymIzO\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/SamsungBlackFridayContent.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin-bottom: 30px;\"></a>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://patreon.com/chromeunboxed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/patreonInContentDesktop.jpg\" class=\"patreonDesktop\"></a>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"newsletterSignupBlock\">\n\tGet Alerted About New Posts On <br class=\"forMobileOnly\"><span class=\"highlighter\">Your Schedule</span><br>\n\t<a class=\"BuyButton\" href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/newsletter-sign-up/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sign Up For The Official Chrome Unboxed Newsletter</a>\n<div class=\"divider\"></div>\n<h6>Latest Posts</h6>\n<div class=\"wp-rss-template-container\" data-wpra-template=\"default\" data-template-ctx=\"eyJmZWVkcyI6Im5ld2VzdHBvc3RzIn0=\">\n    <div class=\"wp-rss-aggregator wpra-list-template  \" data-page=\"1\">\n    \n    \n<ul class=\"wpra-item-list rss-aggregator \"\n    start=\"1\">\n                        <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/the-best-chromebooks-of-2020-video/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">The Best Chromebooks of 2020 [VIDEO]</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n                    <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/google-pay-redesign-announcement\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">Google wants to improve your relationship with money – launching new Google Pay app tomorrow</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n                    <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/google-fit-home-page-redesigned/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">Google Fit redesign for Android and iOS brings you more in-depth information and sharing</a>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wprss-feed-meta\">\n    \n    \n    </div>\n\n            \n        </li>\n                    <li class=\"wpra-item feed-item gurss\">\n            \n            \n\n    <a  href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/need-a-chromecast-remote-you-can-now-purchase-a-spare/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"\">Need a Chromecast remote?
