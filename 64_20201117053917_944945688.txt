Created by the designers at Studio Kononenko, Maverick, a ceramic <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/bird-feeder/\">bird feeder</a>, doesn’t present a new solution for bird feeders but does present an approach for sustainable product manufacturing that solves a problem faced by many designers: the scrap material used during construction, like rings in clay kilns, that is discarded once the product is finished.</p>\n<p>In collaborating with Ceramika Design and creating furniture items for the brand, the thinkers at Studio Kononenko wanted to make use of ceramic rings used when firing clay in kilns. On the process, the designers share, “Considering that the reserves of this clay are limited, we thought about extending the life of these elements. We wanted to create a useful thing out of this. This is how a feeder for wild birds appeared.”</p>\n<p>The main element of the bird feeder is formed from ceramic &#8211; the frame and body of the bird feeder. Covering just about a quarter of the round frame is a plastic plate that functions to store plenty of food for the wild birds. Extending from the middle of the plastic plate is a wooden peg that works as a perch for birds to enjoy their seeds. Industrial, strong metal bolts and nuts hold it all together. The bird feeder itself comes with little frills, as the main purpose of this design rests not in aesthetic intricacy, but usability and sustainability. Another aspect of Maverick that enhances its eco-friendly design method is that the designers at Studio Kononenko made it so that each component of the bird feeder is replaceable on the off-chance that one is damaged either by hungry birds a little too eager for snacking or weak tree branches.</p>\n<p>Up north, birds rejoice at the sight of backyard bird feeders as food in the winter months can be hard to come by with frozen topsoil and frost-covered plants. It seems the design of Maverick encapsulates a method of sustainability that inspires a cycle of feedback. In collaborating with Ceramika Design, Studio Kononenko produces items for human’s ease of life, then, the waste acquired is used to produce a bird feeder, which benefits an animal’s ease of life, heightening the natural artfulness of landscape design where the bird feeder is situated, and so on. While the design behind Maverick might be simple, the ecological commitment to recyclability is both bold and clever.</p>\n<p>Designer: Studio Kononenko x <a href=\"https://ceramika-design.com/products/4/default/maverick\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ceramika Design</a></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-287678\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/11/287676/02_Maverick_StudioKononenkoIDCeramikaDesign_BirdFeeder.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /><br />\nThe feeder consists of four materials: ceramic, wood, metal, and plastic linings.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-287679\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/11/287676/03_Maverick_StudioKononenkoIDCeramikaDesign_BirdFeeder.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /><br />\nThrough an intuitive hanging method, Maverick can be suspended from any sturdy tree branch closeby where birds feed.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-287680\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/11/287676/04_Maverick_StudioKononenkoIDCeramikaDesign_BirdFeeder.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-287681\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/11/287676/05_Maverick_StudioKononenkoIDCeramikaDesign_BirdFeeder.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-287682\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/11/287676/06_Maverick_StudioKononenkoIDCeramikaDesign_BirdFeeder.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /><br />\n&#8220;While creating items for [the] brand, Ceramika Design, we paid attention to the rings used in the technological process.

have brought this tool to almost every fingertip. What often surprises me is the innovation behind this humble design that was first invented in 1876! The QWERTY layout we type away on is over a century old and remains a trusted format whereas what has changed are the things we can do other than just typing on our keyboard. Keyboards are now the portable go-between your trusted typing accessory to everything you need on your machine &#8211; it doubles as a USB hub or even has sliding compartments that are notepads or Num pads to be used as needed &#8211; whatever your problem, we have a keyboard design that solves it!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/03/255901/01_keyboarddesigns_koludekeyboard_yankodesign_3.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Say hello to the <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/03/02/an-external-keyboard-with-a-built-in-multi-port-hub-sounds-like-sheer-genius\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kolude KD-K1</a> by Jeremy Lin, a sleek external keyboard with a pretty interesting twist. With circular keys that sit within a machined aluminum base giving it a neo-retro vibe, the Kolude KD-K1 keyboard is a visual treat with tactile scissor-switch keys that make it a great keyboard to type on too. Built right into the back-face of the KD-K1 is a USB hub, complete with USB-A and USB-C ports, an HDMI port, and two card-reader slots. Designed to be the Swiss-Army-Knife of keyboards, the Kolude KD-K1 makes sure you’ll never have to bend over and reach behind a CPU to plug a pen-drive in again. Connect it to your laptop or desktop using the USB-C port and the KD-K1 comes alive with a myriad of possibilities. The multitude of ports allows you to maximize productivity by connecting drives, devices, displays, or cards to your main computer, right through the keyboard.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/09/sorry-post-it-we-are-moving-onto-digital-sticky-notes/01-ouverture_yankodesign.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/09/sorry-post-it-we-are-moving-onto-digital-sticky-notes/03-ouverture_yankodesign.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/09/sorry-post-it-we-are-moving-onto-digital-sticky-notes/06-ouverture_yankodesign.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>As a reflex, we always tend to frantically search for a notepad to jot down a number, address, meeting feedback, last-minute lists, or notes during a class. To integrate this existing behavior with the technology we already use, designer Jeong Woo Kim created <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/09/17/sorry-post-it-notes-we-are-moving-onto-digital-sticky-notes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ouverture</a> – a conceptual <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/keyboard\">keyboard</a> accessory that is a number pad + a digital notepad when you flip the cover. It has a typing mode which is the number pad and a memo mode which is the writing pad. “The leather cover acts as a number pad on a conventional keyboard. Current from the fingertips passes through the special conductive fiber to the touchpad inside the leather cover,” explains Kim.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2019/08/aura_personal_computing_layout.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2019/08/aura_personal_computing_08.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2019/08/aura_personal_computing_07.jpg\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\">We love seeing concepts that challenge our perception of the future of technology by forcing us to rethink how we will one day interact with devices. <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2019/08/16/who-needs-a-display-when-this-keyboard-projects-your-screen-on-your-retina/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Aura</a> by Vince Wang certainly achieves this, and it does so by transforming the humble laptop into an ultra-portable, productivity station! So, you may be asking yourself how it functions without a screen, well that’s all down to the rather clever Eye-tracking Infrared Illuminators that locate eye-details and reflection patterns to project the image directly onto the user’s retinas! The futuristic technology doesn’t end there; in addition to the lack of screen, there is also concave keyboard with Glow Thru keys that’s been paired with an adaptive input service for maximum productivity!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/04/auto-draft/photoshop_keyboard_3ddecors_1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/04/auto-draft/photoshop_keyboard_3ddecors_3.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>You can find all of Photoshop’s commonly used tools in the key-layout, along with quick-access keys for undoing and redoing, as well as for saving and opening files. There are even custom-mappable knobs for controlling features such as brush sizes, hardness, or even for zooming in/out. The <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/04/15/this-custom-keyboard-brings-photoshops-toolbar-to-life/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">keyboard</a> can be mapped as per your requirements, and for people who don’t want something this elongated (that’s not what she said), there’s even a smaller, square-shaped Numpad-esque keyboard with a few extra buttons that unlock more features… and while products like Loupedeck’s Creative Tool exist, it’s nice knowing that this particular variant, created by Etsy-maker 3dDecors, is close to 5 times cheaper. Forget the MacBook and its Touch Bar, just buy me this slim custom keyboard and I’ll be on my way.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/03/255901/07_keyboarddesigns_Adobe_yankodesign_2.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/03/255901/07_keyboarddesigns_Adobe_yankodesign_1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Vinicius Araújo has designed a gorgeous keyboard to aid in the transition between each Adobe program, saving the user hours of switching between Photoshop to Indesign to Illustrator to Lightroom.

At first glance, the device looks like a touch-screen product, which allows you to swipe between windows, including a calendar/to-do list, a virtual meeting room, or various keyboard interfaces. The screen has IR-Cameras built-in, which tracks users’ finger gestures across the surface. This finger-tracking ability is similar to the controls on a smartphone or tablet. Underneath the touch screen lies a bed of small press-able points that give you the haptic feedback of a keyboard without the limitations of a specific keyboard arrangement. Basically, any point on the tablet’s surface can function as a key.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/07/this-keyboards-magnetic-accessories-create-the-ultimate-modular-desk-setup/10-link_yankodesign.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/project_modules/fs/0b86e197729487.5efa6d53d8148.gif\" alt=\"link1\" width=\"1050\" /></p>\n<p>Having a visually harmonious, intuitive, and efficient set of tech accessories allows the user to keep all devices and peripherals charged and in sync at all times – its the same calm you experience when you start your day on a clean, organized desk! Link is a collection of essential computer accessories that are integrated to work together to optimize functionality for the user right from wireless charging devices to compact input devices. “The goal of this project was to design an ecosystem of peripherals that aims to deliver an experience that is customizable, easy to use, and adaptable to the computer users’ needs at a moment’s notice,” says the designer. So no more scampering around for a certain jack if you have to plug in a non-Apple device or having a network of cables that just take up more space + energy!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/03/255901/08_keyboarddesigns_Off-keyboard_yankodesign_2.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2017/09/off/off_03.jpg\" alt=\"off_03\" /></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2017/09/20/the-cleanest-keyboard-ever\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Off keyboard</a> by Marko Oljaca comes with soft, rounded keys that are elevated on independent “stems” rather than recessed into a solid surface. Not only easy to clean, but it also prevents the buildup of dirt and residue. Better yet, its seamless design makes it spill-proof and water-resistant. Its organic form is also ergonomically adapted to maximize wrist comfort.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/project_modules/1400_opt_1/e83a3387619703.5dcea60f71c03.gif\" width=\"1050\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2019/12/auto-draft/slide_keyboard_tablet-yankodesign09.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>South Korean product designer Cheolsu Park designed ‘<a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2019/12/10/this-modular-keyboard-design-slides-to-double-productivity/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Slide</a>’. Slide is a keyboard that doubles up as a tablet. A combination of a keyboard and tablet, Slide, as its name implies comes with a ‘sliding’ element. The tablet can be easily pulled out or pushed in, enabling it to hide sneakily below the keyboard. With two products being packed into one, space is efficiently saved, bringing the usual clutter of your desk to a minimum. When you’re only using the keyboard, the tablet snugly remains a part of it. Park added a lock button to the product, pressing it prevents the keyboard from sliding up and down, keeping it firmly in position. The edges of the product have been centered using a weighty material, ensuring that the product does not tilt in its extended form, especially when you’re typing on the keyboard.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/project_modules/max_1200/8a7c7d88581217.5ddaf36569aaa.gif\" width=\"1050\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2019/11/auto-draft/hidekey_keyboard-yankodesign14.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Most Bluetooth keyboards aren’t equipped with a number pad. On the other hand, they are extremely space-efficient. And there comes in Yeong Seok Go’s ‘<a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2019/11/25/this-sliding-keyboard-reveals-a-hidden-compartment/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hidekey</a>’. But Hidekey has a secret! Its number pad is in hiding. Tucked away on the backside of the keyboard, a quick sliding movement reveals the number pad. The pad can be easily pulled out whenever needed. Once it has been used, you can effortlessly slide it back in. This ensures you always have a number pad at your disposal, improving the efficiency of your work, without taking up too much space.</p>\n<p>Check out more products designed to amp up your

in the loop! The sight of the serene waters being unzipped like a winter jacket is pure ASMR, and that’s what creativity is all about. Exploring the different expressions of water – the infinite perspectives we can all have about things we see, feel, or project in our lifetime. With a hope that 2021 will bring in some semblance of normalcy, this pal is the Zip-Fastener Ship contrived by Japanese artist Yasuhiro Suzuki which resonates with the spirit of creation even when things are not going as planned!</p>\n<p>One fine day when the sun was beating down on the Tokyo Bay, Yasuhiro witnessed the sight of a boat opening up the sea like a zipper from an airplane. Perhaps a coincidence or sheer sign from the universe to churn up the idea of a ship that actually looks like a zipper was seeded in the artist’s mind who apparently has a knack for drawing inspiration from everyday objects. The cool-looking zipper ship is 9-meters long has a chrome-colored body, bridge, and a puller that gives it the distinct zipper-like form factor that anyone would mistake for a water surface unzipper when viewed from the skies above. It&#8217;s the utmost artistic nature of the design with its element of whimsy that makes the idea stand out from the crowd!</p>\n<p>Yasuhiro Suzuki’s design was a part of the DESIGNART Tokyo 2020 as it bemused onlookers diving the Sumida River between the bridges of Azumabashi and Sakurabashi from October 31 to November 8, daily -12 noon to 2 pm. Sumida River Sumi-Yume Art Project on their event page expressed, “If you look at the gently flowing Sumida River, you can see the swaying water that changes its shape due to the splash of waves that the ship has set up on the sparkling water surface that reflects the sky. As the ‘Fastener Ship’ sails, we will bring out and convey the various expressions of water that lurks around us.”</p>\n<p>Designer: <a href=\"http://www.mabataki.com/\" target=\"_blank\"

I always wonder how that would go &#8211; they would be able to express what they want to eat, how they are feeling, if they want to go out to play, and when they are feeling sick. As a cat owner myself, one of the biggest worries is that my cat can’t tell me when he’s feeling ill. Naturally, I would want to help as soon as he feels low but realistically we can’t be there monitoring them 24&#215;7. Enter LuluPet &#8211; a smart litter box that uses AI recognition to detect symptoms of the top 7 common cat illnesses! Designs like this bridge the language barrier between our cats and us (for obvious reasons)!</p>\n<p>LuluPet is the first smart cat litter box that uses excretory image recognition to track your cat’s health with 95% accuracy &#8211; yes, it means through their potty habits. More than 30% of the cats suffer from urinary tract diseases in their life and pet owners don’t catch it till it&#8217;s late. Cats inherently hide their pain so it makes it even more difficult to spot what is wrong especially with illnesses like kidney disease, heart disease, and urinary tract problems early on. With LuluPet you have more control over your cat’s health and you will be alerted of any irregularity in real-time whether it is a minor issue or a potentially major one. LuluPet uses AI image recognition to help identify urinary tract problems and a built-in camera, infrared sensor, and AI chips to analyze different types of feces. It distinguishes feces using the Bristol Stool Scale and combines with medical data from pet hospitals to identify symptoms of cat diseases which sets it apart from the traditional litter boxes that simply detect the weight of the feces.</p>\n<p>The double door design helps reduce fallen litter when cats finish their business and the front entry is ideal for kittens and senior cats who are unable to jump constantly. It has an easy to clean drawer and works with all kinds of poop be it scented, unscented, clumpy, or not clumpy. Lulupet also has enough room for your pet, the hexagonal shape creates the most internal space for your cat while keeping it manageable for every size household. A nice detail is that you can keep the litter box completely closed or semi-open depending on what you and your cat prefer (maybe you both love the blue litter box more?). LuluPet makes it easier for you to keep your pet’s health in top condition without feeling guilty or being constantly worried about them not being able to tell you what is wrong and nipping issues in the bud if any. It is also compatible with Google Home and Alexa so even if you forget to check the app, your virtual assistant will send you a reminder.</p>\n<p>The litter box is integrated with a smart app so you will get real-time alerts from the LuluPet and can act quickly when needed. This also saved pet owners from excessive vet visits and the constant worry is your cat is alright, but with LuluPet both you and your feline friend can sleep easy. Stool and urine analysis is the most straightforward way of detecting a wide range of feline diseases. LuluPet has an in-depth, cat pathology database with clinical data from more than 6,000 cats and automatically cross-references the details to ensure your cat’s health is in the normal range. Health data varies for different breeds depending on cat age, but our AI Autonomous Learning Mechanism gives a custom data model for each cat so they get a report uniquely tailored to their situation. AI accurately monitors cat weight, urine volume, stool volume, excretion duration, excretion frequency, excretion appearance, and color type &#8211; so you know what is truly happening on the inside even if they can’t express it.</p>\n<p>Designer: LuluPet</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/lulupet-cat-health-monitoring-made-simple/reft/24989507/yanko\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Click Here to Buy Now: $169</strong></a> <del datetime=\"2020-11-16T04:09:01+00:00\">$249</del> (32% off).

your guests a mild shock and your landlord a mini heart-attack! Designed to look like you&#8217;ve got a circular hole in your floor, this woolen rug is for people with a sense of decor, and a sense of humor. The two-tone rug comes in black, with a crescent-shaped grey zone, designed to complete the illusion of a black void in the thick floor when you look at it at the right angle. The illusion works best on grey floors, but I suppose any sort of floor would really do the trick. Just place the mat at a crucial passage-way and watch your friends and family do a double-take as they suddenly feel like they&#8217;re about to step into a massive hole, only to later realize it&#8217;s an optical illusion and not a portal into the underworld.

Christmas!","link":"https://www.yankodesign.com/?p=287691","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-287714\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/11/rado-revisits-its-iconic-true-square-collection-with-a-modern-yellow-watch-just-in-time-for-christmas/Rado_iconic_true-square-watch-design.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p>\n<p>Rado’s innovative True Square collection rocked the world of <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/watch/\">watches</a> by introducing the first square watch crafted using injected monobloc high-tech ceramic casing to fill out a square-shaped wristwatch, the first of its kind. Today, Rado has collaborated with British designer Tej Chauhan, and together, they’ve designed their own reinterpretation of the iconic True Square wristwatch.</p>\n<p>Reintroducing the True Square watch, under joint creative direction with Tej Chauhan, Rado brings a refreshing revamp to the classic timepiece we’ve come to love. Tej Chauhan’s take on the True Square maintains the timepiece’s square case as the basis for the watch but coats it in retro-inspired, lemon yellow drip with a matte-like texture in order to bring the unique touch that only ceramic molding can deliver. Bright, yellow leather cushioning fills out the strap of the watch to offer maximum comfort for every user, while matte yellow ceramic pieces connect each stainless steel element together. The watch is water-resistant for up to 50 meters and operates using the ETA C07.611 automatic movement.</p>\n<p>The back of the square case was produced using PVD-coated stainless steel, which ensures the user’s comfort as PVD-coated stainless steel offers the same feeling as liquid metal, landing softly on your wrist and offering a cooling, metallic accent to the watch as a whole. The watch face itself has a concave glass dome that gives the art of time-telling an immersive touch. Etched along the perimeter of the square timepiece are sleek, thin minute-markers, symmetrically interrupted with bolder, thicker hour-markers. Imitating the look of a sonar radar, twelve concentric circles emanate from the timepiece’s nucleus, giving the True Square watch a focal point to inform users of the time of day or date.</p>\n<p>Chauhan designed this wristwatch with the user in mind first and foremost. By using an Emotive Industrial Design approach, this new True Square design embraces both user-friendliness and visibly striking design details, offering a watch that’s both visually approachable and enticing for everyone. The latest addition to the True Square collection from Rado is one that’s intuitive in its impressive technological design structure, but also one that’s as classic as it comes. Up-to-date technological features fill out this watch and unbeatable, singular design color and material schemes comprise a watch that’s so distinguishable and attention-grabbing, it’ll leave even the most devout of watch aficionados suddenly asking for the time.</p>\n<p>Designers: <a href=\"https://tejchauhan.com/work/true-square-tej-chauhan/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tej
