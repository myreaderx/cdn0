So it's fair to say there's a lot of room for new lore in the world of the films.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">That's where Lionsgate hopes to step in and change things up by partnering with Dorian, a platform for independent writers to make their work into playable games, for a contest where fans can submit their \"Blair Witch\" fan fiction and independent works for a chance to become officially part of the canon.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">According to <a href=\"https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3685137/lionsgate-wants-fans-use-platform-dorian-create-officially-licensed-blair-witch-project-game/\">their press release</a>:</p><blockquote>Dorian, the first ever no-code platform that allows independent writers to easily transform their stories into playable immersive games, has partnered with global content leader Lionsgate to empower fiction creators to expand the stories behind some of Hollywood's most popular franchises. Through this unique partnership, Dorian and Lionsgate will launch official events tied to well-known Hollywood IP, calling for creators to write and submit their fanfiction for a chance to publish licensed playable games on Dorian, opening the door for potential revenue while expanding the creator's growth opportunities. The first major franchise to kick off the partnership is the iconic 'Blair Witch'.</blockquote><h2>The Details</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/lionsgate-throws-hands-in-air-asks-blair-witch-fans-to-make-stuff-because-who-knows-anymore-man/intro-1633010976.jpg\" /><p dir=\"ltr\">Creators in the USA, UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India and the Philippines will be able to submit their work through the Dorian app starting on October 15, 2021. Submissions will close on October 31, 2021, and the grand prize winner will be awarded with a virtual meeting with a Lionsgate senior executive to discuss their project and potential future opportunities. The winner's story will be featured and promoted in the Dorian app — and the creator will have the chance to make revenue off of the fan fiction playable game they've created. They will also receive custom cover art for their story created by the app's design team, and will be given Dorian currency they can use to access premium content on the platform. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">This is the official writer's prompt for the contest:</p><blockquote>Horror tourists and fans congregate in Burkittsville, Maryland for a 3-Day Blair Witch themed music festival! Séances, rituals, and spooky-themed scavenger hunts fill the once frightening Black Hills Forest. As a hit horror streamer, you think you can brave just about everything—right? Your plan: Break the internet by taking on the #SurviveTheWitch challenge. The horrific twist? The festival's organizers have something wicked in store for the young influencers in attendance. Will you and crew survive a night in the Black Hills Forest... or end up livestreaming your own deaths?</blockquote><h2>Why This Could Be A Goldmine For Blair Witch Fans</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/lionsgate-throws-hands-in-air-asks-blair-witch-fans-to-make-stuff-because-who-knows-anymore-man/why-this-could-be-a-goldmine-for-blair-witch-fans-1633010976.jpg\" /><p dir=\"ltr\">No matter what way you slice it, being invited into the \"Blair Witch\" world this way is a really cool fandom moment — and it definitely could lead to some very inventive and divisive content. It will certainly be interesting to see how fans bring this story into the now and put their personal spins on the prompt concept.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Additionally, the press release noted that the writer's platform is primarily used by marginalized communities as both audience and creators, specifically women and people of color. Considering this fact, it really shines a light on the need for diversity and inclusion in both the creator economy and genre content. The stories that will result from this contest will be undoubtedly fresh and most likely spotlight perspectives that haven't been as common in entertainment, or even horror as a whole.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\"When we were first introduced to Dorian and the opportunity it brings to creators, we were immediately hooked on the idea of working with them,\" said Jenefer Brown, EVP, Global Live Interactive and Location Based Entertainment of Lionsgate, in the press release. \"We are always looking for new and inspiring ways to engage with female creators and diverse communities, and through Dorian's platform, content creators can explore new pathways to a narrative experience within the universe of the 'Blair Witch.'\"</p><p>Read this next: <a

Far","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/619965/everything-we-know-about-heathcliff-so-far/","description":"<img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/everything-we-know-about-heathcliff-so-far/intro-1633009954.jpg\" /><p dir=\"ltr\">It's been 15 years since we were last blessed with a film about an orange comic strip cat with \"Garfield 2: A Tale of Two Kitties,\" but Legendary Pictures has recently obtained the rights to both a feature film and a series version of the arguably cooler orange cat, \"Heathcliff.\" The favorite of all the Catillac Cats and the Hydrox cookie to \"Garfield's\" Oreo has become somewhat of a meme in recent years, which makes him ripe for a cinematic update. Will Heathcliff get to wear a sweet leather jacket? Will Heathcliff's weirdly curvaceous anthropomorphic girlfriend cat make an appearance?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Here's everything we know so far about the inevitable \"Heathcliff\" movie and series.</p><h2>When And Where To Watch Heathcliff</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/everything-we-know-about-heathcliff-so-far/when-and-where-to-watch-heathcliff-1633009954.jpg\" /><p>Good news! We have no idea. The rights were <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/legendary-heathcliff-movie-tv-rights-1235019964/\">just picked up by Legendary</a> and there's still no say if this will be a fully animated film, a hybrid animated/live-action film, so estimating a time of release is also going to be difficult. Paramount+ currently has all of the episodes of the \"Heathcliff\" animated series, so it feels like a safe assumption that Paramount may become the home for the new movie and series. Then again, Legendary has also collaborated with the likes of Warner Bros., Universal Pictures, and Netflix. Regardless, we're still excited to see what they cook up for good ol' Heathcliff.</p><h2>What We Think Heathcliff Will Be About</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/everything-we-know-about-heathcliff-so-far/what-we-think-heathcliff-will-be-about-1633009954.jpg\" /><p dir=\"ltr\">Created by George Gately in 1973 and now drawn by Gately's nephew Peter Gallagher, \"Heathcliff\" started as a comic strip that at its height ran in thousands of newspapers. Centered on the titular cocky and street-smart cat, Legendary plans to develop both a film and series about Heathcliff at the same time.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The popular comic strip has been in syndication for 32 years, has been translated into 20 languages, and has run in 57 countries. The strip was adapted into two separate cartoon series in the 1980s, both featuring legendary voice actor Mel Blanc in one of his last voiceover roles as Heathcliff. The strip also turned into a Marvel comic in 1985 as part of Star Comics which was later absorbed into the Marvel Comics line.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">More importantly, however, \"Heathcliff\" has now become <a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1992541-cats\">a meme</a>. His popularity now is less about his comic strip and more about the weird relatable humor that can be found by changing the punchline in his comic strips. Considering everything today feels like a gritty or sardonic remake of a beloved children's property, there's a good chance the \"Heathcliff\" movie and series will follow suit. We foresee a sarcastic and self-aware Heathcliff the cat in our future.</p><h2>What We Know About The Heathcliff Cast And Crew</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/everything-we-know-about-heathcliff-so-far/what-we-know-about-the-heathcliff-cast-and-crew-1633009954.jpg\" /><p>Artist Peter Gallagher will serve as a producer with Steve Waterman, who was an executive producer on 1999's \"Stuart Little\" and the new batch of \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" movies. This executive producer role has led many to believe that \"Heathcliff\" will lean toward the CGI character/live-action hybrid model of filmmaking.</p><p>No voice cast or human actors have been announced, but following in the footsteps of Mel Blanc will be no easy task. Perhaps Mel Blanc's successors like Jeff Bergman, Billy West, or Eric Bauza could take up the mantle, but after the choice of casting Bill Murray in the \"Garfield\" films, there's a higher probability that a comedic Hollywood A-lister will take over the role.</p><p>Read this next: <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/567203/muppet-movies-ranked/\">Ranking All Eight Muppet Movies On The First Film's 40th Anniversary</a></p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/619965/everything-we-know-about-heathcliff-so-far/\">Everything We Know About Heathcliff So Far</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=xy008qohJ2s:bgEYuZet4cw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=xy008qohJ2s:bgEYuZet4cw:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=xy008qohJ2s:bgEYuZet4cw:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=xy008qohJ2s:bgEYuZet4cw:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=xy008qohJ2s:bgEYuZet4cw:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=xy008qohJ2s:bgEYuZet4cw:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/xy008qohJ2s\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 13:55:37 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/everything-we-know-about-heathcliff-so-far/intro-1633009954.jpg","linkMd5":"a7d86f6650679995171aefed91d2d95d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn22@2020_3/2021/09/30/14-28-24-285_be9310542b659732.webp","destWidth":780,"destHeight":438,"sourceBytes":96801,"destBytes":43548,"author":"BJ Colangelo","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/everything-we-know-about-heathcliff-so-far/intro-1633009954.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn22@2020_3/2021/09/30/14-28-24-285_be9310542b659732.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/everything-we-know-about-heathcliff-so-far/when-and-where-to-watch-heathcliff-1633009954.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn10@2020_2/2021/09/30/14-28-25-325_f8a584a1f343d980.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/everything-we-know-about-heathcliff-so-far/what-we-think-heathcliff-will-be-about-1633009954.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn38@2020_4/2021/09/30/14-29-25-292_708af890f5c7d473.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/everything-we-know-about-heathcliff-so-far/what-we-know-about-the-heathcliff-cast-and-crew-1633009954.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn59@2020_1/2021/09/30/14-28-25-039_2bd5e01bfc79cdef.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=xy008qohJ2s:bgEYuZet4cw:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn17@2020_6/2021/09/30/14-28-25-532_76e3549ff4aca217.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn57@2020_1/2021/09/30/14-28-25-378_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=xy008qohJ2s:bgEYuZet4cw:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn53@2020_5/2021/09/30/14-28-25-399_44e81a93d3f143e8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/xy008qohJ2s":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn25@2020_6/2021/09/30/14-28-25-332_738207f784315290.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1633012104105},{"createdTime":"2021-09-30 22:28:24","updatedTime":"2021-09-30 22:28:24","title":"Maya And The Three Trailer: The Stunning New Epic From The Book Of Life Director Comes To Netflix","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/619944/maya-and-the-three-trailer-the-stunning-new-epic-from-the-book-of-life-director-comes-to-netflix/","description":"<img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/maya-and-the-three-trailer-the-stunning-new-epic-from-the-book-of-life-director-comes-to-netflix/intro-1633009491.jpg\" /><p>Netflix must have caught wind about <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/619615/netflix-film-chief-wants-people-to-call-it-the-best-film-studio-in-the-world/\">some of the recent grumbling</a> directed towards the streaming service, because \"Maya and the Three\" looks more and more like an emphatic statement aimed at any and all skeptics. This \"Netflix Animated Event told in nine epic chapters\" will introduce audiences to a refreshingly new and original world that loosely borrows from different aspects of Indigenous mythology and Caribbean culture. Created, directed, written, and executive produced by \"The Book of Life\" filmmaker Jorge R. Gutiérrez -- with credited writers Silvia Olivas, Doug Langdale, and Candie Kelty Langdale, along with Jeff Ranjo as Head of Story -- this has been a passion project for several years, going back to the initial announcement of the project in November of 2018.</p><p>The diverse and multicultural animated miniseries has released another trailer to hype up its imminent release, which you can watch for yourself below.</p><h2>Maya And The Three Trailer</h2><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/QrPMlYSbkEQ\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe><p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/604325/maya-and-the-three-release-date-cast-and-more/\">\"Maya and the Three\" has been described as</a> \"an adventure full of heart and humor, inspired by a rich, vibrant mixture of Aztec, Maya, and Inca mythology, and modern-day Caribbean culture.\" The footage certainly backs up that claim, boasting epic visuals and heightened worlds, vibrant characters, and an intriguing blend of Latin American perspectives. The ensemble of voice actors includes big names such as Zoe Saldaña, Gabriel Iglesias, Allen Maldonado, Stephanie Beatriz, Diego Luna, Gael García Bernal, Alfred Molina, Kate del Castillo, Danny Trejo, Cheech Marin, Rosie Perez, Queen Latifah, Wyclef Jean, Jorge R.

As someone feeling the need for representation; as the mother of three beautiful boys who, already, at the tender ages of 6-and-a-half and 4-and-a-half, are acknowledging that there aren't enough portrayals of children who look like them. 'Maya and the Three' is a big step in the right direction. It's beautiful.\"</p><p>\"Maya and the Three\" debuts on Netflix on October 22, 2021.</p><blockquote>In a fantastical world, where magic turns the world and four kingdoms rule the lands, a brave and rebellious warrior princess named Maya is about to celebrate her fifteenth birthday and coronation. But everything changes when the gods of the underworld arrive and announce that Maya's life is forfeit to the God of War — a price she must pay for her family's secret past. If Maya refuses, the whole world will suffer the gods' vengeance. To save her beloved family, her friends, and her own life, Maya embarks on a thrilling quest to fulfill an ancient prophecy that foretells the coming of three great warriors who will help her defeat the gods and save humankind.</blockquote><p>Read this next: <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/591696/the-best-animated-movies-that-arent-made-by-disneypixar/\">The 14 Best Animated Movies (That Aren't Made By Disney Or Pixar)</a></p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/619944/maya-and-the-three-trailer-the-stunning-new-epic-from-the-book-of-life-director-comes-to-netflix/\">Maya And The Three Trailer: The Stunning New Epic From The Book Of Life Director Comes To Netflix</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=eNS6ftSSrTs:QxIZlSPS-4I:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=eNS6ftSSrTs:QxIZlSPS-4I:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=eNS6ftSSrTs:QxIZlSPS-4I:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=eNS6ftSSrTs:QxIZlSPS-4I:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=eNS6ftSSrTs:QxIZlSPS-4I:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=eNS6ftSSrTs:QxIZlSPS-4I:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/eNS6ftSSrTs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 13:46:31 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/maya-and-the-three-trailer-the-stunning-new-epic-from-the-book-of-life-director-comes-to-netflix/intro-1633009491.jpg","linkMd5":"54acbbf8ffe196bfd21976cc64860da7","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn98@2020_3/2021/09/30/14-28-24-175_ebd86e10fb237a1f.webp","destWidth":780,"destHeight":438,"sourceBytes":65931,"destBytes":28018,"author":"Jeremy Mathai","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/maya-and-the-three-trailer-the-stunning-new-epic-from-the-book-of-life-director-comes-to-netflix/intro-1633009491.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn98@2020_3/2021/09/30/14-28-24-175_ebd86e10fb237a1f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=eNS6ftSSrTs:QxIZlSPS-4I:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn69@2020_6/2021/09/30/14-28-25-235_a60f910f674f14a2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn57@2020_1/2021/09/30/14-28-25-378_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=eNS6ftSSrTs:QxIZlSPS-4I:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn76@2020_6/2021/09/30/14-28-25-061_c69559551010ad77.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/eNS6ftSSrTs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn82@2020_6/2021/09/30/14-28-25-037_ed111dca5943e0ed.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1633012104105},{"createdTime":"2021-09-30 22:28:24","updatedTime":"2021-09-30 22:28:24","title":"Immersive 007 Exhibitions Will Let You Enter The World Of Bond, James Bond","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/619936/immersive-007-exhibitions-will-let-you-enter-the-world-of-bond-james-bond/","description":"<img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/immersive-007-exhibition-will-let-you-play-bond-james-bond/intro-1633009090.jpg\" /><p dir=\"ltr\">If you've ever wanted to step into 007's shoes and order one \"shaken, not stirred,\" you'll actually have the opportunity to step into the espionage legend's shoes in New York City with a new immersive James Bond exhibition.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The \"<a href=\"https://feverup.com/m/102102?utm_source=affiliate&utm_medium=rakuten&utm_campaign=2116208_Skimlinks.com&utm_content=10&utm_term=uk_network&ranMID=45370&ranEAID=TnL5HPStwNw&ranSiteID=TnL5HPStwNw-PWbg40xoK3rqJ_zSsM4CGg\">007xSKYSCAPE: The James Bond Immersive Exhibition</a>\" is where fans can step into \"projection mapping and larger-than-life installations [that] take you inside the magic of 007,\" located in the Skyscape in midtown Manhattan.

According to a press release obtained by <a href=\"https://variety.com/2021/shopping/news/james-bond-immersive-exhibition-1235076182/\">Variety</a>, there is also a VIP package, which comes with a 156-page hardcover book that shares the same title as the exhibit.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">So, what exactly do you do in this Bond experience?

The tour is led by an espionage expert who takes guests to various locations related to Ian Fleming — the original writer of the James Bond spy novels — and the different places he references throughout his books. The tour, which takes place over six hours, also includes a counter-surveillance techniques lesson, as well as a session on the shooting range using Bond's most favored weapons.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The event is concluded with one of Bond's signature vesper and vodka martinis at the Taj Hotel, a five-star establishment, so you feel pretty <em>international spy</em> from start to finish.

We're not thinking about it at all. We want Daniel to have his time of celebration,\" producer Barbara Broccoli recently told Variety. \"Next year we'll start thinking about the future.\"</p><p dir=\"ltr\">It seems that the braintrust behind these films is really savoring the moments they have left with Craig — and for good reason. He is one of the best Bonds we've had yet.</p><blockquote>\"We're very, very lucky to get him to play this role. We could see he was reluctant to do it, because he knew it would change his life, which it obviously has,\" Broccoli added. \"It's changed his life, but it hasn't changed him. What he's enabled us to do with the franchise is really explore the emotional life of Bond and go into the person and complexity and conflicts that happen within the Bond character.\"</blockquote><p>Read this next: <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/588506/the-greatest-james-bond-villains-ever/\">The 20 Greatest James Bond Villains Ever</a></p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/619936/immersive-007-exhibitions-will-let-you-enter-the-world-of-bond-james-bond/\">Immersive 007 Exhibitions Will Let You Enter the World of Bond, James Bond</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=VFE0-4De2S8:YObCwoK7G8M:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=VFE0-4De2S8:YObCwoK7G8M:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=VFE0-4De2S8:YObCwoK7G8M:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=VFE0-4De2S8:YObCwoK7G8M:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=VFE0-4De2S8:YObCwoK7G8M:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=VFE0-4De2S8:YObCwoK7G8M:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/VFE0-4De2S8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 13:45:48 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/immersive-007-exhibition-will-let-you-play-bond-james-bond/intro-1633009090.jpg","linkMd5":"a36c99802bd016c01dfdcf72418ef228","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn34@2020_4/2021/09/30/14-28-24-178_b9b44357ea4958f9.webp","destWidth":780,"destHeight":438,"sourceBytes":64679,"destBytes":13182,"author":"Lex Briscuso","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/immersive-007-exhibition-will-let-you-play-bond-james-bond/intro-1633009090.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn34@2020_4/2021/09/30/14-28-24-178_b9b44357ea4958f9.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/immersive-007-exhibition-will-let-you-play-bond-james-bond/a-second-option-1633009532.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn38@2020_4/2021/09/30/14-28-25-380_7450e4fee69467e0.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/immersive-007-exhibition-will-let-you-play-bond-james-bond/when-is-the-new-bond-taking-over-for-daniel-craig-1633009090.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn34@2020_2/2021/09/30/14-28-25-352_c984d84e27a7f64a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=VFE0-4De2S8:YObCwoK7G8M:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn13@2020_3/2021/09/30/14-28-25-063_f267ffe239b37bab.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn57@2020_1/2021/09/30/14-28-25-378_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=VFE0-4De2S8:YObCwoK7G8M:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/VFE0-4De2S8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn52@2020_1/2021/09/30/14-28-25-207_6ba046cd0aaf159a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1633012104104},{"createdTime":"2021-09-30 22:28:24","updatedTime":"2021-09-30 22:28:24","title":"Squid Game Might Be Netflix's Biggest Show Ever","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/619883/squid-game-might-be-netflixs-biggest-show-ever/","description":"<img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/squid-game-might-be-netflixs-biggest-show-ever/intro-1633006592.jpg\" /><p>Move over, \"Tiger King,\" there's a new weirdo series in town. Hwang Dong-hyuk's Korean survival drama \"Squid Game,\" which has captured the attention of audiences since it dropped on Netflix in mid-September, currently holds the No. 1 slot. The streaming service's co-CEO Ted Sarandos <a href=\"https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/netflix-most-popular-tv-shows-movies-1235075301/\">tells Variety</a> that the show could very well become its biggest show ever. </p><p>\"We did not see that coming, in terms of its global popularity,\" Sarandos says. </p><p>Netflix's <a href=\"https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/netflix-q2-2021-earnings-video-game-strategy-1235023563/\">second quarter</a> has seen a stagnation in new subscribers, slowing to 1.5 million viewers globally.

Writer-director Hwang Dong-hyuk helms his first series after a string of successful genre-spanning feature films, including the tragic 2011 account of abuse and atrocities at the Gwangju Inhwa School for the deaf, titled \"The Crucible.\" \"Squid Game,\" also titled \"Round Six,\" follows a battle arena structure like \"Battle Royale,\" Takashi Miike's \"As The Gods Will,\" and the odd \"Saw\" sequel, pitting 456 desperate pawns against each other in an absurdist fight to the death over nine episodes.</p><p>Playing schoolyard matches and deadly territory quests like the titular Squid Game, Tug of War, and Red Light, Green Light, the contestants compete for millions in needed prize money; some are like the show's gambling-indebted star Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae), while others have a different flavor of pressure, like North Korean defector Sae-byeok (Jung Ho-yeon). Others still would simply prefer to control the place and manner of their death, like the terminally ill Oh Il-nam (Oh Yeong-su) who doesn't want to die in the cruel world outside of the competition. The show doesn't focus much on the motivations for joining the games, choosing rather to take the concept to its logical extreme and focus on the power dynamics among the players and the masked hosts, stopping for social commentary along the way.</p><p>The simple premise didn't deter Hwang, who tells <a href=\"https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/squid-game-director-hwang-dong-hyuk-korean-series-global-success-1235073355/\">Variety</a>:</p><blockquote>\"I wanted to write a story that was an allegory or fable about modern capitalist society, something that depicts an extreme competition, somewhat like the extreme competition of life. But I wanted it to use the kind of characters we've all met in real life.\"</blockquote><p>Egos were built and toppled on the playground, and with \"Squid Game's\" stakes so much higher than wounded pride or a skinned knee, it's no wonder why viewers are willing to roll the dice and press play.</p><p>Read this next: <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/587730/the-best-sci-fi-shows-currently-on-netflix/\">The 10 Best Sci-Fi Shows Currently On Netflix</a></p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/619883/squid-game-might-be-netflixs-biggest-show-ever/\">Squid Game Might Be Netflix's Biggest Show Ever</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=U5pxcVwHLM0:z7Ei0DgiiCU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=U5pxcVwHLM0:z7Ei0DgiiCU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=U5pxcVwHLM0:z7Ei0DgiiCU:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=U5pxcVwHLM0:z7Ei0DgiiCU:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=U5pxcVwHLM0:z7Ei0DgiiCU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=U5pxcVwHLM0:z7Ei0DgiiCU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/U5pxcVwHLM0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 13:02:17 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/squid-game-might-be-netflixs-biggest-show-ever/intro-1633006592.jpg","linkMd5":"54e133aa4f703298718093d8ad0da883","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn11@2020_6/2021/09/30/14-28-24-170_4fc4a3ff4b92d354.webp","destWidth":780,"destHeight":438,"sourceBytes":153078,"destBytes":72086,"author":"Anya Stanley","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/squid-game-might-be-netflixs-biggest-show-ever/intro-1633006592.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn11@2020_6/2021/09/30/14-28-24-170_4fc4a3ff4b92d354.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/squid-game-might-be-netflixs-biggest-show-ever/your-latest-obsession-1633006732.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn82@2020_3/2021/09/30/14-28-25-038_5bed89ec890fedf5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=U5pxcVwHLM0:z7Ei0DgiiCU:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn70@2020_4/2021/09/30/14-28-25-048_e328d49627bcb9c7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn57@2020_1/2021/09/30/14-28-25-378_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=U5pxcVwHLM0:z7Ei0DgiiCU:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn45@2020_4/2021/09/30/14-28-25-407_5c04ac9b0b6bfc2b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/U5pxcVwHLM0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn29@2020_1/2021/09/30/14-28-25-353_5b4f5c149b679e84.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1633012104105},{"createdTime":"2021-09-30 22:28:24","updatedTime":"2021-09-30 22:28:24","title":"Shang-Chi Director Breaks Down The Action-Packed Bus Fight","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/619915/shang-chi-director-breaks-down-the-action-packed-bus-fight/","description":"<img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/shang-chi-director-breaks-down-the-action-packed-bus-fight/intro-1633008048.jpg\" /><p>If you have 20 minutes to spare, you can embark on a video journey with director Destin Daniel Cretton as he breaks down the bus fight in <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/583701/shang-chi-and-the-legend-of-the-ten-rings-review-tony-leungs-villain-eclipses-the-mcus-first-asian-superhero/\">\"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings.\"</a></p><p>2021 has actually been a big year for bus fights in action movies. First, there was the rough-and-tumble <a href=\"https://youtu.be/oROB_7A4oeI\">brawl in \"Nobody,\"</a> which saw Bob Odenkirk throwing down with a gang of unruly bus passengers (without super powers). Then, there was the fight in \"Shang-Chi,\" which upped the ante by pitting Simu Liu against a supervillain named Razor Fist and other assorted assassins aboard a bus in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</p><p>The crazies really come out when you're riding public transportation. With all due respect to Odenkirk and his character, Hutch, Shang-Chi would probably knock him into next week, or just out the bus window, as we saw in \"Nobody.\"</p><p>Speaking of time measurements, here comes that 20-minute video, courtesy of Vanity Fair and its \"Notes on a Scene\" YouTube series. In it, Cretton walks you through the anatomy of a bus fight in a Marvel movie.</p><p>The video shows you how much thought can go into a single movie scene. Cretton, who has a background in dramas like \"Short Term 12\" and \"Just Mercy,\" has discussed how \"Shang-Chi\" is more a <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/583633/shang-chi-is-more-a-journey-of-self-discovery-than-a-superhero-movie-director-destin-daniel-cretton-says/\">journey of self-discovery</a> than a superhero movie.

As he tells it, the Act I turn is when Razor Fist deploys his signature weapon. Then, it's game on.</p><p>Evidently, Cretton used \"a lot of what-if scenarios\" when he pitched the scene to Marvel.

Marketing for the flick played up a dark, shadowy, potentially violent antihero story. But the fun of the film came from how unusually silly it was for a modern-day comic book adaptation, with Tom Hardy going gonzo as he used weird voices and climbed into lobster tanks. Now, here's \"Venom: Let There Be Carnage,\" a sequel that does away with any pretext of seriousness. Like \"Evil Dead II,\" this is an off-the-wall, over-the-top, \"Three Stooges\" inspired freak show. The end result is a queer-coded rom-com about two very messy boys who love each other. Eddie Brock and his alien symbiote Venom are destined to be together; they're both losers who make each other winners in the end. Sure, a few heads get bitten off in the process, but love does funny things to us all. </p><p>Yes, there are still a few dark and serious things here. But \"Venom: Let There Be Carnage\" is also refreshingly breezy. It flies by — probably because it's pretty clear multiple scenes ended up on the cutting room floor at some point. On top of that, the stakes are incredibly low. There's no threat of world domination here or mass extinction. In an era where we're inundated with superhero movies, and every single one of those movies is treated like A BIG EVENT, there's something oddly comforting about a movie like this that has very little on its mind, other than throwing big gooey monsters up on screen to scream at each other in surround sound. The bottom line: \"Venom: Let There Be Carnage\" does not want you to take any of this even remotely seriously, and there's nothing wrong with that. </p><p>As \"Let There Be Carnage\" begins, Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) and Venom (Tom Hardy doing a funny voice) have become something akin to an old married couple. They bicker, they make up, they bicker again. They have two pet chickens, Sonny and Cher, that were originally intended to be snacks for Venom. But Venom refuses to eat them — they're his friends, now. Besides, it's not chicken Venom wants. Instead, the alien is constantly begging Eddie to let him eat some bad guys, and Eddie is constantly shooting this request down. Eddie is also still trying to make a comeback as a journalist, and he gets a big break when serial killer Cletus Kasady (Woody Harrelson, having the time of his life here) requests an interview. \"People love serial killers,\" Cletus says, and he has a point. </p><p>With help from Venom, Eddie is able to figure out where many of Cletus' still-missing victims are buried. The outcry is so severe that we're told the governor of California has lifted the state's ban on the death penalty to make Cletus pay for his crimes. \"Let There Be Carnage\" was in production before the California recall, so it's unclear if we're meant to assume the governor putting Cletus to death is Gavin Newsom or a fictional equivalent. In any case, the idea that the state would up and reverse its death penalty stance on the basis of one creepy ginger guy is perhaps the most implausible thing in a movie full of goo monsters. </p><h2>Hammy, Undercooked Villains</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/venom-let-there-be-carnage-review-a-goofy-romantic-comedy-disguised-as-a-superhero-sequel/tk-1632929483.jpg\" /><p>Like everything else in \"Venom: Let There Be Carnage,\" Cletus Kasady is refreshingly simple. He's not a misunderstood tragic figure. He's not a good guy who just went bad. He's simply a creep who murdered his mother, grandmother, and a lot of other people. He's spent most of his life in and out of institutions, and the only real connection he ever made was with Frances Barrison (Naomie Harris), a character just as deranged as he is. Frances has a superpowered scream that can shatter glass and physically injure people, and she and Cletus really hit it off at the reform school they grew up together in. But Frances was eventually taken away to a top-secret facility, leaving Cletus pining for his true love for most of his life. </p><p>Harrelson and Harris have as much fun as they possibly can with these characters, although it seems abundantly clear that they both had a lot more scenes that director Andy Serkis ultimately decided to cut. Harris' character is particularly ill-served here — we learn almost nothing tangible about her, and her characteristics change dramatically at the drop of a hat. She spends most of the film as a full-blown psycho willing to kill, and then at one point suddenly acts alarmed and says things have gone too far — only to then go right back to being cartoonishly evil again. It's this sort of messiness that keeps \"Let There Be Carnage\" from being fully successful, but it doesn't mean the movie isn't fun to watch, and indeed, there's plenty of fun to be had watching Harrelson and Harris ham it up, laughing and sneering as if they were mustachioed villains in a silent film. </p><p>Right before he's about to be sent to the gas chamber, Cletus requests one final interview with Eddie. It doesn't go so well, and the serial killer ends up taking a bite out of Eddie's hand. Of course, Eddie has alien stuff running through his body, and Cletus ingests some of that without thinking too much about it (he's a crazy serial killer, so he's prone to decisions like that). And wouldn't you know it, that ingestion turns Cletus into an alien monster, too — the red, multi-limbed Carnage. Carnage is much deadlier, and meaner, than Venom, and Cletus uses his newfound powers to bust out of the gas chamber and go looking for his long-lost love, Frances. </p><h2>A Real Boy And An Amoeba</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/venom-let-there-be-carnage-review-a-goofy-romantic-comedy-disguised-as-a-superhero-sequel/tk-1632930308.jpg\" /><p>In the midst of all of this, Eddie and Venom go through a break-up. Things get so testy that Venom leaves — jumping out of Eddie and into other people. This leads to a silly-but-charming sequence in which Venom has a kind of coming-out party, wandering into a rave and giving an impassioned speech about how love is love and we should not judge others for their beliefs. Venom couches the conversation in the form of \"being nice to aliens,\" but Andy Serkis and writer Kelly Marcel know exactly what they're doing here, all but shouting from the rooftops that Venom is here, and he's queer, and he's proud of it, goddamn it. And just in case you didn't pick up on it, there's even a quick moment where a female character at the rave attempts to come on to Venom, at which point the hulking alien replies, \"Sorry, not my type.\" </p><p>Ultimately, Venom realizes he misses Eddie, and Eddie misses Venom. They need each other, and Eddie has to turn to his ex, Anne (Michelle Williams), to help get Venom back. This scenario has all the trappings of a screwball rom-com, and we know it's only a matter of time before Venom and Eddie put aside their differences and get back together again. And when they do, they'll have to stop Cletus/Carnage and Frances, who also goes by the supervillain name Shriek. </p><p>The villains don't seem to have a real plan other than \"let's mess stuff up.\" Again, I get the distinct impression that an earlier version of this movie had much more development for the baddies. Hell, they might have even had a nefarious world domination plan. But if so, it's not here, and the movie is the better for it. Not all comic book movie villains need plots to take over the world; sometimes, it's okay for them to just be evil jerks who like to run around smashing things. </p><p>On paper, Cletus and Frances are paper-thin. They merely exist. Even Carnage is kind of a dud here; he has none of the personality of Venom. He simply moves around screaming, and barely saying anything. This seems like a miscalculation because I imagine Harrelson could've had some fun delivering lines for Carnage. But perhaps everyone involved with the movie realized that the real heart and soul of \"Let There Be Carnage\" was the relationship between Eddie and Venom, and the promise of another unhinged performance from Hardy, who gets to deliver lines like, \"I'm a real boy, and you're just an amoeba!\" At one point, Venom causes Eddie to have a loud outburst in public, at which point Eddie tells stunned onlookers, \"Sorry, I don't have an explanation for that.\" Hardy is the true glue that holds all of this together, and this franchise is lucky to have him. Without his go-for-broke approach to this material, \"Venom\" would be worse for wear. </p><h2>Who Needs Spider-Man?</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/venom-let-there-be-carnage-review-a-goofy-romantic-comedy-disguised-as-a-superhero-sequel/tk-1632934413.jpg\" /><p>\"Venom: Let There Be Carnage\" is choked with issues, from its nonsensical plot to its trimmed-down narrative. And yet, I find myself wanting to recommend this simply because it never once bored me the way some classier, bigger Marvel-centric movies have. Nothing in the main film feels like it's sticking to a formula or doling out fan service. Indeed, when a fan service-heavy post-credit scene arrives, it rings hollow, and needy, and false. The Venom of the comics might need Spider-Man to get by, but this weirdo movie version of Venom is perfectly fine standing on his own ground. </p><p>I know there are fans who only want to see Venom in context with the world of Spider-Man, but I could care less. I don't need to see Tom Hardy meet up with Tom Holland's Spidey. All I need is for Venom and Eddie to continue their clumsy, sweet, occasionally deadly romance. There's a moment here where Eddie and Venom watch as Cletus fights against Carnage, leading Eddie to point out that while Cletus and Carnage aren't a good fit, Venom and Eddie are a match made in symbiote heaven. Moments like that are so unusually sweet that it's hard to judge \"Venom: Let There Be Carnage\" too harshly. </p><p>There are countless superhero movies better than this. Better written, better directed, better acted, better made. And yet, \"Let There Be Carnage\" has a weird, quirky heart, and sometimes, that's exactly what you need to see. If we must be inundated with a never-ending stream of comic book movies, at least give us more oddities like this to keep things fresh. As long as Tom Hardy keeps wanting to make these movies, I'll keep watching them. </p><p><strong>/Film Rating: 7 out of 10</strong></p><p>Read this next: <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/590577/marvel-comics-villains-we-really-want-to-see-in-the-mcu/\">11 Marvel Comics Villains We Really Want To See In The MCU</a></p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/618980/venom-let-there-be-carnage-review-a-goofy-romantic-comedy-disguised-as-a-superhero-sequel/\">Venom: Let There Be Carnage Review: A Goofy Romantic Comedy Disguised as a Superhero Sequel</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=b2NrA_EA5lM:R2Ro_q2pVKI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=b2NrA_EA5lM:R2Ro_q2pVKI:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=b2NrA_EA5lM:R2Ro_q2pVKI:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=b2NrA_EA5lM:R2Ro_q2pVKI:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=b2NrA_EA5lM:R2Ro_q2pVKI:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=b2NrA_EA5lM:R2Ro_q2pVKI:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/b2NrA_EA5lM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 13:00:20 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/venom-let-there-be-carnage-review-a-goofy-romantic-comedy-disguised-as-a-superhero-sequel/intro-1632929483.jpg","linkMd5":"f4644375f8185bc9fce040c996a523dc","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn99@2020_3/2021/09/30/14-28-24-166_305827e60cca975f.webp","destWidth":780,"destHeight":438,"sourceBytes":85266,"destBytes":23934,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/venom-let-there-be-carnage-review-a-goofy-romantic-comedy-disguised-as-a-superhero-sequel/intro-1632929483.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn99@2020_3/2021/09/30/14-28-24-166_305827e60cca975f.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/venom-let-there-be-carnage-review-a-goofy-romantic-comedy-disguised-as-a-superhero-sequel/tk-1632929483.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn37@2020_1/2021/09/30/14-28-25-112_0df3113baecf360a.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/venom-let-there-be-carnage-review-a-goofy-romantic-comedy-disguised-as-a-superhero-sequel/tk-1632930308.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn29@2020_4/2021/09/30/14-28-25-274_dd98e472d3335ec2.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/venom-let-there-be-carnage-review-a-goofy-romantic-comedy-disguised-as-a-superhero-sequel/tk-1632934413.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn18@2020_6/2021/09/30/14-28-25-080_34c79d4183f235a6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=b2NrA_EA5lM:R2Ro_q2pVKI:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn40@2020_4/2021/09/30/14-28-25-304_fd9771cc5af99041.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn57@2020_1/2021/09/30/14-28-25-378_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=b2NrA_EA5lM:R2Ro_q2pVKI:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn22@2020_1/2021/09/30/14-28-25-539_37a869ae417adc23.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/b2NrA_EA5lM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn41@2020_2/2021/09/30/14-28-25-036_4133b1e85690581f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1633012104105},{"createdTime":"2021-09-30 22:28:24","updatedTime":"2021-09-30 22:28:24","title":"The Black Phone: Release Date, Cast, And More","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/619990/the-black-phone-release-date-cast-and-more/","description":"<img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-black-phone-release-date-cast-and-more/intro-1633010249.jpg\" /><p><em>(Welcome to <strong>...And More</strong>, our no-frills, zero B.S. guide to when and where you can watch upcoming movies and shows, and everything else you could possibly stand to know.)</em></p><p>When uber-producer Jason Blum, the name behind the horror-friendly studio Blumhouse Productions, says that \"The Black Phone\" is the <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/586841/scott-derricksons-the-black-phone-is-the-scariest-movie-producer-jason-blum-has-made/\">\"scariest movie\" he's \"ever worked on,\"</a> that's some pretty high praise. It immediately raises expectations for \"The Black Phone,\" as does some of the other movie talent involved. This fright flick marks a reunion for Ethan Hawke and several key players from another Blumhouse title, \"Sinister,\" which <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/577348/scariest-movie-ever/\">science has determined</a> to be the current record-holder for scariest movie ever.</p><p>\"The Black Phone\" already made its world <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/615658/the-black-phone-review-scott-derrickson-delivers-the-best-joe-hill-adaptation-yet-fantastic-fest/\">premiere at Fantastic Fest 2021</a>, but it's not in theaters yet, just approaching -- like a kidnapper on the basement stairs wearing a demon mask. For Jane or John Q. Moviegoer, who couldn't make it to Austin, Texas, for the festival, we've compiled all there is to know about \"The Black Phone\" in one handy-dandy guide, below.</p><p>Read it on your phone or any darn device, even if it's not black.</p><h2>The Black Phone Release Date And Where You Can Watch It</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-black-phone-release-date-cast-and-more/the-black-phone-release-date-and-where-you-can-watch-it-1633010249.jpg\" /><p>\"The Black Phone\" is coming to theaters on January 28, 2022.</p><p>In times past, January and February often functioned as a studio dumping ground for poorly reviewed films. However, streaming distribution, the pandemic, and the ever-moving goalposts of the movie release calendar in general have somewhat upended that model, since it's just as easy now to dump a dud on Netflix or some such platform. Even Blumhouse has gone straight-to-Amazon with its \"Welcome to Blumhouse\" anthology series.</p><p>The earliest round of reviews for \"The Black Phone\" has been uniformly positive. Keeping in mind that this perfect rating will likely slip once it screens for more critics outside the Fantastic Fest circle, the film still came away from its premiere with a <a href=\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_black_phone\">100% Rotten Tomatoes score</a>. And unlike, say, \"The Forever Purge,\" it isn't continuing a bankable franchise.</p><p>If Blumhouse and the movie's distributor, Universal Pictures, are sticking to their guns and making \"The Black Phone\" exclusive to theaters first, you can bet they have some measure of confidence in it. It's always possible that they could extend its window of theatrical exclusivity if it demonstrates serious legs at the box office. But if it goes the way of the aforementioned \"Forever Purge\" and Blumhouse's \"Freaky,\" it should be available on VOD after three weeks.</p><h2>What Is The Black Phone?</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-black-phone-release-date-cast-and-more/what-is-the-black-phone-1633010249.jpg\" /><p>\"The Black Phone\" may sound like a special phone that only wealthy Purge participants can use, like an Amex Black Card. (Don't commit legal crime without it?) Please don't get the wrong idea, though.</p><p>What \"The Black Phone\" is, really, is a film adaptation of a short story by Joe Hill, who has long since escaped his father Stephen King's shadow with his own successful novels and comics, several of which have been adapted into movies and TV series, such as \"Horns,\" \"NOS4A2,\" and \"Locke & Key.\"</p><p>Here's the plot summary for \"The Black Phone,\" courtesy of <a href=\"https://fantasticfest.com/films/the-black-phone\">Fantastic Fest</a>:</p><blockquote>\"After being abducted by a child killer and locked in a soundproof basement, a 13-year-old boy starts receiving calls on a disconnected phone from the killer's previous victims.\"</blockquote><p>Finney is the boy's name, and he goes missing in a suburban Colorado town. As you can probably surmise from his and his sister's period clothing (see above), \"The Black Phone\" is set in the 1970s.</p><p>Speaking of wardrobe details, Finney's abductor has a creepy mask, designed by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/THETomSavini/status/1442052975514382339\">Tom Savini</a> and Jason Baker of Callosum Studios. And he has an even creepier name.

Joining the ranks of \"The Conjuring\" and the all-time '70s classic \"The Exorcist,\" comes the brand new story of \"The Devil's Light.\" Centering on a nun instead of your typical priest, the upcoming movie delves into religious institutions and a demonic infestation. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">If that sounds like your idea of a fun night, here's everything you need to prepare for \"The Devil's Light.\"<em></em></p><h2>The Devil's Light Release Date And Where To Watch</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-devils-light-release-date-cast-and-more/the-devils-light-release-date-and-where-to-watch-1633007423.jpg\" /><p dir=\"ltr\">\"The Devil's Light\" comes to theaters on February 11, 2022. Why spend your Valentine's weekend on romance when you can be terrified instead? The film was originally slated for its theatrical release in January of 2021, but pandemic delays and theater shutdowns led Lionsgate to shuffle some films across its release calendar.</p><h2>What Is The Devil's Light?</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-devils-light-release-date-cast-and-more/what-is-the-devils-light-1633007423.jpg\" /><p dir=\"ltr\">\"The Devil's Light\" is a supernatural horror about demonic possession. The exorcist at the center of the film is a young nun, Sister Ann, who believes that performing exorcisms is her calling. The church attempts to shut down this desire, as only priests are allowed to perform exorcisms, but Sister Ann is unswayed. She continues her pursuit, observing exorcisms and eventually trying to prove herself once she encounters a disturbed patient who she believes she can save. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">And in typical horror fashion, she discovers evil much more powerful than she ever imagined.</p><h2>The Devil's Light Cast</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-devils-light-release-date-cast-and-more/the-devils-light-cast-1633007423.jpg\" /><p dir=\"ltr\">\"The Devil's Light\" stars Jacqueline Byers as Sister Ann. Byers previously starred as science fiction writer Jillian Hayes in the CBS drama \"Salvation\" and also appeared in the David Tennant-led thriller \"Bad Samaritan.\" Starring alongside Byers is horror veteran and star of the original \"Candyman,\" Virginia Madsen.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The late Ben Cross appears in the film as Cardinal Matthews, one of his final roles. \"The Devil's Light\" was filmed in early 2020, prior to his death. The movie also stars Colin Salmon (\"Die Another Day\"), Christian Navarro (\"13 Reasons Why\"), and Nicholas Ralph (\"All Creatures Great and Small\").</p><h2>The Devil's Light Director, Writer, And More</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-devils-light-release-date-cast-and-more/the-devils-light-director-writer-and-more-1633007423.jpg\" /><p dir=\"ltr\">\"The Devil's Light\" comes from director Daniel Stamm, who isn't new to the exorcism horror sub-genre. He previously helmed the 2010 found-footage horror film, \"The Last Exorcism.\" More recently, Stamm has directed episodes of \"Scream,\" 'Fear of the Walking Dead,\" and \"Into The Dark.\"</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\"The Devil's Light\" is written by Robert Zappia, who previously penned \"Halloween H20: 20 Years Later.\"</p><h2>The Devil's Light Synopsis</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-devils-light-release-date-cast-and-more/the-devils-light-synopsis-1633007423.jpg\" /><p>We're still waiting to see a trailer for the upcoming film, but here's the official synopsis for \"The Devil's Light\":</p><blockquote><p>Sister Ann, a restless 25-year-old, who devoutly believes that performing exorcisms is her calling. But she is at odds with the institution's traditions: sisters are not allowed to perform exorcisms, only priests. With the support of a mentor, a professor who senses her special gift, she is allowed to observe actual training sessions. Her desire to prove herself takes a personal turn when she meets one of the school's most disturbed patients. During their harrowing encounters, Sister Ann comes face to face with a demonic force that infests the school and has mysterious ties to her own past. It is then that the power of evil and her own startling abilities are fully realized.</p></blockquote><p>Read this next: <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/601262/the-best-movies-about-the-devil-ranked/\">The 13 Best Movies About The Devil Ranked</a></p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/619893/the-devils-light-release-date-cast-and-more/\">The Devil's Light: Release Date, Cast, and More</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=98LhLIiSMi8:qjFL1HZygV4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=98LhLIiSMi8:qjFL1HZygV4:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=98LhLIiSMi8:qjFL1HZygV4:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=98LhLIiSMi8:qjFL1HZygV4:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=98LhLIiSMi8:qjFL1HZygV4:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=98LhLIiSMi8:qjFL1HZygV4:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/98LhLIiSMi8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 13:12:44 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-devils-light-release-date-cast-and-more/intro-1633007423.jpg","linkMd5":"c0da3252d3fc7ddb4fa1d1d93c263253","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn29@2020_2/2021/09/30/14-28-24-154_d7b4dd3204759d8b.webp","destWidth":780,"destHeight":438,"sourceBytes":70946,"destBytes":24312,"author":"Shania Russell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-devils-light-release-date-cast-and-more/intro-1633007423.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn29@2020_2/2021/09/30/14-28-24-154_d7b4dd3204759d8b.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-devils-light-release-date-cast-and-more/the-devils-light-release-date-and-where-to-watch-1633007423.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn78@2020_2/2021/09/30/14-28-25-093_493337326d010609.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-devils-light-release-date-cast-and-more/what-is-the-devils-light-1633007423.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn100@2020_3/2021/09/30/14-28-25-043_83ed5852e8d1ceb4.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-devils-light-release-date-cast-and-more/the-devils-light-cast-1633007423.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn94@2020_6/2021/09/30/14-28-25-248_36ee7d2a5f29f508.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-devils-light-release-date-cast-and-more/the-devils-light-director-writer-and-more-1633007423.jpg":null,"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-devils-light-release-date-cast-and-more/the-devils-light-synopsis-1633007423.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn50@2020_5/2021/09/30/14-28-25-399_24c863c8fbaf4726.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=98LhLIiSMi8:qjFL1HZygV4:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn57@2020_3/2021/09/30/14-28-25-088_ba3c8346ed57a097.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn57@2020_1/2021/09/30/14-28-25-378_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=98LhLIiSMi8:qjFL1HZygV4:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn86@2020_6/2021/09/30/14-28-25-085_b49b85cd28b88015.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/98LhLIiSMi8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn34@2020_5/2021/09/30/14-28-25-035_d925c85faad48033.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1633012104104},{"createdTime":"2021-09-30 22:28:24","updatedTime":"2021-09-30 22:28:24","title":"The Sopranos Creator David Chase Doesn't Believe In The Good Ol' Days [Interview]","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/619963/the-sopranos-creator-david-chase-doesnt-believe-in-the-good-ol-days-interview/","description":"<img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-many-saints-of-newark-co-writer-david-chase-doesnt-believe-in-the-good-ol-days-interview/intro-1633010680.jpg\" /><p dir=\"ltr\">David Chase's laugh is infectious. The creator of \"The Sopranos\" and co-writer of its new prequel film, \"The Many Saints of Newark,\" crafts great drama, but also real laughs. As violent and as gut-turning as his work can be, it's that sense of humor of his that helps make these grueling stories as entertaining as they are. So, it should come as no surprise that Chase appreciates a good joke. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">That's what I came away with after talking to Chase for \"The Many Saints of Newark,\" which takes place during \"the good ol' days,\" as Tony Soprano always called them. There's nothing good about them, though -- the prequel reaffirms history repeats itself. I recently sat down with Chase to talk about creating the world of the film (which he wants audiences to experience in a theater, not HBO Max) and how the good ol' days don't actually exist.</p><h2>\"I Loved Being With Those Characters Again.\"</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-many-saints-of-newark-co-writer-david-chase-doesnt-believe-in-the-good-ol-days-interview/i-loved-being-with-those-characters-again-1633010680.jpg\" /><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>I really enjoyed experiencing this movie in a theater.</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">I'm really glad to hear that. It would be great if you write about that. We want to make sure that people go to see it in the movies. Here in the states, it's being released on the same day as streaming. So we really need people to go see it in the theater, not on their couch,</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Since the movie is set in the '60s, did you feel freedom with the characters' voices? Since they're younger, you didn't have to write them exactly how you did in the show?</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">No, I mean actually, and to a slight extent, we needed less freedom in 1967 than we did in 2007. It wasn't hard at all. I mean, they were just, for me anyway, and I guess for Larry too, they're just in my blood and it was just like being back there. Like I'd just done it yesterday.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>So, those voices never leave you?</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Well, they don't come to me at night and wake me up.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>[Laughs] Right.</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">I just knew who they were and it was always fun for me to write \"The Sopranos.\" And it felt that way from the very beginning. I'm not saying it wasn't difficult, writing a screenplay, but I loved being with those characters again.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>They're still hilarious.</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Oh, good. The same for me. I mean, the thing about \"The Sopranos\" was always a pleasure to write because anything that the characters said, wasn't true. They lied 98% of the time. So you would write something and you'd know that's not what he's thinking. He's thinking the opposite of that. It was still a lot of fun to think that way.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Dickie is a great example of that. He keeps saying he wants to do good deeds, but I don't think he wants to be as good as he claims.</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">I would agree with you. \"I want to do a good deed, I want to be good.\" Nobody's stopping it. I think that's a very, very wise insight.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Thank you. When it comes to the comedy, do you often write a line, and without even considering it a joke, an actor's delivery makes it a laugh?</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Absolutely. Oh, absolutely. I don't know if you write comedy or drama, but what happens all the time is that things you thought were funny, don't get a laugh and things you thought were just like nothing, get a laugh because the performances are so good.</p><h2>\"Crystal Clear. No Bullsh*t.\"</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-many-saints-of-newark-co-writer-david-chase-doesnt-believe-in-the-good-ol-days-interview/crystal-clear-no-bullsht-1633010680.jpg\" /><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Needle drops are a big part of the show and the film. Do you listen to music when you write?</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">I go there for inspiration, but not while I'm doing the writing. I listen to a lot of music all the time, especially when I'm working, but not when I'm actually sitting there. I mean, later on during the night, I'll do it. A lot of these things are dredged up from memory. I'll go, \"Oh, that was a really good song.\" Or I've kept this catalog in my head of so-and-so I've always wanted to use. And then a movie situation will come up in which they fit very well.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>One of the great needle drops from the show was \"Every Breath You Take\" mixed with the Peter Gunn theme. Where did that come from?</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">My wife. We were listening to \"Every Breath You Take,\" and my wife said, \"That's the same song as Peter Gunn.\" And we played them and they worked. So, we did this mash up and she has credit on it. I thought it was an amazing insight and it worked really well in that case because it was about espionage. Domestic espionage, yeah.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Do you write song choices in your scripts?</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">It's very seldom. It never really works. Unless you can really plan the show around that or something. You can think about these things in the abstract, but when you see it on the screen, it's completely different than it was on the page. You wind up auditioning many songs.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>You've said before you and Alan Taylor got on well during the tone meetings for the show. He'd pushback more than most directors. Did you have a similar tone meeting for the movie?</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">No. Not at all.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Why are those meetings excruciating for directors?</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">I really don't know, because I'm also a director. I'm trying to think if I was going through it. Well, if I was going through it with someone who was, where we creatively saw eye to eye, which I would think I would be or otherwise, why would I be on the show? If I was intelligent, I might look at that as an opportunity to pick things up or to try things out, but they never do. They're only pissed off and in a hurry and they forget most of it anyway. When the bullets start flying, that all goes out the window.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>You originally planned on directing the movie. How does Alan Taylor's vision compared to what you had in mind?</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Oh, I would like to think it was different, but what he did was, I think, very universal. Crystal clear. No bullsh*t. Just really beautiful, beautiful directing. No nonsense, no tricks. You know, really good.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Your mother would take you quite a bit to Newark as a child. Any memories from that time that influenced the movie?</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Well, there's a scene out in front of an Italian delicatessen. I remember my mother dragging me to those Italian delicatessens when I was little, but that's gone on all my life. So those things still exist. I don't really think so. It doesn't remind me, truthfully, of the Newark I knew then. It's faithful to what it was, but it doesn't spark any memories for me.</p><h2>\"There's No Nostalgia.\"</h2><img src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-many-saints-of-newark-co-writer-david-chase-doesnt-believe-in-the-good-ol-days-interview/theres-no-nostalgia-1633009837.jpg\" /><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Tony talked so much about the \"good ol' days\" on the show.</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Yeah.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Walking out of the movie, I thought,</strong> <strong><em>those</em></strong> <strong>were the good ol' days?</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">[Laughs] That's great. That's great.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>There's no sense of Tony's nostalgia for that time in this movie.</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">No, there was none, that's a good point. I never even thought of it, but you're right. There's no nostalgia. Maybe some of the music, some of it, maybe. Music does carry that, but no, there really wasn't.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Any key differences between writing a younger and older Tony Soprano?</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">I really can't say. Just trying to get into Tony's suit again, you know. We're the writers. Just make it up.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>When you're writing, is it just more instinct? You don't always know exactly why you're doing it, but it just feels right, as a writer?</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Yeah. That's true. Absolutely true. Absolutely true. I mean, that will be for every writer in the world ever. Otherwise, people would write nothing. Somebody sits down and starts to write imaginary characters. So, yeah. That's exactly true. It's just instinct, I say.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>You've said Paulie is an incredibly difficult character to play. He's always been my favorite.</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Everyone's favorite.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>As funny as he is, though, the episode that was always one of my favorites was him thinking about death and the afterlife.</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">[Laughs] The reason I'm laughing is you reminded me of that. That he did think about that a lot. I think you can make the argument that \"Sopranos\" was about death and money. You could make that argument. So it wasn't only Paulie who was obsessed with death. He talks more about it. Somebody should go back and count the number of scenes we did in funeral homes or hospitals. We were always in and out of hospitals and funeral homes.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>\"Pine Barrens,\" death weighs heavy on that episode. Say for a tone meeting for an episode like that, what do you and [director] Steve Buscemi talk about?</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">I don't really remember anything particular. I mean, Steve was very, very professional, very knowledgeable and very easy to get along with. What happened was, we prepped the whole show, three weeks of it or whatever. We were supposed to come back from vacation and start shooting. And in between was a snow storm. That was just luck. And that made that episode. If it hadn't snowed, I don't know if it would've been as good. I don't think so.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Next year is the 10th anniversary of \"Not Fade Away.\" I want to say, I'm a big fan of that movie. I saw it at an age where I really connected with it.</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Oh, good. Really? How old were you?</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>I was 21, leaving home like the character around that time. How do you look back at that movie now?</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">I have a real case about that show. This gentleman named Tom Moore, who was really running Paramount, made sure that nobody saw it. And it was the centerpiece of the New York film festival. And then right after that, in October, they shut it down and they didn't, it sat on a shelf for two months. And then it came back in December with almost no marketing, no promotion. I'll say that. The other thing is, I believe I could have made a better movie.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Well, I really enjoy it.</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Good. Well, I'm always happy to talk about it.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><em>\"The Many Saints of Newark\" hits theaters and HBO Max on October 1st. </em></p><p>Read this next: <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/612335/best-movies-of-2021/\">The Best Movies Of 2021 So Far</a></p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/619963/the-sopranos-creator-david-chase-doesnt-believe-in-the-good-ol-days-interview/\">The Sopranos Creator David Chase Doesn't Believe in the Good Ol' Days [Interview]</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=GRJed3sMkVA:oSjNx-yQsGA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=GRJed3sMkVA:oSjNx-yQsGA:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=GRJed3sMkVA:oSjNx-yQsGA:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=GRJed3sMkVA:oSjNx-yQsGA:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=GRJed3sMkVA:oSjNx-yQsGA:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=GRJed3sMkVA:oSjNx-yQsGA:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/GRJed3sMkVA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 14:07:19 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-many-saints-of-newark-co-writer-david-chase-doesnt-believe-in-the-good-ol-days-interview/intro-1633010680.jpg","linkMd5":"2702ba409f2bec03654422a5357d3005","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn25@2020_2/2021/09/30/14-28-24-304_eede56f410b60c64.webp","destWidth":780,"destHeight":438,"sourceBytes":82649,"destBytes":26030,"author":"Jack Giroux","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-many-saints-of-newark-co-writer-david-chase-doesnt-believe-in-the-good-ol-days-interview/intro-1633010680.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn25@2020_2/2021/09/30/14-28-24-304_eede56f410b60c64.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-many-saints-of-newark-co-writer-david-chase-doesnt-believe-in-the-good-ol-days-interview/i-loved-being-with-those-characters-again-1633010680.jpg":null,"https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-many-saints-of-newark-co-writer-david-chase-doesnt-believe-in-the-good-ol-days-interview/crystal-clear-no-bullsht-1633010680.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn96@2020_6/2021/09/30/14-28-25-053_d49f11df17d7c9e7.webp","https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/the-many-saints-of-newark-co-writer-david-chase-doesnt-believe-in-the-good-ol-days-interview/theres-no-nostalgia-1633009837.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn49@2020_6/2021/09/30/14-28-25-084_abffdb0ba5925916.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=GRJed3sMkVA:oSjNx-yQsGA:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn85@2020_2/2021/09/30/14-28-25-232_b73798b7256289f2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn57@2020_1/2021/09/30/14-28-25-378_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=GRJed3sMkVA:oSjNx-yQsGA:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn4@2020_3/2021/09/30/14-28-25-237_c7c18a0bb9d2d688.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/GRJed3sMkVA":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1633012104105}],"record":{"createdTime":"2021-09-30 22:28:24","updatedTime":"2021-09-30 22:28:24","feedId":21,"fetchDate":"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 14:28:24 +0000","fetchMs":18,"handleMs":7,"totalMs":61688,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"f306b40366a93aa712f78b685bea0f01","hostName":"us-031*","requestId":"477b79f2695740c78f50c0cfe44458cf_21","contentType":"text/xml;
