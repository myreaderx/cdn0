Merriman took to the airwaves after ministers drew back at the last minute from imposing the use of face coverings in the communal areas of secondary schools, opting instead to apply this only where local lockdowns are in place, and leaving head teachers elsewhere to somehow assess the risk and make their own decisions about requiring face mask use.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis was the latest in a succession of U-turns made by the government over the summer. Most were the result of external pressure, but the reversal over face coverings in schools was apparently achieved by Tory MPs themselves, many of whom find the idea anathema. It is not just the U-turns. As full lockdown – with its starkly simple message: “Stay Home. Protect the NHS. Save Lives” – has been progressively eased, so the rules as to what is and is not permissible have ramified bewilderingly. In many instances they have given rise to absurdities, such as people being unable to have their parents visit, unless of course they were to employ them as cleaners. As someone with more than a passing interest in our management of the pandemic, even I have lost track of what is and is not permissible in terms of meeting up with how many people from how many households and in what kind of venue. I doubt there are many people who feel entirely clear on the rules.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt was this sense of drift and chaos that exercised Merriman. “The government needs to get a grip of our scientists. I’m sick and tired, and I think many people in the public are sick and tired – the science just changes,” he said on BBC Radio 4’s <em>Today</em>. “People don’t know what the rules are any more. How can the science change from one day to the next?” But while Merriman has identified a real problem, his diagnosis – that it is the result of flip-flopping science – is entirely wrong.</p>\n<p>\n\tDespite the large sums it has paid to consultancies for guidance on how to tailor its Covid-19 messaging, the government’s communications have been woeful ever since it decided to switch to the “Stay Alert” slogan in May. Fundamental to this is the UK’s failure to make an explicit distinction between personal safety and population-level infection control.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe discourse is about whether it is “safe” for children to return to school, “safe” for workers to return to their offices and so on. The “safety” is strongly implied to be that of the individuals concerned, yet that couldn’t be further from the truth, given that we are not attempting to achieve “zero Covid”. The opening or closing of schools or certain types of business; the prescriptions over inter-household contacts; whether it’s OK to get one’s nails gelled or go to the gym should be understood for what they are: blunt tools that cause varying degrees of disruption to normal social interactions. The more coronavirus spreads, the more interruptions are required to stop it getting out of hand, and vice versa when transmission falls.</p>\n<p>\n\tBecause at a political level such decisions seem like a numbers game, there are always choices that can be made. If cases rise during the autumn, one possible scientific response is to limit social interactions. Johnson has said he would shut pubs and restaurants rather than close schools again. But if political pressure caused him to change that stance, it wouldn’t be because the science had abruptly altered. The same is true with face coverings in schools. It is merely one tool for interrupting some chains of transmission – and not a strongly evidenced one at that. If enough irate Tory backbenchers kick up a fuss, it wouldn’t seem that important a thing to cling on to. There are always other options for exerting friction on the viral growth rate.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe ambiguity between personal safety and population-level management in government messaging is deliberate, I suspect, and reflects a belief that we are too individualistic a culture to be sufficiently motivated by ideas such as collective effort. We will only modify our behaviour if we feel threatened. One problem with this approach is what happens when the threat doesn’t feel real. This might be because a younger person (rationally) perceives their risk from contracting Covid-19 to be small. Or perhaps a middle-aged parent believes they have the virus, so the “threat” then is very different; it becomes about how to manage childcare when ill. In the absence of strong collectivism, judgements come down to individual risk-benefit equations. The youth sorely misses socialising and dancing: out to a party or rave they go. The unwell parent bundles the children in the car, and drives hundreds of miles to where family members can help out if needed.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat of Merriman’s remedy for the confusion and malaise: the “firm smack of government”? New Zealand illustrates what really counts. Rather than constantly fine-tuning the minutiae, its government has set out four levels of social disruption, the requirements of which are widely understood. Individual regions can be moved to different levels independent of the rest of the country, as has happened in Auckland recently. There is clarity, consistency and simplicity as to what is expected. And the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, models empathy and collectivism, frequently emphasising her “team of five million” working together to conquer Covid-19.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf there has been a moment for the “firm smack of government” in the UK’s handling of Covid-19 policy, it was when Dominic Cummings illustrated that individual risk-benefit assessment trumps collective endeavour. The impact reverberates to this day. It is not a genie that will be easily returned to its bottle. </p>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n          Getty      \n\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-image-caption field-type-text field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\">Boris Johnson and his political advisor Dominic Cummings leave 10 Downing Street on 28 October 2019</div></div></div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 11:54:51 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1178657673.jpg?itok=RWdxaPd2","linkMd5":"042447d58f2ccc481e24817a07142819","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn84@2020_4/2020/09/05/09-02-08-797_57d51799ee96fc1d.webp","destWidth":790,"destHeight":350,"sourceBytes":34849,"destBytes":18424,"author":"Phil Whitaker","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1178657673.jpg?itok=RWdxaPd2":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn84@2020_4/2020/09/05/09-02-08-797_57d51799ee96fc1d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528294},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"Personal Story: My failed music career","link":"https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/music-theatre/2020/09/personal-story-my-failed-music-career","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-field-subheadline field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"> <p>\n\tI started playing the piano aged four, and was told I had a talent.

I sat in the entrance hall of the Guildhall School of Music &amp; Drama for an hour before I was sent to warm up on the piano, my programme of Beethoven, Chopin, Rachmaninov, Gershwin and Glass whirling around my mind.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe two members of the panel were positioned at the top of a bank of seating in an otherwise empty lecture theatre, except for the Steinway on the lowered stage. When I played, chaos reigned. I tend to forget details of performances, but I know there were stumbles, shaking hands, an adjustment of the stool. At one point – though I couldn’t say for sure – I recall a piece coming completely unstuck.</p>\n<p>\n\tMy suspicions of failure were fortified afterwards, when I perched awkwardly on a chair the row below the panel for an “interview” and the conversation lasted less than five minutes. A few days later, I received my rejection – the final result of my auditions to study for a master’s in performance, on the piano, at a conservatoire. I hadn’t got into the Royal College or Royal Academy of Music, but I had one offer from the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester. In the days that followed, I knew I had made up my mind. I wouldn’t be going. I would give up my pursuit of a career in music.</p>\n<p>\n\tI started playing the piano aged four, and was told I had a talent. I was fortunate to have supportive parents and access to instruments and lessons. Music spoke to me in a way that nothing else did, and I felt the feeling was mutual. I discovered that I had perfect pitch. This made me feel deeply and personally connected to the nuances of even the most brash pop, which I listened to as a teenager between obscure CDs (Pat Metheny, Moondog, Imogen Heap) borrowed from my dad, and whatever late Romantic symphony we were playing in youth orchestra.</p>\n<p>\n\tThough I continued my weekly piano lessons until I left home at 18, and took up the cello and saxophone along the way, I was always less confident in my ability to play before others. I was nervous and too embarrassed to express myself fully onstage. I reconciled this as part of my anxious temperament. It wasn’t helped, though, by always being underprepared. I had never done what one piano teacher told me I should: practise until you cannot play it wrong.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen I studied music at university I discovered that it was not, as it had been at school, mine for the taking. Others shared my passion – and were better at it. The talents of many of my contemporaries had been nurtured not just by loving parents and encouraging teachers but elite establishments (junior conservatoire, the National Youth Orchestra, BBC Young Musician).</p>\n<p>\n\tRather than trying to compete, I distinguished myself as someone who would rather write essays than play. In private, I was engulfed by jealousy. I worried that by retreating from the piano I was somehow upsetting my own fate. Equally, I was too scared of failing in front of my invariably successful peers to try.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn my lessons, I needed more and more reassurance. Rather than taking an interest in what I was playing, I just wanted to play it well. I asked my piano teacher at university, a professor from the Royal Academy, if it was worth me carrying on. “There is talent there,” he shrugged, “but it’ll take a lot of work.” When I graduated, I began having lessons with a master’s student at the Guildhall. In my first lesson I enquired anxiously if she thought I was good. “Yeah,” she said. “Yeah. But I mean” – she laughed, sympathetically – “you’re never going to be Horowitz.”</p>\n<p>\n\tIn early 2018, I was working as an administrator at the Royal Academy of Music, and interacted with students who were studying for performance degrees. I couldn’t let go of the idea that it could have been me. I decided to test the theory. I found a new teacher. I resolved to apply for master’s courses at prestigious conservatoires the following year. My piano teacher at university had suggested that to be as good as I wanted to be, I should start practising for two or three hours a day, at a minimum. I would do as he said, and see how good I really was.</p>\n<p>\n\tLearning a 45-minute programme of virtuosic music by memory is itself “a lot of work”. By my first audition in November, I was just about prepared, but I never felt completely comfortable. There were tricky passages I would dread, notes in the middle of chords I would bluff and hope nobody noticed. But in between attacks of nerves I felt a thrill, and a sense of harmony, when I managed to make the notes sparkle; when my mind, my hands and my ears were all in sync.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat I would do the practice and the auditions was never in doubt, but I remained unsure of what I was aiming for. Eventually I conceded that even if I went to Royal Northern, it was almost unthinkable that I would end up with a solo career. But nor did I want a solo career enough. Every step had felt difficult. I was tired. Sometimes the piano keys themselves seemed to turn on me, becoming too heavy for me to push down.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs children, we do not understand that the things we love do not belong only to us. Then, I was not prepared to relinquish music to anyone else’s ownership. Now, I have finally loosened my grip.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere is something freeing about rejection. Having an aptitude for something as magical as music had always filled me with a sense of responsibility, and suddenly it was out of my hands. The report from my audition at the Royal College specified that I was “clearly of insufficient standard”. I was playing at the highest level I had in my life, yet the panel still found that my performance lacked “depth”, “nuance”, “bravura” and “dramatic gesture”. I was stung, but the message finally became clear. I wasn’t cut out for this. And though there was loss there, what’s more profound – and hopeful – is that nothing had really changed. </p>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n          Adam Voorhes/gallery stock      \n\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 14:08:32 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_730/public/Longreads_2020/09/2020_36_emily_bootle.jpg?itok=a6Ke9l5F","linkMd5":"2aafd22f11423e526ce57251522baa58","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn40@2020_2/2020/09/05/09-02-09-865_d538dcc527b3f397.webp","destWidth":730,"destHeight":520,"sourceBytes":29462,"destBytes":16130,"author":"Emily Bootle","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_730/public/Longreads_2020/09/2020_36_emily_bootle.jpg?itok=a6Ke9l5F":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn40@2020_2/2020/09/05/09-02-09-865_d538dcc527b3f397.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528292},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"Podcast: Fallout in Lebanon","link":"https://www.newstatesman.com/2020/09/podcast-fallout-lebanon","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-field-subheadline field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"> <p>\n\tThe New Statesman’s World Review podcast with Jeremy Cliffe and Emily Tamkin.</p>\n </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><noscript class=\"adaptive-image\" data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=\"300 768 1024\" data-adaptive-image-300-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;300&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1227973172_1_.jpg?itok=DHMqYikK&amp;amp;c=04c74a76bee63d9fc171a5152bc3c04a&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-768-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;768&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1227973172_1_.jpg?itok=DHMqYikK&amp;amp;c=04c74a76bee63d9fc171a5152bc3c04a&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-1024-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;1024&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1227973172_1_.jpg?itok=DHMqYikK&amp;amp;c=04c74a76bee63d9fc171a5152bc3c04a&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-max-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;max&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1227973172_1_.jpg?itok=DHMqYikK&amp;amp;c=04c74a76bee63d9fc171a5152bc3c04a&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\"><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1227973172_1_.jpg?itok=Z7YcGN5S\" alt=\"\" /></noscript>\n</div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\" property=\"content:encoded\"> <p>\n\tOn this week's episode of World Review from the New Statesman, Jeremy Cliffe in Berlin and Emily Tamkin in Washington DC are joined, from Erbil, by Lizzie Porter.

I hope to cut through the data noise and deliver some clear impressions of what the UK thinks about key issues, and the implications for Britain's leaders. This week, we start with the Labour Party.</p>\n<h3>\n\t1. More Brits now view Labour as competent and capable</h3>\n<p>\n\tThere's little question that Keir Starmer has impressed as a formidable leader of the opposition. Though his party is still behind in the polls, it does appear that slowly but surely, perceptions of the Labour Party are beginning to change.</p>\n<p>\n\tPolling from <a href=\"https://www.jlpartners.co.uk/polling-results\">JL Partners</a> reports an increasing number of Britons now view Labour as competent and capable, with the number perceiving it to be divided falling from 59 per cent in January to 38 per cent in August.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Conservatives, by contrast, have seen a fall in perceived competence and an increase in perceptions of being out of touch.</p>\n<link href=\"https://nsmg-projects-public.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/common/chart.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" />\n<div class=\"nsmg-chart\">\n<div class=\"nsmg-h3\">\n\t\tLabour is seen as more united since January</div>\n<div class=\"nsmg-h4\">\n\t\tShare of voters who think [x] statement applies best to which party</div>\n<iframe aria-label=\"Arrow Plot\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"219\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-1GA2P\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/1GA2P/1/\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;\" title=\"JL partners polling on party perceptions\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n<!--//--><![CDATA[// ><!--\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}}))}();\n\n//--><!]]>\n</script></div>\n<h3>\n\t2. Labour would win on the cost of living, but lose on the economy</h3>\n<p>\n\tAnother intriguing find from the JL Partners survey is that Labour performs well on the cost of living, but poorly on the economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tThese messages may appear contradictory, but they aren’t. On a macro-level – on the financial affairs of the country at large – the Tories are perceived as competent. On a micro-level – when it comes to household finances and day-to-day spending – Labour does better.</p>\n<link href=\"https://nsmg-projects-public.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/common/chart.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" />\n<div class=\"nsmg-chart\">\n<div class=\"nsmg-h3\">\n\t\tLabour's trusted with the cost of living, but not the economy</div>\n<div class=\"nsmg-h4\">\n\t\tShare of voters who think which party is best to deal with [x] issue</div>\n<iframe aria-label=\"Stacked Bars\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"316\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-fYCP3\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/fYCP3/1/\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;\" title=\"JL partners competence on issues\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n<!--//--><![CDATA[// ><!--\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}}))}();\n\n//--><!]]>\n</script></div>\n<p>\n\tThis was something the Conservatives exploited to great effect in 2015, doubling down on their macroeconomic message of steadying the ship in the face of “chaos with Ed Miliband”. The cost of living crisis wasn’t as great a pull: issues such as immigration and the SNP carried greater weight with English and Welsh voters during the campaign.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe poll covers other policy areas which could be seen as problematic for Keir Starmer. Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party is perceived to be almost as competent on immigration as Labour, for example. However, this is simply an expression of a long-term problem for Western social democratic and left-wing movements in winning support for their views on the issue; Starmer's own leadership has had little effect on this trend so far.</p>\n<h3>\n\t3. Conservative approval has been hit by A-levels and Covid-19</h3>\n<p>\n\tNew <a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-mori/en-uk/public-favourability-towards-johnson-and-conservatives-dips-after-challenging-fortnight-government\">Ipsos MORI</a> polling surveyed this week adds more weight to the idea that the British public is falling out of love with both the Conservative Party and the Prime Minister.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe number of Brits with a favourable view of Boris Johnson dropped to 29 per cent in August, a fall of 12 points since July.</p>\n<p>\n\tPublic favourability towards the Tories was also hit hard. Only 28 per cent of voters now have a favourable view of the governing party – while 29 per cent are positive about Labour.</p>\n<link href=\"https://nsmg-projects-public.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/common/chart.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" />\n<div class=\"nsmg-chart\">\n<div class=\"nsmg-h3\">\n\t\tTories see a drop in favourability since April</div>\n<div class=\"nsmg-h4\">\n\t\tShare of voters with a positive/negative view of the Conservatives, Nov 2019 to Aug 2020</div>\n<iframe aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"400\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-AXOQW\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/AXOQW/1/\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;\" title=\"Ipsos MORI Con favourability\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n<!--//--><![CDATA[// ><!--\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}}))}();\n\n//--><!]]>\n</script></div>\n<p>\n\tA notable trend for Labour since Starmer became leader has been a steady drop in the number of voters with an unfavourable opinion about the party. In the run-up to the 2019 election, nearly half of Brits viewed Labour negatively. That has now fallen to 39 per cent.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe number of voters viewing Labour positively, however, hasn’t risen at the same rate. This suggests Starmer has succeeded in detoxifying his party, but not necessarily endearing it to the wider British public – a crucial second step.</p>\n<link href=\"https://nsmg-projects-public.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/common/chart.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" />\n<div class=\"nsmg-chart\">\n<div class=\"nsmg-h3\">\n\t\tHas Keir Starmer detoxified the Labour Party?</div>\n<div class=\"nsmg-h4\">\n\t\tSince Keir Starmer's election as Labour leader, the number of Brits with a negative view of the party has fallen to a record low</div>\n<iframe aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"400\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-meJBK\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/meJBK/1/\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;\" title=\"Ipsos MORI Con favourability (Copy)\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n<!--//--><![CDATA[// ><!--\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}}))}();\n\n//--><!]]>\n</script></div>\n<p>\n\tKeiran Pedley of Ipsos MORI says: “There is work to do for Labour to get voters to actively make the jump in terms of supporting them, as evidenced by stubborn Conservative leads in voting intention polls.</p>\n<p>\n\t“On the Conservative side, our numbers show the reputation of the party taking a hit since July but this could well be a temporary thing. Given that they still lead in voting intention polls, it would be wise to reserve judgement on whether this is part of a more lasting trend until we see more data.”</p>\n<h3>\n\t4. The Conservatives still enjoy a lead over Labour</h3>\n<p>\n\tDespite growing unpopularity over their perceived poor handling of both the Covid-19 crisis and the A-level results debacle, the Tories have yet to fall behind on voting intentions.</p>\n<p>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.opinium.com/resource-center/public-opinion-on-coronavirus-26th-august/\">Last week's Opinium</a> poll for the <em>Observer</em> has Labour and the Conservatives neck and neck, the first voting intention since July 2019 failed to show anything other than a Conservative lead.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe latest from the Britain Elects poll tracker, which accounts for all voting intentions, continues to give the Tories a lead of five points.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt the height of the Covid crisis in April, the Tories were leading Labour by around 20 points, and they won the 2019 General Election with a lead of 11 points.</p>\n<link href=\"https://nsmg-projects-public.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/common/chart.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" />\n<div class=\"nsmg-chart\">\n<div class=\"nsmg-h3\">\n\t\tBritain Elects poll tracker</div>\n<div class=\"nsmg-h4\">\n\t\tWeighted poll tracker of the latest UK/GB-wide Westminster voting intentions</div>\n<iframe aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"355\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-yiZxV\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/yiZxV/10/\" style=\"width: 0;

They are less likely to call it the year of the great cacophony over mask wearing. But no other event has more acutely revealed the fractured state of public culture in the early 21st-century US.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn a culture of hyper-polarised political identities, Americans now wear their politics on their faces. Democrats make a public display of mask wearing; Donald Trump’s most loyal supporters rail against mask ordinances as an invasion of their basic freedoms. Young people party without masks as if they were immune to the future. Left-wing radicals wear masks as badges of a newly militant anarchism. Epidemiologists plead for mask wearing as a public health necessity. Conservative pundits such as Rush Limbaugh dismiss the Covid emergency as a plot to topple the president.  </p>\n<p>\n\tAs cultural authority fragments, medical truth is what any individual chooses to make of it. You can click on any conclusion you desire about the pros and cons of mask wearing. Panaceas promising protection against Covid-19 are on sale in virtually every corner of the internet. Even mask wearing Americans cannot fully escape the language of choice. When asked why they wear masks, they tend to say they do so to protect themselves and their families, only secondly as a duty to others or as a contribution to the social good.  </p>\n<p>\n\tForeign pundits are quick to interpret these signs as evidence of timeless American hyper-individualism. But American political culture has never been timeless. What we are witnessing now is the culmination of half a century’s erosion of the language of the “social” in American public life.</p>\n<p>\n\tAmerican political culture during the Depression and Cold War years was full of strong words for the common good and public obligations, from the solidarity language of the New Deal to the mass society theories of the 1950s.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the “age of fracture” that followed, the emphasis on social relations was overtaken by more fragmented ways of understanding selves and society. Claims of individual rights grew stronger, notions of identity grew more individual and fluid, theoriesof personhood grew more transactional, and the metaphor of “the market” saturated everyday speech. Choice became the new age’s synonym for “freedom”.  </p>\n<p>\n\tA confluence of forces helped fracture the mid-century language of the social. Most important was the dramatic expansion of rights talk, as black Americans, women, immigrants, gay people and others seized on rights as legal and rhetorical tools for resisting oppressive laws and social norms.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut rights talk quickly spun off in a dizzying number of other directions. Conservatives, once the arch-defenders of custom and social order, found new traction in the “rights and choice”-infused language of libertarianism. A new generation of microeconomists, following Gary Becker, set about explaining how much of human behaviour could be understood as outcomes of choice and preference satisfaction. Psychologists left behind mid 20th-century studies of the socially structured roots of personality to prioritise micro-studies of individual subjects.</p>\n<p>\n\tSociety did not disappear in any of these characterisations of the human condition, but it became thinner and less authoritative in its dictates.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn this intellectual soil, neoliberal economic policies flourished. Tax-cutting was heralded not simply for its macroeconomic effects but for freeing up citizens’ choices over their money. Privatisation schemes flourished. Markets were constructed in public schooling, healthcare, the prison system and other public services. In the criminal justice realm, bargaining largely replaced trials not only on grounds of economy, but on the rationale that, by its very nature, bargaining satisfied more wants than adversarial justice. The social responsibility of corporations was pared down to its minima; in neoliberal America, corporations have no legal obligations to their workers or communities, only to the shareholders who putatively own them.  </p>\n<p>\n\tAnd yet, the waning of the social was not only a boon for more aggressive, entrepreneurial capitalism. It expanded possibilities for people and groups that had been socially subordinated before. It amplified rights of dissent.  </p>\n<p>\n\t“Society” had been a partial fiction all along, and to many Americans it had been an oppressive one. To pit rights against rights, expertise against expertise, opened new spaces for non-conforming identities. Mass political actions remained possible. Political activists mobilised in women’s marches, in the Seattle WTO protests in 1999, and in Black Lives Matter demonstrations.</p>\n<p>\n\tStill, mass movements are now easier to initiate than to sustain against the forces of choice and political identities. Whether the let-every-affinity-group-do-its-own-thing compromises being made on the streets of Seattle, Portland and elsewhere are adequate to the injustices those citizens rally against remains to be seen.  </p>\n<p>\n\tThe furore over mask wearing has brought into relief all these cultural transformations.  Where individual choice dominates social imaginations, one’s obligations to others cannot but be a fraught point of contention.</p>\n<p>\n\tYet there are also signs that the age of fracture may have begun to run its course. Within the past year, the structures of racism, the institutions of carceral justice and the engines of economic inequality have come dramatically to the front of the Democratic Party agenda. On the political right, Trump’s relish for national greatness and concentrated executive power have complicated the libertarian agenda of the Tea Party.  </p>\n<p>\n\tThese visions of solidarity are profoundly oppositional. Trump conjures up a solidarity of the aggrieved, the fearful and the angry: a movement massed together by its furious negations. By contrast, the 2020 Democratic Party convention broached terms that have not been heard in US politics for a long time: love, national purpose, even empathy. This year will be the nation’s first test of a post-fracture politics. The stakes could not be higher. </p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Daniel T Rodgers’ “Age of Fracture” (Harvard) won the Bancroft Prize in 2012</em></p>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n          Getty      \n\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 16:25:13 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1210404344.jpg?itok=jWtCGysu","linkMd5":"9e2d42d76405dbbbb6129a274c1bc2ad","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn79@2020_4/2020/09/05/09-02-08-829_c3fc7589ea408de8.webp","destWidth":790,"destHeight":350,"sourceBytes":45817,"destBytes":27996,"author":"Anonymous","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1210404344.jpg?itok=jWtCGysu":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn79@2020_4/2020/09/05/09-02-08-829_c3fc7589ea408de8.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528288},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"To understand Germany&#039;s successes, we must concentrate less on Angela Merkel","link":"https://www.newstatesman.com/international/places/2020/09/understand-germanys-successes-we-must-concentrate-less-angela-merkel","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-field-subheadline field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"> <p>\n\tThe German model is a package deal, whose transmission to Britain would require a decades-long institutional overhaul. </p>\n </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><noscript class=\"adaptive-image\" data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=\"300 768 1024\" data-adaptive-image-300-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;300&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-454290050.jpg?itok=8WNk63kM&amp;amp;c=f955c776945611320db8492e5cddd970&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-768-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;768&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-454290050.jpg?itok=8WNk63kM&amp;amp;c=f955c776945611320db8492e5cddd970&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-1024-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;1024&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-454290050.jpg?itok=8WNk63kM&amp;amp;c=f955c776945611320db8492e5cddd970&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-max-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;max&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-454290050.jpg?itok=8WNk63kM&amp;amp;c=f955c776945611320db8492e5cddd970&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\"><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-454290050.jpg?itok=7gPgZU_d\" alt=\"\" /></noscript>\n</div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\" property=\"content:encoded\"> <p style=\"clear: both;\">\n\tAngela Merkel is riding high. Not just in Germany – where she approaches her final year as chancellor with a 71 per cent approval rating – but internationally, too. Her calm and scientific leadership is widely associated with Germany’s relatively low Covid-19 infection and death rates. The fifth anniversary of her assertion, “<em>Wir schaffen das</em>” (“We’ll manage this”), made at the peak of the refugee crisis, has turned the spotlight on the country’s better-than-expected progress towards integrating the 1.2 million migrants who entered Germany in 2015 and 2016. And in Britain a new book, <em>Why The Germans Do It Better</em> by John Kampfner, offers a nuanced but compelling account of the manifold virtues – a serious political system, successful export industries, social cohesion – of Merkel’s Germany.</p>\n<p>\n\tA former editor of the <em>New Statesman </em>who knows the country well, Kampfner marshals a convincing argument that “other countries would be foolish to ignore Germany’s emotional maturity and solidity”. It is hard to read those terms – maturity and solidity – and not automatically think of the chancellor and the obvious contrast between her and the cynical circus acts leading Britain and the US. She is the anti-Johnson, the anti-Trump, and thus inspires a particular sort of fascination in observers in those countries.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is a strength of Kampfner’s book that it resists over-Merkelising its story of today’s Germany, instead mining deeper social, cultural and political seams. Almost 15 years into her chancellorship, Merkel is familiar. She is distinctive. Many abroad have opinions about her, positive and negative. And so it is always tempting to describe the country’s strengths and weaknesses with reference to her character and leadership. That so many do helps to explain why Germany remains poorly understood overseas, particularly in precisely the English-speaking countries that are so intrigued by Merkel.</p>\n<p>\n\tThree explanations for this stand out. The first is that Merkel belongs firmly within a Christian democrat tradition that is underdeveloped in Britain and the US. Its Christian social ethics, its emphasis on stability and consensus, its peculiar synthesis of liberalism and conservatism, render it similar to but also clearly distinct from those countries’ leading political traditions. The result is a long history of confusion about Merkel’s politics, leading to her being characterised variously – approvingly and critically – as a German Thatcher, a nationalist, a radical, a conservative and a die-hard liberal. She is none of those things; she’s a Christian democrat, and if you do not understand Christian democracy you will struggle to understand today’s Germany through the prism of her chancellorship.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe second reason is that viewing the Merkel era in isolation from the broader sweep of history obscures important shifts and notes of continuity that define the country she leads. The period from reunification in 1990 to Merkel’s arrival in the chancellery in 2005 was turbulent and transformative, marked by fraught debates about Germany’s society, economy and role in the world. The red-green governments of her predecessor Gerhard Schröder had launched the country’s first post-1945 foreign military mission, overhauled its ethnically restrictive naturalisation laws, begun an overhaul of conservative family policies and introduced divisive measures to cut unemployment.</p>\n<p>\n\tMerkel’s historical role, in which she has acquitted herself well, has been to strike a balance between progress and reassurance in bedding in many of those changes. Her refugee gambit, for example, belongs to a long-term story of Germany’s evolution into a “migration country”.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe third reason is that to focus on Merkel is to attribute too much of Germany’s social, economic and political architecture to decisions that she has made. Even setting aside the fact that the German chancellor lacks the centralised, unilateral power of a majority-wielding British prime minister, let alone a French president, it is truer to say that Merkel’s chancellorship is a product of that architecture than vice versa.</p>\n<p>\n\tGermany’s strengths are not just deep-rooted but mutually reinforcing. Consensus-based politics lends itself to long-termism in government and industry. That in turn supports investment in applied research and vocational training, which strengthen and benefit from workplace co-determination, which is linked to the country’s dense networks of civic organisations, and so forth. The relative successes of “<em>Wir schaffen das</em>” and of Germany’s pandemic response are primarily tales not of Merkel deftly pulling levers in the chancellery but of the complementary strengths of the German social, political and economic system. (The disadvantages of that system, from over-cosy corporatist practices to the country’s underdeveloped services and digital industries, are likewise inextricable from the whole.)</p>\n<p>\n\tThat final reason poses a particular challenge for those, like me, who agree with Kampfner’s argument that there is much to envy about Germany. Because the lesson would be much simpler were that story mostly one of Merkel’s leadership: ditch the clowns and elect a serious leader, and we too can proceed through the shopping list of German successes in our own country. But to look beyond Merkel is to recognise that the mature German model is a package deal whose transmission to, say, Britain would require a decades-long project of institutional overhaul. And that is without getting into its culturally rooted foundations.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is easy to look across at Germany’s wry, sensible and yet, to many English speakers, unfathomable chancellor and ask: why can’t we be more like them? The complicated answer begins with recognising that “they” are far more than just Merkel. </p>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n          Getty      \n\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 11:25:37 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-454290050.jpg?itok=7gPgZU_d","linkMd5":"258545661a6b7c105641460d927c74be","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn84@2020_3/2020/09/05/09-02-09-876_079322c4b2a78750.webp","destWidth":790,"destHeight":350,"sourceBytes":23478,"destBytes":11508,"author":"Jeremy Cliffe","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-454290050.jpg?itok=7gPgZU_d":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn84@2020_3/2020/09/05/09-02-09-876_079322c4b2a78750.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528294},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"The coming avalanche: why the pandemic has shaken the book world ","link":"https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/observations/2020/08/coming-avalanche-why-pandemic-has-shaken-book-world","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-field-subheadline field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"> <p>\n\tThis year, 210 titles were held back until September, causing chaos for publicity teams and bookshops, and leaving authors disappointed. </p>\n </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><noscript class=\"adaptive-image\" data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=\"300 768 1024\" data-adaptive-image-300-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;300&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/08/2020_35_obs_trends.jpg?itok=VxlIWOfr&amp;amp;c=3d436dd522345efb0bc04876d453f2a4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-768-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;768&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/08/2020_35_obs_trends.jpg?itok=VxlIWOfr&amp;amp;c=3d436dd522345efb0bc04876d453f2a4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-1024-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;1024&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/08/2020_35_obs_trends.jpg?itok=VxlIWOfr&amp;amp;c=3d436dd522345efb0bc04876d453f2a4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-max-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;max&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/08/2020_35_obs_trends.jpg?itok=VxlIWOfr&amp;amp;c=3d436dd522345efb0bc04876d453f2a4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\"><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/08/2020_35_obs_trends.jpg?itok=OTABqAB9\" alt=\"\" /></noscript>\n</div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\" property=\"content:encoded\"> <p style=\"clear: both;\">\n\tOn Thursday 3 September, the book world will see an avalanche of new titles. The autumn is always a busy time of year in bookselling, as publishers prepare for Christmas. But this year, with a significant number of books delayed from late spring and early summer due to the pandemic, there will be more new titles hitting shelves than ever before.</p>\n<p>\n\tIncluding academic and professional books, 590 hardbacks will be released on 3 September, a 28 per cent increase on the number published on the first Thursday of September 2019. This year, 210 titles were held back until September after the <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/2020/05/arts-after-coronavirus\">pandemic forced bookshops to close</a>, wreaking havoc for publicity and sales teams, causing an administrative nightmare for the stores and leaving authors disappointed.</p>\n<p>\n\tThese problems will affect debut authors and independent publishers and bookshops the most. Lesser-known titles will be competing with celebrity memoirs from Ant and Dec and Will Young, Richard Osman’s first foray into crime fiction and the latest novels by <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/books/2017/09/martin-amis-s-rub-time-shows-it-s-possible-be-foolish-and-brilliant\">Martin Amis</a> and <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/books/2015/09/margaret-drabble-what-kind-feminist-elena-ferrante\">Elena Ferrante</a>.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I know what I’m up against,” Jac Shreeves-Lee told me over the phone. Her debut collection of short stories, <em><a href=\"https://www.fairlightbooks.co.uk/broadwater/\">Broadwater</a>,</em> will be published by Fairlight Books on 3 September. “I am aware of the high volume of books coming out at the same time and I’m also aware that the big guns – Penguin, Wiley, Pan Macmillan – command more shelf space and get more attention than books from independent publishers. <em>Broadwater</em> might get buried.”</p>\n<p>\n\tSam McDowell, co-founder of Edinburgh-based Charco Press, has been anticipating the date since the start of lockdown. Charco, which specialises in English translations of contemporary Latin American literature, will publish <em><a href=\"https://charcopress.com/bookstore/dead-girls\">Dead Girls</a> </em>by Selva Almada on 3 September. Unlike many others, the book was always due to come out then to coincide with its publication in the US. “Maybe we were one of the first to have a book lined up for 3 September, and now everybody else has joined the party,” McDowell said.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe volume of upcoming books means “there’s less oxygen out there”, said McDowell, who is concerned <em>Dead Girls </em>will “not get the profile it deserves”. Small presses such as Charco rely on booksellers who often read advance copies and hand sell their favourite titles to customers. “This is why it’s a tricky situation: there’s only a limited amount of time and attention from booksellers, and a limited amount of space for them to display the books.”</p>\n<p>\n\tSpace is at a premium at <a href=\"https://mostly-books.co.uk/\">Mostly Books</a> in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, where shop owner and manager Sarah Dennis is working out how to stock all these books. “We’re going to have our work cut out,” she said. She pointed out that books sell best when laid flat on tables or facing out on shelves, but display space is already limited due to new social distancing measures in the shop.</p>\n<p>\n\tDaunt Books Publishing, founded in 2010, benefits from having its own chain of shops which prioritise Daunt books in displays, said Željka Marošević, a Daunt editor who will publish <a href=\"https://dauntbookspublishing.co.uk/book/indelicacy/\"><em>Indelicacy</em></a>, the debut novel from Amina Cain, on 3 September. She recognises the “bumper crop” of books which will be competing with <em>Indelicacy</em>, but trusts the novel “will still find its readers”.</p>\n<p>\n\tBesides, she said, the publishing industry is luckier than the live events sector, which has to delay its work indefinitely. “Isolation is built into the concept of books, and it doesn’t matter if you miss the publication date, the book will still be waiting for you.” </p>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n          Phanie / Alamy      \n\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 15:43:53 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/08/2020_35_obs_trends.jpg?itok=OTABqAB9","linkMd5":"e01ba5d148f1a347b6cc260683992551","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn11@2020_6/2020/09/05/09-02-08-807_68d63be3960daae1.webp","destWidth":790,"destHeight":350,"sourceBytes":74977,"destBytes":46434,"author":"Ellen Peirson-Hagger","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/08/2020_35_obs_trends.jpg?itok=OTABqAB9":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn11@2020_6/2020/09/05/09-02-08-807_68d63be3960daae1.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528309},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"Samanta Schweblin’s Little Eyes: strange and poignant ","link":"https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/fiction/2020/09/samanta-schweblin-s-little-eyes-strange-and-poignant","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-field-subheadline field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"> <p>\n\t<em>Little Eyes, </em>a series of vignettes about “kentukis” (part Furby, part hacked webcam), sits somewhere between a novel and a series of linked short stories.</p>\n </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><noscript class=\"adaptive-image\" data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=\"300 768 1024\" data-adaptive-image-300-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;300&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-56704099.jpg?itok=Yftx3uCk&amp;amp;c=44f1dfa6247d9c89108549b03dd5a125&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-768-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;768&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-56704099.jpg?itok=Yftx3uCk&amp;amp;c=44f1dfa6247d9c89108549b03dd5a125&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-1024-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;1024&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-56704099.jpg?itok=Yftx3uCk&amp;amp;c=44f1dfa6247d9c89108549b03dd5a125&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-max-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;max&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-56704099.jpg?itok=Yftx3uCk&amp;amp;c=44f1dfa6247d9c89108549b03dd5a125&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\"><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-56704099.jpg?itok=Io9Zfxgc\" alt=\"\" /></noscript>\n</div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\" property=\"content:encoded\"> <p>\n\tSamanta Schweblin, the Argentinian author of four story collections and the novel <em>Fever Dream</em>, is a master of the unsettling. In <em>Fever Dream</em> and <em>Mouthful of Birds</em>, the first two of her works to have been translated into English, strange transformations, vanishings and violence take place in spare and unspecified settings. A teenage girl starts eating live songbirds, crunching their bones and letting the blood drip down her chin. Hundreds of grooms abandon their brides by a road in the middle of the night, each man disappearing alone into the darkness. A woman discovers that a malevolent spirit has taken over the body of her young son. The events of these earlier works hover between the surreal and the supernatural, with neither the reader nor their characters ever fully knowing what is happening or why. By contrast, the imaginary technology at the heart of <em>Little Eyes</em> feels all too real, and Schweblin persuasively elaborates its operations and implications.</p>\n<p>\n\tPart Furby, part hacked webcam, a kentuki is a small artificial animal – a crow, rabbit, a panda – on wheels. Implanted in the kentuki is a camera that sees through the animal’s eyes. You can buy a kentuki, or you can buy a code that connects your tablet or computer to the camera inside one. The connection is randomly generated; when you buy a kentuki you have no idea who will end up looking through the camera at your home, your life, your body. Kentuki owners are “keepers”, while those who look through the camera are “dwellers”. As a dweller, you can control “your” kentuki, moving it around and making various purrs, squeaks and growls. And to a certain extent, the keeper can control the dweller’s kentuki experience by, for example, shutting the kentuki in a cupboard, taking it on a trip, or lifting it up to look out a window. Either party can end the connection at any time, and such an ending is permanent.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Little Eyes </em>is somewhere between a novel and a series of linked short stories. Each chapter is set in, and takes its title from, a location (Oaxaca, Zagreb, Antigua, Vancouver, and so on) inhabited either by a kentuki keeper or a dweller. The narrative moves back and forth between these locations, returning to each one only as long as the connection there between keeper and dweller is maintained. This means that some places we only see once (Vancouver, where a keeper quickly “kills” a kentuki controlled by a cruel dweller) whereas others we visit several times, watching the relationship between keeper, dweller and kentuki develop over weeks or months. It’s a clever structure, allowing Schweblin to investigate all the things that a kentuki might be – is it a pet? a spy? a co-parent, a money-spinner, an alter ego? – as well the various thrills and dangers that such a technology might offer.</p>\n<p>\n\tWith one exception: Schweblin is notably uninterested in corporate surveillance. We learn nothing about the company that makes kentukis, and none of the characters wonder or care how customers’ information is being gathered, stored or sold. Instead, <em>Little Eyes</em> uses technology to consider individuals’ connections to one another, to their own bodies and to their possessions.</p>\n<p>\n\tSchweblin’s language is plain, verging on the colloquial, allowing the narrator to stay close to the perspectives of the keepers and dwellers. Generally, the chapters focusing on the latter are more successful, conveying the weirdness and poignancy of existing in two bodies at once. A lonely child connected to a dragon kentuki starts to experience his life outside the kentuki as unreal: he is “no longer a boy with a dragon, he was a dragon with a boy inside him”. An elderly widow, given a kentuki connection by her son, derives pleasure from seeing the rabbit she inhabits fondled by its keeper.</p>\n<p>\n\tAlmost all the keepers and dwellers that maintain the kentuki connection longer than a day or two are unhappy in some way. The book’s structure, which demands that every connection end, means that the solace these characters find in their kentukis cannot be permanent, but Schweblin leaves us to decide for ourselves whether or not impermanence renders such solace worthless. And while kentukis offer humans new ways of abandoning and being abandoned, mistreating and being mistreated, <em>Little Eyes</em> doesn’t suggest that these ways are ­necessarily worse than the old ones.</p>\n<p>\n\tSchweblin’s skipping around between characters and places means that her portrayal of technology’s capabilities is broad rather than deep. While this lack of depth may not be to every reader’s taste, the ­novel’s breadth provides much of its pleasure, allowing an inventiveness that balances the bleakness of its characters’ lives. </p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Little Eyes </strong><br />\n\tSamanta Schweblin, trs Megan McDowell<br />\n\t<em>Oneworld, 256pp, £14.99</em></p>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n          Getty      \n\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 16:41:36 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-56704099.jpg?itok=Io9Zfxgc","linkMd5":"6662d46f2821544f04cf9cc56e0bceb2","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn26@2020_3/2020/09/05/09-02-11-191_3d459daadf8be33e.webp","destWidth":790,"destHeight":350,"sourceBytes":21814,"destBytes":10620,"author":"Hannah Rosefield","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-56704099.jpg?itok=Io9Zfxgc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn26@2020_3/2020/09/05/09-02-11-191_3d459daadf8be33e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528285},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"What we learned from Boris Johnson&#039;s chaotic return to PMQs ","link":"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2020/09/what-we-learned-boris-johnsons-chaotic-return-pmqs","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-field-subheadline field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"> <p>\n\tThe Prime Minister is panicking after a summer of U-turns.</p>\n </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><noscript class=\"adaptive-image\" data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=\"300 768 1024\" data-adaptive-image-300-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;300&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1228293785.jpg?itok=YiwCSUUx&amp;amp;c=b3c25f2100a36ad4cf98c2747f6f055d&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-768-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;768&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1228293785.jpg?itok=YiwCSUUx&amp;amp;c=b3c25f2100a36ad4cf98c2747f6f055d&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-1024-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;1024&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1228293785.jpg?itok=YiwCSUUx&amp;amp;c=b3c25f2100a36ad4cf98c2747f6f055d&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-max-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;max&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1228293785.jpg?itok=YiwCSUUx&amp;amp;c=b3c25f2100a36ad4cf98c2747f6f055d&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\"><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1228293785.jpg?itok=R7o2bQU5\" alt=\"\" /></noscript>\n</div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\" property=\"content:encoded\"> <h4 dir=\"ltr\">\n\tThe Prime Minister is panicking</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-6cff96f7-7fff-1a1e-e010-97bc1efbbc3b\">It was the first exchange between Boris Johnson and Keir Starmer of the new parliamentary term, and it was quite an extraordinary event. After a summer of U-turns, Keir Starmer put to the Prime Minister a series of comments from his own Conservative backbenchers, decrying the chaos of the past few months. In response, Johnson simply panicked. He abandoned any semblance of engagement with the Labour leader's question to instead hurl a slew of unrelated accusations: that Starmer had supported remaining in the EU and an \"IRA-condoning politician\" in serving under the last Labour leader.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-6cff96f7-7fff-1a1e-e010-97bc1efbbc3b\">It is commonplace for a Prime Minister to pivot away from a question towards more comfortable attack lines. It is rare, however, to do so with so little skill that the Speaker intervenes to request that the PM “try and answer the question that’s being put”. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-6cff96f7-7fff-1a1e-e010-97bc1efbbc3b\">What is more remarkable is that Johnson, in a panic, made a comment so provocative it derailed the rest of the exchange, as MPs filled the chamber with shouts of “withdraw!”. Starmer himself, appearing angry, demanded that Johnson withdraw his remarks, as the Labour leader cited his extensive work prosecuting terrorists in Northern Ireland as director of public prosecutions, and his track record of working with Northern Ireland’s police service. The Speaker Lindsay Hoyle also invited Johnson to withdraw his comments, which he declined to do.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-6cff96f7-7fff-1a1e-e010-97bc1efbbc3b\">Jeremy Corbyn’s past associations with the IRA were a useful attack line for Johnson during the leadership debates before the last election. That he used it here, against a different Labour leader, suggests a Prime Minister clinging to his last lines of defence; an impression only furthered by a clumsy attack on Starmer for being a Remainer and for U-turning on schools - one of the few attacks that has worked reasonably well for Johnson when facing Starmer so far. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-6cff96f7-7fff-1a1e-e010-97bc1efbbc3b\">After PMQs, Boris Johnson is meeting with MPs from the 2019 intake and, later today, with members of the 1922 committee of Conservative backbenchers. The Prime Minister’s performance gave some indication of what those meetings will reveal: a fractious parliamentary party with growing concerns after a summer of U-turns, and a leader visibly weakened.</span></p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span>There will be no extension to the furlough scheme</span></h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\tThe Labour leader, the SNP leader in Westminster Ian Blackford, and the opposition back benches spoke with one voice in the chamber today, as they raised concerns about the furlough scheme finishing at the end of October. But Johnson was resolute in saying the scheme cannot continue to support people in \"unemployment\" on \"substantial sums\" indefinitely. </p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">\n\tConservative backbenchers are pushing for a crackdown on asylum seekers and the BBC</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\tQuestions from Conservative backbenchers confirmed a theme that has developed over the summer: there is a strong will from parts of the Tory party to see stronger action taken against migrants and asylum seekers who try to enter the UK illegally, as there is over the licence fee and the BBC more generally. The government appears only too happy to oblige.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">\n\tThings are getting nasty between the Conservatives and the SNP</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\tIan Blackford was granted a rare point of order to accuse Downing Street of smearing him after the location of Johnson's holiday in the Scottish Highlands was revealed, with several papers naming Blackford as the origin of that leak. Johnson responded by quoting a tweet in which Blackford did appear to know the Prime Minister's location. There was clear hostility on both sides. With the Union possibly at stake in the Scottish parliamentary elections next May, it is a taste of things to come between the two parties. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<em>This article was amended after publication to clarify that Ian Blackford raised a point of order, not an urgent question. </em></p>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n          Getty      \n\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 12:44:54 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1228293785.jpg?itok=R7o2bQU5","linkMd5":"9138f3f1f2300c1efc0babc4bf0480f1","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn79@2020_2/2020/09/05/09-02-09-028_391d3977c6689364.webp","destWidth":790,"destHeight":350,"sourceBytes":39689,"destBytes":21222,"author":"Ailbhe Rea","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1228293785.jpg?itok=R7o2bQU5":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn79@2020_2/2020/09/05/09-02-09-028_391d3977c6689364.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528293},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"From the NS archive: What government in Japan?","link":"https://www.newstatesman.com/2020/09/ns-archive-what-government-japan","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-field-subheadline field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"> <p>\n\t1 September 1945: The day before the Second World War reached an official end, an unsigned editorial asked what lay ahead for the Allies and Japan.</p>\n </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><noscript class=\"adaptive-image\" data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=\"300 768\" data-adaptive-image-300-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot;

The day before, the magazine published an editorial that looked to the future. The path ahead was not clear: “Will Allied incapacity to supervise Japanese life in detail lead to a repetition of the mistakes made in Weimar Germany?” the anonymous writer asked. “Will prejudice, ignorance or conflicts of policy among the major Allies produce a situation where the militarists, exercising their authority underground, maintain the myth of civilian collapse, and quietly prepare long-term plans for another war?” The key would be a sympathetic understanding of Japanese society and history.</em></p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\">\n\t<span class=\"divider\">***</span></p>\n<p>\n\tThe Act of Surrender is the end of an epoch of Japanese history. The bid for mastery of the Far East has been broken, Japan forced to accept the piecemeal capitulation of her armies, and to withdraw into her four over-populated islands. So far so good. But what government are the Allies now planning for Japan? There is not among the Allies any adequate personnel for the immense task of administering Japan.</p>\n<p>\n\tObviously, the occupying armies will have, from the outset, to rely on the use of Japanese officials and institutions. The existing machinery of government will have to be taken over and adapted to the demands of whatever Control Commission the Allies see fit to establish. And, naturally, that path is beset with pitfalls. Will Allied incapacity to supervise Japanese life in detail lead to a repetition of the mistakes made in Weimar Germany? Will prejudice, ignorance or conflicts of policy among the major Allies produce a situation where the militarists, exercising their authority underground, maintain the myth of civilian collapse, and quietly prepare long-term plans for another war? These dangers can only be avoided if the Allies make a serious attempt to understand the social development of modern Japan and the underlying struggle for power between a number of competing groups.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Japanese Revolution of 1868 has never been completed. For the past seventy years, four major groups have been struggling with each other for control over the economic and political life of Japan. Assassination, intrigue, the use of economic power, religious and dynastic propaganda have all been employed as instruments in this struggle between the Imperial Household Ministry, the army, the cabinet and bureaucracy, and, lastly, big business.</p>\n<p>\n\tNominally, the Emperor is the source of authority, and each of the main groups has sought to exploit his prestige in support of its sectional aims. The Imperial Household Ministry, which consists of permanent appointed advisers to the Emperor and acts as a link between him and the cabinet, has always been most influential in times of national crisis. Its members have the preservation of the prerogatives of the Imperial Dynasty as their main concern, and, in the present negotiations, were doubtless the authors of the inquiry whether the Potsdam ultimatum endangered those prerogatives. Admiral Suzuki, who was prime minister from April of this year until the capitulation, was at one time a member of the Imperial Household Ministry in his capacity as Grand Chamberlain — a position from which he resigned after he was wounded by young army officers in 1936.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe violent interference of the army in Japanese politics is not checked or balanced by any provision of the Japanese Constitution or by political practice and convention. The increased ascendancy of the army groups dates from the period of the Manchurian invasion of 1931. In 1931, they killed the prime minister, Hamaguchi, because he signed the London Naval Treaty; in 1932, they murdered Prime Minister Inukai, thus putting an end to party government. In 1936, in their biggest coup, three members of the Imperial Household Ministry were killed or wounded. It was also the army which made Tojo – up till then, a relatively obscure figure – prime minister in November 1941. Most of the army officers are drawn from the ranks of peasant farmers. Their philosophy is based on vague ideas of social reform and a hatred of big business. They have the constitutional right of direct access to the emperor.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Japanese cabinet has little resemblance to the same body in a European democracy. Though supported by the local bureaucracy and national civil service, which provide most of the cabinet (for professional politicians are few in Japan), the Premier has never been powerful, except perhaps during the years just before the war. He acted chiefly as chief executive officer for the Imperial Household Ministry and informed the Japanese Diet of its requirements. His office grew in importance in recent years when Konoye – just appointed vice-premier – proved to be an adept at playing the army, the Imperial Household Ministry and big business off against each other. During the war, the job of the prime minister and his cabinet has been to satisfy the economic and man-power demands of the army. Until Suzuki took office last April, final decisions on strategy and policy always rested with the army. Suzuki’s appointment brought a change. On April 16th, a revealing Japanese broadcast announced that “in consideration of the current war situation, the prime minister will hereafter be given a seat in the Imperial Headquarters so that he may form an idea of the war situation.”</p>\n<p>\n\tRelations between the army and big business have been strained throughout the war. The controlling groups in the big monopolies have always feared that the army would overplay its hand and land them in disaster. They would have preferred a more subtle expansion. Their programme for the control of East Asia would have been economic imperialism, aided by rationalisation of industrial plant, lower wages, a deflated currency and subsidised exports. For them, a war against Britain and the United States before the Chinese “incident” was liquidated, was a folly which has only intensified their dislike of the army leaders. All the same, they did well out of the war while Japan conquered.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe manoeuvring of these groups has taken place with little reference to the Japanese people, who scarcely understand their constitutional institutions. The revolution of 1868, the constitutional reforms of 1889, and the award of adult manhood suffrage in 1925 were all granted from above. Democratic forms were merely external imitations of institutions which, in the West, men valued because they struggled for them. Similarly, when Fascism began to look powerful in Europe, the rulers of Japan copied the forms of the Fascist States. By 1932, party government had ceased to exist in Japan; by 1940, the parties themselves were wound up; and in January, 1941, Konoye’s Government tried to restrict the vote to the male heads of families and to ex-servicemen. This, however, ended in failure; the opposition came from those who regarded any alteration of the Constitution as sacrilege, since the document was held to partake of the emperor’s sacred character and so could be amended only on his initiative.</p>\n<p>\n\tBelief in the divinity of the emperor is, however, by no means universal in Japan. Apart from the big industrialists and the high army leaders, who regard the myth as a convenient propaganda line, most of those educated at Japanese universities in the period of relative freedom developed Liberal or Communist tendencies and were agnostic about the emperor. Industrialisation had the effect of also undermining the divinity myth among the workers. With the peasants, however, whose main concern is with their poverty, faith in the emperor’s sacred character is still strong.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is barely ninety years since the grandfather of the present emperor was rescued from obscurity by the revolting groups that used him as a national symbol to overthrow the Tokugawa clan — the <em>de facto</em> rulers of Japan since 1600. The Imperial dynasty had been living almost forgotten in penury for 250 years. It was at this time that the traditional Shinto doctrine was revived and Buddhism disestablished, as part of the revolutionary tactics designed to break the power of the Tokugawa clan and make the emperor the central figure in Japanese life. Clearly the doctrine of State Shinto must be discouraged by the Allies. They have, for instance, to decide the future of the Imperial dynasty. To find a substitute for monarchy in some form may not prove immediately possible. Even Susumo Okano, the Communist leader at present in Yenan, does not say more than that “the future of the throne must be decided by the people themselves. The militarists are using the emperor’s name to bolster up their own position.” What the Allies can certainly do is to see that the blame for the war, the capitulation and its consequences fall upon the emperor and his military advisers. Constitutionally, a useful change would be to see that the power of the future political head of the Japanese state is derived not from his Sun-born ancestors, but from the people.</p>\n<p>\n\tDemocractic government is not easy to foster in Japan. There is no political tradition of democracy and there are few voluntary associations in which Japanese citizens can have learnt even the rudiments of self-government or democratic procedure. As in Germany, it seems probable that a start may best be made with the development of local self-government. Local councils and their mayors are already locally elected and are fairly closely related to the everyday life of their people. But in Japan, as in Germany, the chances for democracy depend, in the long run, even more on the rival pressures of the victorious States than on changes of internal structure.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe USA, the USSR, China and (in a less degree) the British Commonwealth will all influence Japan. Some believe the Manchurian Army will return home “infested with Communism”, as it did in the years after the Wars of Intervention against the Soviet Union. The presence, on the other hand, of United States Forces of Occupation will encourage Japanese business interests which desire to orientate themselves towards America. In the early 1930s, Hollywood films exercised considerable influence on the industrialised worker. The same may be true again, but it is difficult to believe that the imitation of American customs and methods will be more than superficial. Not the least likely long-term development is a <em>rapprochement </em>with China. For centuries China filled the Japanese horizon and influenced her culture. It may do so again. The tension and strains which have been continuously visible in Japanese political and social life have been due in large part to the failure to reconcile her rapid westernisation with the traditional modes of thought. In the future conflict between Powers and cultures for influence in Japan, it may well prove that China, herself struggling to reconcile her ancient culture with the development of modern industry, will once again be the nation from which Japan derives most.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em style=\"box-sizing: border-box;

One group in particular has been breaking out the popcorn to enjoy the show: Liberal Democrat MPs, who have been delighted to learn that Jeremy Corbyn was jealous of their electric battle bus during the election campaign (Labour’s ran on diesel). “I wish I’d known this at the time,” remarks an amused senior figure from the Lib Dem campaign. “I’d have sent it to follow him around the country.”</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>It was also revealed</strong> this week that Tom Watson, the former Labour deputy leader, held secret talks with Jo Swinson to consider standing for the Liberal Democrats in December’s general election. It has prompted some to wonder about the fate of those who did make the leap to the Lib Dems last year, only to lose their seats. Chuka Umunna and Luciana Berger have both joined communications firm Edelman, while Sam Gyimah has joined the board of Oxford University Innovation. “I can’t see a way back for Chuka,” a former colleague observes, while several privately wonder whether Berger might stand again for her old party under Keir Starmer.</p>\n<p>\n\t“It would be a big win for him from an internal perspective,” one Lib Dem MP muses.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Some of the defectors </strong>from the last election have, however, “got the Lib Dem bug”, according to a fellow MP. Phillip Lee, who sparked a Lib Dem revolt over his record on LGBTQ issues when he defected from the Tories, is expected to stand again for the party, as is Antoinette Sandbach, the former Tory MP for Eddisbury. She’s already in the club: when the female Lib Dem MPs met for Zoom chats during lockdown, Sandbach joined, as did former leader Jo Swinson.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Boris Johnson has shared</strong> his summer reading list, complete with Lucretius, <em>Britain’s Europe</em> by Brendan Simms, and <em>Any Human Heart </em>by William Boyd, the fictional diary of Logan Mountstuart, a posh, affable fellow who drifts from woman to woman and historic event to historic event, always at the centre of things and failing upwards. The Labour leader is reading <em>The Nickel Boys</em> by Colson Whitehead, and the shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds is reading <em>The Secret Barrister</em>, and <em>Betrayal in Berlin </em>by Steve Vogel, while the Green MP Caroline Lucas’s beach reads include <em>The Covid-19 Catastrophe</em> by Richard Horton, editor of the <em>Lancet</em>, and Walt Whitman’s <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Angela Rayner, however, has eschewed all book chat. The Labour deputy leader is leaving it, an aide jokes, “to her more intellectual colleagues”. </p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Kevin Maguire is away</em></p>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n          Getty      \n\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-image-caption field-type-text field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\">Jeremy Corbyn</div></div></div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 15:08:25 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-531365848.jpg?itok=D8e0O5Xw","linkMd5":"11e61e82a7159b7930b7f79238717843","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn87@2020_4/2020/09/05/09-02-10-889_6a770f2c4224a933.webp","destWidth":790,"destHeight":350,"sourceBytes":32824,"destBytes":16780,"author":"Ailbhe Rea","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-531365848.jpg?itok=D8e0O5Xw":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn87@2020_4/2020/09/05/09-02-10-889_6a770f2c4224a933.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528310},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"Will Richard Leonard be ousted as Scottish Labour leader?

The SNP was boosted by Scotland’s animus towards Brexit.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-f5b98201-7fff-f0d3-725d-66a3f6a21ae3\">Nevertheless, Leonard has unarguably failed in the three years of his leadership to re-establish Labour, not just as an alternative devolved government, but even as a contender to be the main opposition. He voted for Corbyn in both 2015 and 2016, and has pursued a policy programme – “radical” is his favourite word – focused on trade unions, blue-collar workers and nationalisation, with little to say about wealth creation or to middle Scotland. “Richard has lots of policies,” says one senior Scottish Labour figure, “but they’re all wrong.”</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-f5b98201-7fff-f0d3-725d-66a3f6a21ae3\">Leonard has also failed to make any impact as a national figure. A </span><a href=\"http://ballotbox.scot/yougov-6th-10th-august-2020\" target=\"_blank\">recent YouGov poll</a> found only 10 per cent of voters think he is doing well, while 37 per cent believe he’s doing badly. Perhaps worse, when asked how they thought the Labour leader was performing at his job, 53 per cent of voters responded with “don’t know”. These numbers are not going to improve.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/wales/2020/07/how-covid-19-crisis-may-accelerate-break-uk\"><strong><em>See also: Chris Deerin on how coronavirus may accelerate the break-pu of the UK</em></strong></a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-f5b98201-7fff-f0d3-725d-66a3f6a21ae3\">The polling ahead of next year’s election offers no solace. While the Conservatives are supported by between 20 and 25 per cent of voters, Labour is stubbornly stuck in the mid-teens. The SNP, meanwhile, after 13 years in government, poll in the fifties, </span><a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2020/07/why-support-scottish-independence-has-surged-during-covid-19-crisis\" target=\"_blank\">look likely to win an overall majority</a>, and will then claim to have a mandate for a second independence referendum. <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/scotland/2020/08/scotland-s-dreaming-why-snp-appears-unstoppable\" target=\"_blank\">Support for independence</a> is now consistently above 50 per cent. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-f5b98201-7fff-f0d3-725d-66a3f6a21ae3\">The numbers suggest my opening question should be rephrased: how does Leonard have the brass neck to stay on? One answer is based on another set of statistics. Party sources suggest the rebels don’t yet have a majority in either the parliamentary party or Labour’s ruling </span><a href=\"https://scottishlabour.org.uk/about/whos-on-the-sec/\" target=\"_blank\">Scottish Executive Committee</a>, both of which could pass a no-confidence motion that would force the issue. “They probably have about 45 per cent in both,” says a well-informed source. The reasons for this are mixed: residual loyalty among the lobby fodder, and uncertainty about who would replace him.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-f5b98201-7fff-f0d3-725d-66a3f6a21ae3\">The favoured successor among Leonard’s critics is Anas Sarwar, a former Scottish Labour deputy leader and the son of the former MP Mohammad Sarwar. However, says a source, “Anas may be the best answer at the moment but a fair number are unconvinced by him.” Another contender is the current deputy leader Jackie Baillie – “She would probably get it by acclaim,” adds my source – but she is said not to want the job.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-f5b98201-7fff-f0d3-725d-66a3f6a21ae3\">Although Leonard was never a full member of the Corbyn caucus, insiders believe he is under pressure from the remnants of the project in Scotland and at Westminster to stay in place. “He is the last man standing, and they don’t want to be seen to lose to the other side,” says a senior party figure.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-f5b98201-7fff-f0d3-725d-66a3f6a21ae3\">Leonard’s critics insist the rebellion is Scotland-made, and not being driven by Keir Starmer’s team at Westminster. They say lessons were learned from the experience of moving the former shadow cabinet minister Jim Murphy from London to Edinburgh in a failed and short-lived experiment in 2014. “Jim came in and it looked like a London takeover,” says a source. “Everyone is aware that can’t be repeated.” Instead, Starmer is said to be “scratching his head” about how to resurrect the party’s fortunes in its former heartland.</span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-f5b98201-7fff-f0d3-725d-66a3f6a21ae3\">The drama points once again to a major problem facing Scottish Labour. It has almost no talent pipeline in Scotland. The traditional route from local government has been closed off as the party has lost control of the big city councils, while insiders believe mediocre and ageing MSPs are effectively “bed-blocking” winnable constituencies and places at the top of the additional member lists.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-f5b98201-7fff-f0d3-725d-66a3f6a21ae3\">Whatever the truth, Scottish Labour is undeniably in a sorry state: lagging in the polls, with an ineffective leader and no obvious replacement, and lacking a serious policy agenda with broad voter appeal. With the numbers suggesting Scotland may be heading for independence, the consequences of the party’s collapse could be epochal. While Leonard’s defenestration is necessary, it will not be sufficient.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/scotland/2020/08/scotland-s-dreaming-why-snp-appears-unstoppable\"><strong><em>See also: Rory Scothorne on why the SNP now seems unstoppable</em></strong></a></p>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n          DANIEL LEAL-OLIVAS/AFP via Getty Images.      \n\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-image-caption field-type-text field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\">The Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard speaks at the 2019 Labour conference</div></div></div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 12:45:11 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1170373817.jpg?itok=HItlNiRE","linkMd5":"495159fadcf50d24dae07f137d2ab1c8","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn3@2020_6/2020/09/05/09-02-11-032_ccfe7097fcf49df0.webp","destWidth":790,"destHeight":350,"sourceBytes":27060,"destBytes":14502,"author":"Chris Deerin","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1170373817.jpg?itok=HItlNiRE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn3@2020_6/2020/09/05/09-02-11-032_ccfe7097fcf49df0.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528293},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"“Eat Out to Help Out” attracted near-universal approval.

Little wonder: in its first fortnight, 35 million meals were consumed for the cause – a figure, the Treasury points out, that doesn’t include restaurants yet to submit reimbursement claims, and is still equivalent to “over half the UK taking part”.</p>\n<p>\n\tGiven the scheme – which offered 50 per cent off food (up to £10 per diner) for three days a week in August – was designed to protect jobs by “boosting demand and getting customers through the door”, it seems to have been a success. Indeed, according to one survey, 39 per cent of people using it did so for their first meal out since restaurants reopened: Oisín Rogers, landlord of Mayfair’s the Guinea Grill, credits the scheme with giving people “the confidence to go out and try restaurants and see we are operating safely”.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut though the response from the industry itself has been largely positive, not everyone is smitten with the Chancellor’s plan. Chef Tony Rodd of Blackheath’s Copper and Ink tells me that “as a small independent, it has been tricky”, not only because of the extra administrative load and the cash-flow implications of claiming money back in arrears – he says he has heard of “aggression towards staff” from customers who can’t get a table, as well as “quiet weekends and other issues”.</p>\n<p>\n\tSadly, he’s not the only one to bring up bad behaviour on the part of punters: reports of diners grossly over-ordering to get the maximum discount, demanding money off all week, and generally being “horrible” abound. One café worker confides she can’t wait for Eat Out to Help Out to be over – “I’m sick to death of rude, aggressive customers” – a sentiment confirmed by Janie Thompson of Norfolk’s Thornham Deli, who says at times it’s been “hellish” for her staff. “To put this scheme on now when everyone’s out anyway is ridiculous. It’s great [Sunak]’s doing this, but I think it’s the wrong time.” According to beer writer Melissa Cole, the scheme is “crucifying” drinks-led businesses, which, having put all the safety measures in place, are finding that people are booking a table, staying for one drink “and then pushing off to eat” and “not coming out at weekends”.</p>\n<p>\n\tYet, as the sector hit hardest by Covid-19, hospitality is willing to clutch at any straws that might be offered by the Treasury. Edinburgh’s Union of Genius soup café admits that while they know the measure is “only short term”, they’re hoping it will “tide us over until students return in September”. The problem is that no one knows what will happen in the autumn, when both Eat Out to Help Out and the furlough scheme come to an end, and cold weather makes outdoor dining less attractive, posing a particular problem for small venues.</p>\n<p>\n\tJonathan Downey of the Hospitality Union has been clear that Eat Out to Help Out is “nowhere near enough… if the Chancellor doesn’t do something soon to address the issue of the mounting rent debt, half of all restaurants, and two million jobs in hospitality, will be gone by the end of the year”. Twenty-two thousand jobs are already history, and with every week bringing fresh disaster (Pizza Express has announced the closure of 73 sites, potentially affecting 1,100 jobs), I fear it’ll take more than a few free dough balls to fix this particular crisis.</p>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n          Andy Feltham/millennium images, uk      \n\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 14:51:12 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/2020_36_food.jpg?itok=sYOZr1QB","linkMd5":"7aadfc09ff7b945e430ae0e1ec33fb15","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn96@2020_1/2020/09/05/09-02-08-807_89c565b33f0cd871.webp","destWidth":790,"destHeight":350,"sourceBytes":26909,"destBytes":10732,"author":"Felicity Cloake","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/2020_36_food.jpg?itok=sYOZr1QB":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn96@2020_1/2020/09/05/09-02-08-807_89c565b33f0cd871.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528290},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"Schools are set to reopen but how safe are they from Covid-19?","link":"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/education/2020/08/schools-are-set-reopen-how-safe-are-they-covid-19","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-field-subheadline field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"> <p>\n\tWithout a significantly improved test and trace programme, reopening schools could lead to a second wave in December. </p>\n </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><noscript class=\"adaptive-image\" data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=\"300 768 1024\" data-adaptive-image-300-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot;

Pupils, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds, may rely on schools for free meals and childcare while their parents work. The same children were less likely to spend time learning from home or to have access to the resources they need to learn during the lockdown, according to a report by the </span><a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/14976\">Institute for Fiscal Studies</a>.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-e2084e5d-7fff-5b67-bc04-8629b4070214\">These inequalities have intensified a pre-existing gap between the richest and poorest pupils and will likely be felt for years to come.

Firstly, we collect national and state-wide polls </h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t\tWe gather voting intention figures, sample size, fieldwork dates, method of collection, and <span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sans-serif, Arial, Verdana, &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">– </span>whenever satisfactory sample size permits<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sans-serif, Arial, Verdana, &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"> –</span> demographic breakdowns.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">\n\t\t2. We adjust the polls to account for third parties and undecided voters</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t\tThird party candidates are almost always overstated in US opinion polls<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sans-serif, Arial, Verdana, &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"> –</span> Green Party candidate Ralph Nader in 2000 was overstated by as much as four points in the closing days of the campaign. To account for this we readjust those candidates by the typical overstatement seen from previous elections, reapportioning to Trump and Biden equally, with a small share to the pile of undecideds.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t\tThe method for reapportioning undecided votes is done in two ways. If the cross-breaks (sub-samples) have an unsatisfactory sample size, we cut and give to Trump and Biden equally. If the demographic make-up is statistically significant, or if there is available data to build an accurate image of undecided voters, we reapportion in a way that would reflect the typical voting pattern of those demographics.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t\tIf, for example, all undecided voters are non-college educated whites who have ranked immigration and border security as their number one issue over the course of the past few months, we are likely to recast a significant share of those votes to the Trump column.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t\tThis process allows us to make more reliable comparisons between polls by effectively standardising them.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">\n\t\t3. We readjust and weight the polls again to account for historic pollster performance</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t\tPollsters often get it wrong and this part of the model process seeks to account for this fact where possible.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t\tThis isn’t an exact science because pollsters often change their methodologies over time and cannot necessarily be assumed to possess the same sample-bias or sample-success as four years ago. Nonetheless, it is still valuable to account for those pollsters persistent in their sample and/or methodology bias.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t\tPollsters persistent in these \"house effects\" are readjusted to reflect the result of the election. If, in 2016, for example, a pollster persistent in historic bias had Clinton at 52 per cent on polling day (when the actual result was 48 per cent), our model would in future elections readjust that pollster’s Democratic poll share down by four points. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t\tPolls by firms with form for accuracy in previous contests receive greater value in our tracker, and those which haven’t performed as well will naturally receive a lower value.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t\tPollsters which have performed well nationally but not quite as well in certain states or regions are given values dependent on what it is that they are sampling. If, for example, John Smith Pollsters in 2016 did well at projecting the national share, but not quite as well in Michigan, then that company will receive a high value nationally, but a low one in Michigan.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">\n\t\t4. We introduce economic and issues-based indexes </h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t\tHere we introduce two sets of data which help provide context to the election campaign: an issues index and an economic index.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t\tThe economic index is an aggregate of a year’s worth of data which gives a general idea of the direction of the country in economic terms. This tends to shape voter perceptions and enthusiasm about their candidate. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t\tThis index combines unemployment figures, consumer spending, and perceived economic wellbeing from opinion polls. When the index is positive (i.e. when unemployment is falling and consumer spending is increasing), the incumbent candidate/party will be projected to do well. When the index is negative, the incumbent will be expected to face a backlash.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t\tDue to the Covid-19 pandemic, the value of a reliance on economic data is less clear than under normal circumstances. It is questionable, for instance, as to whether the metrics we have can provide a concise portrait of the economic situation in the fast changing environment that is a global pandemic.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t\tAs a consequence, though it does exist in our model, the value of the index in the weighted tracker is not as big as it would have been.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t\tThe issues index, like its economic counterpart, gives additional context on how voters view candidates and their abilities to tackle certain issues - something that isn’t captured fully in headline voting intention questions.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t\tThis index is calculated from polls that ask Americans to rank the issues most pertinent to how they’ll vote come November, and comparing them with perceived competence by candidate on each issue. If, for example, racial justice is the number one issue pertinent to how Americans will vote, and if Joe Biden is perceived to be the candidate most effective on that issue, then on the index alone we’d expect Biden to comfortably win the November election.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t\tIn practice these indices serve as state-level vote projections, aiding what will become the poll tracker. </p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">\n\t\t5. We produce the final weighted polling averages</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t\tThe poll tracker works as a day-to-day average of all the recently readjusted polling and relevant index-based data, with more recent polling given a higher weighting.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t\tThis section of the process also involves us, metaphorically speaking, \"going under the bonnet\". Here we examine individual polls, looking out for consistent headline and demographic variation that in isolation would resemble outliers, but due to their regularity deserve to be accounted for. We use this to create a range of possible values for each candidiate. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t\tIf, for example, you have one pollster regularly showing Biden with more support among non-college educated white women than other pollsters, then you have an instance of demographic variation that needs to be accounted for.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t\tIdentifying frequent variations allows us to produce a minimum and maximum range of values for both Biden and Trump, accounting for poll error as we go. These ranges are then used in calculating our final state-by-state probabilities, which leads us to the final part of the model process. </p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">\n\t\t6. We simulate the election more than 50,000 times</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t\tWith our state-by-state probabilities in hand, we take to our simulator. Here we plug in the probability figures, applying our min-max ranges, and introduce variables to make the state probabilities dependent on one another (if Trump wins Pennsylvania, the likelihood of him winning Ohio increases significantly), and from there receive our modal electoral college votes and headline probabilities.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t\tAnd there we have it <span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: sans-serif, Arial, Verdana, &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot;; font-size: 13px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">–</span> <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/international/2020/08/us-2020-presidential-election-forecast-model-will-donald-trump-or-joe-biden\">the <em>New Statesman</em> US election model</a>, explained!</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t\t<em>With thanks to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joshrayman\">Josh Rayman</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/georges_corbin\">Georges Corbineau</a> for their work in visualising the model and to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidottewell\">David Ottewell</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Patrick_E_Scott\">Patrick Scott</a> for their work in editing it.</em></p>\n</div>\n </div></div></div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 28 Aug 2020 12:22:12 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/08/americaelects1.png?itok=sJh00QV_","linkMd5":"6dd806e110f1157789b4883f633b8b79","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn36@2020_4/2020/09/05/09-02-09-723_41bacd7e3b0a2621.webp","destWidth":790,"destHeight":350,"sourceBytes":166679,"destBytes":33796,"author":"Ben Walker","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/08/americaelects1.png?itok=sJh00QV_":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn36@2020_4/2020/09/05/09-02-09-723_41bacd7e3b0a2621.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528298},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"Is the government dodging the blame for the exam results fiasco?","link":"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/education/2020/08/government-dodging-blame-exam-results-fiasco","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-field-subheadline field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"> <p>\n\tA second senior official has resigned over the debacle <span id=\"docs-internal-guid-19f3de05-7fff-4fda-e6a3-80e07d279e17\">– </span>but the Education Secretary remains in place.</p>\n </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><noscript class=\"adaptive-image\" data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=\"300 768 1024\" data-adaptive-image-300-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;300&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-1228081037.jpg?itok=K6kf7_S4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-768-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;768&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-1228081037.jpg?itok=K6kf7_S4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-1024-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;1024&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-1228081037.jpg?itok=K6kf7_S4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-max-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;max&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-1228081037.jpg?itok=K6kf7_S4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\"><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-1228081037.jpg?itok=pYZuf96a\" alt=\"\" /></noscript>\n</div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\" property=\"content:encoded\"> <p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-20b8e7a6-7fff-96df-292d-3f60ea02dde8\">Jonathan Slater, the top civil servant at the Department for Education (DfE), is to leave his post in the wake of the exam results fiasco. Slater will step down on 1 September. The head of Ofqual, Sally Collier, has also resigned. Gavin Williamson, the Education Secretary, who is ultimately responsible for the department, remains in place.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-20b8e7a6-7fff-96df-292d-3f60ea02dde8\">Are officials being made scapegoats for political failures? Well, yes and no. Ultimately, Ofqual is an independent body, and while it performed well within the confines of the impossible task it was set – to generate exam results without exams – ultimately, if an independent regulator is incapable of declaring publicly that it has been set an impossible task, its leadership </span><em>has</em> failed and should be replaced. That Ofqual has also been accused of rejecting help from the Royal Statistical Society is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/aug/24/royal-statistical-society-hits-back-at-ofqual-in-exams-algorithm-row\">also another blot on its leadership’s record.</a> </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-20b8e7a6-7fff-96df-292d-3f60ea02dde8\">That Williamson instructed Ofqual to avoid grade inflation is frankly a secondary issue; the problem was that there was no meaningful way to </span><em>produce </em>comparable exam results as in previous years. That is as true of the results that the government ultimately ended up issuing and accepting as it was of the ones proposed. The only winning move was not to play, and Ofqual’s failure was in either not seeing that, or seeing it and not telling the public.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-20b8e7a6-7fff-96df-292d-3f60ea02dde8\">But that case is far from clear in the DfE itself. The basic political problem this year is, ultimately, a policy problem: you can’t generate exam results without the exams taking place, and no matter how you tinker with an abacus, you will upset somebody. In England, Scotland <em>and</em> Northern Ireland, this year’s students have no comparable exam results from which you could meaningfully generate results – all you can do is hand out grades, fairly arbitrarily, based on the previous performance of pupils in the same school.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-20b8e7a6-7fff-96df-292d-3f60ea02dde8\">Why did both John Swinney, the Scottish Education Secretary, and Gavin Williamson try to do it anyway? Was Williamson made aware of the difficulty of the task, only to press on regardless? Or did officials fail to adequately prepare him? We don’t know, and one thing this row highlights is that we need greater transparency, which is why civil servants should make more frequent use of the requirement that ministers provide an official “direction” – that is, a written and detailed instruction. The big political bet that the government is making is that we won’t discover in the coming weeks and months that the fault lay with Williamson rather than Slater. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-20b8e7a6-7fff-96df-292d-3f60ea02dde8\">I suspect, however, that the cause of this crisis goes beyond one secretary of state. That the governments in England, Scotland </span>and Northern Ireland all opted to moderate exam results without having any exams to draw on is, in of itself, troubling and suggests bigger problems than just one politician, however unimpressive their tenure at the DfE may be. The whole mess is exactly what inquiries are made for: something has gone very wrong somewhere, and to prevent a recurrence, we need a serious and thorough look at the issue. The problem is we are not getting an inquiry; we are getting the usual approach from Boris Johnson’s government, which is to blame the nearest official. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-20b8e7a6-7fff-96df-292d-3f60ea02dde8\">The government has rearranged Public Health England without first holding an inquiry into what went wrong and right with the UK's response to Covid-19, and there is no guarantee that the new health body that succeeds it will be any better equipped – nor can we even accurately describe whether or not the new body is the right solution. Now another department is responding to a crisis without first conducting an inquiry, and we once again can’t say for certain that it is making the right response.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-20b8e7a6-7fff-96df-292d-3f60ea02dde8\">That speaks to the bigger problem: it’s not just that this government, like all governments, makes mistakes. It’s that this government is uniquely averse to transparency, which means its response to a setback is always shrouded in secrecy. Bad governance is the inevitable consequence of this approach.</span></p>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n          Getty      \n\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 15:01:29 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-1228081037.jpg?itok=pYZuf96a","linkMd5":"8c25d420920e158c4f5c117d9c674702","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn83@2020_3/2020/09/05/09-02-09-178_329759edd33effd3.webp","destWidth":790,"destHeight":350,"sourceBytes":86944,"destBytes":60504,"author":"Stephen Bush","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-1228081037.jpg?itok=pYZuf96a":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn83@2020_3/2020/09/05/09-02-09-178_329759edd33effd3.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528310},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"The QAnon conspiracy theory is absurd but dangerous.

The glue holding it all together is </span><a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/world/2018/08/qanon-inside-4chan-conspiracy-suggests-donald-trump-secret-genius\" target=\"_blank\">the conspiracy theory known as QAnon</a>.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-5a427cd1-7fff-bd74-e3a3-b8ae307f65aa\">QAnon emerged in October 2017 from cryptic internet postings purported to originate from a high-level US official. Drawing on almost all previous conspiracy theories, it asserts that Donald Trump is engaged in a secret war with a Satanic paedophile cabal, involving large parts of the liberal Democratic establishment and Hollywood. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-5a427cd1-7fff-bd74-e3a3-b8ae307f65aa\">A “triangle” of rich families is alleged to run the world – the Rothschilds, George Soros and the Saudi royals – while the “Hollywood elite” (seen as a codeword for Jews) is alleged to be “adrenochrome </span>harvesting<span>” (extracting adrenaline to create the psychoactive drug adrenochrome) from the blood of children. Soon, according to QAnon believers, “The Storm” is coming: Trump will arrest thousands of cabal members and intern them at Guantanamo Bay, while the US military will stage a coup.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-5a427cd1-7fff-bd74-e3a3-b8ae307f65aa\">It is absurd, of course. But during the Covid-19 pandemic QAnon supporters' slogan – Where We Go One We Go All – the word “adrenochrome”, and the letter Q have become common signifiers, not just among traditional far-right demonstrations, but across a larger and more diverse movement. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-5a427cd1-7fff-bd74-e3a3-b8ae307f65aa\">The Global Network on Extremism &amp; Technology </span><a href=\"https://gnet-research.org/2020/07/22/cross-promotion/\" target=\"_blank\">noted in July</a> that “three formerly distinct online ecosystems – lifestyle/wellness, violent extremism and conspiracy promoting groups – have become intertwined through shared #QAnon related hashtags and conspiracy narratives on vaccines, 5G and the evils of the ‘Deep State’ during this pandemic.” </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-5a427cd1-7fff-bd74-e3a3-b8ae307f65aa\">To a new generation of “influencers” on platforms such as TikTok and Instagram, unregulated and unverified purveyors of marketing and information, it became clear that conspiracy theories make money. The more you feed people the idea that drinking bleach can cure the virus, or that 5G telecoms masts are causing it, or that the whole thing is a </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/23/how-the-plandemic-conspiracy-theory-took-hold\" target=\"_blank\">“plandemic”</a>, the more traffic you generate and the more money you make.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-5a427cd1-7fff-bd74-e3a3-b8ae307f65aa\">Politicians, too, are feeding off the myth. According to the <em>Economist</em>, some<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/08/29/qanon-conspiracy-theorists-could-prove-awkward-for-republicans\">72 QAnon sympathisers</a> have sought nominations for the Republican Party in elections this year, while in Germany the far-right </span>AfD has continually riffed on Covid-19 conspiracy themes. The FBI has already identified QAnon as a terror threat – but the much greater danger is that the theory has become, for large numbers of people, an ideological gateway drug to the far right. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-5a427cd1-7fff-bd74-e3a3-b8ae307f65aa\">At a literal level, QAnon purports to explain what neither liberalism nor Marxism nor mainstream conservatism can: why the world doesn’t work; why nothing changes; why power elites persist. But at a sub-literate level it serves a function that Arendt identified in the ideologies of both Nazi Germany and the USSR: to promote irrationalism. Observers of QAnon networks have likened their activities to a collaborative roleplay game: you have to work out what the cryptic “Q-drops” mean, and to do so you have to consult other atomised and confused people. It’s fun, it creates structure and meaning, and then – when you take to the streets over, for example, a road closure proposal by the local council – you “find each other”.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-5a427cd1-7fff-bd74-e3a3-b8ae307f65aa\">If you watch </span><a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/videos/politics/2020/06/24/mask-mandate-florida-anger-erupts-coronavirus-vpx.cnn\">the response</a> of nicely turned-out residents in Palm Beach, Florida in June – to the simple issue of a vote by the local government to make mask wearing mandatory – you can see the levels of mass psychosis that QAnon feeds off. “You, doctor, are going to be arrested for crimes against humanity,” says one woman, jabbing her finger at a medical expert. QAnon has emerged as the overarching explanatory myth, explaining ten years of economic disempowerment and political turmoil.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-5a427cd1-7fff-bd74-e3a3-b8ae307f65aa\">Arendt understood that the purpose of conspiracy theories was to make people knowingly complicit in irrationalism: to shut them off from facts, analysis and reason, and to create a closed world in which everything makes sense. In the “lying world” created by Nazi propaganda, she wrote, “through sheer imagination, uprooted masses can feel at home and are spared the never-ending shocks which real life and real experiences deal to human beings and their expectations”.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/2020/04/how-conspiracy-theorists-have-embraced-coronavirus-pandemic\"><span><em><strong>See also: Samuel Horti on how conspiracy theorists have embraced coronavirus</strong></em></span></a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-5a427cd1-7fff-bd74-e3a3-b8ae307f65aa\">Covid-19 was a shock, </span><a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/economy/2020/07/how-imagine-death-capitalism\">the recession it has caused</a> is a shock, but they are the latest in a long list of shocks, going back to the dotcom bubble, 9/11, Fallujah, Abu Ghraib and the 2008 Lehman Brothers collapse. <span id=\"docs-internal-guid-5a427cd1-7fff-bd74-e3a3-b8ae307f65aa\">With neither liberal politics nor neoliberal economics capable of explaining such shocks, people take refuge in ridiculous beliefs. Once ensnared in a community of ridiculous beliefs, Arendt warned, people “﻿do not trust their eyes and ears but only their imaginations, which may be caught by anything that is at once universal and consistent in itself”. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-5a427cd1-7fff-bd74-e3a3-b8ae307f65aa\">In the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory, the Nazis found not only justification for their core myth – the world Jewish conspiracy – but their model for government. The Germans are going to rule the world just as ruthlessly as the Jews do, was the subtext – and we can do it through the same alleged methods of intrigue, network and conspiracy.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-5a427cd1-7fff-bd74-e3a3-b8ae307f65aa\">The QAnon conspiracy theory, however, is not the work of a single person: unlike the Nazis, we have a networked information society and the “wisdom of crowds”. The theory has a life of its own, and is being deepened and made more comprehensive with the addition of health and lifestyle lunacies, and the Covid-19 conspiracies.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-5a427cd1-7fff-bd74-e3a3-b8ae307f65aa\">If we read it literally, as the product of mass psychosis, what are QAnon’s adherents actually promising each other? That just as the Hollywood elite, the Saudis and the Democrats secretly rule the world now, so we – the ordinary, midwestern, white, Christian Americans – can rule the world in future.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-5a427cd1-7fff-bd74-e3a3-b8ae307f65aa\">If it literally came to pass that the US military staged a coup, threw Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton into Guantanamo and exposed thousands of famous people as Satanic paedophiles, what would the US look like? There would have to be camps, prisons, trials, secret detention centres – and, of course, the people in them would not be Hollywood stars, but black, Muslim and Hispanic and Jewish Americans, together with the supposed “cultural Marxists” who are alleged to be conspiring to “replace” white Christian America.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-5a427cd1-7fff-bd74-e3a3-b8ae307f65aa\">And since there would be resistance to The Storm, there would most likely be a civil war. The US's dominant role in world affairs would end, its alliance systems would break up and its economy would be in ruins. That is what QAnon followers are really fantasising about.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-5a427cd1-7fff-bd74-e3a3-b8ae307f65aa\">The Protocols, which, like QAnon, had a life of their own, far beyond the overt propaganda of the Nazis, led to death camps. QAnon, if left to spread, could do the same. The lessons of history here are not hiding among the arcana and footnotes.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-5a427cd1-7fff-bd74-e3a3-b8ae307f65aa\">What should progressives and democrats do? Experts in conspiracy say that prevention is better than cure: they suggest that, rather than debunking the theory, pre-bunking is more effective. Politicians, media personalities and journalists need to go out of their way, in advance, to warn that QAnon exists and that its aim is to create an alliance of concerned and powerless people and draw them into the far right.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-5a427cd1-7fff-bd74-e3a3-b8ae307f65aa\">The worst thing to do is ridicule the person spreading the theory: instead, write the authors Stephan Lewandowsky and John Cook in </span><em><a href=\"https://www.climatechangecommunication.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ConspiracyTheoryHandbook.pdf\">The Conspiracy Theory Handbook</a></em>, accept that critical thought and scepticism are healthy, but try to get the victims of conspiracy theory to confront evidence and logic.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-5a427cd1-7fff-bd74-e3a3-b8ae307f65aa\">Ultimately, however, we are going to defeat the far right by empowering the people it is recruiting – but in different ways to the gun-toting and vigilantism they are currently flirting with. </span><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-5a427cd1-7fff-bd74-e3a3-b8ae307f65aa\">What they want is a political and social alternative to the present. You only have to hear one sluggish speech by Joe Biden to understand that liberalism cannot offer one. Biden's campaign rightly accused Trump of boosting QAnon – but the Democratic presidential nominee needs to take the theory apart, line by line, linking its irrationalities to a warning about where the US is headed if Trump wins a second term.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-5a427cd1-7fff-bd74-e3a3-b8ae307f65aa\">And in the UK, where thousands of conspiracy theorists and far-right activists descended on Trafalgar Square on 29 August, what’s wrong with QAnon, and climate denial, and the “plandemic” myth, needs to be the subject of sermons, school curricula and, above all, the speeches of serious politicians.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/coronavirus/2020/04/why-pandemics-create-conspiracy-theories\"><span><strong><em>See also: Richard J Evans on why pandemics have always created conspiracy theories</em></strong></span></a></p>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n          Kyle Grillot /AFP via Getty Images.      \n\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-image-caption field-type-text field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\">QAnon demonstrators protest on Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles, California, on 22 August</div></div></div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 16:09:06 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1228159554_1_.jpg?itok=u6_KtuAR","linkMd5":"6ca02629616221b3ed7a960fccbe69f0","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn64@2020_4/2020/09/05/09-02-09-869_641eb820c97782ff.webp","destWidth":790,"destHeight":350,"sourceBytes":72767,"destBytes":49358,"author":"Paul Mason","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1228159554_1_.jpg?itok=u6_KtuAR":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn64@2020_4/2020/09/05/09-02-09-869_641eb820c97782ff.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528289},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"If ministers don’t act, our aerospace and automotive industries are heading for a crash","link":"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/economy/2020/08/if-ministers-don-t-act-our-aerospace-and-automotive-industries-are-heading","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-field-subheadline field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"> <p>\n\tThe UK government has been silent while France, Germany and Spain allocate billions of euros to investing in the future.</p>\n </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><noscript class=\"adaptive-image\" data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=\"300 768 1024\" data-adaptive-image-300-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot;

These sectors, and their supply chains too, provide millions of high-paid, high-skilled jobs in areas of the country that need them most, outside the M25.   </p>\n<p>\n\tOur country has led the world in aerospace and automotive development, from producing the world’s first commercial jet airliner, to today's innovation in battery science, exporting technology and goods across the globe and contributing to a successful economy and prosperous communities. These companies power the engine of global Britain and our drive for a cleaner, greener future. </p>\n<p>\n\tYet they are now faltering, and ministers' failure to accept these sectors are being disadvantaged in the international response to the Covid-19 crisis means that the engine is sputtering, and we’re in danger of being overtaken, as our competitors across the globe pump-prime for recovery. </p>\n<p>\n\tIt’s not just a lack of targeted sectoral support or measures to boost demand like those we’ve seen for the housing market, or hospitality, but that our global competitors are supporting their home-grown industries with such ambition that it is now significantly increasing the impact of the damage that companies face here. Cruising in the slow lane is a mistake in and of itself, but it also means our competitors will leave us further behind. </p>\n<p>\n\tMany businesses in these sectors would have had full order books before the coronavirus pandemic hit. But automotive industry association SMMT reports that car sales are down by half for the first six months of this year. Aviation industry body ADS reported that aircraft orders were down 75 per cent in May compared to the same month last year. Now, through no fault of their own, many companies find themselves in jeopardy, and are crying out for help from a government that is failing to live up to the Chancellor's pledge to do \"whatever it takes\" to see us safely through the crisis and take us back to the front of the pack.   </p>\n<p>\n\tYes, furlough support and the loan schemes have provided respite for some, but we have already seen thousands of job losses across both sectors: Rolls Royce in Derbyshire, Airbus in Broughton and Filton, GE in Scotland, and Bombardier in Northern Ireland, alongside those at McLaren, Aston Martin Lagonda, and at DHL for workers involved in making Jaguar Land Rover vehicles in the Midlands. </p>\n<p>\n\t<em><strong>[see also: <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/brexit/2020/01/brexit-isn-t-done-what-next-uk-s-car-industry\">Brexit isn’t done: What next for the UK’s car industry?</a>] </strong></em></p>\n<p>\n\tLabour has long called for more support for ailing industries in order to protect jobs, and improve our position relative to our international challengers. Promised investment in green tech should be delivered, and ministers should bring forward orders in the pipeline to save jobs now. </p>\n<p>\n\tIn response we’ve had silence from ministers while France, Germany and Spain allocate billions of euros to overtaking us. €50bn of Germany’s stimulus fund is being targeted at clean transport and low emission vehicles, including doubling the purchase premium for electric vehicles to €6,000, pumping €2.5bn into e-charging infrastructure and battery technology alongside €Ibn for cleaner, quieter aircraft. France’s €15bn package includes funds to accelerate research into environmentally friendly technology, such as electric- or hydrogen-powered commercial jets, with an ambition to achieve a carbon-neutral plane by 2035 instead of 2050. Spain’s support package for automotive earmarked almost 70 per cent of funds to the sector’s \"value chain\", alongside replacing older models with more energy-efficient vehicles. What’s more, schemes to protect employment have been extended to up to two years. </p>\n<p>\n\tNot only does this mean that we will fall behind on the clean and green technologies driving the future, but businesses will move investment to places with better rewards – other countries where there is more generous support and greater investment opportunities. We will see a brain drain from Britain unless ministers act. </p>\n<p>\n\tWe want our manufacturers to succeed, to maintain and improve their world-leading position, and motor ahead to support our future prosperity. Unless ministers urgently change direction, the downturn will turn into a crash and manufacturers will be left running on empty, with communities and our country losing out. </p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Lucy Powell MP is Labour’s shadow minister for business and consumers </em></p>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n          Getty      \n\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-image-caption field-type-text field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\">The closed Jaguar-Land Rover production plant in Solihull, central England on 9 April 2020.</div></div></div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 28 Aug 2020 10:27:16 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-1209548916.jpg?itok=frBZz90t","linkMd5":"177eb550c1d890ef36985a9923cec10c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn71@2020_5/2020/09/05/09-02-09-212_0bba74b30fe38b0a.webp","destWidth":790,"destHeight":350,"sourceBytes":54292,"destBytes":38776,"author":"Lucy Powell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-1209548916.jpg?itok=frBZz90t":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn71@2020_5/2020/09/05/09-02-09-212_0bba74b30fe38b0a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528299},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"In lockdown, preparing a good meal was the focus of my day.

Garp writes, “Sometimes it is the only worthwhile product you can salvage from a day: what you make to eat. With writing, I find, you can have all the right ingredients, give plenty of time and care, and still get nothing. Also true of love. Cooking, therefore, can keep a person who tries hard sane.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWriting had failed me in lockdown, or I it; I had produced the equivalent of an averagely productive weekend over the course of those two months. Love, certainly, was nowhere to be found and the worst-case warnings of coronavirus resulting in a five-year shuttering made me sure I would never speak to anyone new in person again, let alone fall in love with them.</p>\n<p>\n\tFood, then, was what I had left to play with. Like many others I learned new recipes and elaborated on old standards – anything decadent and involved enough that it would consume my afternoons whole. I threw myself into chicken karaage tacos, and sage brown butter pasta with poached fish, and some appalling thing with cauliflower done four ways.</p>\n<p>\n\tSoon after that phase, I made my way out of my parents’ place in Waterford and back to London, where I now live alone.  I am afraid of a lonely winter, the possibility (or certainty, depending on who you ask) of a recurring period of total isolation, and I observe myself gathering close objects and routines that would make such a time more bearable. I’m like a bird dragging scraps of shiny debris to make its nest, noticing bits and bobs that might provide some moment of solace in the depths of an interminable November evening. I have acquired an exercise bike, upon which I dispassionately work out while watching the<em> Real  Housewives</em> franchise, and when I think of winter, I am safe in the knowledge that I can maintain this level of semi-conscious perfunctory fitness even if I’m stuck indoors.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the midst of these feelings, the meaning of my meals has shifted again. Living alone, with nobody to witness what you do from hour to hour, changes the tenor of many things in life – but for me it has chiefly been to do with food. Without a companion, an audience of some kind, the idea of preparing something decent and nourishing, something that requires a little effort, now often feels absurd, and even frightening. To spend several hours preparing something I will then consume at my kitchen table with a podcast on, in the space of 15 minutes, feels bleak to me. It feels bleak in a way that, say, the notion of reading a book and drinking a coffee alone in my apartment does not. Why is this? I love nothing more than eating alone in restaurants. Why do I need others to see me eat for it to feel like a worthwhile endeavour?</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen I was a teenager, to prepare food in solitude was my greatest ambition. Like many people who suffer from disordered eating, what I was struggling toward was not only thinness but control. It felt filthy to me that others could make me eat what they had cooked, or could watch me as I made something, and see me eat or discard it. It was the invasion of observation that I felt as keenly as the desire to take up less space in the world. I wanted solitude, to wallow in the luxury of my own private choices. Food was holy then, as well as the enemy, and I dreamed of being left alone with it eternally.</p>\n<p>\n\tAll that changed eventually. (Though, of course, it still remains in various embarrassing phantom iterations; to this day, I can’t eat much in front of someone I have a crush on until I get to know them quite well and learn to relax. Until then, my throat physically refuses, my stomach seems to shrink in revolted protest, screaming: “Don’t let them see you do that!”) Now, I love to eat, and food is no longer threatening or suspect, but rather holds the promise of communion and love and the beginning of nights with my favourite people. It’s something I give or take or share with my best friends and partners. It’s no longer the enemy, because I have reframed it as social – and I love nothing more than being social.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut what, then, to do when the social is removed? I realise, living alone, that the truce I made with food was conditional, that it needed an audience.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen I think about the performance of meals, I think of when I was a waitress in my early twenties. I had never worked in a restaurant before, and my sensitivity to humiliation was such that every minor thing I got wrong felt like a catastrophic event. But soon I learned to fake it, and because the restaurant was known to be staffed by hip young dickheads, I had a ready-made role to play. There was even a costume: the owner told me one day to stop wearing floral dresses and come in skinny jeans and sharp shirts. Soon I was sauntering around icily like everyone else, and the experience began to feel like we were all acting in some play together. When no one was looking, though, the reality shone through – the wages from my four shifts a week were not enough to live off, really, and I was hungry and wild, and would remove uneaten food from yuppie plates and eat it quickly, ravenously.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat it comes down to, I think, is that alone, without the audience, it is far harder to simply accept that you are really a person. The routines around personhood come to feel thin and shabby. To prepare a meal for yourself alone is to actively confront the fact that you’re alive and that you deserve and need things. This is the hardest lesson for me to absorb, but I know it might really be the only one. So on I go, with a heavy heart, feeling exposed and more than a little absurd. I open the recipe book once again, without anybody to see if I do or don’t. </p>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n          Getty      \n\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 11:40:55 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-3137179.jpg?itok=shwzr-e5","linkMd5":"65b2afb677f548f2db386bb98c1a3610","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn25@2020_4/2020/09/05/09-02-10-165_aa767002d2a9b806.webp","destWidth":790,"destHeight":350,"sourceBytes":56108,"destBytes":35478,"author":"Megan Nolan","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-3137179.jpg?itok=shwzr-e5":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn25@2020_4/2020/09/05/09-02-10-165_aa767002d2a9b806.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528294},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"Shinzo Abe: Japan’s longest-serving prime minister stands down","link":"https://www.newstatesman.com/world/asia/2020/08/shinzo-abe-japan-s-longest-serving-prime-minister-stands-down","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-field-subheadline field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"> <p>\n\tHis attempts to revitalise the ageing country produced only patchy and qualified results.</p>\n<p>\n\t </p>\n </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><noscript class=\"adaptive-image\" data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=\"300 768 1024\" data-adaptive-image-300-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;300&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-1228231167.jpg?itok=O0myFaQy&amp;amp;c=ca677084aaaf8754a47652f2b87cda70&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Japan&amp;#039;s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has stood down over health reasons&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-768-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;768&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-1228231167.jpg?itok=O0myFaQy&amp;amp;c=ca677084aaaf8754a47652f2b87cda70&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Japan&amp;#039;s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has stood down over health reasons&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-1024-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;1024&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-1228231167.jpg?itok=O0myFaQy&amp;amp;c=ca677084aaaf8754a47652f2b87cda70&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Japan&amp;#039;s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has stood down over health reasons&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-max-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;max&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-1228231167.jpg?itok=O0myFaQy&amp;amp;c=ca677084aaaf8754a47652f2b87cda70&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Japan&amp;#039;s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has stood down over health reasons&quot; /&gt;\"><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-1228231167.jpg?itok=ei1V0cV4\" alt=\"\" title=\"Japan&#039;s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has stood down over health reasons\" /></noscript>\n</div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\" property=\"content:encoded\"> <p>\n\tOn 20 November 2019 Shinzo Abe passed the record set by his early 20th-century predecessor Katsura Taro to become the longest-serving prime minister in Japan's history. On 24 August, this past Monday, he reached a new landmark: the longest continuous period as prime minister. Abe, who is also president of the conservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has dominated Japan's postwar politics, had served a short, scandal-plagued term as prime minister in 2006-07 before resigning citing ill health, and then regaining the premiership in 2012. Today, fresh from writing this new line in his country's history books, Abe held a press conference to announce his resignation – again for health reasons. And this time it looks to be for good.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe news marks the end of an era in Japanese and Asian politics. The scion of a major political dynasty, Abe's current tenure began more than two decades after the 1989 peak of Japan's great economic and technological postwar rise; the 1990s and 200s were \"lost decades\" marked by an ageing society and a stagnant economy. His eight-year spell as prime minister can be summarised as an only patchily successful attempt to revitalise the country, the world's third largest economy, at a time when its neighbour China's industrial and geopolitical heft has loomed ever larger.</p>\n<p>\n\tAbe's bid to inject new dynamism into Japan has been, first and foremost, economic. His so-called \"three arrows\" have been: aggressive monetary easing to force the country out of its deflationary slump, intensive government stimulus spending, and structural reforms including tax cuts, labour market liberalisation and deregulation. This \"Abenomics\" has had some success, including Japan's longest stretch of growth since the 1990s and increases in investment and employment (albeit these also reflected the global economic recovery of the mid-2010s).</p>\n<p>\n\tBut broader efforts to overhaul Japan's conservative corporate culture, making it more entrepreneurial and women-friendly, remain unfinished business. Inequality has risen. And the modest economic recovery has not inspired an increase in the country's low birth rate; in a mark of its ongoing ageing process, Japan's consumption of adult nappies has overtaken its consumption of baby ones. If the country's stagnation no longer stands out so starkly from international comparators that is at least partly because \"Japanification\" (<a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/economy/2020/05/falling-interest-rates-capitalism-economic-downturn-future-solutions\">secular stagnation</a>) has increasingly come to other wealthy economies too.</p>\n<p>\n\tA second element of Abe's project has been cultural. As Kristin Surak of the the School of Oriental and African Studies <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/world/asia/2019/05/shinzo-abe-and-rise-japanese-nationalism\">wrote for us last year</a>, his economic reforms have been accompanied by a turn towards nationalist populism. Under the LDP slogan \"<em>Nippon o Torimodosu</em>\" (Take Back Japan), his governments have stacked the management of the public broadcaster NHK with right-wing appointees, and supported the use in schools of revisionist history books. Abe's tenure will be particularly remembered in China and South Korea for the offence felt in those countries at his 2013 visit and subsequent offerings to the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo, which honours Japan's war dead and is considered a symbol of Japanese military aggression. Two further initiatives – a bid to remove pacifist clauses in the country's constitution and to restore sovereignty over Pacific islands to which both Japan and Russia lay claim – did not succeed.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe third element has been Abe's bid to revitalise and modernise his country's geopolitical standing. He has challenged Japan's postwar tradition of pacifism in deed as well as word; in 2015 he passed legislation enabling the armed forces to take combat roles abroad. He has made Japan an important pillar of the four-part Indo-Pacific alliance known as the Quad, tightening relationships with its three other players: the United States (including under Donald Trump), Australia and India.</p>\n<p>\n\tThough that grouping's role is to counterbalance China in the region, and it has risen in prominence as China's might has grown, Abe has also tried to find a stable if wary accommodation with Beijing  – inviting Xi Jinping to come to Japan in April this year for what would have been the Chinese president's first trip to the country. That strategy has shifted, however, over the past year as the Covid-19 pandemic and growing Chinese diplomatic and military belligerence have fuelled Japanese scepticism about its larger neighbour. Xi's visit has been indefinitely postponed. Abe's stimulus package in May included incentives for Japanese firms to pull production out of China, while efforts to <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/world/asia/2020/05/rise-indo-pacific\">tighten and strengthen</a> the counter-Chinese alliance in the Indo-Pacific have accelerated.</p>\n<p>\n\tOther than Xi's visit, the other big event in Abe's calendar for 2020 had been the Tokyo Olympics this summer (one of the enduring images of his tenure was his appearance, dressed as the Nintendo video game character Super Mario, at the handover ceremony in Rio de Janeiro in 2016). But the global pandemic caused the event to be postponed until next year and has also caused something of a political crisis. As the virus surged in Japan in April – to an admittedly relatively low peak of 743 new cases a day – Abe was reluctant to hobble the country's economy with a severe lockdown. As <em>New Statesman</em> contributor <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/world/asia/2020/04/japan-lockdown-coronavirus-covid-shinzo-abe\">Tom Feiling wrote for us </a>from the Japanese capital at the time, that contrasted unfavourably with the tough response of Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike.</p>\n<p>\n\tAbe's popularity has taken another dent in recent weeks as, with rumours about his own health problems swirling, the infection rate has surged again and has regularly hit or exceeded 1,000 new cases a day. That is still relatively low by international comparison, but the critical public opinion relative to the country's performance make Japan an international outlier (for reasons <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/world/north-america/2020/08/survey-us-and-uk-publics-are-most-pessimistic-about-their-governments\">my colleague Ido Vock explores here</a>).</p>\n<link href=\"https://nsmg-projects-public.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/common/chart.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" />\n<div class=\"nsmg-chart\">\n<div class=\"nsmg-h3\">\n\t\tPeople in countries with more coronavirus deaths think their countries did worse</div>\n<div class=\"nsmg-h4\">\n\t\tCoronavirus deaths vs percentage who say their country has done a bad job</div>\n<object id=\"deathsPlot\"></object><div class=\"source-text\">\n\t\tSource: <em>New Statesman</em> analysis of Pew Research Center survey results and Our World in Data figures</div>\n</div>\n<script src=\"https://nsmg-projects-public.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/common/updatesize.js\"></script><script>\n<!--//--><![CDATA[// ><!--\nupdateSize(\"deathsPlot\", [\"https://nsmg-projects-public.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/live/2020-08/coronavirus-satisfaction/380-deaths.svg\",\"https://nsmg-projects-public.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/live/2020-08/coronavirus-satisfaction/560-deaths.svg\",\"https://nsmg-projects-public.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/live/2020-08/coronavirus-satisfaction/deaths.svg\"]);\n//--><!]]>\n</script><p>\n\t </p>\n<p>\n\tEven before today's news, it was in any case already clear that the Abe era was drawing to a close. Not only was the prime minister's handling of the pandemic weighing him down, but under LDP internal rules no individual can hold its presidency for more than three terms, or nine years. So Abe would have had to stand down ahead of the general election due by October next year.</p>\n<p>\n\tStill, his departure leaves a big gap. Japan's opposition is relatively weak. Throughout this turbulent year to date the LDP's share of polled voting intention has mostly fluctuated in the 30s per cent while those of its rivals have remained in single digits. The party's mandate to govern continues up to the next election, which it can probably expect to win. But even within the LDP there are no figures to rival Abe's stature. It is reported that the party will choose an interim prime minister to serve through to the election; possibly an elder such as cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga or finance minister Taro Aso. Of the potentially more long-term successors, former foreign minister Fumio Kishida (who has already thrown his hat into the ring) might strike a more conciliatory tone with China, while defence minister Taro Kono is known to be more hawkish, but none seems likely to alter drastically the course set by Abe.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat all of his likely successors have risen and served in his long shadow, combined with the sheer stature and prominence of the Abe project, suggests that Abe-ism, or variants of it, may well long outlast his record-breaking tenure.</p>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n          KAZUHIRO NOGI/AFP via Getty Images      \n\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-image-caption field-type-text field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\">Japan&#039;s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has stood down over health reasons</div></div></div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 28 Aug 2020 08:23:35 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-1228231167.jpg?itok=ei1V0cV4","linkMd5":"4178720195e00711953c0cf0e8007f1a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn92@2020_2/2020/09/05/09-02-08-943_ab6a3005ce4515b8.webp","destWidth":790,"destHeight":350,"sourceBytes":37103,"destBytes":21446,"author":"Jeremy Cliffe","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-1228231167.jpg?itok=ei1V0cV4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn92@2020_2/2020/09/05/09-02-08-943_ab6a3005ce4515b8.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528302},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"US democracy in peril: Don&#039;t underestimate the Trump Factor","link":"https://www.newstatesman.com/world/2020/09/us-democracy-peril-dont-underestimate-trump-factor","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-field-subheadline field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"> <p>\n\tThe greatest threat to American norms in this presidential election is the president himself.</p>\n<p>\n\t </p>\n </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><noscript class=\"adaptive-image\" data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=\"300 768 1024\" data-adaptive-image-300-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot;

that he is a by-product of bad faith right-wing media, celebrity culture and years of Republicans calling people out to battle in the culture war. But though what is currently happening to the country is larger than the president, he is also the person now positioned to do the nation most harm. That is true if he loses in November; it is even truer if he wins.</p>\n<p>\n\tTrump has already begun sowing seeds of doubt around this election’s legitimacy. He’s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/article/mail-in-voting-explained.html\">pushed</a> the baseless theory that mail-in votes will lead to widespread fraud, and some in his circle are reportedly <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/08/trump-wants-to-cut-mail-in-voting-the-republican-machine-is-helping-him-392428\">exploring</a> the option of trying to curb such voting by executive action.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere is also widespread concern that he is trying to <a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/08/trump-postal-service-sabotage-vote-by-mail.html\">sabotage</a> the US postal service, which many Americans will need to safely use to be able to vote in November. The new postmaster general, Louis DeJoy, appointed by a board of governors selected by the president, is a major Republican party donor. And in an interview with Fox Business Network, Trump himself implied that he wanted to prevent the post office from functioning properly because of the Democrats' support for mail-in votes: “Now they need that money in order to make the post office work so it can take all of these millions and millions of ballots,\" he said, adding: \"But if they don’t get those two items that means you can’t have universal mail-in voting, because they're not equipped.\"</p>\n<p>\n\tThese are attacks on the logistics of voting, but they also undermine the validity of this election. The same can be said for a tweet that Trump sent out late last month which suggested the vote be delayed. \"With Universal Mail-In Voting (not Absentee Voting, which is good), 2020 will be the most INACCURATE &amp; FRAUDULENT Election in history. It will be a great embarrassment to the USA,\" the president <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1288818160389558273?s=20\">tweeted</a>. \"Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???\"</p>\n<p>\n\t<em><strong>[See also: <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/what-happens-if-trump-refuses-electoral-defeat-2020-lawrence-douglas-will-he-go\">What would happen if Trump refused defeat?</a>]</strong></em></p>\n<p>\n\tThe president can’t actually delay the election, but he is already compromising it by using his powerful position to predict it will be inaccurate and fraudulent – and he will almost certainly continue doing so on election night.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn all likelihood, the result will not be called on 3 November, and will instead require a wait for votes to come in and be counted. But this is not what Americans are used to, and Trump will likely take this time to try to convince anyone who will listen that the game is rigged against him. (He has done something similar before, in 2016, when he claimed he would have won the popular vote but for millions of illegal votes. There was no evidence to support this claim.)</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen I <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/what-happens-if-trump-refuses-electoral-defeat-2020-lawrence-douglas-will-he-go\">interviewed</a> Lawrence Douglas, US legal scholar and author of <em>Will He Go?</em>, he drew a distinction between Trump admitting and accepting defeat.

If he wins, he’ll be in a position to spend four more years chipping away at the postal service, and working with his administration to dictate which Americans are able to exercise their legal right to vote.</p>\n<p>\n\tNor are those the only rights that Trump has worked to curtail while in office. There’s also the right to protest, which has been met with federal agents <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemimamcevoy/2020/07/17/trump-ordered-federal-agents-are-reportedly-pulling-protesters-into-unmarked-vehicles-drawing-outrage/#603c42a570de\">reportedly</a> throwing people in vans; there’s the right to seek asylum, which this administration has tried to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/08/politics/trump-asylum-coronavirus/index.html\">block</a>; and there’s the right to free press, which this administration has <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/media/486273-trump-escalates-fight-against-press-with-libel-lawsuits\">threatened</a> with libel.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe United States’ hypocritical position on civil and voting rights, immigration, and the freedoms of assembly and the press did not begin with Trump. But he’s the one who is, at present, best positioned to expand that hypocrisy; if he wins in November, he’ll be even better placed to do so.</p>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n          Getty Images      \n\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-image-caption field-type-text field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\">President Donald Trump</div></div></div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Sep 2020 10:26:21 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-1216826643.jpg?itok=K_HnmrjL","linkMd5":"0b3b776f49c51e614291ac50b4dfa71d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn99@2020_4/2020/09/05/09-02-08-954_ffe7caa6f4370408.webp","destWidth":790,"destHeight":350,"sourceBytes":58105,"destBytes":36354,"author":"Emily Tamkin","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-1216826643.jpg?itok=K_HnmrjL":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn99@2020_4/2020/09/05/09-02-08-954_ffe7caa6f4370408.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528285},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"Steve Richards&#039; Diary: Back onstage, why Boris Johnson will be miserable, and fear at the BBC  ","link":"https://www.newstatesman.com/2020/09/steve-richards-diary-back-onstage-why-boris-johnson-will-be-miserable-and-fear-bbc","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-field-subheadline field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"> <p>\n\tDuring lockdown I realised the stage is my favourite outlet, and just how different the Prime Minister is from all his recent predecessors.</p>\n </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><noscript class=\"adaptive-image\" data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=\"300 768 1024\" data-adaptive-image-300-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;300&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1210843789_1_.jpg?itok=TXdJ3Fh4&amp;amp;c=7cd0f12e6ff17377ccf07189c0841350&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-768-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;768&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1210843789_1_.jpg?itok=TXdJ3Fh4&amp;amp;c=7cd0f12e6ff17377ccf07189c0841350&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-1024-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;1024&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1210843789_1_.jpg?itok=TXdJ3Fh4&amp;amp;c=7cd0f12e6ff17377ccf07189c0841350&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-max-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;max&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1210843789_1_.jpg?itok=TXdJ3Fh4&amp;amp;c=7cd0f12e6ff17377ccf07189c0841350&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\"><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1210843789_1_.jpg?itok=V8iKeaT3\" alt=\"\" /></noscript>\n</div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\" property=\"content:encoded\"> <p style=\"clear: both;\">\n\tThere are many dark images from the Covid era, but those of empty theatres are among the more vivid. They show the killing of collective exuberance. Fortunately, some theatres and arts venues are opening again. This is good news for the obvious reason that many of them faced the threat of permanent closure, but for me there is another, more selfish consideration. Before the theatres closed I performed a regular one-man show, <em>Rock ‘n’ Roll Politics</em>, an (unreliable) guide to what was happening in the increasingly strange political world. I enjoyed the shows but saw them as little more than a hobby, the equivalent of playing golf. During lockdown I realised that I was hooked – that the good old-fashioned stage is my favourite outlet in the modern media era. With theatres closed, I performed live streams instead, and thousands paid to tune in.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt’s an interesting economic model, but staring at a computer is not the same as being with an audience. In its unpredictability the live show is a better representation of the wild waves of politics than the controlled structure of a column or the choreographed rhythms of the broadcasting studio. I have always wanted to be a politician and this is the closest I get. Virus restrictions permitting, I will be surfing the waves later this month, reopening in the main hall at Kings Place in north London, and performing for the first time at the Greenwich Theatre.</p>\n<h4>\n\tBias at the BBC</h4>\n<p>\n\tThe BBC is often unfairly accused of bias. But decisions such as what is sung at the Last Night of the Proms are driven more by fear. In this case, a worry about reflecting sensitivities in relation to the UK’s past collides with a terror of Tory-supporting newspapers and the right on Twitter. “How do we get out of this?” is a more likely proclamation within the layers of BBC management than any assertions of personal opinion.</p>\n<p>\n\tNonetheless, parts of the BBC do have a bias that is rarely considered: some programmes seem to be against letting items breathe for long. I remember taking part in a discussion on <em>Today</em> at the height of the financial crash. John Humphrys read the introduction: “It’s three minutes to nine. Has the financial crash changed British politics forever, and perhaps politics around the industrialised world? Joining me is the <em>Economist</em>’s Anne McElvoy and the <em>Independent</em>’s Steve Richards.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAnne answered first with speedy precision. When it was my turn, I noticed it was now one minute to nine. I began with a flourish. “All fashionable assumptions since the early 1980s have been turned on their head by what has happened…” Humphrys had no choice but to interrupt and declare, “That’s all we’ve got time for.” Similar time constraints still apply too often. There’s more space on a live stage.</p>\n<h4>\n\tAll in the delivery</h4>\n<p>\n\tWhen Ed Miliband was leader of the Labour Party, he raised with me an interesting question. Why is it that sometimes a speech or a performance is a great hit, while another address, prepared with the same assiduous care, can leave an audience offering “cricket applause” or worse?</p>\n<p>\n\tBefore the pandemic I would occasionally watch the same live stand-up show several times. Although the carefully rehearsed substance was the same, each performance was different. I could never work out why, and I bet the performer couldn’t either.</p>\n<h4>\n\tUnfavourable comparisons</h4>\n<p>\n\tBefore Boris Johnson, all modern prime ministers agonised over their annual conference speeches, often until the early hours on the day of delivery. It is an example of how Johnson differs greatly from his predecessors. His first conference speech as prime minister in Manchester last year was evidently composed hurriedly. I cannot remember a single phrase or argument.</p>\n<p>\n\tWriting an updated version of my book on modern prime ministers, I am struck by quite how different Johnson is from all his recent predecessors. The frantic U-turns over exams and the wearing of masks are an example. Most prime ministers plan ahead neurotically, exploring all possible eventualities. Johnson and his advisers proclaim their unyielding intention to stick to obviously fragile plans until the moment they scrap them.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere are other big differences. In hung parliaments, previous prime ministers reached out to other parties and wooed internal dissenters. By contrast, Johnson behaved like an emperor, removing the whip from rebels and accusing other parties of defying the will of “the people”.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn addition, previous prime ministers felt compelled to sack colleagues whom they rated. Tony Blair dumped his friend Peter Mandelson twice. Theresa May dismissed Damian Green, a rare confidant and unofficial deputy prime minister. Dominic Cummings and co remain in place.</p>\n<h4>\n\tWyatt’s wisdom</h4>\n<p>\n\tFor lockdown escapism I have been reading the diaries of Woodrow Wyatt, a columnist known as “the voice of reason” in the 1980s and 1990s – which is one way of describing a man who displayed doting loyalty to Margaret Thatcher and John Major. Wyatt spoke to both prime ministers weekly.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe diaries are known for the light they shine on the ruling political and media establishment. More revealing for me is how vulnerable Thatcher appeared to be when she confided in Wyatt. She appears to have been down a lot of the time, worried about newspaper coverage, opinion polls and treacherous colleagues, even though she enjoyed herself much more than most prime ministers. I am struck by how insecure and miserable prime ministers are a lot of the time, often with good cause. Boris Johnson faces bigger challenges than any of them. If he is not feeling insecure and miserable yet, he will be soon. On this, at least, he is not so different. </p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Steve Richards’ latest book is “The Prime Ministers: Reflections on Leadership from Wilson to Johnson” (Atlantic)</em></p>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n          Getty /  JUAN MABROMATA      \n\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 09:44:03 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1210843789_1_.jpg?itok=V8iKeaT3","linkMd5":"0afcf287364f46e729e3a1d819cb8cb8","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn38@2020_6/2020/09/05/09-02-11-310_005b4fa2ef67fac2.webp","destWidth":790,"destHeight":350,"sourceBytes":102495,"destBytes":77022,"author":"Anonymous","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1210843789_1_.jpg?itok=V8iKeaT3":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn38@2020_6/2020/09/05/09-02-11-310_005b4fa2ef67fac2.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528296},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"Where will Boris Johnson&#039;s next parliamentary defeat come from?","link":"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2020/09/where-will-boris-johnsons-next-parliamentary-defeat-come","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-field-subheadline field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"> <p>\n\tThere's one issue coming down the line with the potential to unite Conservative malcontents more than any other.</p>\n </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><noscript class=\"adaptive-image\" data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=\"300 768 1024\" data-adaptive-image-300-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;300&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1228293698.jpg?itok=6TWklJgj&amp;amp;c=cbcd8f275ee90c95e296f7a9435af74d&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-768-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;768&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1228293698.jpg?itok=6TWklJgj&amp;amp;c=cbcd8f275ee90c95e296f7a9435af74d&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-1024-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;1024&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1228293698.jpg?itok=6TWklJgj&amp;amp;c=cbcd8f275ee90c95e296f7a9435af74d&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-max-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;max&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1228293698.jpg?itok=6TWklJgj&amp;amp;c=cbcd8f275ee90c95e296f7a9435af74d&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\"><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1228293698.jpg?itok=g--W5Qpd\" alt=\"\" /></noscript>\n</div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\" property=\"content:encoded\"> <p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-40632087-7fff-1dcf-8204-6499014074d3\">Where will Boris Johnson’s next parliamentary defeat come from? It’s a question worth asking as Conservative MPs return to parliament this week, in just as fractious a mood as when they left for the holidays.  </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-40632087-7fff-1dcf-8204-6499014074d3\">Before recess, backbenchers were increasingly irritated at having to expend their political capital in defence of unpopular moves by this government, from the Dominic Cummings affair to free school meals, which saw their efforts to defend the government's position wasted when it eventually U-turned. They felt in the dark, cut out of governmental decision-making and unsupported by Downing Street when they went out to fend for the government in their constituencies. As </span><a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2020/06/boris-johnson-ignores-tory-backbenchers-his-peril\">I wrote in June</a>, the No 10 operation had effectively replaced traditional feedback from MPs with daily polling, but with a detrimental impact on internal party relations. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-40632087-7fff-1dcf-8204-6499014074d3\">These problems only worsened over the summer, despite many in the parliamentary party trying to put their concerns on ice over the holidays in an effort to switch off before what is expected to be a difficult parliamentary term. But now, after a summer of U-turns, Conservative MPs have returned to Westminster without much political capital left to expend on unpopular decisions, and in the full awareness that there will be plenty of those in the pipeline.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-40632087-7fff-1dcf-8204-6499014074d3\">“It’s pretty fractious,” says one senior Tory MP of the mood within the parliamentary party. “But it isn’t in tribes. It isn’t just blue-collar Tories or the shires Tories who are alienated. It’s everyone arguing about everything. You could say the party has become very atomised.” </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-40632087-7fff-1dcf-8204-6499014074d3\">This is the crucial point to consider in the months to come. Conservative MPs are pretty much universally alienated by months of tricky decisions to defend and embarrassing U-turns, but they are coming at things with different interests. Whether they unite in discontent over one particular issue will be the question that determines how smooth a ride Johnson has over the next few months. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-40632087-7fff-1dcf-8204-6499014074d3\">The issue most likely to cause a rebellion in the new parliamentary term is, perhaps improbably, planning reforms. It is hardly the biggest challenge the government faces in the coming months in terms of the big national picture (it must also deal with the triple challenge of coronavirus, the economic crisis and Brexit, with all of the possible tax rises, cuts, legislative logjams, controversies, and local lockdowns these may bring). But, for all of the internal disputes (or “massive arguments”, as one Tory puts it) that have already begun over plans for the budget in November, it is the internal politics of the Conservative Party that will see planning reforms, a relatively small aspect of the government’s economic programme, causing potentially the biggest upheaval in the months ahead.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-40632087-7fff-1dcf-8204-6499014074d3\">Earlier this summer, the government unveiled its plan for the “biggest shake-up of planning since World War Two”. The broad aim is to radically simplify the planning system in England, making it easier and more predictable for planning permission to be given to new developments, therefore making it more difficult for councils to block individual proposals. It is an area where the government’s pre-pandemic economic agenda aligns with its Covid recovery plans: the hope is that the changes will kick-start economic activity, while the algorithm that allocates targets for every area in England looks set to address discrepancies between areas in terms of affordability and current rates of housebuilding.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-40632087-7fff-1dcf-8204-6499014074d3\">Therein lies the problem. The reforms have prompted concerns from traditional shires Conservatives and their colleagues in the London suburbs: their seats are to be set the </span>highest targets of new homes to build<span>, which they worry would fundamentally change the character of their desirable, leafy constituencies, alienating their voter base in the process. One MP in such a seat describes the proposals as simply a “non-starter”. The government has always known it would take a lot of political capital to ram these changes through, but, with a majority of 80 and a broadly happy parliamentary party, it didn’t seem an impossible task.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-40632087-7fff-1dcf-8204-6499014074d3\">This government is often criticised for a lack of conviction, led by a Prime Minister with few deeply-held principles: the man who famously wrote two speeches before deciding where he stood on the Brexit debate. But this is a rare example of the government being prepared to drive through something unpopular with an eye to longer-term outcomes and the principles it hopes to be remembered for: a disruptive, radical spirit and a “levelling up” agenda with a lasting impact on the UK economy. The objections from backbenchers to this early attempt to do so expose the tension inherent in “levelling up”: a programme that sees expensive, desirable areas become more affordable and accessible by people of lower incomes is alienating to plenty of Tory voters and disruptive to the Conservatives’ very voter base at a seat-by-seat level. Somewhere in these concerns from backbenchers there’s the germ of a profound problem with levelling up: if this government “levels up” too well, will traditional Conservative heartlands still be Tory?    </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\tBut these aren’t the only Conservative MPs with worries over the plans. Some Conservatives, who happily dismiss their parliamentary colleagues as “NIMBYs” for their objections to the plans, have profound concerns about the quality of the housing that these reforms will produce. If new areas become built up with potentially very low-quality housing, they worry that the government will be creating the “slums of tomorrow” that will amount to a sort of “social cleansing”, as one senior Tory puts it. Indeed, these reforms are almost universally unpopular: the Labour Party, homelessness charities, architectural boards have expressed their objections, while non-profit organisations raise concerns over the potential for corruption and lobbying with the new rules.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-40632087-7fff-1dcf-8204-6499014074d3\">A consultation on the proposals has begun and will conclude at the end of October. It will be a tricky period for the government, coinciding with the end of the furlough scheme and the final run-up to Rishi Sunak’s budget. And the problem is that, after months of U-turns, Conservative MPs have reasonable grounds to believe that with a bit of pressure, they can change the government's position. Watch out for the issue that could well unite the malcontents and hand Boris Johnson his next parliamentary defeat.  </span></p>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n          Getty      \n\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Sep 2020 15:48:41 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1228293698.jpg?itok=g--W5Qpd","linkMd5":"d52f22fb63808fd9ec14eea9172f15cd","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn60@2020_2/2020/09/05/09-02-08-902_d0f4928f1af21e35.webp","destWidth":790,"destHeight":350,"sourceBytes":51832,"destBytes":29750,"author":"Ailbhe Rea","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1228293698.jpg?itok=g--W5Qpd":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn60@2020_2/2020/09/05/09-02-08-902_d0f4928f1af21e35.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528282},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"Why we must accept that our return to the office is essential for jobs and economic recovery","link":"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/economy/2020/09/why-we-must-accept-our-return-office-essential-jobs-and-economic-recovery","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-field-subheadline field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"> <p>\n\tLockdown was for too long allowed to be an existential space.</p>\n </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><noscript class=\"adaptive-image\" data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=\"300 768 1024\" data-adaptive-image-300-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;300&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1207592004_1_.jpg?itok=00z6JL2U&amp;amp;c=aeddf52b419267b0761ce8c4e3c863e0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-768-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;768&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1207592004_1_.jpg?itok=00z6JL2U&amp;amp;c=aeddf52b419267b0761ce8c4e3c863e0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-1024-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;1024&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1207592004_1_.jpg?itok=00z6JL2U&amp;amp;c=aeddf52b419267b0761ce8c4e3c863e0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-max-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;max&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1207592004_1_.jpg?itok=00z6JL2U&amp;amp;c=aeddf52b419267b0761ce8c4e3c863e0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\"><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1207592004_1_.jpg?itok=lqIXrM8Z\" alt=\"\" /></noscript>\n</div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\" property=\"content:encoded\"> <p>\n\tBy the end of March, the present economic crisis was already historically unprecedented. Never before had governments across the world shut economies down to impose a quarantine on the healthy and sick alike, and never before had central banks turned themselves into, as one investor quipped about the Federal Reserve, the “lender of all resorts”.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis economic emergency has also inverted the relationship between energy costs and falling production. Since the Second World War recessions in Western economies have generally come after a surge in oil prices. This one has arrived after they declined in the first months of this year, and following nearly six years of prices better suited to consumers than producers.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs millions of jobs were lost in the United States and the cost of extending furlough schemes mounted in Europe, by June it seemed the decisions made to put the world economy into storage might be catastrophic mistakes. National lockdowns that began without a stated end-point presumed not only that economies could wait for the pandemic to abate, but that they could be paused for an unknown length of time and the odds would still be stacked in favour of a rapid V-shaped recovery.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is quite possible that governments did not really understand the judgement they were making because the risk of healthcare services collapsing overwhelmed all other considerations. But once, after a month or so of lockdown, their aim appeared to drift nearer to eliminating the virus than containing it, they doubled down on this judgement as if central bank monetary alchemy would be a sufficient recovery strategy. Asked in his interview with the <em>Financial Times </em>in April whether there was a “maximum number of months after which the lockdown becomes intolerable for the economy”, Emmanuel Macron replied, “I don’t know, and I must be able to answer ‘I don’t know’.”</p>\n<p>\n\tNow it is evident that autumn will come without definitive progress on a vaccine and no prospects at all of a V-shaped recovery. Fearful of this reality, Boris Johnson’s government has moved into economic panic mode, telling people who have been working at home that the risk of economic disaster must prevail over the fear of getting ill. But this is the same terrible predicament that has existed from the start, and acting for months as if it were not so has only exacerbated the problem.</p>\n<p>\n\tLockdown was for too long allowed to be an existential space. Some people may be desperate to get back to their old lives but many palpably are not. The British economy – perhaps more than any other given London’s outsized role – depends on habitual daily movement.</p>\n<p>\n\tHad the government told people to break their habits for a few weeks, they probably would not have lost them. But, given longer, the potential costs of movement became ever more likely to press hard into people’s consciousness.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhatever the experiment in accelerated digitalisation over the past six months has proved about home working on its own merits, employment in the economy as we know it depends on plenty of unnecessary movement and some degree of pretence. This state of affairs could not be unravelled without unravelling much else too. Commuting may not be essential, but hundreds of thousands are employed and a great volume of commercial property debt is serviceable because large numbers of people endure it. That movement-based economic activity also supports much of cities’ cultural life.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere has been a paradox at work for the last decade. A wide awareness that economic and ecological problems run very deep has co-existed with a political assumption that almost any problem could be fixed with more credit, more political will, more concern for inequality, more technology.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the times are now more dangerous than this kind of matter-of-faith optimism allows. We know the political risks that high unemployment has historically wrought, although since Britain was spared it after the 2008 crash, we may have forgotten.</p>\n<p>\n\tNobody, however, knows what a large unemployment shock looks like when monetary policy is already set to an extraordinarily accommodative stance; society’s employed are divided between those who must work in person and those who refuse to; a young generation is already underemployed in relation to their aspirations and largely shut out of home ownership; and a disruptive energy revolution is under way. And this is before considering that the bilateral Sino-American relationship around which the world economy has pivoted for nearly two decades is breaking down, the United Kingdom is threatened by Scottish secession, and the present chances for reaching a post-Brexit agreement with the European Union to avoid reverting to World Trade Organisation-based trading are unpropitious.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe need to learn quickly what dangers lie ahead. If zoonotic diseases that spread across the globe by air travel come to be considered a permanent risk, the world economy as it has functioned since the era of cheap flights may be unrecoverable. In the lacuna, the scope for transformative economic action, including in the ways we work and the place of work in our individual lives, may seem enormous. But that temptation is an illusion: in opting for rapid change to make things better we cannot know that what we are doing won’t make them much worse.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor the time being, the employment imperative must be to accept what we already know, however unpalatable it seems: that physically moving ourselves around the country is an economic necessity. </p>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n          Getty      \n\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-image-caption field-type-text field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\">A commuter wears a mask whilst walking across London Bridge during the morning rush hour on 18 March 2020</div></div></div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 10:38:00 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1207592004_1_.jpg?itok=lqIXrM8Z","linkMd5":"0c33e8afed8e4e457ce5fd11dd8fbc79","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn82@2020_3/2020/09/05/09-02-10-956_d348198be2760a08.webp","destWidth":790,"destHeight":350,"sourceBytes":46575,"destBytes":24992,"author":"Helen Thompson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1207592004_1_.jpg?itok=lqIXrM8Z":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn82@2020_3/2020/09/05/09-02-10-956_d348198be2760a08.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528295},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"Commons Confidential: Rishi Sunak’s indigestion","link":"https://www.newstatesman.com/international/2020/09/commons-confidential-rishi-sunak-s-indigestion","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-field-subheadline field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"> <p>\n\tYour weekly dose of gossip from around Westminster. </p>\n </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><noscript class=\"adaptive-image\" data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=\"300 768 1024\" data-adaptive-image-300-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;300&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1264484924.jpg?itok=fGr_sAjP&amp;amp;c=ce3f31c8b1869a0d66a6c49c17f0d5b8&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-768-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;768&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1264484924.jpg?itok=fGr_sAjP&amp;amp;c=ce3f31c8b1869a0d66a6c49c17f0d5b8&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-1024-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;1024&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1264484924.jpg?itok=fGr_sAjP&amp;amp;c=ce3f31c8b1869a0d66a6c49c17f0d5b8&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-max-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;max&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1264484924.jpg?itok=fGr_sAjP&amp;amp;c=ce3f31c8b1869a0d66a6c49c17f0d5b8&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\"><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1264484924.jpg?itok=Onv4SrBT\" alt=\"\" /></noscript>\n</div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\" property=\"content:encoded\"> <p>\n\t<strong>Meal deal Chancellor Rishi</strong> Sunak, the Ronald McDonald of Boris Johnson’s cabinet chain, is developing financial indigestion. With public borrowing and national debt ballooning to startling levels, my snout reports a panicking Treasury money man may be on the verge of cancelling his autumn big Budget. The statement, setting out spending plans for the rest of the parliament, was billed as the defining economic moment of Johnson’s government. Amid fears of a devastating second Covid-19 wave, it may be replaced by a short-term package until the plague is contained. Ending the furlough scheme on Halloween risks a jobs bloodbath horror.

Sunak, basking in popularity bought by £10 off dinners, may find the praise lasts as long as it takes to eat a Big Mac.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>The chap is for turning</strong> and Johnson’s dizzying U-turns are a crisis proving an opportunity for certain Tories. A newly elected “Red Wall” MP revealed she sends sympathetic responses to constituents writing to complain about government policies, pledging to lobby the relevant ministers. When the almost inevitable climbdown is announced by No 10, she and colleagues adopting the same strategy share the credit. The only consistent side of Johnson is his inconsistency.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Football’s boardroom battles</strong> and dressing room brawls are child’s play compared with the fight over who captains the Westminster team. Play is halted not by the virus but a civil war. Labour MPs are boycotting posts on the all-parliamentary group after veteran Clive Betts was ousted as chair by studs-up Tory Karl McCartney, so the squad cannot be formally constituted. McCartney has refused to compromise by accepting bite-yer-legs Betts as co-chair. In SW1 the VAR system isn’t football’s most controversial development.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Taking time out from moving</strong> the Prime Minister’s top advisers into a cavernous call centre in 70 Whitehall – billed as a Nasa-style control room – weirdo misfit Dominic Cummings is poised to visit secretive Porton Down, on his bucket list of military outposts. One of the mandarins responsible for the tour whispered they intend to flatter the geek with high-grade science. Perhaps the onetime home of Britain’s biological and chemical weapons research could develop a simple eye test to save concerned motorists a 30-mile drive to Barnard Castle.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Labour’s shadow cabinet </strong>office minister Cat Smith, and Holly Lynch, the shadow immigration minister, are the latest MPs for Doppelganger Central. The BBC incorrectly captioned Halifax’s Lynch as Lancaster’s Smith. Both will hope Keir Starmer knows the difference when he has a promotion to hand out. </p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Kevin Maguire is the associate editor (politics) of the Daily Mirror</em></p>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n          Getty Images      \n\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-image-caption field-type-text field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\">Eating out: Rishi Sunak </div></div></div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 09:28:03 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1264484924.jpg?itok=Onv4SrBT","linkMd5":"f0bee54caebc8ab3430b1b0a319bad2a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn4@2020_2/2020/09/05/09-02-08-947_701df74dddfe5aea.webp","destWidth":790,"destHeight":350,"sourceBytes":42920,"destBytes":27094,"author":"Kevin Maguire","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1264484924.jpg?itok=Onv4SrBT":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn4@2020_2/2020/09/05/09-02-08-947_701df74dddfe5aea.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528296},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"In isolation, I am starting to dissect my old relationships","link":"https://www.newstatesman.com/2020/08/isolation-i-am-starting-dissect-my-old-relationships","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-field-subheadline field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"> <p>\n\tWhat started as a distraction morphed into a bona fide hobby – I spent hours reading through digital exchanges, from outpourings to quick back-and-forths.</p>\n </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><noscript class=\"adaptive-image\" data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=\"300 768 1024\" data-adaptive-image-300-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;300&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-936215654.jpg?itok=3m6W5Rgt&amp;amp;c=33930f0b40122f557d8bd93c068f0d74&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-768-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;768&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-936215654.jpg?itok=3m6W5Rgt&amp;amp;c=33930f0b40122f557d8bd93c068f0d74&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-1024-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;1024&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-936215654.jpg?itok=3m6W5Rgt&amp;amp;c=33930f0b40122f557d8bd93c068f0d74&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-max-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;max&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-936215654.jpg?itok=3m6W5Rgt&amp;amp;c=33930f0b40122f557d8bd93c068f0d74&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\"><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-936215654.jpg?itok=HAhWmCh2\" alt=\"\" /></noscript>\n</div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\" property=\"content:encoded\"> <p>\n\tIt’s one in the morning and I’m lying in bed scrolling through Facebook messages that are nearly five years old. My phone is glowing in the dark and my eyes are heavy and dehydrated.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is not the first time I’ve done this since lockdown began in March; it won’t be the last. I’m looking closely at my relationships for the precise point at which things tipped from being “how it was then” to “how it is now”. And to my surprise, I’m struggling to find these pivotal moments, so I keep scrolling.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor many, the past few months have been packed with time-destroying routines – managing childcare and home-schooling, or a potentially dangerous key-worker job. But for others, the opposite has occurred: there has been too much idle time and too little to do with it. It has created space for introspection. And for me, it has created space to press my face up against a magnifying glass, dissecting my own behaviour and the minutiae of my relationships, under the guise of self-improvement.</p>\n<p>\n\tI’ve always prided myself on my understanding of human emotions and my ability to handle conflict healthily. At 26 years old, I’ve “done therapy” five times – the first three stints as a child and the other two as an adult. Mostly I went because of something traumatic: on these occasions I was forced, probably too young, to learn about the effects of different interpersonal dynamics. But through this education, I grew to see myself as an expert on my own emotional functions and flaws.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis expertise was something I became known for among my friends – I was everyone’s confidant or conflict mediator. Just as regularly as I absorbed guidance, I dished it out to those who wanted it.  I colluded with myself to create a false equivalency: that by simply understanding my vulnerabilities, I had effectively learned to act on them. Being in isolation for six months has exacerbated this delusion, with an even more lopsided lack of output.</p>\n<p>\n\tI began to think more about what I’d be doing now if things were normal. I noticed myself reaching for nostalgia as an escape. I became obsessed with revisiting past versions of myself, comparing how well I knew people before with how well I know them now. I found my mind wandering towards the quasi-romantic friendships I had in my early twenties that have since faded away.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat started as an occasional distraction morphed into a bonafide hobby. I spent hours reading through digital exchanges, from emotional outpourings to quick back-and-forths about day-to-day plans. I convinced myself that I did this to unwind; that this was, in fact, relaxing. Weeks passed indulging this anxiety-fuelled pastime, under the guise that I was learning. This is what self-improvement looked like, I told myself.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut every time I scrolled back through my conversation archive, that perception of self-progression would fall apart. I’d wake up, jaw aching, wondering why my anxiety was only deepening. Why was all this personal growth leaving me so drained?</p>\n<p>\n\tEach step I took closer to myself, the more the wider picture was obscured. I realised how easy it is to forget that, despite having mustered the energy to put yourself under the microscope, analysis for its own sake does not translate into change.</p>\n<p>\n\tI’ve started to accept that however well I know myself, I may not be particularly adept at altering my behaviour. I’ve begun to practise the ways I could be better. I’ve tried to be more vulnerable rather than simply stating what my vulnerabilities are. I’ve tried to be less intense and self-brutalising, and have also accepted that even my best intentions might not be enough. And I’ve tried to stop looking at the messages I sent to friends when I was only 20.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt’s easy to get too close to our self-image when we have a lot of time on our hands. But it’s also easy to convince ourselves that our hands are tied when they aren’t. I have begun to question the value of harsh self-analysis when the time we’re in is so unforgiving. But we must also accept that the ability to spot our own bad habits is merely sport when we do nothing to fix them.</p>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n          Getty      \n\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 14:20:57 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-936215654.jpg?itok=HAhWmCh2","linkMd5":"4cd626fb8f14188be8430fcc87a14cd5","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn3@2020_3/2020/09/05/09-02-09-947_87199895ff899c8b.webp","destWidth":790,"destHeight":350,"sourceBytes":29751,"destBytes":16530,"author":"Sarah Manavis","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-936215654.jpg?itok=HAhWmCh2":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn3@2020_3/2020/09/05/09-02-09-947_87199895ff899c8b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528311},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":" Why the government’s new quarantine payments are almost completely useless","link":"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/health/2020/08/why-government-s-new-quarantine-payments-are-almost-completely-useless","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-field-subheadline field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"> <p>\n\tCould you self-isolate on £13 a day?

Yet for many others – particularly low-paid workers who cannot work from home, and are more precariously employed – the only immediate support is Britain’s extremely low rate of statutory sick pay: £95.85 per week.</p>\n<p>\n\tThese workers can also apply for Universal Credit, but it takes a minimum of five weeks before the first payment is made, so this would only kick in long beyond their period of quarantine. Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) is also available, but only if you’re not eligible for statutory sick pay (you can’t claim both ESA and statutory sick pay), and comes to £74.35 a week for those temporarily off work.</p>\n<h4>\n\t<em><a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2020/08/care-worker-left-without-sick-pay-during-quarantine-under-government-self-isolation\"><strong>See also: Care worker left without sick pay during quarantine under government self-isolation rules</strong></a></em></h4>\n<p>\n\tThe government appears finally to have noticed this very obvious gap in its fight against the virus. It is trialling a new self-isolation payment from Tuesday in parts of north-west England. Details of the system, however, reveal a further failure to engage with the problem.</p>\n<p>\n\tPeople on low incomes in places with high coronavirus concentration in England, who claim Universal Credit or working tax credits and cannot work from home, will be able to claim up to £182 if they have to self-isolate.</p>\n<p>\n\tThose testing positive for the virus will receive £130 to isolate for ten days, those who share a household with a positive case will receive up to £182 to isolate for 14 days, and others who meet the eligibility criteria could receive £13 a day.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut these payments are marginally lower than statutory sick pay – a rate that the Health Secretary Matt Hancock has already admitted <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/coronavirus-uk-statutory-sick-pay-matt-hancock-question-time-covid-19-a9413821.html\">he couldn’t live on</a>.

His mother, a garment worker, played the lead role in the 1930s musical <em>Pins &amp; Needles</em>, the only ever Broadway hit to have been produced by a labour union. His father fought in the International Brigades against Franco’s fascist forces in the Spanish Civil War between 1937 and 1939. Graeber’s lifelong commitment to what he called “<a href=\"https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/TCYACVvmnF2Qx5JhGD6u1?domain=newleftreview.org\" target=\"_blank\">small-a anarchism</a>” – an approach to libertarian socialism, “whose ideological practice”, Graeber wrote, “consists of teaching by example” – was forged within this febrile family environment.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe maturation of his political views was also influenced by his ground-breaking work as an anthropologist. Graeber enrolled for a PhD at the University of Chicago in the late 1980s, where he wrote his thesis on magic and the legacy of slavery in Madagascar. He established a reputation as a prodigious scholar and won a prestigious appointment at Yale University, where he published extensively on the anthropology of value and exchange.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut academic success never prevented Graeber from being politically active. Around the turn of the century, he became a prominent organiser in the global justice movement, which protested against the neoliberal policies of the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organisation. While he resolved to keep his scholarship at Yale separate from his activism in New York, his anti-capitalist views alienated him from the faculty. In 2005, the university controversially refused to renew his contract – Graeber and his supporters <a href=\"https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/Vo3ECWPnoF6o5PEtxxKI4?domain=nytimes.com\" target=\"_blank\">claimed</a> that the reasons for this were political rather than academic.</p>\n<p>\n\tDespite his impressive research record, Graeber struggled to find a job in the US, and in 2008 he moved to the UK for a teaching post at Goldsmiths, University of London. He then accepted a professorship at the London School of Economics in 2013.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs an anthropologist, Graeber understood “how different cultures define the world in radically different ways”. Having conducted extensive ethnographic fieldwork in the central highlands of Madagascar, he <a href=\"https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/XlvqCY76qtDBLN7uVr2dH?domain=thewhitereview.org/\" target=\"_blank\">saw</a> how the island’s “hybrid rebel culture, created by a population of escaped slaves”, had generated alternative views and definitions of political concepts such as obligation and authority.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe insights he gained through this research pushed Graeber to examine the elemental phenomena of modern Anglo-American society: How did late-capitalist culture come to define money and debt in the way that it does? Why do we value some types of work more than others? And what is the real meaning of democracy? Does democracy even exist?</p>\n<p>\n\tThese were the subversive questions at the core of his writing that established Graeber as one of the most notable thinkers of the crisis-ridden 2010s. His commercial breakthrough came in 2011, with the publication of the acclaimed <a href=\"https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/QCJfCZ84rI7B5D6Fxhhf8?domain=en.wikipedia.org\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Debt: The First 5,000 Years</em></a>, a magisterial study that undermined the longstanding assumptions of mainstream economics about the origins of money and debt.</p>\n<p>\n\tGraeber demonstrated how money, far from being rooted in a peaceful process of market exchange, really emerged from the unequal power relation between debtor and creditor, marked by a long and complex history of violence and morality. Its publication was meticulously timed: <em>Debt</em> came out just before the Occupy movement in September 2011, which endeavoured to highlight the central role of Wall Street in perpetuating a debt-based economy that favoured the financial elite.</p>\n<p>\n\tGraeber himself played an active part in the Occupy movement, coordinating meetings at Zuccotti Park and helping to coin the movement’s famous battle cry: “We are the 99 percent.”</p>\n<p>\n\tIn subsequent works, written in his witty and playful style, Graeber brought his anthropological training to bear on topics such as democracy (“one of the earliest really democratic institutions were pirate ships”), bureaucracy (“a cop is a bureaucrat with a gun”), and technology (“where, in short, are the flying cars?”). One of his most influential essays, “<a href=\"https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/oKv2C16j3F6WMk4t1-55j?domain=strike.coop/\" target=\"_blank\">On the Phenomenon of Bullshit Jobs</a>”, became a successful book in 2018 that interrogated the emergence of ever more meaningless forms of work. “Huge swathes of people in Europe and North America,” he argued, “spend their entire working lives performing tasks they secretly believe do not really need to be performed. The moral and spiritual damage that comes from this situation is profound. It is a scar across our collective soul”.</p>\n<p>\n\tOne reason for Graeber’s popularity on the left lay in his capacity to communicate complex ideas to a wide audience, combining engaging prose with disarming humour (a rare quality among his contemporaries). He revitalised old concepts such as class and revolution, but in a way that gave readers the feeling they had encountered something new and exhilarating, even if Graeber was openly building on ideas developed over the course of a long-standing tradition of popular struggle.</p>\n<p>\n\tCharacteristically generous, Graeber spent his life fighting for a freer, more joyous and egalitarian world. He leaves behind an impressive body of work, including an unpublished manuscript co-authored with the archaeologist David Wengrow, an ambitious deep history tentatively titled<em> The Dawn of Everything</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe full scope of Graeber’s political and intellectual legacy is yet to be grasped. But if there is one thing that endures in his writings, it is the force of hope in times of universal crisis and despair. “The ultimate, hidden truth of the world,” Graeber once wrote, “is that it is something that we make, and could just as easily make differently.”</p>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n          Goldsmiths      \n\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 04 Sep 2020 15:12:23 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/david_graeber_free_to_use_credit_goldsmiths_university.jpg?itok=s1H0vjdl","linkMd5":"0971b7196b5236b158c20e40d36db93d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn78@2020_3/2020/09/05/09-02-11-007_18bc523db7114e2a.webp","destWidth":790,"destHeight":350,"sourceBytes":27636,"destBytes":13742,"author":"Jerome Roos","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/david_graeber_free_to_use_credit_goldsmiths_university.jpg?itok=s1H0vjdl":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn78@2020_3/2020/09/05/09-02-11-007_18bc523db7114e2a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528278},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"The Proms row is just the beginning of Tim Davie&#039;s battle to save the BBC","link":"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/media/2020/08/proms-row-just-beginning-tim-davies-battle-save-bbc","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-field-subheadline field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"> <p>\n\tThe new director-general takes over next week at a time of unprecedented political and financial uncertainty for the corporation.</p>\n </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><noscript class=\"adaptive-image\" data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=\"300 768 1024\" data-adaptive-image-300-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;300&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-1183220488.jpg?itok=8taBEW1e&amp;amp;c=b2a68e42ff8017710d2398a086d45fcd&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-768-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;768&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-1183220488.jpg?itok=8taBEW1e&amp;amp;c=b2a68e42ff8017710d2398a086d45fcd&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-1024-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;1024&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-1183220488.jpg?itok=8taBEW1e&amp;amp;c=b2a68e42ff8017710d2398a086d45fcd&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-max-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;max&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-1183220488.jpg?itok=8taBEW1e&amp;amp;c=b2a68e42ff8017710d2398a086d45fcd&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\"><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-1183220488.jpg?itok=YxOcGDB6\" alt=\"\" /></noscript>\n</div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\" property=\"content:encoded\"> <p>\n\tThe traditional British brouhaha about the Last Night of the Proms illustrates the challenge faced by Tim Davie as he prepares to start work, next week, as the new director-general of the BBC. The corporation is still central to our national life, but it is caught between the demands of new audiences and the expectations of its loyalists – and whichever way it turns, it seems its number of opponents will increase. Add an unfriendly government and a financial crisis, and the path to success becomes ever harder to find.</p>\n<p>\n\tDavie takes over at a time when the corporation urgently needs a new sense of direction. He may have appeared to be the continuity candidate: one of the outgoing DG Tony Hall’s key lieutenants, supported by many senior colleagues, and a known quantity with 15 years of BBC board experience. The truth, though, is that he may have to be a revolutionary: the external and internal pressures on the BBC mean that “no change” is no longer an option.</p>\n<p>\n\tBBC executives are fond of Hall, but many have been bothered by his avoidance of the tougher strategic decisions they believe are overdue. “I think Tony himself accepts that it is time for something different,” says one. These decisions cannot be avoided because the financial outlook is bleak. It isn’t known whether Hall plans to emulate the Labour politician Liam Byrne and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/09/liam-byrne-apology-letter-there-is-no-money-labour-general-election\">leave a letter</a> behind saying “there is no more money”, but there is certainly no magic money tree outside New Broadcasting House. The figures in red dominate: paying for the over-75s’ licence fees has been costing the BBC <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-53347021#\">an extra £35m a month</a> during the health emergency; there’s the threat of decriminalisation of non-payment, which could cost hundreds of millions; an absence of its annual dividend from commercial arm BBC Studios, also because of the pandemic; and undelivered savings from the last budget round after Hall withdrew controversial plans for cuts to BBC News. Further politically toxic savings <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-53263793\">have been announced</a> in nations and regions. “They are royally screwed,” says one corporation finance expert.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis would be a grim picture even without the likely long-term trends. The BBC has come into its own during the coronavirus crisis as an institution that can bring the nation together, and it has been buoyed by increased consumption levels even among younger audiences. But there are already signs that these will not endure, and consent for the licence fee will remain shaky if the media habits of the young resume their regular pattern. That in turn feeds the blood lust of the Tory right, who see a way to diminishing the corporation by extolling the virtues of drama and entertainment on YouTube, Netflix and the rest. One well-placed corporation figure notes that there are the looming 2022-23 licence fee and charter mid-point reviews, adding that “time is short to make a compelling case, and to get the BBC seen as a critical investment”. The national and international economic meltdown makes that task even tougher.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd yet… the BBC still has a much bigger budget and a more guaranteed income stream than its UK commercial rivals. ITV or Channel 4 can only dream of £5bn a year coming into their bank accounts. One critic says the financial crisis in the BBC is partly self-inflicted: “they created an inherently unstable economic model in the digital era, cemented by the BBC’s inability to stop doing things while they continued to add more and more”. The question for Davie, then, is whether he can get the size and shape of the organisation right, and match that to its core funding, in a way that has eluded his predecessors.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em><strong>[see also: <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2020/02/how-bbc-can-defeat-grave-threat-conservatives\">How the BBC can defeat the grave threat from the Conservatives</a>]</strong></em></p>\n<p>\n\tOne former senior television executive outlines a possible approach. “BBC drama has stayed in the game despite being outspent ten-fold by its competitors,” he says, citing shows such as <em>The Night Manager</em> and <em>Normal People</em>, “because the quality of commissioning and production has stayed up to par. But what the BBC doesn’t need is three or four terrestrial channels to spread its drama across.” Another figure with experience of running BBC budgets concurs: “If ever ‘fewer, bigger, better’ should apply, it’s now.” The corporate strategists will, of course, be reluctant to saw off limbs if it risks the commitment to universality. But that may be forced upon them, and it could even be an ultimatum that the corporation needs. What parts of the BBC's output should in future be funded by the state for the good of the state – and what might be discarded or be paid for directly by new financial models? An experienced observer believes that “Tim getting on the front foot with this kind of initiative\" could change the mood.</p>\n<p>\n\tAlso at the top of the Davie in-tray will be the future of BBC News. He himself is not a journalist, but it is a curiosity of the Hall regime that the outgoing DG – a very effective director of news under John Birt – has seemed uncertain as editor-in-chief, from his unfathomable defence of the Cliff Richard coverage to persistent crises about impartiality. Trust ratings are still high, but being eroded; and one of Hall’s colleagues who is normally stout in the defence of the BBC compares the current position on employees’ use of social media to “the Wild West”, with an urgent need for management control. I anticipate Davie will take early action to sort this out.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em><strong>[see also: <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2020/04/bbc-and-journalism-fear\">The BBC and the journalism of fear</a>]</strong></em></p>\n<p>\n\tThe particular problem for the BBC is that many of its staff's Twitter feeds reveal the metropolitan, Remainer, liberal bias that its critics have always suspected; and there is a battle ahead too to counter that perception about the mainstream output. It is fine for the BBC to be a liberal organisation internally, and it still needs to do more to increase the diversity of its staff. But it is not acceptable for the BBC on air to morph into a news organisation like America’s MSNBC, which is open about its left-of-centre position. <a href=\"https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2020-06/DNR_2020_FINAL.pdf\">Recent research</a> by the Reuters Institute of Journalism at Oxford says there is still a strong public demand in the UK – 76 per cent of those surveyed - for news to be “neutral”.  Davie should stick on his wall Matthew Syed’s recent piece in the <em>Sunday Times</em>, which <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/if-the-bbc-picks-a-side-it-will-already-have-lost-xq3nz35zp\">argued</a> that any corrosion of the BBC’s reputation for impartiality “is of unusually grave importance… This could yet destroy the BBC itself, turning a great organisation into a facet of polarisation rather than a bulwark against it.”</p>\n<p>\n\t<em><strong>[see also: <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/media/2020/05/bbc-emily-maitlis-newsnight-dominic-cummings-impartiality\">The BBC must strive to be impartial but it should never be timid</a>]</strong></em></p>\n<p>\n\tRelated to that is the imperative to make devolution real, and to reflect the whole of the UK. The BBC has been good at moving staff into the nations and regions, but much less effective at giving them real power. Almost all the top decision-makers still sit in a small piece of real estate in W1A, and it is time to give authority and budgets to those in places such as Glasgow and Salford in a way that enables them to overrule a London view, rather than the other way round.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere are, of course, many more pages in Davie’s “to do” list – much of it about regulation and distribution and influencing legislation: the kind of stuff that is a hard slog but vital if public service broadcasting is to retain its prominence in a digital era. And he will have to cope with the Proms-type storms that accompany any DG. One of the current executives notes that we should never underestimate how difficult the job can be and how much fire-fighting is involved, citing the amount of management time spent on the equal pay debacle.     </p>\n<p>\n\tDavie will therefore need luck. But he also has the opportunity in his early days to set an agenda and seize control of events. He will, I sense, do that. Change is coming – like it or not.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>A previous version of this article was published by the Royal Television Society.</em></p>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n          Leon Neal / Getty Images      \n\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-image-caption field-type-text field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\">Tim Davie</div></div></div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 28 Aug 2020 10:52:17 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-1183220488.jpg?itok=YxOcGDB6","linkMd5":"eaae6206c1f6679cc3a6a7cbbade71d1","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn58@2020_1/2020/09/05/09-02-11-252_abddf446230de21f.webp","destWidth":790,"destHeight":350,"sourceBytes":32509,"destBytes":17274,"author":"Roger Mosey","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-1183220488.jpg?itok=YxOcGDB6":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn58@2020_1/2020/09/05/09-02-11-252_abddf446230de21f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528299},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"Al fresco distancing and £28 hand sanitiser: the rise of Covid luxury","link":"https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2020/08/al-fresco-distancing-and-28-hand-sanitiser-rise-covid-luxury","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-field-subheadline field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"> <p>\n\tHow high-end brands are repackaging the pandemic as an indulgent experience for consumers. </p>\n </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><noscript class=\"adaptive-image\" data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=\"300 768 1024\" data-adaptive-image-300-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;300&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/08/soap.jpg?itok=83wJ40zr&amp;amp;c=8bf8e97b1795e820dbd8d5cb252a0cbd&quot; alt=&quot;A soap dispenser on a bed of pink silk.&quot; title=&quot;A soap dispenser on a bed of pink silk.&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-768-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;768&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/08/soap.jpg?itok=83wJ40zr&amp;amp;c=8bf8e97b1795e820dbd8d5cb252a0cbd&quot; alt=&quot;A soap dispenser on a bed of pink silk.&quot; title=&quot;A soap dispenser on a bed of pink silk.&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-1024-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;1024&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/08/soap.jpg?itok=83wJ40zr&amp;amp;c=8bf8e97b1795e820dbd8d5cb252a0cbd&quot; alt=&quot;A soap dispenser on a bed of pink silk.&quot; title=&quot;A soap dispenser on a bed of pink silk.&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-max-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;max&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/08/soap.jpg?itok=83wJ40zr&amp;amp;c=8bf8e97b1795e820dbd8d5cb252a0cbd&quot; alt=&quot;A soap dispenser on a bed of pink silk.&quot; title=&quot;A soap dispenser on a bed of pink silk.&quot; /&gt;\"><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/08/soap.jpg?itok=Nx8Q_gWo\" alt=\"A soap dispenser on a bed of pink silk.\" title=\"A soap dispenser on a bed of pink silk.\" /></noscript>\n</div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\" property=\"content:encoded\"> <p>\n\tFour Thieves hand sanitiser, made by the botanics company Amass, costs £28 for a 16 oz bottle. Gracing the world’s country clubs, private ski resorts and upscale hotels, a single spritz promises to transport the user to “candle-lit bistros, cabin getaways, and the bustling markets of Marrakesh”.</p>\n<p>\n\tHand sanitiser is having an Instagram moment. While coronavirus ravages its way through the world’s most deprived communities, designer brands and wealthy influencers are translating handwashing into an experience of lush well-being.</p>\n<p>\n\tA scroll through Instagram reveals bottles of high-end hand sanitiser resting sleekly on slabs of marble, and manicured hands lightly pressing soap dispensers. The captions (“Keep safe in style” and “Make our hand sanitiser the star of your self-care routine”) blur into one, reframing a desire to prevent illness into a luxury trend.</p>\n<p>\n\tPictures of solitary sinks, carved from spare granite or scalloped marble, are now ubiquitous on the Instagram feeds of companies like Amass, a retailer of “botanics for modern life”, and the upmarket skincare brand Aesop.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn one image, the “rhomboid pattern” of a basin “pays homage to the interior of a local church”, and the “sacred vessels of religious rites”. Handwashing is now a near-religious experience, a moment of Instagrammable self-discovery.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe marketing of Four Thieves is based on the plague. The hand sanitiser’s blend of herbs is the same recipe believed in medieval Europe to ward off the bubonic plague, when it was reputedly favoured by grave robbers and others caught in one of the deadliest pandemics in human history, it’s now a feature of five-star establishments, from The Ned hotel in London to Montana’s Yellowstone Club.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Up until the pandemic, hand sanitiser was this really clinical, utilitarian thing,” says Morgan McLachlan, chief distiller at Amass. “I wanted to make a hand sanitiser that was a nicer user experience. I wanted to turn something we have to do – cleaning our hands – into something that’s a bit more pleasurable, a sensory ritual. If there’s any emotion I want to bring to the product, it’s comfort – because I think we all need that right now.”</p>\n<p>\n\tIt’s a sentiment that is hard to argue with. In the UK, coronavirus has wreaked havoc on an already precarious jobs market, destroyed many people's mental health and confined millions to their homes. If you can afford to reframe Covid-19 and its associated rituals (cleaning your hands and wearing face masks) as peaceful retreats, why not do so? Don’t we all deserve a bit of comfort?</p>\n<p>\n\t<em><strong>[see also: <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2020/06/save-british-high-streets-forget-lost-era-retail-millennials\">To save British high streets, forget the lost era of retail – and listen to millennials</a>]</strong></em></p>\n<p>\n\tAnd yet, selling handwashing – a practice which, for those more susceptible to the virus, could mean the difference between life and death – as an expensive personal care ritual throws into sharp relief the distinction between those who can afford to forget coronavirus, and those condemned to remember it.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor Arathy Mohanlal, a critical care nurse, handwashing during the height of Covid-19 meant soreness and skin peeling off the back of her hands. She’ll never forget the patients dying on the ICU ward where she worked, laying out their bodies, and then racing back, drenched in sweat, to care for the other patients.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I had broken skin and pressure sores from wearing a visor, and I barely had time to drink or pee,” says Mohanlal. “We were responsible for up to four patients at a time, when ICU should be one-to-one care. Luxury brands marketing handwash and hand sanitiser makes me think that they don’t fully understand the effects of Covid-19 and how scary this virus is. It’s not a marketing opportunity.”</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the world of Covid-19, wealth doesn’t just buy material security – it buys space for luxury mental retreat.</p>\n<p>\n\tMcLachlan says: “Aroma has this incredible ability to transport us in space and time,” and she hopes her hand sanitiser’s fragrance will lift the user out of the anxiety and isolation of the pandemic. Forty three per cent of Amass’s luxury hand sanitiser sales are to high-end hotels and restaurants across the globe.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe might all be subject to some of the same physical restrictions, but for the wealthy there’s no tax on escaping to low-lit bistros and tropical beaches, in contrast with those crammed into one-bedroom flats with three children, with coronavirus spreading through their neighbourhood and sickness an everyday reality.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere’s a myth, beloved by politicians who clapped the NHS while carers tended to the sick <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2020-04-19/nhs-staff-being-asked-to-sacrifice-themselves-over-lack-of-ppe\">without proper PPE</a>, that we’re all in this together. But as non-essential retail reopens, there is a gap between the high-street stores trailing floor markers and safety tape, and luxury boutiques scrambling to give their clients an upmarket pandemic experience.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em><strong>[see also: <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/economy/2020/07/why-shops-close-covid-coronavirus-john-lewis-burger-king-pret-boots\">To Boris Johnson’s government, our vanishing high streets are simply a parallel universe</a>]</strong></em></p>\n<p>\n\tWhat is a luxury shopping experience in the era of Covid-19? It is high-end boutiques taking government guidelines – which are supposed to be utilitarian, ubiquitous and for the safety of everyone – and repackaging them as jovial diversions.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe luxury perfume house Penhaligon's communicates Covid-19 guidelines via a mock-Edwardian <a href=\"https://www.tbvsc.com/bicester-village/en/brands/penhaligons?gclid=CjwKCAjwkJj6BRA-EiwA0ZVPVrgiYBytNhNp6RLR2HRESOwRGLczvIUmfsQyKcQRLZ1vy4tofzHCWBoCXFkQAvD_BwE\">public information film</a>.</p>\n<p>\n\t“It goes without saying that our staff are always immaculately turned out,” the film reads, in reference to the gloves and masks supposed to keep shop workers safe.</p>\n<p>\n\tBicester Village, a famous designer shopping outlet in the UK, does not use the term \"Covid-19\" in its safety guidelines. Instead, the website describes “a new way of shopping”, as though the pandemic was created to offer a novel shopping experience. Eating outside to lessen the risk of the virus becomes “al fresco dining”, and queuing is an inconvenience to be eliminated for customers’ comfort (Bicester Village has implemented a digital queuing system to allow customers to “make the most of their visit”).</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen I worked as a sales assistant in luxury retail, I discovered that it was not so much about the product itself – the £40,000 handbag, or the shoes quivering with fox fur – as the human cost surrounding it.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat would a luxury purchase be without the bleeding feet and bursting bladder of the sales assistant serving you, without the “madams” and “sirs”? And disturbingly, during Covid-19, many luxury shoppers believe their wealth transcends common safety restrictions.</p>\n<p>\n\t“A lot of customers feel like they’re entitled not to wear a mask, because they’re shopping at a designer brand,” says Anna (not her real name), a sales assistant at Ted Baker in Bicester Village.</p>\n<p>\n\t“If I know a customer’s going to be spending a lot of money and it’s my job to give them luxury service, I don’t feel comfortable asking them to put their mask on. If you do ask, customers get really defensive, and it just makes the whole experience of serving them really difficult. So, I just leave it, even though I don’t feel safe.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen Anna returned to work, she and her colleagues were promised proper protective gear. They were given a three-pack of disposable masks, but when those ran out, they were never re-ordered. She speaks of customers getting angry, taking their masks off at the till (“I just need some air”), and throwing tantrums about not being allowed to pay in cash: “I’ve already touched all the clothes, so what’s the difference? I’ll be emailing in about <em>you!</em>”</p>\n<p>\n\t<em><strong>[see also: <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2020/04/coronavirus-key-workers-pay-conditions-unions-NHS-front-line-applause\">“You can’t eat applause”: why the coronavirus crisis poses dilemmas for trade unions</a>]</strong></em></p>\n<p>\n\tIn a pandemic, luxury shopping isn’t a glass of champagne with your purchase – it’s a luxury hand sanitiser in an elegant bottle at the door, because, instead of death, you’re worried about the softness of your hands.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt’s being ushered into a shop which is over its customer limit, because you’re demanding to enter <em>now </em>– even if it’s dangerous for the sales assistants (deaths among shop workers are <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2020/07/14/shop-workers-are-dying-75-higher-rate-rest-country-12988352/\">seventy five per cent higher</a> than the average national rate).

Welcome to Lisbon. The global coronavirus death toll stands at more than 809,000. Your referee is a Mr Orsato from Italy. Let’s play!</p>\n<p>\n\tBut then, the beauty and the horror of football has always been its ability to make you forget. To bury your earthbound concerns in fresh snowfalls of athleticism and wonder. To shout down the stories it doesn’t want to tell with the stories it does. As Bayern lifted the trophy after their 1-0 win, the eye was inescapably drawn to their left-back Alphonso Davies, the brilliant Canadian teenager born in a Ghanaian refugee camp to parents fleeing Liberia’s civil war, now scaling the peak of European football at the age of 19.</p>\n<p>\n\tMeanwhile, among the beaten finalists was PSG’s star centre-back Presnel Kimpembe. He is not a product of a jaw-dropping nine-figure transfer fee, but a Paris native who had joined the club’s youth academy at the age of ten, long before the club was bought by the Qatari state, lavished with unthinkable investment and reimagined as a state propaganda vehicle.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe point here is that ultimately you see whatever you want to see. The reverse, of course, is also true. The old money/new money dialectic that many sought to impose on the final ignores the fact that Bayern also benefit handsomely from Qatari investment via a sponsorship deal with the country’s state airline. The narrative of Bayern’s big-game pedigree trumping PSG’s big-game naivety also falls down when you consider that each of the starting XIs could boast five Champions League winners’ medals.</p>\n<p>\n\tBesides, it’s always possible to read too much into a single game of football, even one as important as this. It was, after all, a fairly even contest, one that could legitimately have tipped either way. Had either Neymar or Kylian Mbappé put away their clear-cut chances in the first half, PSG would probably have won. “You can’t control the result,” their German manager Thomas Tuchel philosophically observed afterwards.</p>\n<p>\n\tYou get the feeling PSG’s owners will keep trying regardless. After all, control has been the defining theme of Qatar’s stewardship since it purchased the club in 2011, ushering in an unprecedented era of success. And in many ways the broader theme of this season’s Champions League final was already in place: PSG’s measured but inexorable progress towards its ultimate goal of global pre-eminence, an end to which a tight 1-0 defeat is really only a minor inconvenience, a bump in the road.</p>\n<p>\n\tPSG have already essentially anaesthetised their own league as a meaningful contest. Since the start of the 2013-14 season, PSG have won 24 of the 28 available domestic trophies. The only time they were pipped to the Ligue 1 title, by Monaco in 2017, PSG responded by forking out £160m for Mbappé, Monaco’s best player. On the European stage, they have gone from a solitary semi-final in four decades to reaching the knockout stages of the Champions League eight seasons running. How will they make the final leap? It may – and I’m speculating here – simply involve getting out the chequebook.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt was instructive to hear Tuchel speaking, in the minutes after their defeat in Lisbon, of the need for further reinforcements at a club that has already spent north of £1bn on transfer fees alone in the past decade. “We need to use the transfer window…” he insisted. “We need to build a strong, strong squad.” And the recent history of the Qatari state suggests that there are few problems that its swollen coffers have been unable to overcome.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis goes well beyond its investment in players such as Neymar, Mbappé, Ángel di María and Mauro Icardi, or the new training ground in Poissy that is scheduled to open in 2022. For example, around the same time Qatar bought PSG, its state owned broadcaster Al Jazeera bought broadcast rights to Ligue 1, which it continues to hold. French football is thus in the invidious position of owing much of its financial solvency to the same state that owns its biggest club. As ever, Qatari spending is irrevocably bound up not just in product, but in control.</p>\n<p>\n\tMeanwhile, in a transfer market first overheated by Qatari capital and now contracted by coronavirus and the impending global recession, PSG is uniquely placed to cement its advantage still further. Even the traditional giants such as Real Madrid and Barcelona are unlikely to be able to compete with them on wages or transfer fees in the short term. “He would be very welcome here,” Tuchel said impishly in response to the bubbling speculation that even the great Lionel Messi – currently disgruntled at Barcelona and reportedly considering his options – might be tempted by a move.</p>\n<p>\n\tPSG probably won’t sign Messi. And no matter how much they spend, they’ll probably never attain the same dominance in European football that they have managed in France. But then again, a decade ago it would have felt equally unlikely that a tiny Gulf state would end up hosting a World Cup. That it would transform one of French football’s most perennial underachievers into one of the powerhouses of the game through a combination of luxury rebranding and financial shock and awe.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd moreover, that it would be allowed to do so largely unimpeded, despite its human rights abuses, its geopolitical sabre-rattling, the migrant workers dying in untold numbers on its construction sites.

president, as well as 435 representatives and 35 senators, it is clear that the elections on 3 November will be unlike any others in modern US history. Not only has Donald Trump’s presidency upended myriad norms of American politics - a trend that will likely continue in the final run to polling day - but the campaigning and voting will take place during a global pandemic that has infected and killed more people in the US than any other country. The term “unpredictable” is often used at political crossroads like this one, but rarely has it been more apt. Polls, debates, rallies, turnout and even something as fundamental as whether the president would accept a defeat are all wreathed in uncertainty.</p>\n<p>\n\t </p>\n<p>\n\tTo help <em>New Statesman</em> readers make sense of the twists and turns in the weeks building up to 3 November, on election night itself, and in the potentially turbulent period afterwards, we are bringing all of our coverage and analysis together in one place: <a href=\"http://newstatesman.com/us-election-2020\">our US 2020 elections hub</a>.</p>\n<p>\n\t </p>\n<h5>\n\tHere you can follow:</h5>\n<h5>\n\t </h5>\n<p>\n\t- All the latest from the <em>New Statesman</em>'s US editor <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/writers/331924\">Emily Tamkin</a>, leading our US coverage in Washington, DC and on the campaign trail</p>\n<p>\n\t </p>\n<p>\n\t- Commentary and analysis from the whole <em>New Statesman</em> international team, <em>New Statesman</em> magazine contributors such as Sarah Churchwell and Gary Younge, and from sector experts across the <em>New Statesman </em>Media Group</p>\n<p>\n\t </p>\n<p>\n\t- Our regularly updated results model and the numbers behind it</p>\n<p>\n\t </p>\n<p>\n\t- Polling trends, maps and analysis from the <em>New Statesman</em>’s data team</p>\n<p>\n\t </p>\n<p>\n\t- Special data features telling the mega-stories behind the election</p>\n<p>\n\t </p>\n<p>\n\t- Notifications from our <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/world-review\"><em>World Review </em>newsletter</a></p>\n<p>\n\t </p>\n<p>\n\t- US election episodes of our <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/world-review-podcast\"><em>World Review </em>podcast</a></p>\n<p>\n\t </p>\n<p>\n\t- Our 3 November election night live blog, where we will be analysing the results as they come in</p>\n<p>\n\t </p>\n<p>\n\tThis launch is the latest step in the<em> New Statesman</em>’s international growth.

Take Richard Yates’s 1961 debut novel <em>Revolutionary Road</em>. The book tells the story of April Wheeler, a woman with a seemingly perfect Connecticut family who is wholly dissatisfied with how life behind the white picket fence has turned out. That idea of suburban womanhood – white, blonde and conservative, and suffocating in its prim and proper mores – is decades old, but is still very much with us today. The book was made into a movie in 2008. April was played by Kate Winslet, who was nominated for a British Academy Film Award for her performance, so compelling to viewers was the story of one such woman’s interior life.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere are many other examples; from the highbrow, such as Daisy Buchanan in <em>The</em> <em>Great Gatsby</em> or Betty Draper in <em>Mad Men</em>, to the lowbrow, like Susan Mayer and Bree van de Kamp in <em>Desperate Housewives</em>. Judging by American culture, there are few sub-species more interesting than women living in the prosperous outskirts of our nation’s cities; the whiter and blonder, the primmer and more pristine they are, the more they deserve our fascination. The cities are gritty and dangerous, goes the traditional view, while the suburbs are pure and clean. And the women of the suburbs are the living symbols and guardians of that purity.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo for Donald Trump – keen to shift attention from his mismanagement of the Covid-19 pandemic and on to the more comfortable territory of law-and-order culture wars – supposed threats to the suburbs, and particularly suburban women, are ideal material. “Why would Suburban Women vote for Biden and the Democrats when Democrat-run cities are now rampant with crime… which could easily spread to the suburbs,” the president tweeted on 22 August, adding: “They will reconstitute, on steroids, their low-income suburbs plan!”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe subtext, which ran through various speeches at the Republican National Convention, is clear: the Democrats want to flood the rich, white, peaceful, picket-fence-and-apple-pie suburbs with poor, non-white, violent people.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut what Trump styles as the imperilled “suburban lifestyle dream” is just that: a dream. Never mind that the fears the president and his allies are whipping up are unfounded; ours is in any case no longer the America depicted in <em>Revolutionary Road </em>or <em>Mad Men</em>, and the suburbs are more diverse, more foreign and poorer than the current Republican hyperventilation allows.</p>\n<p>\n\tSome suburbs, it is true, conform to the old stereotypes; they were home to eight of the ten wealthiest postcodes in the United States in 2019. But new suburban realities are on the rise. More people living below the federal poverty line (one person earning less than $12,760, or $26,200 for a four-person household) now live in suburbs than in cities. This is in part because more people live in suburbs – the suburbs are, according to US Census Bureau estimates in 2019, growing more rapidly than cities – but also because poverty has, says the Brookings Institution, grown more quickly in suburbs than elsewhere. The long resurgence of inner cities, from no-go zones to hyper-productive centres of the knowledge economy, has pushed poorer Americans outwards into lower-density zones.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe suburbs are not only poorer than the Republicans think; they are less white too. According to a 2018 Pew Research Center report, 14 per cent of America’s suburbanites are black and 11 per cent are Hispanic. The trend of a growing non-white suburban population can be expected to continue. In the decade to 2010, reports Bloomberg CityLab, less than 10 per cent of the population growth of the 100 largest suburban areas in the US was white. The black American suburban population in particular has increased since the Noughties. That is partly a product of the shift in income profiles: gentrification pushes poorer black Americans out of cities as it does poorer white Americans. But it also speaks to the rise of black middle-class suburbia, particularly in the demographic boom zones of the urban south. To imagine the American suburb today, do not just think of <em>Revolutionary Road</em> and Connecticut; think of DeSoto outside Dallas in Texas, where median household incomes are almost $69,000 and nearly 60 per cent of businesses are owned by African Americans.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat Trump means when he says “suburban women” and what you, if you are a white reader of this piece, almost certainly imagined when you read the first line, is “white women”. It is a dog whistle in other words. But the president is not the only one to use this shorthand. The notion of the suburbs ingrained in our imagination – a white blonde sighing over a martini while gazing over a white picket fence as her two children and their dog play in the garden – dies hard. That is why the media uses it too. Consider all the commentary and analysis about “suburban women” who voted for Trump in the 2016 election and, significantly, backed Democrats in the 2018 mid-term elections. This, of course, refers to white women, as a glance at the negligible percentage of women of colour who voted for Trump in 2016 will show.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat we still imagine the suburbs as white and rich, as the territory of April Wheeler, Daisy Buchanan, Betty Draper and Bree Van de Kamp, does not make them so. They are more heterogeneous and fluid, or to put it another way, they look more like the rest of the US. Nor is the suburban woman, specifically, necessarily white or rich. Indeed, she does not necessarily want the president tweeting on her behalf. So: enough. We have given her so much space in our imagination; surely we can allow her the room in our debates to defy stereotypes about her demographics and opinions too. </p>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n          Getty      \n\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 11:14:50 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-81100237.jpg?itok=nHqgK2-P","linkMd5":"51487987c1ae141edd3750a20108e539","destWidth":790,"destHeight":350,"sourceBytes":56302,"destBytes":41784,"author":"Emily Tamkin","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-81100237.jpg?itok=nHqgK2-P":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528294},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"Letter of the week: The perfect last image","link":"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2020/09/letter-week-perfect-last-image","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-field-subheadline field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\">\n <div class=\"field-items\">\n  <div class=\"field-item even\"> \n   <p> A selection of the best letters received from our readers this week.

The clockwork of the universe may be cold, but a stopped clock is occasionally right. Maybe the beauty of such images comes from their improbability.<br /> <em>Lukas Bernays, aged 16<br /> London E8</em></p> \n   <h2> Unhappy species</h2> \n   <p> Jeremy Cliffe gives a perceptive view of humanity: a rather unhappy species in an “age of angers” now displayed in a great many countries (World View, 21 August). A few pages on, Martin Fletcher draws similarly perceptive views in his interview with Stephen Emmott (“The population time bomb”, 21 August). I recall Emmott’s 2012 one-man show <em>Ten Billion</em> at London’s Royal Court Theatre, and have his book of the same title that followed. Both showed graphs of our burgeoning population, three billion in 1960, when I was in school, soaring to ten billion or more by the century’s end, “plundering the planet’s resources, devastating the environment, spewing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and triggering the sixth mass extinction of life&nbsp;on Earth”.&nbsp;</p> \n   <p> One can only guess the degree to which the pressure of our numbers contributes to the angers so well described by Cliffe. The population is already greatly in excess of the three billion scientists estimate is the maximum sustainable on this planet. Africa’s population alone is set to more than double in 30 years, fuelling ever more poverty and expanded migration. We owe Africa much after exploiting its resources for our industrial revolution, but instead this government has announced a reduction of £3bn, or 20 per cent, to the aid budget. We should be increasing it to provide equal education for girls as for boys and reproductive health services in developing countries. This is a necessity if we wish to leave our grandchildren a less dystopian world than that of which Cliffe, Emmott, and many others warn.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <em>Richard Vernon<br /> Iffley Village, Oxford</em></p> \n   <h2> No denier</h2> \n   <p> Peter Wilby (First Thoughts, 28 August) seems to think that he is my interrogator, and that I am his prisoner. No, he is a journalist who disagrees with me, another journalist. He is also plainly one of those willing to wound but afraid to strike.&nbsp; If he has ever asked me if I hold “catastrophe bonds” before, I must have missed it. I would immediately have answered that no, I do not. Despite finding his smear techniques repulsive, I am amused he should think I am some sort of polluting Bentley-driving plutocrat, when in fact I live in a semi-detached house in the Oxford suburbs and generally get about on a bicycle or by train. Nor am I a “denier” of anything. The slippery word, crafted to insinuate a similarity with Holocaust denial without actually daring to say so, is a smear in itself. I certainly do not contest the evident fact of global warming, as Mr Wilby mistakenly asserts.&nbsp;<br /> <em>Peter Hitchens<br /> London W8</em></p> \n   <h2> Churchill’s vision</h2> \n   <p> Damian Madden is correct that <em>Heroic Failures</em> by Fintan O’Toole is not anti-English but anti-Brexit (Correspondence, 28 August). O’Toole demonstrates this more decisively in his later book <em>Three Years in Hell</em> (2020).Portraying Basil Fawlty as “all-too-English” reminds the reader of Winston Churchill’s vision of Britain’s place in&nbsp;the world after the Second World War, when he was advocating for something the Brexiteers like to forget: a united Europe that, in Churchill’s words, would banish “tariff walls and passport networks” and in which Britain would be a leading light.</p> \n   <p> However, O’Toole does assert that the main driver of Brexit is a form of English nationalism that has no rational or historical basis and little to no vision of what the future might be when we are cut adrift from our European neighbours. In this sense it could be described as an English rather than a British problem, which, given the failure of recent negotiations with the EU, is only becoming more acute.<br /> <em>Rev Canon David Jennings<br /> Market Bosworth, Warwickshire</em></p> \n   <h2> Turnout truths</h2> \n   <p> Emily Tamkin’s column (Inside America, 28 August) includes a lot of figures, but one hair-raising statistic is missing. Since the election of Franklin D Roosevelt in 1932, the highest turnout as a percentage of eligible voters has been 62.8 (for John F Kennedy in 1960). In 1996 (Clinton’s re-election), it was only 49 per cent – but given that the choice was between a supremely uncharismatic Kansan and a tarnished, reckless, priapic and sublimely self-absorbed Arkansan it’s hardly surprising.&nbsp;<br /> <em>Peter Smith<br /> Cromer, Norfolk</em></p> \n   <h2> Era of upheaval</h2> \n   <p> Periodisation in history is a complex matter. I’m not sure that Quinn Slobodian has it right when he argues that the “last cycle” of world history lasted from 1989 to the present (“The world to come”, 28 August). An alternative might be defining a period between 1989 and 2008-09, when the US became the only world superpower, followed by the period to date, when China has arrived as a significant challenger. Given the Black Lives Matter and climate change movements across the world, it might also be argued the era of upheaval that began in 1968 is not only still with us but intensifying.<br /> <em>Keith Flett<br /> London N17</em></p> \n   <h2> Time to downsize</h2> \n   <p> In his article on the Lords (“A house derided”, 14 August), Robert Saunders draws out “the problems of a chamber stocked by prime ministerial patronage”. The only existing curb on his patronage is the House of Lords Appointments Commission, a cross-party body with an independent element. Its job is to ensure that “the past conduct of the nominee would not reasonably be regarded as bringing the House of Lords into disrepute”. It has been at loggerheads with Boris Johnson over some of his nominees, whom it excluded from his recent list, though shamefully let through an IRA apologist. It is not impossible that Johnson will put forward his rejects again, hoping to browbeat the commission into accepting them. This could lead to a breakdown in trust between the Prime Minister and Lords members. That would be an achievement for the head of the Conservative and Unionist Party, whose historic mission has always been to uphold the constitution.<br /> <em>Alistair Lexden<br /> House of Lords</em></p> \n   <p> I accept that the present size of the House is excessive. But the problem is too many life peers, not too many hereditary peers. Back in 1999, 600 hereditary peers left on a single day and their numbers have remained firmly at 92 since then. I propose the responsibility for appointments to the House of Lords should be taken from the Prime Minister and vested in a new independent statutory body whose decisions would be binding. A small number of categories – for example, religious leaders – could be included. Such a system would indeed mark the completion of House of Lords reform and thus end the hereditary peer by-elections. This new appointments body might also be given a numerical responsibility – for example two out, one in – to create a more manageable size.</p> \n   <p> As Robert Saunders reminds us, it was King John who put his signature to the Magna Carta at Runnymede in 1215, thus creating democracy. Who was it who so persuaded him? They were described as the Nobles, the Barons and the Bishops. Today we call them the House of Lords.<br /> <em>David Trefgarne<br /> House of Lords</em></p> \n   <p> Lord Tyler’s recollections of Nick Clegg’s ill-fated Lords reform differ from mine (Letter of the Week, 28 August). As I recall it, the reforms failed because the Liberal Democrats refused to talk to, let alone compromise with, those who had concerns about the side-effects of the proposals. The Lib Dems thought that they could bully through a faulty bill, but they were wrong.<br /> <em>Ralph Lucas<br /> House of Lords</em></p> \n   <h2> Off the mark&nbsp;</h2> \n   <p> In response to Simon Scarrow’s letter (Correspondence, 28 August): in the nine years I worked in a grammar school, I saw how a minority of teachers habitually overestimated their students’ ability with elevated predictions and over-marked coursework. In one A-level subject’s case, virtually all the students were given As or Bs in coursework and similar predictions for the exam, only for a large number to get Ds, Es or even Us in the actual exam.<br /> The pressure came in part from students and parents who treated predicted grades as an entitlement that would lead to the high grade they felt they deserved. While some teachers hold fast, plenty award high predictions for the sake of a quiet life. Or they too subscribe to the myth that a high predicted grade will determine the future.<br /> I don’t know what fantasy world Simon Scarrow lives in. He may be honest, but he ought to look outside his classroom door. This autumn there will be a considerable number of students embarking on courses that in any other year they would have been excluded from. Stephen Bush was simply drawing attention to an ongoing issue that has now been exposed for all to see.<br /> <em>Guy de la Bédoyère&nbsp;<br /> Grantham, Lincolnshire</em></p> \n   <h2> Spoiler alert</h2> \n   <p> A correction to Philippa Snow’s review of <em>Céline and Julie Go Boating</em> (The Critics, 21 August), but an important one, because it makes the film a comedy not a tragedy: the little girl in the mysterious house on the rue des Nadir aux Pommes is not killed, but is rescued by Céline and Julie. This is evident in the penultimate scene, when we see the three of them in a boat on a lake while past them floats another boat with the three ghostly figures from the “other scene’’ in the house.

As the scientist rode his bicycle through the ancient streets of Oxford he was stopped by a member of the Home Guard, whom he had to persuade of his sobriety before continuing on his way. It was 26 May 1940: the UK’s position had never been so precarious, its army stranded on the beach at Dunkirk under German assault. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-9ef5f0b0-7fff-1cfc-ac10-88cb21c3d70e\">The following morning, Heatley returned to the Dunn School of Pathology in Oxford to meet his colleagues and report the stunning results behind his ebullience. Four mice carrying a bacterial infection treated with a new drug the scientists had been testing had survived, while the untreated mice had died. The discovery of penicillin is a quintessential story of English improvisation and grit. So much so, that when the Nobel committee of 1945 selected the winners of the prize for physiology or medicine, Heatley, the discovery’s leading Englishman, was overlooked. The accolades were instead divided between a Scotsman, an Australian and a German refugee. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-9ef5f0b0-7fff-1cfc-ac10-88cb21c3d70e\">The Scotsman, Alexander Fleming, was born in Ayrshire in 1881 but moved to London to study medicine. It was there, at St Mary’s Hospital in 1928, that he discovered penicillin. An element of luck was involved; he’d left the lid off a bacterial culture-dish he’d been working with before leaving on holiday. When he returned he found a fungus had landed on the dish and lysed the bacteria in its proximity. Fleming had been seeking anti-bacterial agents for years and was quick to investigate precisely how the fungus killed bacteria. But lacking the chemical skills needed to elucidate the antibiotic, he abandoned the work. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-9ef5f0b0-7fff-1cfc-ac10-88cb21c3d70e\">It was revived by Ernst Chain, </span>a Jewish man who had fled Germany immediately following Hitler’s assumption of power in 1933 and now worked at Australian pathologist Howard Florey’s lab in Oxford. Chain was shunted between universities before the pivotal move to Oxford. Having endured the worst horrors of anti-Semitism in Germany – his mother and sister both died in concentration camps – he was perpetually wary of discrimination in Britain too. Furious with the British scientific authorities that financial support for his research wasn’t more forthcoming, Chain once railed: “It would all be different if only I played cricket.” Chain was an irascible and difficult man. Heatley struggled to get along with him as they worked together to characterise penicillin. “We were temperamentally incompatible,” said the mild-mannered Englishman, who never once complained about being overlooked for the Nobel Prize. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-9ef5f0b0-7fff-1cfc-ac10-88cb21c3d70e\">Florey, according to one biographer, was “a rough, tough Australian. Completely uncompromising, rather prickly, very energetic and tense as a coiled spring.” But he was able to read people and build a brilliant team. Florey came to Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar in 1921 and returned after working elsewhere in 1935, bringing Chain and Heatley into his team, and first working on other antibacterial agents before turning to penicillin in the late 1930s, as war loomed in Europe.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-9ef5f0b0-7fff-1cfc-ac10-88cb21c3d70e\">The cell biologist Henry Harris, who succeeded Florey as head of the Dunn School, succinctly summarised the respective standing of the penicillin team: “Without Fleming no Florey or Chain, without Chain no Florey, without Florey, no Heatley, without Heatley, no penicillin.”</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-9ef5f0b0-7fff-1cfc-ac10-88cb21c3d70e\">Having shown mice could be cured, Florey sought terminally ill individuals who, once the risks had been explained to them, would help demonstrate penicillin was harmless to people. A woman with terminal cancer survived taking it, albeit with a fever linked to impurities that had to be removed before he could treat the first patient, police constable </span>Albert Alexander. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-9ef5f0b0-7fff-1cfc-ac10-88cb21c3d70e\">According to popular legend, Alexander received a cut while pruning his roses, which caused bacterial sepsis. But his daughter, Sheila, whom I spoke to a few years ago, recalls Alexander’s illness starting with a minor wound acquired while seconded to Southampton during the Blitz in December 1940. Whatever the cause, he was close to death by the time he was treated. Multiple doses were needed as the original formulation of penicillin was rapidly cleared by the body in urine. In spite of this, the patient’s recovery was remarkable, although, tragically, the drug eventually ran out, and he relapsed and died. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-9ef5f0b0-7fff-1cfc-ac10-88cb21c3d70e\">The temporary reprieve, however, convinced the penicillin team that a cure was possible, if only enough of the drug could be made. Florey and Heatley then visited the US, where they persuaded several large pharmaceutical companies to scale production to levels that, by the end of the Second World War, were allowing thousands of Allied soldiers to survive battlefield wounds.  </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-9ef5f0b0-7fff-1cfc-ac10-88cb21c3d70e\">Meanwhile, German scientists in the 1930s had been experimenting with selected textile dyes that revealed antimicrobial properties. Bacteriologist Gerhard Domagk had shown that one such red dye, Prontosil, based on sulphur, could kill bacteria. When his daughter Hildegard, aged six, fell ill with sepsis having pricked herself with a needle, Domagk treated her with Prontosil. She was cured. This triggered a major rise in the medical testing of similar sulphur-based dyes. Domagk was awarded the Nobel Prize for medicine for his work in 1939, but was arrested by the Gestapo for accepting. Germans had been banned from taking the prize after Carl von Ossietzky, an anti-Nazi pacifist, received the peace prize in 1935. Under duress, Domagk declined the prize but was allowed to retrieve it in 1947.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-9ef5f0b0-7fff-1cfc-ac10-88cb21c3d70e\">The Nazis, of course, wanted antibacterial agents to enhance their ability in warfare. In 1942 they initiated trials to test sulphur drugs against gangrene, a common bacterial cause of death in war. Instead of testing the drugs on soldiers injured on the battlefield, or pursuing an ethical approach through controlled trials, they embarked on a sickening set of experiments of unthinkable barbarism.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-9ef5f0b0-7fff-1cfc-ac10-88cb21c3d70e\">In the concentration camp of Ravensbr</span><span>ück in northern Germany, dozens of female prisoners, mainly Polish women, dubbed “the rabbits” by their SS guards, were taken for human experimentation. Gashes were slit into their skin, often going deep into muscle, before gangrene-causing species of bacteria were inoculated. The experimenters would mix soil, sawdust and shards of broken glass into the wounds to better mimic battlefield wounds, before sewing them up and testing the sulphur drugs. The pain inflicted was excruciating and many of the women died. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span>Some survivors were reused in other, even more grotesque experiments. Muscles were excised from different anatomical sites to see if they could regenerate. Other prisoners had arms or legs removed in futile attempts at whole limb transplantation. Most of those who did not die of trauma or subsequent infection were shot. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span>It seems abject cruelty was at the heart of the mission of the “doctors from hell” as US journalist Vivien Spitz calls the perpetrators in her book of that name. Churchill, in his famous “finest hour” speech, alluded to the “lights of perverted science” shone by the Nazis. Even he, however, was unaware of how sickening things were to become in the concentration camps.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-9ef5f0b0-7fff-1cfc-ac10-88cb21c3d70e\">Ultimately, the British, with help from the Americans, brought penicillin to practical use in the war by late 1943. The sulphur drug programme in Germany failed and infected Allied troops were able to recover more quickly than their German counterparts. Winning the race to produce antibiotics undoubtedly helped the US and the UK to win. The different ways of running that race serves as a lesson today <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/health/2020/07/race-covid-19-vaccine\" target=\"_blank\">as the world seeks a Covid-19 vaccine</a>.</span><span> Science can better our society and our world, but the ends can never justify the means.

It was not only about astounding political incompetence and short-term thinking, lack of leadership, strategic planning and international cooperation. Nor will the post-pandemic fallout be solely about economic recession. What we are going through is primarily a crisis of meanings and definitions.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor far too long, we in the West have consulted the same leather-bound dictionary compiled in the aftermath of the Cold War. Now our dictionary is in flames. We reach to save what we can, but many pages of entries are scorched. Suddenly we realise we must redefine our most fundamental concepts. What is democracy? We thought we knew the answer, we took it for granted, but now we are no longer sure. What is normal? What is happiness? What are the values we should prioritise: ambitious trade agreements, financial deregulation, profit-driven business models that destroy the environment and pay no heed to coexistence? Or health and social care, diversity and inclusion, positive interaction with our ecosystems and purpose-driven business models?</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is a threshold. The old world is simply no more. From partisan gerrymandering to systematic attacks on journalism, the decline and decay in US institutions is alarming. Meanwhile, the EU exposed its own ruptures between “the centre” and “the periphery”. Keep an eye on Italy. In a nation that was traumatised by the pandemic and felt ignored by the Brussels elite we will see a further rise in populist nationalism. China is also undergoing an unexpected social transformation. If there is systematic deglobalisation in response to the pandemic failures, the domestic dynamics in China cannot remain intact.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe old world is gone, and yet we do not know what kind of a new world we want to build. It is a state of in-between-dom, full of anxiety and uncertainty, and fertile ground for demagogues and their false promises of redemption.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe are confronted with two paths, of which we can choose one. On one side stretches out protectionism, nationalism, a “my-kind first” approach: already, authoritarian leaders in Turkey, Hungary, Brazil and the Philippines have been using the disruption as an excuse to consolidate their power, control civil society and retreat further into isolationism. On the other side extends the path towards international communication and cooperation to deal with major global challenges, from future pandemics to the climate emergency, from cyber-terrorism to the dark side of digital technologies. If we choose the wrong path not only will we suffer the consequences, but so too will many generations to come.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Elif Shafak’s “How to Stay Sane in an Age of Division” will be published by Profile on 27 August</em></p>\n<p>\n\t </p>\n<h4>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/international/coronavirus/2020/08/world-come\"><em>Read the rest of the \"world to come\" series here</em></a></h4>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n          GETTY IMAGES      \n\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-image-caption field-type-text field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\">Chains of command: coronavirus has exposed the tensions and dependencies in global supply chains</div></div></div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 13:07:23 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_730/public/Longreads_2020/08/2020_35_wtc_last.jpg?itok=o22zG1bE","linkMd5":"0c0d70c3d900260f1cd0ce28be9b9cf0","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn48@2020_2/2020/09/05/09-02-08-984_08aa4a46be778e7c.webp","destWidth":730,"destHeight":520,"sourceBytes":100700,"destBytes":86030,"author":"Elif Shafak","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_730/public/Longreads_2020/08/2020_35_wtc_last.jpg?itok=o22zG1bE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn48@2020_2/2020/09/05/09-02-08-984_08aa4a46be778e7c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528313},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"US 2020 presidential election forecast model: will Donald Trump or Joe Biden win?","link":"https://www.newstatesman.com/international/2020/08/us-2020-presidential-election-forecast-model-will-donald-trump-or-joe-biden","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-field-subheadline field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"> <div id=\"nsmg-us20-widget\" style=\"min-width:320px;

Backhanders were common, players – even seasoned internationals – were limited to a maximum wage of £20 a week, the Football Association and the Football League were at administrative odds, the transfer system was a mess (when Denis Law </em><em>was sold by Huddersfield to Manchester City for </em><em>£</em><em>50,000 the player himself received just </em><em>£</em><em>20). What’s more, the standard of play was falling and as a result crowds were diminishing. Mallalieu was no mere bemoaner, however, and delivered a range of practical suggestions to put the professional game back on its feet.</em></p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\">\n\t<span class=\"divider\">***</span></p>\n<p>\n\tSome towns today hardly need those extra police and special buses on a Saturday afternoon. The flow that used to disorganise traffic, and swamp even the smoke-blackened side streets, on its way to the football ground has fallen to a trickle. Compared with this time last year – which itself showed a big drop on 1958 – some two and a half million fewer spectators have troubled to watch Football League matches and, as a result, 60 out of the 92 League clubs say that they are now losing money.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is at this moment that, by accident rather than intention, the Professional Footballers Association has brought the players' longstanding grievances to a head, grievances about the maximum limit set to their earnings, about the form of their contract, which binds them to an employing club even when the contract has expired, about the persistent refusal of the employers to set up a disputes committee at which grievances could be quickly aired and possibly settled, instead of being allowed to fester. Unless some agreement is reached, there is to be a strike on 13 December – the first in the history of the game; already this week the row has flared in the House of Commons, and conciliators at the Ministry of Labour have begun to work overtime.</p>\n<p>\n\tNor is this all. For many years past there have been hints of corruption in football. This season some players have been publicly accused of fixing matches to provide themselves and their backers with assured pickings from the fixed-odds coupons. These charges are still being investigated by the football authorities. Ten days ago, the manager of what I would call one of the six most glamorous clubs in the country made another charge to me personally. “National newspapers,” he said, “are bribing my players to ask for a transfer in order to create a story. Worse, at least one player in every first and second division club is being paid by one newspaper or another to sell not only dressing room tittle tattle, but also such secrets as the tactics we intend to use in a particular game.” This manager is not a has-been who has turned sour. Nor is he inexperienced and hot-headed. Through the 20 years I have known him as player and manager he has been intelligently devoted to his game. Yet he could say: “I have lost heart. I get hold of good youngsters and try to bring them on. But within two years, they're corrupted.”</p>\n<p>\n\tObviously, English professional football is in a mess; but before one can begin to understand how it has got into this mess one must first get clear some facts about its organisation. There are two controlling bodies. The supposedly supreme Football Association generally supervises all football, amateur and professional, except the break-away Sunday leagues. It is responsible for changes in the rules, and for seeing that the rules, both of play and of administration, are obeyed. It runs “the Cup”. It represents England in football dealings with other countries. It chooses and runs our international teams.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe second controlling body is the Football League, which, through its management committee, is responsible, broadly, for running professional football through the 92 League clubs. The existence of these two bodies is a cause of increasing friction, even though representatives from the League serve in the councils of the Association. Most of the money which reaches football comes through the League; and the League, providing most of the cash, resents surveillance from a body which it is itself helping to subsidise. The League cry for a breakaway from the Association comes louder each year.</p>\n<p>\n\tSuch friction at the top does not make for peace below. What makes things worse is that the players, in any negotiations they may have, must deal with both bodies; and a continuing players’ complaint has been that, if one body agrees to a proposal, the other will turn it down. There is difficulty moreover in getting both bodies to sit down for negotiation at the same time. The complications, however, do not end there. Although a player is employed by an individual club, the principles on which he is paid and serves are laid down by the League – under the supervision of the Association. But the League is itself really controlled by the votes of its full members, the 44 First and Second Division clubs, plus four “associates” from the Third and Fourth Divisions. To be accepted by this body, any proposal requires a two-thirds majority, and this means that the poorer clubs can veto – as they did veto last month – any proposal by the richer clubs for an improvement in players' conditions. Thus a man who is employed by Arsenal or Spurs finds that in fact his pay and conditions may be controlled, not just by Stoke or Ipswich but even by Accrington Stanley or Aldershot.</p>\n<p>\n\tNext it is important to look at two points in the players' conditions of service. The first is that the profession is unique in having a maximum wage. No matter how great a star a man becomes, be may not be paid more than the £20 a week, plus bonuses, which can be paid to the least effective member of his team. Stanley Matthews, in his heyday, could put £1,000 on a gate; but his club, was not allowed to recognise his drawing power.</p>\n<p>\n\tTwo arguments are put forward in favour of this rule. One is that football is a team game, that the star is as dependent on lesser lights as they are on him. The other is that if they could pay what they liked, richer clubs would attract all the stars. Those against it point out that a differential system has worked well, not only in Scotland, but in every other football country in the world and that it provides a much needed incentive to footballers to improve their skill. Anyway even under the present system, the richer clubs tend to get their pick of the stars.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis brings up the second point in the players' condition of service: the transfer system. A player signs a contract for a year with his club. When that contract expires, however, he is not free to move elsewhere, unless his club is willing to let him go and unless (usually) another club is prepared to pay a substantial transfer fee to his existing employer. Hence clubs with poor support keep themselves alive by selling stars to clubs with big gates. The selling club retains the bulk of this fee. When a year ago Huddersfield sold Denis Law to Manchester City for some £50,000 the player himself was allowed to receive only £20 – as a signing-on fee. Players resent a system under which they are tied even by a contract that has expired; but if the authorities will not change this system, the players argue that they should themselves get a larger rake-off from it.</p>\n<p>\n\tA final point needs to be stressed. There has been corruption in football almost from the beginning of professionalism. Many years ago one manager I know of was able to get his team into the League only by paying £100 to a very high League official. Since then, both directors and managers have paid cash under the counter in defiance of League rules, to induce a player to move from one club to another. Wealthy supporters of star clubs are known to pass round the hat and even offer inducements in kind, like sinecure jobs, to attract or retain the men their club wants. Players who see this being done by their bosses come in time to believe that no holds need be barred in the search for cash, especially when they believe that the rules which prevent them from earning more cash legitimately are unfair.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis, then, is the background, or most of it, to today's crisis. One must also mention the standard of play, which is generally thought to have gone down either because coaching and training methods are unsatisfactory or because, with full employment, there are fewer recruits to professional football or because, in the present atmosphere of the game, some players think more about cash than they do about enjoyment for themselves and the spectators. One should also mention the unattractiveness of most football grounds and the alternative attractions to football now available in postwar Britain.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat then should be done? I think that the limit on wages should be removed at once, leaving a player free, subject to a minimum, to negotiate by himself or through his union for the highest wage that a club is able and willing to pay. This happens in other professions. There is no reason why football should be an exception. It would mean that the best players would be concentrated, to a greater extent even than now, in the comparatively few clubs which are attracting support already; and this would be an excellent thing, not only for the star players themselves but for the quality of football. We should, in fact, get an elite of clubs playing in a super-league, which could provide football worth going miles to see and could also give potential internationals the chance of welding themselves into a team, either with their own club or (since these super-clubs would not all play in League football every Saturday) in trial international teams playing against clubs which had a vacant date. At the other end of the scale, some clubs that no longer attract support would have to drop out of League football and join regional competitions. I do not think that any club has a right to exist if it has insufficient support. Still less has it the right to hold back more successful clubs and prevent players from getting what are clearly their rights. Nor have indifferent players any right to a regular wage from football. They should find regular work elsewhere and play part-time football.</p>\n<p>\n\tSecondly, I think that the present transfer system should be abolished. A player, free to negotiate on wages, should be free to negotiate also on the length of his contract – for one, three, even for five years. While the contract lasts, he should be held by it. Afterwards be should be free to move. The existence of the present contract, unfair in itself, has had more to do with corruption than any other single factor. Its abolition could well clean the atmosphere.</p>\n<p>\n\tThirdly, disputes committees – one for the super-League, and one for the lower grades of professional football – should be set up at once with powers to act, so that players can get in touch with their bosses the moment a serious dispute arises, and so that these bosses can take immediate action without being held back by the paupers clinging to their coat-tails.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf these requirements are satisfied, I believe that all footballers will once again put their eye on the ball instead of on the hand upturned behind someone else's back. The opportunities for watching League football might diminish, but the increased quality of what was available could more than make good the deficiency. Perhaps, above all, an industry which is now becoming distinguished for double-dealing would have a chance to become respectable again.  </p>\n<p>\n\t<em style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16.112px; line-height: inherit; font-family: Merriweather, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">Read more from the NS archive <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/archive\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; color: rgb(193, 0, 42); text-decoration-line: none;\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</em><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); margin: 0px !important; font-variant-numeric: normal !important; font-variant-east-asian: normal !important; font-stretch: normal !important; line-height: 2 !important;\"> </span><em style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16.112px; line-height: inherit; font-family: Merriweather, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">A selection of pieces spanning the New Statesman’s history has recently been published as </em><a href=\"https://www.weidenfeldandnicolson.co.uk/titles/various/statesmanship/9781474615020/\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16.112px; line-height: inherit; font-family: Merriweather, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(193, 0, 42); text-decoration-line: none;\" target=\"_blank\">“</a><em style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16.112px; line-height: inherit; font-family: Merriweather, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\"><a href=\"https://www.weidenfeldandnicolson.co.uk/titles/various/statesmanship/9781474615020/\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; color: rgb(193, 0, 42); text-decoration-line: none;\" target=\"_blank\">Statesmanship</a></em><a href=\"https://www.weidenfeldandnicolson.co.uk/titles/various/statesmanship/9781474615020/\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16.112px; line-height: inherit; font-family: Merriweather, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(193, 0, 42); text-decoration-line: none;\" target=\"_blank\">”</a><em style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16.112px; line-height: inherit; font-family: Merriweather, Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\"><a href=\"https://www.weidenfeldandnicolson.co.uk/titles/various/statesmanship/9781474615020/\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; color: rgb(193, 0, 42); text-decoration-line: none;\" target=\"_blank\"> (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson)</a></em></p>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n          George W.

I approach the young woman who seems marginally more eager to see me.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Can I help?” she asks.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Yes, I’m looking for a one-bedroom flat to rent near here and I saw a couple of places in the window. . .”</p>\n<p>\n\tShe makes a kind of “I’ll stop you right there” gesture and hands me a business card. It’s fairly conventional, except for her printed name, which looks as though it is pretending to be handwriting. Her first name is “Milly” and I am reminded of the line in Antal Szerb’s glorious novel, <em>Journey by Moonlight</em>, when a character comes across someone called “Millicent”. “‘Millicent,’ he said. ‘There’s someone in the world actually called Millicent!’”</p>\n<p>\n\t“Just go to the website and you’ll see an updated list of properties.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“So I shouldn’t pay any attention to the properties up in your window?”</p>\n<p>\n\t“No.”</p>\n<p>\n\tI like to think of myself as someone who does not make too much of a fuss in public; who, when his world is rocked to its foundations, maintains a calm facade. It is as much about reassuring others as it is about maintaining one’s dignity. But when I learned that what is in an estate agent’s window bears absolutely no relation to the reality of the outside world, I nearly, as the Americans say, lost my shit. But instead I channelled my inner Vulcan, suppressed my emotions, and merely said, “Ah”. Does everyone else know this? How many of you now, reading this, are laughing up your sleeves at my innocence?</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the next morning, I look at their website. I see quite a handful of properties which look feasible, about the price I’m paying now – in one or two instances, slightly less – and not too far away. I start jotting down the details and pick up my phone to make an appointment to view them. This, I thought to myself, is going to be easier than I’d expected.</p>\n<p>\n\tI start to build a fantasy about my new life, on the first floor, away from the hobbit-hole I live in currently. (It’s not bad as hobbit-holes go, but one can only live in a basement for so long if one is not actually a hobbit.) Look at the well-presented airy vistas I shall command! Behold my 18ft living room with a fireplace! When I look out of my window I shall see things below me, and not an overgrown bank almost entirely overrun with snails! (It was actually very cheery in the spring, with the wildflowers, but now, not so much. And people will keep chucking empty beer tins into the area.)</p>\n<p>\n\tBut it turns out I was building castles in the air; or rather, one-bedroom flats in the air. For each thumbnail has the words “Let Agreed” in the upper left-hand corner. I am new to the world of estate agents, or newly re-entered (my last experience with one was in 1994, when my wife and I bought the family home; and she did pretty much everything in terms of dealing with them), but I am fairly sure that the words “Let Agreed” are the rental equivalent of “Sale Agreed”, in other words “forget it, pal”. I could ring up Milly and ask her if this is indeed the case, or whether a letter has dropped out of the deal, but I don’t want her to think I’m even more of an idiot than I actually am.</p>\n<p>\n\tMeanwhile, scrolling through the photographs makes me feel a little uneasy. The ones I like are all entirely devoid of furniture. This means I’m going to have to buy a table, chairs, a fridge, maybe a sofa. A bed, even. How does one buy a bed? (I will be leaving behind all the furniture, a broken toilet seat, and a kitchen tap that sprays water everywhere whenever you turn it on.)</p>\n<p>\n\tLast week I saw that my fellow columnist, Pippa Bailey, is in a similar predicament, but she seems to have arranged matters with maximal efficiency, and without getting into a funk of panic and hopeless despair. How do people <em>do</em> that?</p>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n          Getty      \n\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 14:04:33 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-80794491.jpg?itok=PEGk6XbM","linkMd5":"51a341b7f5722a70a3d3cbdc4b057467","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn7@2020_3/2020/09/05/09-02-10-932_a8dcfc039fcee194.webp","destWidth":790,"destHeight":350,"sourceBytes":69781,"destBytes":40890,"author":"Nicholas Lezard","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-80794491.jpg?itok=PEGk6XbM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn7@2020_3/2020/09/05/09-02-10-932_a8dcfc039fcee194.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528312},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"The dizzying Celine and Julie Go Boating is apt viewing for a chaotic present","link":"https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/film/2020/08/dizzying-celine-and-julie-go-boating-apt-viewing-chaotic-present","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-field-subheadline field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"> <p>\n\tThe brilliantly trippy Seventies masterpiece suits the growing feeling that life itself is somehow glitching, looping, or not making sense. </p>\n </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><noscript class=\"adaptive-image\" data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=\"300 768 1024\" data-adaptive-image-300-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;300&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/08/2020_35_film.jpg?itok=DsMIZA5Z&amp;amp;c=02e5d873b0288591f98707a8cf83c420&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-768-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;768&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/08/2020_35_film.jpg?itok=DsMIZA5Z&amp;amp;c=02e5d873b0288591f98707a8cf83c420&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-1024-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;1024&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/08/2020_35_film.jpg?itok=DsMIZA5Z&amp;amp;c=02e5d873b0288591f98707a8cf83c420&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-max-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;max&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/08/2020_35_film.jpg?itok=DsMIZA5Z&amp;amp;c=02e5d873b0288591f98707a8cf83c420&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\"><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/08/2020_35_film.jpg?itok=imJdARmT\" alt=\"\" /></noscript>\n</div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\" property=\"content:encoded\"> <p>\n\tA brilliantly trippy watch for a period in history when the world around us seems to be dissolving into chaos, <em>Celine and Julie Go Boating</em> (1974) is a time travel fantasia about two Parisian adventuresses witnessing an inter-­dimensional murder. Celine, a ­gorgeous bohemian who may also be a witch, is first seen rushing through Montmartre in a hurry, sloughing off her ­accessories like a snake shedding its skin. She passes Julie, a librarian with a burgeoning interest in black magic.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs if she were Alice following the ­rabbit, Julie begins trailing Celine through the city, picking up her feather boa, books and silk scarves as if she were collecting the ­ingredients for a hex. They dance around each other, coyly, making it impossible to know at first whether the two women are strangers, or whether they are enacting an agreed-upon burlesque. The game goes on for days; Celine moves into Julie’s home. A new game altogether slowly starts ­unfolding. We are asked to follow Julie and Celine not only down the rabbit hole, but back in time.</p>\n<p>\n\t“[Jacques Rivette’s] whole movie, like a dream, is set between quotation marks,” Gilbert Adair suggested in <em>Film Comment </em>in 1974. “Like a dream, it is an anagram of reality.” The simplest way to explain the film – if there is a simple way to explain it – is that at some point Celine enters a ­remote mansion on the outskirts of the city, loses track of time, and ends up thrown back into daylight after an unspecified number of hours. She is dazed, and has no memory of what occurred inside the house, but feels compelled to keep returning.</p>\n<p>\n\tJulie, keen to solve the puzzle, does the same. After each visit, they emerge with a mysterious piece of candy in their mouths; eventually, it becomes clear that the key to remembering what has transpired is ­consuming this strange sweet, allowing them to experience a shared hallucination that takes on the shape of a Victorian  murder mystery.</p>\n<p>\n\tEach of them pictures herself within the story, as the nanny to a child who is eventually killed. We watch Celine and Julie’s fantasy play out, and occasionally, we watch them watching their fantasy play out: slack-jawed, amazed, engrossed, the picture of a movie audience enthralled by a whodunit.</p>\n<p>\n\tCeline, who is extroverted, batty and a little naughty, is glamorous in the most traditional sense, from the old Scottish word for magic. She is also the ancestor of another kind of feminine enchantress, the contemporary Manic Pixie Dream Girl – a bewitching catalyst for sudden drama in the life of the protagonist, who cannot help but chase her. (Little wonder, then, that <em>Celine and Julie Go Boating </em>proved to be a major influence on Susan Seidelman when she directed 1985’s<em> Desperately Seeking Susan</em>.)</p>\n<p>\n\tRivette’s film is full of wordplay that does not translate exactly, the result being that English-speaking viewers like myself are apt to miss occasional jokes. To go boating – <em>aller en bateau</em> – has an idiomatic meaning as well as a literal one: to get caught up in a story, to be taken for a ride. Narratives that loop and replay, or that play out in multiple timelines, have become more popular in recent years – think of 2019’s spiky <em>Russian Doll</em>, whose nihilistic heroine relives her death ad infinitum, or this summer’s hit<em> Palm Springs</em>, in which the loop is a subtly downbeat metaphor for a relationship. Perhaps this is due to an increasing sense that life itself is somehow glitching, looping, playing out on several simultaneous planes, or otherwise not making sense. Rivette, playing fast and loose with unreality, has made a film capable of travelling forward, rushing, to catch up with These Uncertain Times.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe subtitle for <em>Celine and Julie Go ­Boating </em>is the fairy-tale-like “Phantom Ladies Over Paris”, a suggestion that Rivette’s surrealist comedy may be as much a ghost story as an amusing, dizzying romp through time and space. In one of the film’s final scenes, Celine and Julie, in the “real” world, take a boat out on a lake. To their amazement, the characters from the mansion have appeared, as still as statues on the water. For a moment, this appears to be the ending – one last image of the bleed between reality and ­fantasy, the line dissolving like confectionery in the movie’s mouth – until another scene appears: Julie, a librarian with a ­burgeoning interest in black magic, is seen rushing through Montmartre in a hurry, sloughing off her accessories like a snake shedding its skin. Celine, a gorgeous ­bohemian who may also be a witch, sees her and sets out to pursue her. <em>Plus ça change</em>: many stories, whether they are <em>très ­moderne</em> or steeped in history, eventually repeat themselves. l</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>“Celine and Julie Go Boating” is available on Amazon Prime Video</em></p>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n          Moviestore Collection Ltd / Alamy      \n\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-image-caption field-type-text field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\">Celine and Julie Go Boating </div></div></div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 15:57:49 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/08/2020_35_film.jpg?itok=imJdARmT","linkMd5":"668f227c05bfd7e982bba971009feae6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn24@2020_5/2020/09/05/09-02-08-824_02a96fbdfe14b408.webp","destWidth":790,"destHeight":350,"sourceBytes":44278,"destBytes":21758,"author":"Anonymous","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/08/2020_35_film.jpg?itok=imJdARmT":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn24@2020_5/2020/09/05/09-02-08-824_02a96fbdfe14b408.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528309},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"Son of a milkman beats a Kennedy in Massachusetts Senate race","link":"https://www.newstatesman.com/2020/09/son-milkman-beats-kennedy-massachusetts-senate-race","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-field-subheadline field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"> <p>\n\t<em>Emily Tamkin writes:</em></p>\n<p>\n\tRepresentative Joe Kennedy III has conceded to Senator Edward Markey, ending a heated primary race for Markey's Massachusetts Senate seat.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\">\n\t\tI am filled with hope for the future of our country and our planet because of the young people who are rising up to demand a Green New Deal.</p>\n<p>\t— Ed Markey (@EdMarkey) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EdMarkey/status/1301173565312688130?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 2, 2020</a></p></blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><p>\n\tThough incumbents normally win their elections, there was something more at play in the Bay State. Kennedy started the election polling ahead of Markey by double digits. And there was a reason he was expected to win: no Kennedy had ever lost an election in the state of Massachusetts, the state that birthed the careers of John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy, and Ted Kennedy. It looked like he would oust Markey, ending his over four decades in Congress.</p>\n<p>\n\t </p>\n<p>\n\tBut though Markey was not known as a progressive per se for the majority of his career, he was the Senate co-sponsor of the Green New Deal, progressive superstar Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's House bill, and a supporter of Medicare for All. He hit Kennedy on the very thing that made him popular: his family name. \"Tell your father right now that you don't want money to go into a super PAC that runs negative ads,\" he said in one debate. Perhaps most famously, he concluded one ad, which stressed his roots as the son of a milkman, flipping JFK's most famous line on its head. \"It's time,\" the senator said, \"to start asking what your country can do for you.\"</p>\n<p>\n\t </p>\n<p>\n\tKennedy, meanwhile, struggled to articulate to voters why, exactly, he wanted the job. To say \"generational change\" wasn't enough when younger voters themselves were some of the strongest supporters of Markey, and it is harder to argue that one's opponent is out of touch with the common man and woman when one is literally a Kennedy. A Kennedy ad toward the end of the campaign stressed the family name. \"He reminds me of Bobby and Jack and Teddy,\" Ethel Kennedy, the candidate's 92 year old grandmother, told the camera. But, even in Massachusetts, that isn't enough anymore. </p>\n<p>\n\t </p>\n<p>\n\tIt is unlikely the United States has seen the end of political ambitions from the Kennedy family or even Joe Kennedy III individually. He may be leaving Congress in January, but he became a congressman in his early thirties and is still only 39. That he ran for the Senate at all suggests that he has dreams of bigger, more powerful things. But for at least one election, Massachusetts voters chose the son of a dairyman over a dynasty. </p>\n </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><noscript class=\"adaptive-image\" data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=\"300 768 1024\" data-adaptive-image-300-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot;

The campaign avoided discussing the sharper choices and no-win scenarios. And it ran, hard, against the record of the incumbent Conservative government. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\tThe question that now occupies an increasing amount of the government’s time is this: how do we stop the SNP doing to us what Vote Leave did to David Cameron? The role of today's government's central players in winning the Brexit referendum brought Cameron’s premiership to an abrupt end, a little over a year after his great electoral triumph. Now they fear that Scottish independence could do the same to them.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-73e0f558-7fff-c33b-2638-9f2fae75f280\">“Plan A” is simple: you can’t lose a referendum if you don’t hold one. But the government’s “Save the Union” team (whose de facto head is Michael Gove) and the SNP are united in the realisation that while technically the battle that matters as far holding another referendum is concerned is the 2021 Scottish parliament election, what actually matters is whether it’s politically weatherable to avoid holding one. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-73e0f558-7fff-c33b-2638-9f2fae75f280\">Don’t forget that there was a majority in the 2016 Scottish parliament to seek a fresh referendum, and a majority of Scottish voters thought that Brexit was enough to activate the Anglo-Scottish Union for the SNP’s manifesto commitment to hold a fresh vote in the event of a “material change”. Yet voters didn’t really want a referendum, and were happy to have it both ways, telling pollsters that the Scottish parliament ought to be able to hold one if it wanted, while making that scenario less likely by </span>tactically <span>voting against the SNP at the 2017 general election. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-73e0f558-7fff-c33b-2638-9f2fae75f280\">Both sides know full well that what matters is not that Nicola Sturgeon will ask for a referendum and that Boris Johnson will say no, but how that event is viewed by the Scottish public. The fear that, in practice, Johnson will be unable to refuse another independence referendum is why thoughts are turning to “Plan B”: how the government would actually win a second vote. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-73e0f558-7fff-c33b-2638-9f2fae75f280\">Over at the </span><em>Spectator</em>, <a href=\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/to-save-the-Union-negotiate-scotlands-independence\">James Forsyth moots</a> one possible option: for England and Scotland to negotiate the terms of divorce first and then hold a referendum. You can see how this works in theory, as almost any political proposition loses, rather than gains, support as it becomes more specific. (See for instance support for “taxes on pollution”, a more popular proposition than, say, fuel duty.) </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-73e0f558-7fff-c33b-2638-9f2fae75f280\">But it’s not clear to me how this process would command legitimacy or trust. The Scottish government would surely argue that negotiations conducted before an independence vote would have different incentives for the rest of the UK than one afterwards: a pre-referendum negotiation would be about discouraging a Yes vote, while a post-referendum negotiation would be about making a Yes vote workable for both sides. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-73e0f558-7fff-c33b-2638-9f2fae75f280\">And, of course, this would be true! It’s also true that a number of very difficult questions and challenges would not go away, and that a vote for Scottish independence would, just as the Brexit vote has, pave the way for a long period of adjustment. (And that this would be harder and longer, because leaving a union in which you have pooled your sovereignty and policy for four decades is less complex than leaving one in which you have done so for three centuries.)</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-73e0f558-7fff-c33b-2638-9f2fae75f280\">The problem, though, is that landing this message is difficult, to put it mildly, if you have voted in favour of leaving one union. While they are not tasks of equivalent size, the principle (to go through a period of painful adjustment in order to better maximise your sovereignty) is one and the same. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-73e0f558-7fff-c33b-2638-9f2fae75f280\">The difficult truth is that, while the battle over Scotland’s future will be decided in Scotland, it is not solely about Scotland. The perception of Sturgeon’s greater competence compared to Boris Johnson, the perception that the choice is between a long but finite period of adjustment to independence as opposed to the endless grinding incompetence of the Tory government in England: these are perceptions that can only be changed by changing how the Conservative government in England operates or by replacing it. </span></p>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n          Robert Perry - WPA Pool/Getty Images.      \n\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-image-caption field-type-text field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\">Boris Johnson holds crabs caught on the Carvela with Karl Adamson at Stromness Harbour on July 23, 2020 in Stromness, Scotland.</div></div></div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Sep 2020 17:49:26 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1227748543.jpg?itok=gojq9Vt5","linkMd5":"33258a1d68591ee466e283fdd05330a2","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn18@2020_4/2020/09/05/09-02-11-090_cd7728add3f7bde7.webp","destWidth":790,"destHeight":350,"sourceBytes":68453,"destBytes":46920,"author":"Stephen Bush","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1227748543.jpg?itok=gojq9Vt5":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn18@2020_4/2020/09/05/09-02-11-090_cd7728add3f7bde7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528282},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"How we lost our green and pleasant land","link":"https://www.newstatesman.com/british-countryside-access-wild-child-patrick-barkham-bringing-back-beaver-derek-gow-trespass-nick-hayes-framing-nature-lawrence-rose-review","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-field-subheadline field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"> <p>\n\tThe pandemic has revealed not only how essential Britain’s natural landscape is, but how little ownership we have over it.</p>\n </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><noscript class=\"adaptive-image\" data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=\"300 768\" data-adaptive-image-300-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;300&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_866_450/public/Longreads_2020/09/2020_36_cocker_inside.jpg?itok=UpAhSezB&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-768-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;768&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_360_203/public/Longreads_2020/09/2020_36_cocker_inside.jpg?itok=pW9TyFY-&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-max-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;max&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_730/public/Longreads_2020/09/2020_36_cocker_inside.jpg?itok=d3rzblvI&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\"><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_730/public/Longreads_2020/09/2020_36_cocker_inside.jpg?itok=d3rzblvI\" alt=\"\" /></noscript>\n</div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\" property=\"content:encoded\"> <p>\n\tIt is now an established truism of Britain’s spring and summer of lockdown that it emphasised, like almost nothing in our recent history, the importance of countryside and nature to the nation’s well-being. In the media and on every kind of social platform, the part played by the living world in providing spiritual and physical release from the strains of coronavirus has been relentlessly repeated.</p>\n<p>\n\tIronically, perhaps, the defining images of that interrelationship between people and place are the photographs of Bournemouth in late June, with its enormous beach crowds. On the one hand, the half a million visitors were condemned for their inexcusable littering and thoughtlessness. On the other hand, the scenes symbolised precisely how little space and how few rights to our landscape British citizens enjoy.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is this latter interpretation that has informed a succession of calls among environmental organisations for a radical re-evaluation of our access to the natural world. The Green Party, as well as the Wildlife Trusts, Friends of the Earth, the Campaign to Protect Rural England and the National Trust, have all issued similar if separate challenges. Hilary McGrady, the National Trust’s director-general, has called for a recovery plan that “responds to what the lockdown has clearly shown: that people want and need access to nature-rich green spaces near where they live”.</p>\n<p>\n\tAll the new campaigns find powerful corroborative evidence in an ever-expanding shelf of books about the importance of nature to the entirety of the human organism. The latest titles include Isabel Hardman’s <em>The Natural Health Service</em>, reviewed in these pages in April, which explores the part played by her encounter with the living world in overcoming mental illness. She also reports how hospital patients recover faster when the convalescent’s view includes natural elements such as trees. Nature-centred activities and therapies – gardening, exercise in green space, woodland walks – are now prescribed by parts of the NHS and valued for their contributions to mental health.</p>\n<p>\n\tPatrick Barkham, with customary grace and charm, tells us about the importance of nature to children in his new book <em>Wild Child</em>. Like Hardman, he discusses the science underpinning the Japanese folk therapy of “forest bathing”. Trees are known to produce antimicrobial chemicals called phytoncides; people exposed to them through woodland walks experience lowered pulse rate and blood pressure and an enhanced immune system.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile there is no end to works highlighting why we should value nature and why it is beneficial, few tackle the processes that actually determine our access to nature and the condition of our environment. We know <em>why</em> we need improved nature, but the how is missing. A new book that makes the case, albeit implicitly, is Derek Gow’s <em>Bringing Back the Beaver</em>. Gow’s totem animal, a native resident of the UK until it was exterminated in the 16th century, is what is defined as a keystone species.</p>\n<p>\n\tBeavers are essentially engineers, and with their dam constructions they reshape and enhance riverine landscapes, improving flow rates, helping flood prevention, building fish stocks and adding to aquatic diversity like no other animal in the wetland environment. Gow, who is both a farmer and conservationist, is the perfect advocate for the value of returning beavers to Britain. So, how are beavers doing here? In the eight months to December 2019, Scottish Natural Heritage, the government’s wildlife agency, licensed the killing of 87 of them, about one-fifth of all beavers in Britain. Beavers require tolerance and can disrupt river patterns, but this level of slaughter reflects the deep conservatism of landowners when faced with new “problem” species.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere now come two books that in radically different ways examine and expose precisely what shapes national nature policy in Britain and how. The first, by Laurence Rose, is <em>Framing Nature: Conservation and Culture</em>. It is doubly significant because it comes at the end of a long career as a professional with the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB). The book is a summary of a lifetime’s experience, but also a heartfelt admission of failure. First, Rose shows there is a powerful precedent for the way the present crisis has amplified the call to re-evaluate our natural landscape. Until the Second World War not a single penny of state money had been spent on official protection of the British environment. All the key mechanisms we have – town and country planning acts, green belt, national parks, national nature reserves, areas of outstanding natural beauty, sites of special scientific interest (SSSIs) – were devised in a time of global conflict and rolled out, despite national bankruptcy, in the early postwar years.</p>\n<p>\n\tThese may make up the bedrock of present conservation policy but, according to Rose, they are no longer fit for purpose. Far from developing ever-richer natural environments in the ensuing 75 years, we have failed even to hold on to the landscapes we inherited. The book is shaped around nine key species, including the otter, nightingale, white-tailed eagle and badger.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs well as giving full rein to Rose’s lyrical prose, the formula allows him to explore the indisputable achievements of conservation charities. Otters and white-tailed eagles, for instance, have both been brought back from perilously low numbers. By the 1970s otters were wiped out over most of lowland England by agrochemicals. Yet, through a combination of state and charity work, the species has now returned to every English county surveyed, just as white-tailed eagles have been restored to northern Scotland over the same period.</p>\n<p>\n\tRose points out that these specific gains must be set against more general adverse trends in wildlife. By almost every historical index, Britain has a pitiful record on environmental health. On the Farmland Bird Index, which offers insight into the quality of the nation’s food-producing countryside, Britain was last among all EU countries. Overall Europe has lost 421 million birds in 30 years, of which Britain accounts for 44 million, a total that – proportionate to area – is nearly twice the EU average. In 2016, on what is called the Biodiversity Intactness Index, England specifically was judged to be the 29th most denatured country on Earth.</p>\n<p>\n\tRose shows how we have come to such a pass when he charts the unstoppable decline in our most celebrated songbird, the nightingale, which has lost 90 per cent of its British population. His account centres on an ongoing battle to save a site in Kent called Lodge Hill, formerly owned as a munitions store by the Ministry of Defence (MoD). Access has long been restricted because of its military sensitivities and, in our absence, this legally protected wildlife site has grown into a paradise for bats, a suite of rare reptiles and amphibians, as well as about one-tenth of England’s last nightingales.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe MoD has since transferred ownership of Lodge Hill to a quango called Homes England, thereby seeking to subsume the clean-up costs of unexploded ordnance within the economics of building thousands of new homes in the area. Over ten years, conservationists, including the RSPB, BugLife, Butterfly Conservation, Kent Bat Group and Kent Wildlife Trust, all of which attest the exceptional importance of Lodge Hill, have fought four planning battles with developers and Medway Council to prevent it being turned into a building site.</p>\n<p>\n\tRose highlights how the root problem for conservation is that protective designations are located within, and are subordinate to, the planning regulatory system, whose underlying rationale is to enable development. To protect an SSSI such as Lodge Hill, environmentalists must not only win every time a fresh application arises: they must also bear the high costs of fending off each assault. But conservation charities don’t exist to make profit; property developers do. The implications are that wildlife loss is built into the very process of environmental protection. We have not developed conservation policy to hold the natural world inviolate; it is there as a temporary fix, to fulfil a proclaimed if often hollow moral position, that cedes ground whenever a human need is viewed as overwhelming.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs a remedy for this failed system, Rose proposes a simple expedient: largely remove legally protected wildlife sites from the planning system so that the right to overturn their status occurs only in the minimum of cases. In other words, make legal protection mean precisely what it says. Given that Boris Johnson gave a summer speech declaring a wish to “build, build, build” and sweep aside “newt-counting delays in our system”, it is hard to have faith in the government’s proclaimed desire to reverse the fortunes of Britain’s natural heritage.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf Rose identifies the central issue that has failed nature in Britain, then the graphic novelist Nick Hayes, in <em>The Book of Trespass,</em> has named the other central obstacle to a post-lockdown future in which people enjoy genuine access to wildlife-rich space. According to Hayes, it is simple: most of the British are a landless people. While 53 million of us own on average seven-hundredths of one acre, roughly 35,000 people own half this country. One-third of all land is still owned by the aristocracy and the 24 non-royal dukes have almost four million acres of it.</p>\n<p>\n\tYet it wasn’t always so. Britain’s ordinary commoners once had access and rights of usage over 6.8 million acres. But the landed classes, via 5,200 acts of parliament, mainly between 1760 and 1844, and through a legislative process that they controlled in its entirety, transferred to their own possession most of the common estate. The land-grab amounted to internal colonisation. In the past 100 years there has been a further reduction in public access to land with the loss of roughly half of all footpaths in England.</p>\n<p>\n\tBrilliantly argued, <em>The Book of Trespass </em>explores with clarity and courage an ancient problem in radically new ways. Like Jay Griffiths in another essential book, <em>Wild: An Elemental Journey</em> (2007), Hayes unearths the psychological preconditions that empower and legitimise these monumental inequalities. He describes how the British have so long internalised this sense of alienation from the countryside that they consider it a kind of trespass even to reflect on the privileges of the landed classes.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is with this filter in place that we can at least comprehend the shocking littering seen at the Bournemouth beaches. With no investment in it and no sense of shared responsibility towards the countryside, is it not inevitable that people will treat land carelessly? A secondary factor in the littering epidemic must surely be government failure to invest in public messaging about proper countryside behaviour. In the past decade it has spent around £2,000 a year promoting the Countryside Code, as opposed to £46m on the “Get ready for Brexit” campaign.</p>\n<p>\n\tHayes explains how land has been made a vehicle for fiscal transfer, by which ordinary citizens pay for their subservience and exclusion through monetary benefits to landowners. For more than half a century, the EU’s common agricultural policy has been party to a taxation that is little short of medieval in character. Hayes gives the example of our non-royal dukes, 17 of whom pocketed £8.4m, while 14 marquises got £3.5m in tax transfers, in 2016 alone. (These sums are paid by the EU, but after Brexit replacement policies will almost certainly continue to give money to large landowners.) The author Kevin Cahill, in his devastating exposure of land injustice <em>Who Owns the World</em> (2006), calls this transfer from the poorest to the wealthiest “the heist of all heists”.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn making this judgement, Cahill should perhaps have singled out for special consideration the public swindle associated with Britain’s grouse moor. When we survey the full extent of the nation’s environmental mismanagement, as outlined in Rose’s book, then grouse moors are among the worst-case scenarios.</p>\n<p>\n\tThese upland landscapes are a component of those “wastes” conferred on the landed gentry through the 19th-century acts of enclosure. Long misunderstood and unfortunately known as “blanket bog”, they are among the rarest ecological treasures on our islands. In a world of climate chaos, they are additionally the most significant natural storage system we possess, sequestering more atmospheric carbon than rainforest. Their predominant vegetation, called sphagnum moss, is twice as absorbent as cotton wool, offering opportunities to mitigate the escalating problems of flooding in Britain.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe inherent environmental benefits of moors are not maximised for the good of all, nor do the open character and wild aspect of these places fulfil the public’s need for space through rights of access. Rather, they serve the sporting pleasure of a minuscule elite. According to Mark Avery in his seminal exposure of grouse moors, <em>Inglorious</em> (2015), the 1.5 million acres of moorland in England are shaped to meet the interests of about 15,000 mainly male clients. For a day’s shoot each “gun” can pay anything up to £3,000.</p>\n<p>\n\tDriven shooting is apparently the most exciting form of bird-killing sport in which the “guns”, immobile and expectant with their expensive tweeds and Purdey firearms, await grouse flights that are driven toward them by paid beaters. Even the physical choreography of driven shooting seems a ritualised expression of dominance by those who have the sporting fun over those who do the beating.</p>\n<p>\n\tTo achieve the abnormal surpluses of grouse needed to pursue driven shooting, the moor owners and managers intensively flay the vegetation, drain it and, until very recently, widely burned it over vast areas to create the desired monoculture. Setting fire to moorland is a distorted abuse of our upland environment, but the most ecologically illiterate part is that we pay them to do it. The annual subsidy that underpins the sporting obsessions of roughly 0.01 per cent of our population was about £17.3m in 2013.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere is a further darkness to driven grouse practice that receives little light: the sport involves the relentless illegal slaughter of birds of prey – kites, buzzards, peregrines, eagles and especially hen harriers – and anything else that impacts on grouse numbers. Perhaps the most pernicious of these killing exercises is the previously wholesale destruction of mountain hares, because they carry a sickness that affects grouse. Mercifully the hare has been given legal protection in Scotland this year, but not in England. Yet the recent jubilation that the Holyrood decision ignited, especially south of the border, was not just an expression of justice achieved. The long-awaited protection for this scarce, native, utterly harmless and beautiful animal illuminates how infrequent is the triumph of such values in relation to British nature.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat would be genuine justice for the British is a total ban on driven grouse shooting throughout the country. Even better would be the reclamation of these territories for national benefit. As George Monbiot has argued, we have paid many times over in subsidies the value of their outright purchase already.</p>\n<p>\n\tRepossession of our upland landscapes would provide huge opportunities for outdoor activities, for trails and recreation in areas close to large population centres in Yorkshire, Lancashire and north-east England. Overnight it would deliver an area for nature conservation and for programmes of ecological restoration that would be roughly equal in England alone to the entire landholdings of the National Trust, the RSPB and the Wildlife Trusts combined.</p>\n<p>\n\tWill it happen? Almost certainly not. Yet the cessation of driven shooting will come in the near future. From every ecological perspective it is untenable, but the continued killing of our country’s birds of prey is little short of a national disgrace.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf we are truly intent on a new dispensation in our relationship with nature, then banning driven grouse shooting would not be the fulfilment of the policy. Yet it would represent a very important beginning. Were the environmental organisations to unite in a collective campaign then, as low-hanging fruit, it would fall very quickly. If the various organisations currently calling for a new deal on nature undertook it, they should pursue and understand it at two distinct levels.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is firstly the physical restoration of national territory to the public estate. More importantly, it would represent a symbolic assertion of the principle at the heart of all conservation efforts and land-access rights. Land and nature nourish humans across the entire spectrum of their needs and aspirations. Control of those multifarious benefits is not exclusive to he or she who holds the title deed. It belongs to us all.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Mark Cocker’s books include “Our Place: Can We Save Britain’s Wildlife Before It Is Too Late?” (Jonathan Cape)</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Wild Child: Coming Home to Nature </strong><br />\n\tPatrick Barkham<br />\n\t<em>Granta, 256pp, £16.99</em></p>\n<p>\t<strong>Bringing Back the Beaver: The Story of One Man’s Quest to Rewild Britain’s Waterways</strong><br />\n\tDerek Gow <br />\n\t<em>Chelsea Green, 208pp, £20</em></p>\n<p>\t<strong>The Book of Trespass: Crossing the Lines that Divide Us </strong><br />\n\tNick Hayes<br />\n\t<em>Bloomsbury Circus, 464pp, £20</em></p>\n<p>\t<strong>Framing Nature: Conservation and Culture </strong><br />\n\tLaurence Rose<br />\n\t<em>Gritstone Publishing, 256pp, £11.95</em></p>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n          Tim Robinson/millennium images, UK      \n\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 16:32:32 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_730/public/Longreads_2020/09/2020_36_cocker_inside.jpg?itok=d3rzblvI","linkMd5":"04ddce83dc55cce28ffd8d8448141da3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn68@2020_6/2020/09/05/09-02-10-032_28dd3661df9946e7.webp","destWidth":730,"destHeight":520,"sourceBytes":108896,"destBytes":73852,"author":"Mark Cocker","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_730/public/Longreads_2020/09/2020_36_cocker_inside.jpg?itok=d3rzblvI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn68@2020_6/2020/09/05/09-02-10-032_28dd3661df9946e7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528290},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"Survey: US and UK publics are most pessimistic about their governments&#039;

The wrong one has dominated the headlines.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-ce15d28d-7fff-a099-fcab-74c66d07af61\">The </span>Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotland, or <span>Gers, figures, which measure the nation’s spending and revenues for the past 12 months, are always a variation on a theme and spark the same predictable and angry debate each year. </span><a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/publications/government-expenditure-revenue-scotland-gers-2019-20/\" target=\"_blank\">The latest stats</a> show Scotland’s net fiscal balance in 2019-20 – that is, the gap between revenue and spending – was a deficit of 8.6 per cent of GDP, or £15.1bn. The previous year’s Gers put the gap at 7.4 per cent, or £13.1bn. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-ce15d28d-7fff-a099-fcab-74c66d07af61\">The SNP blame the widening gap at least in part on Covid-19 (though the stats run for the year to March 2020, so just as the crisis had begun to bite). Unionists point out that the figures show Scotland benefits from the UK to the tune of circa £2,000 per person. What it would all mean for independence will fill the newspapers for days to come.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-ce15d28d-7fff-a099-fcab-74c66d07af61\">The numbers matter hugely, of course. But they merely confirm something we have known for a long time – redistribution within the Union is a significant economic benefit to Scotland. An independent nation would face multiple and complex challenges in closing the gap. That doesn’t mean it’s not worth doing, of course, and there’s more to nationhood than money.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-ce15d28d-7fff-a099-fcab-74c66d07af61\"><a href=\"http://www.gov.scot/publications/scottish-technology-ecosystem-review/\" target=\"_blank\">The second document</a></span> was a review of the “Scottish Technology Ecosystem” by Mark Logan, a former chief operating officer of Skyscanner, the online travel business that became one of Scotland’s few tech unicorns before being sold to a Chinese company.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-ce15d28d-7fff-a099-fcab-74c66d07af61\">The paper offers something genuinely original and potentially seminal, which is rare enough in politics. It is a comprehensive analysis of the state of play in the Scottish tech sector – good but not as good as it needs to be – and a detailed and exciting route map for how the government and the private sector can work together to build Scotland into a global leader. As Logan says, “there is a tipping-point within tech ecosystems after which certain virtuous network effects establish themselves, and at which point the ecosystem is essentially self-sustaining. Scotland’s tech ecosystem has not reached this…” </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-ce15d28d-7fff-a099-fcab-74c66d07af61\">Whether you’re for or against independence, you should want the Scottish economy to be better and globally competitive in growth areas. Success advances your constitutional case, either way. The Logan report is world-class and should be at the heart of policy-making and all the manifestos for next year’s Holyrood election.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-ce15d28d-7fff-a099-fcab-74c66d07af61\">The author visualises an environment in which computer science has the same centrality in the school curriculum as maths and physics. More computing graduates should be recruited into teaching, perhaps via a rapid-access scheme. The subject is still often taught by non-specialists.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-ce15d28d-7fff-a099-fcab-74c66d07af61\">This pipeline of young talent would emerge into a higher education system where the incentives are restructured to increase entrepreneurialism, boost the number of software engineering and computer science graduates, and to improve the number of spin-outs in both number and quality. Logan makes a telling point about the existing set-up: “If Larry Page had attended a Scottish university, a KPI [key performance indicator] somewhere would have tipped towards amber when he co-founded Google, then towards red when Sergey Brin joined him.”</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-ce15d28d-7fff-a099-fcab-74c66d07af61\">It is hard to attract the best talent from London or Silicon Valley because there are not enough job opportunities to tempt senior figures to move their families. But without these people, start-ups struggle to scale up or have to move south. Equally, Scotland should do more to tap its diaspora, as Ireland has done – there are plenty Scots in senior tech jobs in Silicon Valley and elsewhere.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-ce15d28d-7fff-a099-fcab-74c66d07af61\">Logan suggests the Scottish government works with venture capitalists to address the shortage of seed capital, and creates a joint investment fund to boost the sector. He believes that these steps, amid a series of other, smart recommendations, could push Scotland to that tipping point “at which the ecosystem hosts a critical mass of viable start-ups and scale-ups.” At this point, the virtuous network effects would kick in, reducing the need for state intervention. The theory is similar to that behind the UK government’s Green Investment Bank, though that was privatised too early.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-ce15d28d-7fff-a099-fcab-74c66d07af61\">Scottish ministers, it’s fair to say, are delighted with the depth and quality of the report, and seem determined to pursue its recommendations.

But the real world stubbornly refuses to go away, and the effects of Brexit, Covid-19, a global downturn and the rise in economic nationalism all threaten Scotland’s future prospects, and with it its ability to pay its bills, fund its public services and keep its citizens gainfully employed.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-ce15d28d-7fff-a099-fcab-74c66d07af61\">We all know the future is tech, and that even now we are only in the foothills of its ultimate potential. There’s also no doubt Scotland has the native genius to thrive. The question is, amid the perma-row over independence, does it have the attention span and the will?</span></p>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n          Getty Images      \n\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-image-caption field-type-text field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\">Saltire flags blow in the wind on top of The Bank of Scotland building on The Mound in Edinburgh.</div></div></div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 27 Aug 2020 12:28:53 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-840820676_1_.jpg?itok=H0RAtdcJ","linkMd5":"9822c25dfd2f9e4ca4474f8b677e8b8d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn92@2020_2/2020/09/05/09-02-10-887_4cd2bd537c61f324.webp","destWidth":790,"destHeight":350,"sourceBytes":43949,"destBytes":30930,"author":"Chris Deerin","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-840820676_1_.jpg?itok=H0RAtdcJ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn92@2020_2/2020/09/05/09-02-10-887_4cd2bd537c61f324.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528305},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"On the fascist tradition in American politics","link":"https://www.newstatesman.com/2020/09/fascist-tradition-american-politics","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-field-subheadline field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"> <p>\n\t<em>Jeremy Cliffe writes:</em></p>\n<div>\n<p>\n\t\tSarah Churchwell, professor of American Literature and Public Understanding of the Humanities at the University of London, has an essay in this week's issue of the <em>New Statesman</em> on the fascist tradition in American politics.

Since the president’s grip on the Egyptian parliament is notoriously tight and the proposed intervention was presented as a matter of Egyptian national security, the outcome was a foregone conclusion. The parliament unanimously agreed the authorisation requested.</p>\n<p>\n\tAn Egyptian intervention in eastern Libya is an invitation to reflect on the historical importance of Libya as a geopolitical inflection point for the eastern Mediterranean region.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn 1911, the Italians, encouraged by the British and French, attacked the three Ottoman provinces known today as Libya in a bid to acquire a colony in North Africa. The Italian-Libyan War, now almost completely forgotten, even in Italy, was the first in world history where aerial bombardments took place. Hand-primed bombs were thrown from biplanes and dirigibles on to Ottoman troops below, sowing terror and confusion.</p>\n<p>\n\tLacking an effective navy and prevented from transferring troops through British-controlled Egypt, the Ottomans couldn’t replenish or supply the forces in the country. But the Libyan resistance was unexpectedly fierce. Unable to advance into the hinterland, the Italian troops found themselves trapped near the coast.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe impact of this unprovoked attack on three integral provinces of the Ottoman empire in Africa was profound. The Italian pursuit of Ottoman naval forces led to repeated closures of the Turkish Straits, blocking the passage of transport ships carrying Russian grain for export and seriously disrupting the Russian economy. A series of knock-on crises broke out in south-eastern Europe, triggering two major wars in 1912 and 1913 and sweeping away security arrangements that had previously prevented Balkan conflicts from escalating into continental wars. In short, the war for Libya proved a milestone on the road to the conflict that broke out in 1914.</p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\">\n\t<span class=\"divider\">****</span></p>\n<p>\n\tIn 2011, exactly 100 years later, bombs were once again falling on Libya and the headlines were full of the same place names that had caught international attention in 1911: Tripoli, Benghazi, Sirte, Derna, Tobruk, Zawiya, Misrata. This time it wasn’t the Italians doing the bombing, but Nato. The Ottoman empire was of the distant past and Libya was now an independent and relatively isolated state. The aim of the bombing was not to establish a new north African colony but to impose a ceasefire, prevent humanitarian catastrophe and limit the operations of the crumbling dictatorship of Muammar al-Gaddafi.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere was no third world war in 2014, of course. But the airstrikes of 2011 did exacerbate tensions among the major powers, partly because Nato’s humanitarian intervention quickly morphed into an assault on the Gaddafi regime. Vladimir Putin, then prime minister of Russia, compared the action to a “medieval call to crusade”. It was an unsettling feature of the world order, he remarked, that armed interventions could so easily be unleashed against sovereign states. Russia, Putin declared, would respond by strengthening its own defensive capacity. Commentators who know Putin well have suggested that the Libyan crisis of 2011, and especially the lynching of Gaddafi, were decisive in placing the Russian leader on the path to a more aggressively anti-Western foreign policy.</p>\n<p>\n\tSince the fall of Gaddafi, Libya has been torn by a civil war between troops of the Government of National Accord (GNA) in the west of the country and the Libyan National Army (LNA) led by General Khalifa Haftar in the east. The UN and the EU have recognised the GNA as Libya’s legitimate government; General Khalifa Haftar has been supported by Russia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn 2019, Turkey’s President Tayyip Erdogan entertained a formal plea from the GNA for Turkish assistance against the forces led by Haftar. Erdogan asked the Turkish parliament for a resolution mandating an intervention with a view to securing Turkish interests in North Africa and the Mediterranean and achieving stability in Libya. In January this year, Turkish forces began deploying to the west of the country. “They will be managing the situation over there,” Erdogan said in an interview with CNN Turk.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe action is widely understood to reflect the priorities established in Turkey’s “Blue Homeland Doctrine”, which aims to secure improved Turkish access to resources in the eastern Mediterranean.</p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\">\n\t<span class=\"divider\">***</span></p>\n<p>\n\tIn responding to Turkey’s growing presence in western Libya, Egypt’s al-Sisi has followed the same playbook. On 13 July this year, the “Eastern Libyan Parliament”, sometimes called the “Eastern-based Libyan House of Representatives”, requested Egyptian assistance in safeguarding national security against the threat posed by the Turkish “occupation” in the west. Three days later, delegates of several eastern Libyan tribes were received in Cairo, where they met the president and requested assistance “to protect the national security of Libya and Egypt”. Al-Sisi expressed his support in principle and assured his interlocutors that the Egyptian army was the strongest in the region. The next step was to ask the Egyptian parliament for an intervention mandate. The parliament resolved unanimously, according to a statement issued on 20 July, to approve “the deployment of members of the Egyptian armed forces on combat missions outside Egypt’s borders to defend Egyptian national security… against criminal armed militias and foreign terrorist elements”.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is still unlikely that a direct clash between Egyptian and Turkish troops will result from these steps. Egypt has for the moment promised only training, equipment and logistical support for its eastern Libyan proxies. But whereas the events of 2011 recalled the history of Western colonial and imperial violence, the prospect of an Egyptian-Turkish stand-off in northern Africa has switched on memories that extend far beyond the war of 1911 to the 1830s, when an ambitious Egyptian leader challenged Ottoman power in the eastern Mediterranean.</p>\n<p>\n\tAli Pasha, later known as Mehmet Ali or Muhammad Ali, was the first great state-builder of modern Egyptian history. He was a naval and military reformer who built a central bureaucracy, a moderately meritocratic educational system and the beginnings of a modern economy. He was not an Egyptian by birth, or even an Arab, but an Albanian governor in Ottoman service.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the 1810s and 1820s, Muhammad Ali was the Ottoman Sultan’s energetic supporter. In 1811 and 1812, he helped Istanbul regain control over the Arabian Peninsula, whose holy places had fallen into the hands of the House of Saud, champions of a literalist Hanbali interpretation of Islam. In 1825, Muhammad Ali sent a large navy under the command of his son Ibrahim to suppress the Greek struggle for independence from the Ottoman empire. This venture was at first successful, in the sense that Egyptian forces wrested control of much of mainland Greece from the insurgents.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the Egyptian expedition also triggered the intervention of the Great Powers on behalf of Greece. The Egyptians were pushed back out of the peninsula and British, Russian and French ships destroyed the Egyptian fleet at the Battle of Navarino in 1827.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn 1831, Muhammad Ali, having conquered most of Sudan, turned on the Sultan and invaded Syria, initiating the First Turko-Egyptian War (1831-33). When the Ottomans moved to reoccupy lands lost to the Egyptians, Muhammad Ali fought them again in the Second Turko-Egyptian War of 1839-1841, inflicting a calamitous defeat on the Ottoman forces at the Battle of Nezib on 24 June 1839. With the Ottomans close to collapse, the European Great Powers rushed once again to intervene, brokering a peace that saved the empire and secured de facto independence for Egypt under Muhammad Ali and his descendants.</p>\n<p>\n\tToday, it is as if the tensions over Libya have shone a light on a part of Egypt’s historical diorama that has usually lain in shadow. State-supporting newspapers in Egypt attack Ankara’s intervention in the west of the country as “Turkish aggression on Arab soil with an Ottoman background”. Egypt’s intervention is depicted as a striking blow against the “imperialism” of Istanbul. On 7 June, the Speaker of the Egyptian parliament, Ali Abdel-Aal, declared that “those [meaning the Turks] who have dreams of colonising the Arab world again will go to the dustbin of history”.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn a statement made on the same day, Ahmed Raslan, head of the parliamentary committee on Arab affairs, denounced “the new Turkish colonists who seek to impose their control on parts of the Arab world and seek to steal its wealth and riches”.</p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\">\n\t<span class=\"divider\">***</span></p>\n<p>\n\tThe focus is not specifically on Muhammad Ali, who is remembered principally as a foundational Egyptian patriot and state-builder, but on something more emotional and diffuse, namely the memory of the Arab nationalist movements that chafed under Ottoman rule and eventually threw off the yoke of the Ottoman empire. Of course, these historical resonances are not “memories” rising unbidden to the surface of consciousness; they are rhetorical tools designed to endow present-day policies with depth and legitimacy, to make them feel less like newfangled inventions and more like the fulfilment of a time-honoured national task.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere is a religious dimension to the crisis. The al-Sisi government claims that the fighters loyal to the Turkish-supported GNA include partisans of Islamic State. More specifically, Turkey is accused of sending Isis fighters from Syria to support the GNA. But it should be noted that a US Pentagon investigation found this accusation to be false. As many as 3,000 Syrians had been transferred by Turkey to Libya and paid to fight there, but these were mercenaries and not Islamist militiamen, according to the Pentagon’s report. On the other hand, Erdogan’s sympathy for the Muslim Brotherhood, ruthlessly suppressed by al-Sisi in Egypt and still active in Libya, is well known. Erdogan is often seen making the rabaa sign to his supporters. This gesture, in which the four fingers are raised and the thumb tucked into the palm of the hand, recalls the massacre in Cairo’s Rabaa Square on 14 August 2013, when Egyptian security forces fired on a sit-in of Muslim Brotherhood supporters, killing more than 800 civilians (the Arabic word <em>rabaa </em>means “four”, hence the raised fingers).</p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\">\n\t<span class=\"divider\">****</span></p>\n<p>\n\tHow will the Libyan crisis resolve itself? Partition, though it has been proposed by some, would be difficult, because both the western and the eastern political entities lay claim to the whole country. The ultimate prize is the hotly fought-over oil-bearing areas around the central regions of Sirte and Jufra – key sources of national revenue that neither side is willing to renounce. They are currently held by the LNA.</p>\n<p>\n\tLibya today is an exceptionally inclement environment for negotiating political settlements. Ghassan Salamé, the former Lebanese culture minister who was UN envoy for Libya, resigned from his post in March this year, citing “stress”: “For two years, I tried to reunite Libyans and restrain foreign interference,” Salamé wrote, “but for health reasons I can no longer continue with this level of stress.” He has not yet been replaced. At the Libya summit in Berlin on 19 January this year, the GNA leader Fayez al-Sarraj and Khalifa Haftar, though they both agreed to come to the German chancellery building, refused to meet face to face.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe complexity of the Libyan conflict is a further barrier to progress. In addition to rival armies and tribal militias divided along ethnic and ideological lines, many foreign players are engaged. While the EU continued to acknowledge the Tripoli-based GNA, France has covertly helped to arm and train the forces led by Haftar, a move that recalls the “Oriental Crisis” of 1840, when France was for a time the only European power prepared to support Muhammad Ali against the Ottoman Sultan.</p>\n<p>\n\tRussia and the UAE are also reportedly supplying Haftar with weaponry. The Turks have sent drones, military advisers and foreign mercenaries to the GNA and have deployed naval craft along the Libyan coast in support of GNA forces. With so many uncoordinated stakeholders in play, it is virtually impossible for anyone to control the evolution of the conflict or to forestall local and regional escalations. As long as the mayhem persists, it is difficult to see how the question of uncontrolled mass migration from the Libyan littoral across the Mediterranean to Europe will be resolved.</p>\n<p>\n\tOne of the odd things about the history of international relations is that even as the world system and the political cultures that compose it change, certain regions remain volatile. Libya has repeatedly been a cat’s paw for bad geopolitical weather. It gives the lie to the notion that there are heartlands where conflicts have world-historical consequences and peripheries where they do not. Libya matters and we ignore it at our peril. </p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Christopher Clark is Regius Professor of History at the University of Cambridge</em></p>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n          Amru Salahuddien/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images      \n\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-image-caption field-type-text field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\">Civil war: Libyan Government of National Accord forces in “Operation Peace Storm” against General Khalifa Haftar’s forces, Tripoli, March 2020</div></div></div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 16:16:51 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_730/public/Longreads_2020/08/2020_31_libya.jpg?itok=54gpRxwK","linkMd5":"5b2403e2a156727ee9578f5a5431da15","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn76@2020_3/2020/09/05/09-02-09-063_4c92f26af7fcc4e0.webp","destWidth":730,"destHeight":520,"sourceBytes":67986,"destBytes":43282,"author":"Anonymous","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_730/public/Longreads_2020/08/2020_31_libya.jpg?itok=54gpRxwK":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn76@2020_3/2020/09/05/09-02-09-063_4c92f26af7fcc4e0.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528308},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"The world to come ","link":"https://www.newstatesman.com/international/coronavirus/2020/08/world-come","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-field-subheadline field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"> <p>\n\t<em>New Statesman </em>writers on how the Covid-19 pandemic will transform our way of life.</p>\n </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><noscript class=\"adaptive-image\" data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=\"300 768\" data-adaptive-image-300-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;300&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_866_450/public/Longreads_2020/08/2020_35_wtc_opener.jpg?itok=9vuHIWSb&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-768-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;768&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_360_203/public/Longreads_2020/08/2020_35_wtc_opener.jpg?itok=4ls6bZqQ&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-max-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;max&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_730/public/Longreads_2020/08/2020_35_wtc_opener.jpg?itok=LEh_IaMf&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\"><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_730/public/Longreads_2020/08/2020_35_wtc_opener.jpg?itok=LEh_IaMf\" alt=\"\" /></noscript>\n</div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\" property=\"content:encoded\"> <h4 class=\"rtecenter\">\n\t<a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/coronavirus/2020/08/world-come-digital-dystopia\" target=\"_blank\">A digital dystopia, by William Davies</a></h4>\n<p>\n\tAs Britain neared its worst recession in 300 years, Jeff Bezos increased his wealth by $24bn.

The author has the excuse that these are not his words at all but those of his fictional narrator, though they still carry the sting of truth. “Starbucks is the smart coffee for dumb people,” he declares. “It’s the Christopher Nolan of coffee.”</p>\n<p>\n\tKaufman and Nolan have spent their separate careers making “avant-garde lite”, as the late Gilbert Adair put it in his review of the Kaufman-scripted <em>Being John Malkovich</em> – occasionally even treading on one another’s toes. When Nolan’s amnesia thriller <em>Memento</em> opened in 2000, Kaufman considered abandoning <em>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</em>, the similarly themed screenplay he was working on. Now both have new films out in which a nameless protagonist wrestles with the malleability of time. Nolan’s movie is like a Patek Philippe wristwatch, Kaufman’s a melted Dali clock face.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>I’m Thinking of Ending Things</em>, which Kaufman adapted from the novel by Iain Reid, is a philosophical comedy-horror confined largely to the inside of a car during a blizzard, while Nolan’s <em>Tenet</em> is an action spectacular shot in opulent locations in seven countries. Kaufman’s film is available only on Netflix; Nolan, who has called that platform’s release strategies “mindless”, refused to allow <em>Tenet</em> to be streamed or to delay its theatrical debut beyond the summer. Any cinemas currently open are using the film to gauge whether public appetite for the big screen has survived the pandemic.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe first voice we hear in <em>I’m Thinking of Ending Things</em> belongs to an unnamed woman (Jessie Buckley) on a road trip with her boyfriend Jake (Jesse Plemons) to meet his parents in Oklahoma. Her sanity feels as slippery as the icy tarmac. First, she confides that she has never felt so connected to another person, then that she would break it off if only she could be bothered. Her biography alters line by line. She is unfamiliar with Wordsworth, then she is a poet, then a medical student. Once the pair sit down with Jake’s parents for a fraught and grimly funny dinner, she has become a landscape painter. It’s as though we are seeing every possible incarnation of her.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf anyone is up to the task of playing this infinite-sided enigma, it is Buckley. She was hired as a replacement for Brie Larson, but Kaufman must have jumped for joy, not only at her mutable performance, with its mysterious unpeeling layers of delight, dread, anger and yearning, but also at the homophonic coincidence of casting a Jessie and a Jesse, both redheads at that, to play a couple whose identities are at risk of merging.</p>\n<p>\n\tAgeing, here, is as provisional as personality. Jake’s twitchy middle-aged mother (Toni Collette) goes from serving dinner to lying desiccated on her deathbed, where she is watched over by a husband (David Thewlis) who is no longer stooped and senile but magically revitalised. Far from being linear, time rushes in every direction at once.</p>\n<p>\n\tSomething similar is afoot in <em>Tenet</em>. To cut an incomprehensible story short, the film stars John David Washington, dapper son of Denzel, as a CIA agent known as The Protagonist. This nominative determinism doesn’t extend to the other characters. If it did, Elizabeth Debicki would be called The Damsel in Distress and Kenneth Branagh The Pantomime Villain. Robert Pattinson, rakish with his blond highlights and scarves, would go by Light Relief, rather than the infinitely more disappointing Neil.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Protagonist is trying to thwart a plan, hatched in the future, to destroy the world in the present, but the more everyone explains the plot, the more needlessly complicated it becomes. The “grandfather paradox” is mentioned – if you go back in time to kill Grandpa, will you still exist? – but<em> Back to the Future</em> and <em>The Terminator</em> handled the same idea with less heavy lifting. Proceedings become distinctly underwhelming when the portal between timelines is revealed to be a large revolving door of the kind found at high street department stores.</p>\n<p>\n\tAction set-pieces, including a non-CGI plane crash, are staged at tremendous expense, and several combat sequences feature some of the cast moving in reverse like an experimental dance troupe. But a routine military battle and the hokey device of a bomb timer counting down to destruction still add up to a dismal excuse for a climax, regardless of whether half the actors appear to be doing the moonwalk or not.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>I’m Thinking of Ending Things</em> presents its share of frustrations, too. Reality finally becomes so unstable that it breaks apart before our eyes, fracturing into excerpts of ballet, musical theatre, even animation – each one loosening the film’s emotional tension. At least the movie has a pulse, as well as performances rich in complexity, whereas <em>Tenet</em> is powered by a mechanism and acted by suits. “Wake up the Americans,” is the first line heard in the film. Waking up the audience would be a start.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>“Tenet” is in cinemas now. “I’m Thinking of Ending Things” is on Netflix from 4 September</em></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>I’m Thinking of Ending Things (15) </strong><br />\n\tdir: Charlie Kaufman</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Tenet (12A) </strong><br />\n\tdir: Christopher Nolan</p>\n </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-image-caption field-type-text field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\">Infinite enigma: Jessie Buckley’s character is constantly shifting in I’m Thinking of Ending Things</div></div></div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 09:27:59 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/2020_36_film_resized.jpg?itok=jzKKbBQ-","linkMd5":"d594a887b1eb438565d9aec774a0938a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn37@2020_6/2020/09/05/09-02-10-483_1fa5aa5bbd1914fd.webp","destWidth":790,"destHeight":350,"sourceBytes":87654,"destBytes":60602,"author":"Ryan Gilbey","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/2020_36_film_resized.jpg?itok=jzKKbBQ-":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn37@2020_6/2020/09/05/09-02-10-483_1fa5aa5bbd1914fd.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528297},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"From the NS archive: Where are all the right-wing stand-ups?","link":"https://www.newstatesman.com/2020/09/ns-archive-where-are-all-right-wing-stand-ups","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-field-subheadline field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"> <p>\n\t16 April 2013: It’s hard to find a comedian who votes Tory.</p>\n </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><noscript class=\"adaptive-image\" data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=\"300 768\" data-adaptive-image-300-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot;

Where were these people, needed to offset charges of political bias? In this piece, the stand-up comedian Stewart Lee looked around the humourist circle to try to find who was being overlooked. The problem, he thought, was that comedy needs either a character flaw in the performer’s personality or something to react against in the wider world, but if you're on the right, “you’ve already won. You have no tragedy. You’re punching down.” Punching down, he said, just isn’t funny.</em></p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\">\n\t<span class=\"divider\">***</span></p>\n<p>\n\tCaroline Raphael, BBC Radio 4’s commissioning editor for comedy, recently confessed to difficulty in finding unashamedly right-wing comedians to balance the left-wingers on her shows.

Under analysis, their prose reveals the reliably effective structures of traditionally funny writing. A demonstrably true political observation is gradually exaggerated for comic effect until it becomes absurd and then a wry conclusion, usually more appropriate to the exaggerated version of the initial fact than the fact itself, is appended to the piece by literary sleight of hand.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere’s no denying that this approach can draw laughs, though usually laughs of painful and bitter resignation, from the readership. Indeed, Clarkson’s right-wing comedy integrity was cemented in 2011 when he was described as “one of the few things worth watching on the Burqa Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)” by the Norwegian neo-Nazi mass murderer Anders Behr­ing Breivik, a man not known for his sense of humour but whose right-wing credentials are unimpeachable. Yet where are all the bona fide right-wing stand-up comedians and could any of them fit the Radio 4 brief?</p>\n<p>\n\tRoy “Chubby” Brown, a northern club comic with brilliant timing and the ability to tap into his working-class audience’s prevailing fears, tours vast halls beneath the critical radar. Chubby’s fans imagine that the Marxist media cabal sees him as too “politically incorrect” for broadcast. The BBC, however, is publicly accountable in a way that the label that sells Chubby’s CDs in service stations is not. The punchlines and end points of jokes on BBC comedy shows can be ridiculous for comic effect, but the set-ups must reflect real facts or the BBC would face consequences.</p>\n<p>\n\tThus, this crowd-pleasing Chubby gag could not be broadcast: “You can’t say anything about religion these days, can you? They say you can’t say ‘Protestant’, you can’t say ‘Muslim’, you can’t say ‘Jew’. Which is a shame, because I like to go in my news­agent on a Sunday morning and say, ‘Here’s a quid. Keep the change, you Paki bastard.’” The set-up is based on an erroneous assumption about religion and political correctness (you <em>can </em>say “Protestant”, “Muslim” and “Jew”) and has no etymological relationship to the discussion of racist language that the pay-off seems to be addressing, though the punchy brutality of Chubby’s performance swiftly and convin­cingly papers over the logical cracks.</p>\n<p>\n\tMany Chubby jokes about supposedly controversial material proceed from similarly unsubstantiated tabloid myths. Even the most dogmatically leftist Jeremy Hardy jokes have at least some of the BBC’s required basis in news fact. Chubby does have a funny hat, though. Hardy doesn’t even have a hat.</p>\n<p>\n\tWould any of our popular arena come­dians fit the right-wing stand-up bill? The <em>Daily Mail </em>inexplicably demonises Jimmy Carr and Frankie Boyle as “politically correct left-wingers”, yet to sensitive souls they appear callous, apolitical nihilists. Carr’s jokes about the disabled and his tax avoidance undermine the idea that he is politically correct. You can’t make sense of their acts politically, but imagine them (and their unseen writing teams) not as rounded characters with backstories but as arch saloon-bar wits, trying out a succession of controversial, sometimes contradictory positions for fun, and they become coherent. Carr flirted with the idea of being a liberal satirist on Channel 4’s <em>Ten O’Clock Live</em>, a former marketing man expanding his post-pub customer base into the <em>Guardian</em> green belt. Perhaps Carr might wear a right-wing hat for Radio 4 if the money was right, which it wouldn’t be, but Boyle is too likely to be bluntly anti-war or pro-Palestinian to help Radio 4 out of its Trotskyite ghetto.</p>\n<p>\n\tAl Murray’s patriotic Pub Landlord, though a favourite on BNP internet discussion boards, is in reality a satire of the Little England mentality and so he would not help Radio 4’s right-wing quota. Jim Davidson is avowedly right-wing but seems to want the respect and friendship of trendy liberal comics while racially and homophobically abusing them on his blog, and is currently under investigation anyway, due to his links to the 1970s. I doubt his News Quiz seat is being kept warm. Henning Wehn and Liam Mullone occupy broadly libertarian positions and would please the right with their common-sense fiscal comments but confuse it with their views on individual freedom and use of irony.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the <em>Spectator</em>, Liddle suggested the actor Alexander Armstrong as a right-wing alternative to Jeremy Hardy on Radio 4, presumably because he is a member of the Notting Hill set – but Armstrong hasn’t written any comedy this century and has never performed authored stand-up, being principally an amusing mouthpiece for other writers’ jokes and advertisers’ sales pitches. Is the best we can suggest in a search for a right-wing comedian just a celebrity whose friend’s sister is George “Pencils” Osborne’s wife?</p>\n<p>\n\tWill anyone make up the right-wing stand-up comedian numbers? Since I started in the late 1980s, there have always been stand-ups who appear to be right-wing, but usually are upper-middle-class liberals who, realising that they can’t help their accents, have chosen to take on the role of a kind of out-of-touch, paternalistic Tory “posh boy”. The slit-eyed Simon Evans, whom you may have seen on a big TV stand-up showcase, is the funniest and the most committed of these, hating football fans, working-class women who dress like prostitutes and anyone who has more than two children. Particularly good over short distances, Evans nevertheless inhabits his stage persona so completely, convincingly and hilariously that I assume it must on some level overlap with his beliefs. Whether he is a real Tory or a pretend one, Radio 4 could do worse than make the unflinching Evans the official voice of the comedy opposition.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe stand-up Jerry Sadowitz’s apparent distaste for Islam, feminism and Nelson Mandela might appear to place him at the right end of the political spectrum and his language would keep him off Radio 4, but because Sadowitz is one of the most complete and perfect stand-ups in history, his exact political position is complicated. By accident or design, he appears to be socially, sexually, culturally, physically and economically at the bottom of the pile. This gives him licence to attack everything and everyone, like a drowning rat swimming desperately up the U-bend. And this tells us a lot about the essence of stand-up.</p>\n<p>\n\tStand-up comedians are not the same as wits and columnists and humorists. Strip away the showbiz and a pure stand-up is still a turn, a music-hall act. It’s clowning, and clowns are always tragic figures. Clowns’ comedy came from the inevitability of their defeat, from the gulf between what they want – whether it’s sex with their bored partner or a socialist utopia – and what they are going to get, which is nothing, nothing and a kick in the goolies. Interestingly, in the early years of the Pub Landlord, Murray alluded to how the publican’s reactionary beliefs had been compounded by domestic troubles in his past, lending him a comically effective low status that was inevitably compromised by the character’s subsequent huge popularity. Josie Long is one of the most determin­edly left-wing stand-ups working today, hated by armies of internet trolls. For me, what has improved her act even further lately is her creeping acknowledgement that the character she inhabits is involved in a self-mythologising, romantic and perhaps doomed struggle against capitalism, compromised by her frailties. In her solo show last summer, Long maintained that she’d missed the heroic chance to live the leftist legend and be arrested at a sit-in on an anti-Vodafone demo, having been distracted in Soho by a Thai buffet.</p>\n<p>\n\tCharacter and failure inform the theorising. And, love him or loathe him, Jeremy Hardy does not sound like a happy or powerful man. His corduroy candy mountain crumbled in the 1980s. He is destined to whinge into the dying of the light. That is his tragedy. That is his clown.</p>\n<p>\n\tUltimately, the left will lose. Big business will pollute the planet, capitalist culture will kill off the arts and humanities, schools will all be privatised, libraries will all close, social mobility will cease, the gulf between rich and poor will grow and everything beautiful will die. The left may note little human rights victories – gay marriage and the odd bit of better pay – but the machine is rolling inexorably forwards to crush it.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe African-American stand-up Chris Rock maintained that stand-up comedy should always be punching upwards. It’s a heroic little struggle. You can’t be a right-wing clown without some character caveat, some vulnerability, some obvious flaw. You’re on the right. You’ve already won. You have no tragedy. You’re punching down. You can be a right-wing comedy columnist, away from the public eye, a disembodied, authoritarian presence that doesn’t need to show doubt. Who could be on a stage, crowing about their victory and ridiculing those less fortunate than them without any sense of irony, shame or self-knowledge? That’s not a stand-up comedian. That’s just a c***.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16.112px;

The Treasury is reportedly contemplating rises totalling up to £30bn from changes to capital gains tax, corporation tax and pensions tax relief. Predictably, backbench Tory MPs and their tame media reacted with horror, claiming that such measures will hit “wealth creators” just when their efforts are needed for the recovery.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-e378f9d9-7fff-0fbb-406b-b67fb0555c07\">Voices on the left, however, have also questioned the necessity of tax increases, noting that the government faces no serious impediment to its ability to finance the exceptionally high levels of current spending. With British government interest rates the lowest in history, today’s economics suggest they are correct: there is at present no meaningful constraint on government borrowing. Yet Labour needs to win a general election in four years’ time, and although under no circumstances should it relapse into fretting about the deficit, it must begin making the arguments today that will enable the party to secure victory in 2024.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-e378f9d9-7fff-0fbb-406b-b67fb0555c07\">The short-term political case for pushing tax rises on the wealthy is obvious. By laying down clear demands about how the cost of the crisis should be borne, Labour can set up an argument to its political advantage for the rest of the year. Given that some of the measures the Treasury is said to be considering are already party policy – notably equalising income tax and capital gains tax rates – and that polling consistently indicates public support for well-targeted taxes on the richest, there are few immediate political drawbacks to supporting them.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-e378f9d9-7fff-0fbb-406b-b67fb0555c07\">Given the tensions at the centre of the Conservative government – between No 10’s desire to avoid austerity and promote “levelling up”, the Treasury’s wish to restrain borrowing, and Tory backbenchers’ aversion to tax increases – the most likely outcome is some form of fudge or stalling. Rumour has it that the government’s Spending Review (expected in November), announcing how much money will be allocated to each department over the next three years, will be cut back to just a single year. Meanwhile, Sunak faces a looming headache over the pace and timing of furlough withdrawal as </span><a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/economy/2020/09/why-uk-sleepwalking-job-crisis\" target=\"_blank\">unemployment surges</a> and a second wave of the virus threatens. He will be sorely tempted to defer unpalatable choices, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dc9df18e-c4bd-4f40-9827-3c6caa19a913\" target=\"_blank\">perhaps even by delaying the Budget</a>.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-e378f9d9-7fff-0fbb-406b-b67fb0555c07\">If the Tories do decide to increase taxes on the wealthy, Labour can claim credit and insist the government use the additional funding for public services. If the Tories backtrack, they will be revealed as the party of the incompetent and feckless rich – unable to manage the crisis or take its consequences seriously because they are too busy protecting the interests of the wealthiest even as others suffer. By putting the screws on the Tories now, Labour can position itself to take advantage of their ongoing muddle – and start to set the economic agenda.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-e378f9d9-7fff-0fbb-406b-b67fb0555c07\">But it’s what happens over the next four years that Labour needs to concentrate on. The uncertainties of the coming period are grave, from the fallout from Brexit to further pandemics to climate shocks, but we know two things are here to stay: high levels of government debt, and the long-term costs of Covid-19. We cannot allow that increase in debt – affordable as it is today – to become a justification for future austerity. Insisting on taxing the rich to pay for increased public spending now will help stave off arguments for the supposed necessity of cuts later on.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-e378f9d9-7fff-0fbb-406b-b67fb0555c07\">Coronavirus is already leaving very real and painful costs in its wake. There is no soft-soaping or wishing away the challenges of our new reality. A safe, effective vaccine has yet to be produced, and we have barely begun to contemplate the difficult questions and conflicts that will ensue over its production and distribution: who will make the vaccine? Who will receive it first? Who will pay for it? Even should a viable vaccine be discovered, Covid-19 is unlikely to be eradicated completely, instead </span><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-52643682\" target=\"_blank\">remaining an endemic disease</a>, inflicting real, long-term economic costs from bio-surveillance and probable re-vaccinations. And assuming we manage to keep Covid-19 down to that level – no guarantee in a world where global co-operation on health and economic issues is seriously weakened – we still face the prospect of future epidemics, with outbreaks <a href=\"https://blogs.worldbank.org/climatechange/fighting-infectious-diseases-connection-climate-change\" target=\"_blank\">becoming more frequent as the natural environment disintegrates</a>.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-e378f9d9-7fff-0fbb-406b-b67fb0555c07\">Entire industries will need to change how they operate and in some cases wind down altogether. Airlines and hospitality are the most conspicuous early victims, but as working from home becomes pervasive, the commercial property market and high streets are suffering too. Health and social care expenditures will need to increase, even above the eye-watering projections that have already been made to cope with an ageing population. With new and unexpected costs imposed on the economy, </span><a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/economy/2020/09/why-uk-sleepwalking-job-crisis\">and jobs being lost</a> even if others are created, overall economic growth may well be difficult to revive – even to the anaemic levels seen since the 2008 crash. Any plans for future government spending will need to be robust enough not to depend on a return to supposedly “normal” rates of growth. </p>\n<p>\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-e378f9d9-7fff-0fbb-406b-b67fb0555c07\">There is no winding the clock back to the pre-Covid world. The past has gone, and the future poses challenges that none of us would wish for – but which we must face if we are to have a chance of shaping it politically. Substantial shifts in resources and economic activity will need to take place. Monetary compensation might be available to cushion some of this disruption – as we have already seen with furlough payments – but there is nothing we can pay to avoid making the changes themselves</span>. The primary political question we must ask is not “can we afford to do this?”, since these new costs are not optional, but “who will pay for this?” This is why taxation matters, since changing who pays how much tax affects the distribution of available resources in our economy. It is the first, necessary step towards detailing a programme for a Labour government, committed to social justice in an environmentally unstable world.</p>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n          Dan Kitwood/Getty Images.      \n\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Sep 2020 12:19:53 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-453377184.jpg?itok=2O9rA8Ek","linkMd5":"555e2f44abc12b0b9913f0d16a78ba3a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn75@2020_4/2020/09/05/09-02-08-807_8066566498ddfd97.webp","destWidth":790,"destHeight":350,"sourceBytes":69942,"destBytes":43482,"author":"James Meadway","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-453377184.jpg?itok=2O9rA8Ek":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn75@2020_4/2020/09/05/09-02-08-807_8066566498ddfd97.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528284},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"All the president&#039;s enabling men: a round-up of the 2020 Republican Convention","link":"https://www.newstatesman.com/white-house/2020/08/all-presidents-enabling-men-round-2020-republican-convention","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-field-subheadline field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"> <p>\n\tThis year's RNC showed that in place of a policy platform, the Republican Party is relying on personality and power.</p>\n </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><noscript class=\"adaptive-image\" data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=\"300 768 1024\" data-adaptive-image-300-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;300&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-1228233076.jpg?itok=7z1-uFTp&amp;amp;c=a85fbfceca33d72dc31246b1c051c61d&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-768-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;768&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-1228233076.jpg?itok=7z1-uFTp&amp;amp;c=a85fbfceca33d72dc31246b1c051c61d&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-1024-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;1024&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-1228233076.jpg?itok=7z1-uFTp&amp;amp;c=a85fbfceca33d72dc31246b1c051c61d&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-max-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;max&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-1228233076.jpg?itok=7z1-uFTp&amp;amp;c=a85fbfceca33d72dc31246b1c051c61d&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\"><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-1228233076.jpg?itok=TOnJFW6T\" alt=\"\" /></noscript>\n</div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\" property=\"content:encoded\"> <p>\n\tEveryone and everything at the Republican National Convention (RNC) this week was in service of one man: the president, Donald Trump. Or, perhaps more accurately, in service of Donald Trump and his version of reality.</p>\n<p>\n\tConventions – Democratic and Republican – are always about the presidential candidate. But they are also about the party, the platform that its various wings and members have negotiated, and about pitching that party to the American people.</p>\n<p>\n\tTrump's Republican Party does not have a platform. This year, instead of coming together to outline the party’s policies, the delegates put out a resolution that says that the Republican Party \"has and will continue to enthusiastically support the president's America-first agenda\". It was, if nothing else, an accurate description of the message of the past week: support Donald Trump. That's all.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe support came in different forms. There was Donald Trump Jr, the president's son, who looked into the camera and told Americans that his father would deliver perfection: \"America is the greatest country on Earth, but my father’s entire world-view revolves around the idea that we can always do even better. Imagine the life you want to have, one with a great job, a beautiful home, a perfect family.” There was Donald Trump Jr’s girlfriend, Kimberly Guilfoyle, who, in a speech largely shouted, declared, \"Biden, Harris, and the rest of the socialists will fundamentally change this nation.\" And there were more conventional politicians, like Nikki Haley, Trump's former UN ambassador and the daughter of Indian immigrants, who assured listeners, \"America is not a racist country.\" Or Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, who said in her speech that the Democrats’ impeachment of Trump was illegal, which it was not.</p>\n<p>\n\tSome of the punditry suggested a split between Trump Jr and Haley, implying that they were battling for the soul of the party. But there was no battle here. They were on the same side. They were both there for Trump, just like everyone else involved.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em><strong>[See also: <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/world/north-america/2020/08/who-was-democratic-national-convention-0\">Who was the Democrat National Convention for?</a>]</strong></em></p>\n<p>\n\tThe roll call of high-profile Trump supporters at the convention also included members of the executive branch. The Hatch Act prohibits figures in taxpayer-funded offices, save for the president and vice-president, from participating in certain forms of political activity, in order that their power is not leant to political stunts. Yet secretary of state Mike Pompeo broke precedent by delivering a speech for the convention. (He may have also broken the law, according to House Democrats who have opened an investigation, since his speech was given in Jerusalem on a taxpayer-funded trip.) Similarly, Chad Wolf, acting secretary of homeland security, took part in a televised naturalisation ceremony, in which Trump awarded five immigrants – who were reportedly not told that they would be used as part of a political convention – with citizenship.</p>\n<p>\n\tIvanka Trump, the president's daughter who is also his adviser, gave a speech on the final night in front of the White House's South Lawn. In running through a list of promises kept, she concluded with one made four years ago that she would be here with her audience: \"And here I am!\" she announced proudly. And it was true; there she was, in defiance of past precedent and perhaps also the law.</p>\n<p>\n\tSome of that support even included lying or misleading on the president’s behalf. Vice-president Mike Pence, to take one example, said that he and Trump had inherited “an economy struggling to break out of the slowest recovery since the Great Depression”. Yet their predecessor, Barack Obama, actually started the longest economic expansion in the country’s history. Alternatively, Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, said that the president stands by Americans with pre-existing health conditions – whereas, in fact, Trump is trying to dismantle Obama’s healthcare act, under which Americans with pre-existing conditions have coverage. Trump's own speech <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ryanstruyk/status/1299197966687842304\">contained</a> over 20 untrue or misleading statements, though no <a href=\"https://nowthisnews.com/news/the-rnc-ended-without-a-single-mention-of-how-many-americans-died-from-coronavirus-yes-really\">mention</a> of how many people had died from the coronavirus pandemic or even the virus's name (though he did call it \"the China virus\" twice).</p>\n<p>\n\tAll conventions present the truth in such a way that is more favourable to their candidate, just as many politicians can be caught saying things that are not true. Here, however, the small lies can work in service of larger ones so all-consuming that to believe them is to believe our reality is completely different from the one we currently inhabit. Some speakers, for instance, hailed Trump for his successful handling of the pandemic, which has, at time of writing, led to roughly 180,000 Americans deaths so far this year. Others criticised the Democrats for an alleged disrespect for law enforcement.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em><strong>[See also: <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/world/north-america/2020/08/who-was-democratic-national-convention-0\">Trump could very well win a second term</a>]</strong></em></p>\n<p>\n\tThe convention even included Mark and Patricia McCloskey, the St Louis couple that had waved guns at Black Lives Matter protesters walking by their estate. The couple warned of a lawlessness that would overtake us if Joe Biden is elected president. Meanwhile, also this week, Jacob Blake, a black man, was shot seven times in the back by police in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Protests against police brutality followed, and in response, militia assembled, ostensibly to protect property; a teenager has been charged with shooting and killing two protesters.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt time of writing, the nation is also facing wildfires in California and the fallout from Hurricane Laura, which devastated homes in Louisiana and hit parts of Texas hard too. Although not as bad as originally feared – the hurricane was thought to be a Category 5 on Wednesday (26 August); by Thursday, a Category 4 – other stronger, more frequent hurricanes will come, because nature doesn't care whether we tackle the climate crisis or not. The climate will not revert because we decide not to deal with it, or because the Republican National Convention made no mention of global warming.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd why would they mention the issue? Addressing climate change would involve describing the world in which Americans live, the one in which people are dying and have lost their jobs and are killing one another. Instead, everyone who took part in the RNC presented something else entirely: a world Donald Trump would like to see.</p>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n          Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images      \n\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-image-caption field-type-text field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\">The president and his family at the White House on the final night of the Republican National Convention.</div></div></div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 28 Aug 2020 13:53:39 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-1228233076.jpg?itok=TOnJFW6T","linkMd5":"0fcc8d23eee3a2d483d71ef083f01f4d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn28@2020_3/2020/09/05/09-02-09-538_3796afdf49c2cae8.webp","destWidth":790,"destHeight":350,"sourceBytes":60678,"destBytes":43976,"author":"Emily Tamkin","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-1228233076.jpg?itok=TOnJFW6T":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn28@2020_3/2020/09/05/09-02-09-538_3796afdf49c2cae8.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528297},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"From the NS archive: The Democratic convention","link":"https://www.newstatesman.com/2020/08/ns-archive-democratic-convention","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-field-subheadline field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"> <p>\n\t27 July 1940: On Franklin D Roosevelt's chances of winning a third presidential term.</p>\n </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><noscript class=\"adaptive-image\" data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=\"300 768\" data-adaptive-image-300-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;300&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_866_450/public/Longreads_2020/08/gettyimages-3275593.jpg?itok=T7PNVRpN&quot; alt=&quot;Franklin Delano Roosevelt at his desk, circa 1940&quot; title=&quot;Franklin Delano Roosevelt at his desk, circa 1940&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-768-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;768&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_360_203/public/Longreads_2020/08/gettyimages-3275593.jpg?itok=0RCAb1xY&quot; alt=&quot;Franklin Delano Roosevelt at his desk, circa 1940&quot; title=&quot;Franklin Delano Roosevelt at his desk, circa 1940&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-max-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;max&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_730/public/Longreads_2020/08/gettyimages-3275593.jpg?itok=ssaCGAGZ&quot; alt=&quot;Franklin Delano Roosevelt at his desk, circa 1940&quot; title=&quot;Franklin Delano Roosevelt at his desk, circa 1940&quot; /&gt;\"><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_730/public/Longreads_2020/08/gettyimages-3275593.jpg?itok=ssaCGAGZ\" alt=\"Franklin Delano Roosevelt at his desk, circa 1940\" title=\"Franklin Delano Roosevelt at his desk, circa 1940\" /></noscript>\n</div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\" property=\"content:encoded\"> <p>\n\t<em>The Democratic convention of July 1940 resulted in Franklin D Roosevelt being nominated to run for a third term, an unprecedented achievement for a US president. The political writer Harold J Laski wagers here that this was in part due to the conviction among voters that nobody could handle “these next grave years” of the war with more authority or knowledge. But Roosevelt himself was reportedly doubtful: he desired a return to private life. In this article Laski considers Roosevelt’s renomination, weighing up his and his opponent Wendell Willkie’s chances of success.</em></p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\">\n\t<span class=\"divider\">***</span></p>\n<p>\n\tThe triumphant renomination of Mr Roosevelt at Chicago is primarily due to three causes. It was clear that no other man had any comparable hold on the party, much less, as the public opinion polls had shown, upon the nation; any possible alternative, except Mr Hull, might easily have split the party, and it is pretty certain that Mr Hull shared the general view that the president must be \"drafted\" by the convention. It was due, secondly, to the belief that Mr Willkie will make a good candidate, and that the Democrats needed their best available man to beat him. It was due, thirdly, to the rapidly growing conviction among, above all, the independent voters that no one can handle these next grave years with anything like the authority or knowledge of the president. If, so far, he has been a good deal ahead of his public opinion, each day of the war narrows the distance between them.</p>\n<p>\n\tMr Roosevelt will enter the campaign with two handicaps operating against him. The first, and the one most certain to be fully exploited, is the tradition against the third term. There is no doubt at all of its depth; and there will be many voters for Mr Willkie on that ground alone. But it will count for much less than at any previous time for two reasons. First, the war has made the folly of slavish devotion to any mechanical tradition grimly obvious; and, second, the proceedings at the convention itself will have convinced many with whom the tradition might otherwise have weighed that Mr Roosevelt has genuinely accepted nomination out of devotion to public needs, and not in service to private ambition. I am speaking with real knowledge when I say that up to almost the eve of the convention, some of the president's most intimate friends were afraid that he could not even be “drafted”, so strong was his personal preference for a return to private life.</p>\n<p>\n\tHis second handicap will be the intensity of the support, financial and otherwise, that big business will give to Mr Willkie. Big business does not so much fear a third term for the Democratic Party; it fears a third term for the New Deal, and the New Deal is Mr Roosevelt. This means the danger to the forces of big business that all its major measures – the Securities Act, the Labour Relations Act, the Wages and Hours Act, the control of public utilities, the development of the great national power schemes – will become a part of the national tradition in the US. If these are the known dangers, how much more, in the domestic field, do they not fear the unknown, the expedients that may be devised by those acute minds round the president who are bold enough to think that big business should be below the law, and not above it? There will be no limit to the pressure big business will put upon its constituency to play for “soundness” and Mr Willkie – that is, to put big business once more in a position where its influence is secure.</p>\n<p>\n\tMr Roosevelt, on the other hand, has some trump cards in his hands. The first, and the greatest, is the extraordinary and growing revival of his personal prestige. This is mainly the outcome of the realisation of how right he has been in the measure he has taken of the war, and how sound have been the general lines of his direction of American policy in the international sphere. Mr Willkie has no effective criticism to make of these, and the question obviously arises in the voter's mind: can an untried and inexperienced man do so well? The second trump card is that Mr Roosevelt has made government in these eight years genuinely interesting to the ordinary man because he has related it to the ordinary man's interests. What do the Republicans offer instead? A desiccated version of the New Deal, suited to the palate of the Economic Royalists. That is why Mr Roosevelt, despite the antagonism, due to personal pique, of John L Lewis, will keep the full strength of the Labour vote, and, with the important backing of Mr HA Wallace as his running mate, pretty nearly the full strength of the farmer's vote. Labour will be held by the prospect that the New Deal will go on; and the farmers will be held by the knowledge that Mr Wallace always gave them a square deal. Mr Willkie may retort that he comes from the “hoosier” State of Indiana; it is a simple and, I suspect, an effective reply, that the tenderness of his own company, the Commonwealth and Southern, for the farmer’s interest in cheap power development, was not its most outstanding feature.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd, above and beyond all this, there is the sense that Mr Roosevelt is a world-figure, in the way in which Lincoln and Woodrow Wilson were world-figures. He knows how to make articulate the hopes of those silent millions who hate tyranny, whether it is that of the dictator in Berlin or Rome, or those more hidden, because less personal, autocracies whose habits have been grimly revealed in the stark pages of the La Follette Report. The Duponts will be for Mr Willkie, Mr Ford and Mr Girdler and Wall Street; the “Two Hundred Families” of the United States somehow do not sound like the bead-roll of American democracy. Mr Willkie will not be able easily to escape from the burden of their support; and Mr Roosevelt is a skilful enough campaigner, even in the limited effort he will be constrained to make as candidate, to see that he does not escape. And what he does not directly indicate, the redoubtable Mr Ickes, who knows how to call a spade a spade, will effectively drive home.</p>\n<p>\n\tTo some extent, obviously, the course of the election will depend upon events in Europe. But those events, I think, will not do more than affect the size of Mr Roosevelt's majority. Mr Willkie will do better than Mr Landon in 1936; he is a more robust type of candidate, and his party, in its extremity, will fight harder. I think it is a safe prophecy that Mr Wilkie will carry without fail the irretrievably Republican fastnesses of Maine and Vermont, together with Pennsylvania; I think it possible that he will win his own State of Indiana (though Mr Landon could not hold Kansas in 1936), Oregon, Connecticut and Minnesota, and he may carry Wisconsin also, if Senator La Follette decides that he needs Republican influence there for his own re-election to the Senate. Beyond that figure, I think his hopes are small indeed. His main object will be to make himself indispensable to the Republican party with a view to 1944.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: inherit;

She would have been (vastly) more sinned against than sinning, perhaps even a little saintly.  Prebble, though, isn’t having any of this. If it’s hateful that someone has plastered ­pictures of Suzie Pickles (Piper) performing a “sex act” all over the internet, well, she’s not the only victim here. The ­images in question do not, unfortunately, date  from many years ago, before she was ­married and a mother. They’re three months old. Even more unfortunately, as her ­manager Naomi (Leila Farzad) smoothly notes, she looks “really happy” in them to boot.</p>\n<p>\n\tWho’s the guy in the picture? (Or, as her husband, Cob, puts it rather more plainly: “Whose c*** is it?”) The whole thing brings to mind the infamous photograph from the Sixties of Margaret, Duchess of Argyll, in which Her Grace, resplendent in pearls, could be seen fellating a headless man (this became national news when the Duke ­deployed the picture in their divorce case); like the Duchess, Suzie is keeping ­schtum for now. But this isn’t to suggest that  she’s feeling entirely calm and collected about things. The first episode of<em> I Hate ­Suzie </em>– each one is only half an hour long – was the most frantically hectic thing I’ve seen in ages: think Alan Ayckbourn-meets-<em>Heat</em> magazine.</p>\n<p>\n\tOne minute, Suzie was celebrating the news she’d landed a part as a princess in a Disney movie, the next she was staring, following only the very briefest of Google searches, at the sort of headlines that could (and did, in her case) give a girl a bad dose of diarrhoea. By the time Cob (Daniel Ings) had caught up with events – which was only about five minutes later, news travelling fast even in the countryside, where the couple live in an idyllic cottage with their adorable little son and some chickens – a team from <em>Esquire</em> magazine had arrived. They planned to shoot Suzie, plus two Irish wolfhounds, “at home”. For extra edginess, her fur coat would be splattered with red paint.</p>\n<p>\n\t“If you, too, suffer with anxiety, shame, compulsive lying, but like a laugh, please tune in,” invited Billie Piper, the ­series’ co-creator, recently. (Piper, of course, knows quite a lot both about celebrity and perhaps some of these other things, by now; like Suzie, also a former child star, she was famous at 15). I won’t tell you how many ticks I can put against this statement, but I will say that I do like this series a lot. I like its mess, and its filthy sense of humour (boy, it’s rude); I like the fact that it feels authentic even when it’s at its most manic (coke scenes, as I’ve written before, usually bore me, but episode two features a really rather enjoyable one, co-starring Dexter Fletcher as a lightly frayed sort of  actor called Ben Detroit). Above all, I like  the fact that it’s absolutely bulging with people who, though basically decent and likeable, are also behaving very stupidly and, sometimes, incredibly badly. Kids, I promise you, this is what adult human ­beings are like.</p>\n<p>\n\tLike Prebble’s play <em>Enron</em>, the action veers off, at moments, into slightly surreal song and dance routines. Like her Murdoch- inspired show <em>Succession</em>, it has an eye – almost admiring – for ruthlessness, and all the ways in which people try to disguise it. And like all of her work that I’ve seen, it’s incredibly knowing. “It’s not me,” announces Suzie of the scandalous pictures at a convention for fans of a Noughties sci-fi show she was once in. “I wish I was that thin.” They are, she tells her ­adoring audience, fake news. And then: “It’s very <em>Black Mirror</em>.” Right now, I’ve only one complaint, which is that for an actor, ­Suzie is awfully bad at hiding her feelings. Still, I can’t wait to see the rest. The first ­episode was called “shock”, and the second ­“denial”. After this, she will, apparently, cycle through all the other stages of grief.  “Guilt”, I sense, is going to be great, and “anger” even better.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>I Hate Suzie</strong><br />\n\tSky Atlantic </p>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n          Sky UK       \n\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-image-caption field-type-text field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\">Billie Piper stars in I Hate Suzie.</div></div></div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 15:53:24 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/08/2020_35_tv.jpg?itok=OGE_izQU","linkMd5":"480b7fa5f606279a1b8d485c1a8e1cf8","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn64@2020_4/2020/09/05/09-02-08-804_e6310ad1d91b4e47.webp","destWidth":790,"destHeight":350,"sourceBytes":52505,"destBytes":34208,"author":"Rachel Cooke","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/08/2020_35_tv.jpg?itok=OGE_izQU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn64@2020_4/2020/09/05/09-02-08-804_e6310ad1d91b4e47.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528308},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"What story do the polls tell?","link":"https://www.newstatesman.com/2020/09/what-story-do-polls-tell","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-field-subheadline field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"> <p>\n\t<em>Emily Tamkin writes</em>:</p>\n<p>\n\tIn almost every major poll, Joe Biden is leading Donald Trump in the polls.

Men, in particular, have changed their minds in favour of the incumbent: Trump now has a 19 point lead with men, compared to a two point lead in July. Biden has also lost some of his lead with voters under 50 in that state, from a 29 point advantage two months ago to a nine point lead now. And, at least in Pennsylvania, Trump's warning about the loss of the \"suburban lifestyle dream\" and crime coming to the suburbs (which aren't wholly <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/international/2020/09/us-election-2020-what-donald-trump-misunderstands-about-american-suburbia\">based</a> in reality, but no matter), are working: 39 percent of independent voters in the state are apparently <a href=\"https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_PA_090220/\">worried</a> about people moving into the suburbs who \"may bring in crime and lower property values.\" Pennsylvania is, of course, just one state. But it's important to remember that, for Americans, the reality is that the election is decided not by who wins more votes, but who wins more votes in a handful of states, which is probably why betting markets are now <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-elections-bets/trump-overtakes-biden-as-favorite-to-win-in-november-betfair-exchange-idUSKBN25T1L6\">putting</a> their money on Trump.</p>\n<p>\n\t </p>\n<p>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/international/2020/08/us-presidential-election-2020-donald-trump-or-joe-biden-leading-our-poll\">Follow the <em>New Statesman'</em>s poll tracker here</a>.</p>\n </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><noscript class=\"adaptive-image\" data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=\"300 768 1024\" data-adaptive-image-300-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot;

GDP failed to grow in the final quarter of 2019, average real wages had only just returned to their 2008 level and productivity growth was the weakest of any major country.</p>\n<p>\n\tYet these woes pale in comparison with the perils now ­confronting the economy. In the first half of this year, GDP fell by 22.1 per cent: the worst UK recession since records began in 1955 and the worst of any G7 country. The British economy is now no larger than it was in mid-2003.</p>\n<p>\n\tTo date, however, most people in the UK have been insulated from the pain of this fall in output. Faced with the pandemic, the government responded with admirable swiftness by increasing Universal Credit payments and introducing the Job Retention Scheme. By undertaking to pay 80 per cent of furloughed workers’ wages (up to a maximum of £2,500 a month), the Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, prevented a spike in unemployment of the kind seen in the US (where joblessness peaked at 14.7 per cent). The furlough scheme, which has supported 9.6 million jobs since its introduction in April, continues to sustain an estimated four million roles.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn 31 October, this economic life raft will be withdrawn. One consequence could be rapidly rising unemployment. Companies have already announced tens of thousands of redundancies: 9,000 at Rolls-Royce, 7,000 at Marks &amp; Spencer, 6,500 at Debenhams, 2,800 at Pret A Manger, 1,500 at WHSmith, and so on. The Office for Budget Responsibility has forecast that unemployment will peak at 11.9 per cent – more than three times its pre-crisis level and the highest rate since the miners’ strike in 1984.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn his summer statement on 8 July, Mr Sunak declared: “I will never accept unemployment as an unavoidable outcome.” He was right. The risk, however, is precisely that the Chancellor’s actions could trigger an avoidable jobs crisis.</p>\n<p>\n\tAcross Europe, countries including Germany, France and Italy have extended their versions of the furlough scheme until the end of this year or beyond. Not for the first time during the Covid-19 crisis, the UK is a troubling exception. Mr Sunak has announced measures such as a £1,000 Job Retention Bonus for each furloughed worker companies bring back. But a recent survey by Lloyds Bank found that only 18 per cent of businesses with furloughed workers expect to ­retain all their staff.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhy, then, is the government retreating? As an instinctive fiscal conservative the Chancellor is alarmed by the dramatic increase in the national debt to £2trn (or 100.5 per cent of GDP), as Stephen Bush writes on page 7. The furlough scheme alone has cost £35.4bn. But this has been money well spent: the UK can borrow at ultra-low or even negative rates (debt interest payments were £2bn lower in July 2020 than the previous year). In these circumstances it would be reckless to withdraw government support owing to arbitrary borrowing targets. A spike in joblessness would help thwart the recovery by reducing individuals’ spending power and ­damaging “animal spirits” or economic confidence. As research has long shown, unemployment permanently scars the young, with bleak consequences for our society.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor these reasons, Mr Sunak should learn from the errors of George Osborne, the so-called austerity chancellor, and maintain fiscal support until the economy has returned to health. Rather than simply ending the furlough scheme, he should replace it with a German-style programme to save jobs by subsidising part-time work.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the longer term, the crisis is an opportunity for the UK to transform its flawed economic model: reducing its overdependence on the financial sector, investing more in infrastructure, and creating good, well-paid jobs in green industries, childcare and social care. Debt should be gradually reduced by increasing economic productivity and raising taxes on wealth and static assets such as land ownership.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor now, however, the priority is for the state to fulfil its protective duty and prevent mass unemployment. </p>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n          jonathan McHugh      \n\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 11:00:14 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/2020_36_leader.jpg?itok=i4SsNuwM","linkMd5":"e9f3098e5513f7635d2ae529a5cf52a2","destWidth":790,"destHeight":350,"sourceBytes":65983,"destBytes":40854,"author":"New Statesman","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/2020_36_leader.jpg?itok=i4SsNuwM":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528294},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"Why repression in Zimbabwe worries South Africa","link":"https://www.newstatesman.com/world/africa/2020/09/why-repression-zimbabwe-worries-south-africa","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-field-subheadline field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"> <p>\n\tHow much South Africa uses its leverage over its neighbour could prove crucial to the stability of the region. </p>\n </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><noscript class=\"adaptive-image\" data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=\"300 768 1024\" data-adaptive-image-300-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;300&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1016548482.jpg?itok=cUwtiLsS&amp;amp;c=3c9ea201f180ed863ec43f41058add60&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa in 2018&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-768-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;768&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1016548482.jpg?itok=cUwtiLsS&amp;amp;c=3c9ea201f180ed863ec43f41058add60&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa in 2018&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-1024-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;1024&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1016548482.jpg?itok=cUwtiLsS&amp;amp;c=3c9ea201f180ed863ec43f41058add60&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa in 2018&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-max-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;max&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1016548482.jpg?itok=cUwtiLsS&amp;amp;c=3c9ea201f180ed863ec43f41058add60&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa in 2018&quot; /&gt;\"><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1016548482.jpg?itok=AhQ46W01\" alt=\"\" title=\"Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa in 2018\" /></noscript>\n</div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\" property=\"content:encoded\"> <p>\n\tSouth Africa’s government is continuing to try to calm the ongoing political crisis in Zimbabwe, as discontent rises over its neighbour's stagnant economy and runaway inflation. South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa will send more envoys to Zimbabwe to meet representatives of the governing Zanu-PF party and the opposition \"within days,\" he <a href=\"https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2020-09-01-sa-government-finally-starts-to-lean-on-mnangagwa/\">said</a> this week. A previous South African delegation was widely criticised for not meeting opponents of the Zimbabwean government.</p>\n<p>\n\tZimbabwe has suffered economic and political strife for years. A weak economy and harsh repression of dissent has pushed anything up to five million Zimbabweans (exact figures are difficult to come by due to the extent of unofficial immigration) into South Africa as economic migrants or refugees, making stability in the country a priority for Pretoria. Inflation in Zimbabwe is officially running at 800 per cent and there are <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/31/world/africa/zimbabwe-water-crisis.html\">frequent power cuts lasting up to 18 hours a day and an ongoing water shortage</a>.</p>\n<p>\n\t\"The unfolding political crisis in Zimbabwe constitutes a clear and present danger not just to the peace and people of Zimbabwe but to the region's peace and security,\" said Fadzayi Mahere, a spokesperson for the opposition Movement for Democratic Change. \"The need to broker dialogue and an urgent political settlement could not be more urgent.\"</p>\n<p>\n\tExpectations that President Emmerson Mnangagwa pushing out geriatric dictator Robert Mugabe in November 2017 would lead to reform have proven largely unfulfilled, said Steven Gruzd, head of the African governance and diplomacy programme at the South African Institute of International Affairs, a Johannesburg think tank. “There were early hopes that Mnangagwa could make Zimbabwe open for business, but that faith has largely dissipated.”</p>\n<p>\n\t<em><strong>[see also: <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/world/africa/2019/09/robert-mugabe-how-zimbabwe-s-liberator-became-its-oppressor\">Robert Mugabe: How Zimbabwe’s liberator became its oppressor</a>]</strong></em></p>\n<p>\n\t“When Mnangagwa came to power he was making the right noises [about reform], but now there is no confidence left,” Darren Bergman, South Africa’s shadow minister for international relations, told the <em>New Statesman:</em> “Any collapse on their side is felt in South Africa.”</p>\n<p>\n\tSouth Africa’s close relations with Zimbabwe includes ideological kinship between South Africa’s ruling African National Congress and Zanu-PF, dating back to when both parties were fighting to free their countries from white minority rule, meaning that the Rainbow Nation has significant political influence over its neighbour. In addition, South Africa has strong economic leverage over Zimbabwe, accounting for over a third of its imports and supplying much of its electricity.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em><strong>[see also: <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/world/africa/2018/01/do-south-africa-and-zimbabwe-s-new-leaders-represent-moment-hope\">Do South Africa and Zimbabwe’s new leaders represent a moment of hope?</a>]</strong></em></p>\n<p>\n\tThe porous border between the two countries has meant that Ramaphosa has come under increasing pressure to use his country’s influence to stem the flow of migrants from the north. “Uncontrolled migration from Zimbabwe to South Africa is not something the under-pressure South African government wants, or can afford to continue,\" said Knox Chitiyo, an associate fellow at Chatham House, a think tank.</p>\n<p>\n\t“South Africa really should step in a more forceful way. Our future depends on Zimbabwe’s future. We can’t afford to ignore what is going on there as we have for many years,” added Gruzd. But the Zimbabwean opposition is distrustful of mediation from the ANC due to its historical closeness to Zanu-PF: “Because of the ANC’s loyalties to Zanu-PF, [the South African delegation] is just putting a Band-Aid on a really big wound,” Bergman said.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Zimbabwean government cracked down hard on protests this summer against corruption and economic stagnation. The journalist Hopewell Chin’ono, whose reporting about corruption led to the firing of a minister accused of improperly awarding healthcare contracts worth millions of dollars, was freed this week (2 September) on bail after spending six weeks in prison. He is reportedly showing symptoms of Covid-19. Opposition MPs and the author Tsitsi Dangarembga, a Booker prize nominee, have also been arrested during the crackdown.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em><strong>[see also: <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/world/africa/2019/01/amid-protest-and-unrest-zimbabwe-s-president-emmerson-mnangagwa-resorts-old\">Amid protest and unrest, Zimbabwe’s president Emmerson Mnangagwa resorts to old tactics</a>]</strong></em></p>\n<p>\n\tBut repression is no substitute for reforms and tackling corruption. The slow-moving crisis in Zimbabwe shows no signs of abating. How far South Africa chooses to exercise its economic and political leverage over its neighbour could ultimately prove crucial to the region's stability.</p>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n          JEKESAI NJIKIZANA/AFP via Getty Images      \n\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Sep 2020 14:09:37 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1016548482.jpg?itok=AhQ46W01","linkMd5":"4b33b4b1cec97729a51961acf115a267","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn41@2020_6/2020/09/05/09-02-11-239_fcf15c9607bc2046.webp","destWidth":790,"destHeight":350,"sourceBytes":75914,"destBytes":48150,"author":"Ido Vock","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1016548482.jpg?itok=AhQ46W01":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn41@2020_6/2020/09/05/09-02-11-239_fcf15c9607bc2046.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528296},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"Katy Perry’s new album Smile: fun-loving but unoriginal pop ","link":"https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/music-theatre/2020/08/katy-perry-s-new-album-smile-fun-loving-unoriginal-pop","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-field-subheadline field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"> <p>\n\tPop has moved on from the bright-eyed days of 2008, while the Californian singer has not.</p>\n </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><noscript class=\"adaptive-image\" data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=\"300 768 1024\" data-adaptive-image-300-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;300&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/08/pr_kp_smile2020_argyle_area_look_013.jpeg?itok=WWk1affu&amp;amp;c=c5cfd23f0e9033ce2f024b8e8d61cded&quot; alt=&quot;Katy Perry&quot; title=&quot;Katy Perry&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-768-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;768&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/08/pr_kp_smile2020_argyle_area_look_013.jpeg?itok=WWk1affu&amp;amp;c=c5cfd23f0e9033ce2f024b8e8d61cded&quot; alt=&quot;Katy Perry&quot; title=&quot;Katy Perry&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-1024-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;1024&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/08/pr_kp_smile2020_argyle_area_look_013.jpeg?itok=WWk1affu&amp;amp;c=c5cfd23f0e9033ce2f024b8e8d61cded&quot; alt=&quot;Katy Perry&quot; title=&quot;Katy Perry&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-max-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;max&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/08/pr_kp_smile2020_argyle_area_look_013.jpeg?itok=WWk1affu&amp;amp;c=c5cfd23f0e9033ce2f024b8e8d61cded&quot; alt=&quot;Katy Perry&quot; title=&quot;Katy Perry&quot; /&gt;\"><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/08/pr_kp_smile2020_argyle_area_look_013.jpeg?itok=oxx5qx8-\" alt=\"Katy Perry\" title=\"Katy Perry\" /></noscript>\n</div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\" property=\"content:encoded\"> <p dir=\"ltr\">\n\tKaty Perry has never cared for subtlety. She wasn’t interested in it right from the beginning, when she arrived in mainstream pop with “I Kissed a Girl” and “Hot N Cold” in 2008 (following a failed 2005 country/gospel album released under the name Katy Hudson). On these singles, the American singer was brash and flirtatious, her breathy vocals setting hearts racing as she leaned into kitsch with a playful wink. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\tShe followed this through on her second record, <em>Teenage Dream</em>, where, in the video for lead single “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F57P9C4SAW4\">California Girls</a>”, she wore a glossy lilac wig and ejected squirty cream from a sequin bra. Perry’s music – dance-inflected pop, with her church-trained vocals helming catchy choruses produced by industry titans including Max Martin and Dr Luke – was fun and fearless. Her cutesy, goofy aesthetic was, she said in an interview with <em>Billboard </em>magazine in 2015, “<a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/articles/events/super-bowl-2015/6436763/katy-perry-super-bowl-pay-to-play-interview\">soft-serve sexiness</a>”. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\tAt that time, Perry dominated pop radio, her singles so repeatedly successful that in 2010 she became the first artist since Michael Jackson to score five number one US singles off one album. As the decade progressed and streaming services encouraged even the poppiest of artists to focus on whole albums, where every song could have the potential to make it onto one of Spotify’s coveted playlists, Perry’s dominance waned. <em>Witness</em>, her fourth major label album, released in 2017, topped the charts in the US and Canada, but reached only number six in the UK and then disappeared from the top 40 entirely within a month. It scored no number one singles.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<em>Witness</em> bombed because with it Perry tried to be political, and subsequently shot herself in the foot. On the 2017 Grammys red carpet, she described the album’s content as “purposeful pop”. She labelled herself an “advocate” and an “activist” having vocally supported Hillary Clinton in the 2016 US presidential election. But the record did not follow up on her promise. Perry was criticised for collaborating with hip-hop trio Migos who were <a href=\"https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2017/04/28/katy-perry-collaborates-with-homophobic-migos-weeks-after-receiving-lgbt-award/\">in hot water over homophobic comments</a>, and for reigniting an unnecessarily petty feud with Taylor Swift on “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGk5fR-t5AU\">Swish Swish</a>”. These are not the foundations for the next great progressive album. Pop had moved on from the bright-eyed days of 2008, while Perry had not.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\tPerry has long been used to some pushback: the performative bi-curiosity of “I Kissed a Girl” <a href=\"http://feministing.com/2008/07/18/i_kissed_a_girl_is_not_so_inno/\">stoked controversy at the time</a>, not to mention the even less subtle “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfykWFCQqTU\">Ur So Gay</a>”; and she <a href=\"https://www.mic.com/articles/95444/5-reasons-katy-perry-is-pop-music-s-worst-cultural-appropriator\">has been criticised for the cultural appropriation</a> which defined much of the aesthetic of her first three albums. But it is only now that she has used a record to dwell on the personal crisis brought on by a negative reception to her work.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\tOn <em>Smile</em>, released this Friday (28 August), she has abandoned earlier desires to make a record which is politically conscious. The album comprises many of the individual features that made Perry so loveable in the first instance – sing-along choruses, empowering anthems and a sense that wherever the fun-loving Perry is going, you’ll want to come along for the ride. But it’s too chaotic to ever be fully cathartic.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\tPerry’s spiritual rebirth, framing herself as a woman who has made peace with her past mistakes, is intrinsic to the lyrical content of the album – which is neat, as its release coincides with the actual birth of her first child with her partner, the British actor Orlando Bloom. She remains true to her up-front sensibility, but where she once did this with a twinkling rebellion in her eye, here, the topics she addresses are too weighty to really satisfy such bluntness. While squirty cream bras require a brash attitude, convincing introspection from a grown-up star benefits from a little more subtlety, even when it comes with a big pop sound. But subtlety, even here, is not the order of the day.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\tOpening track and lead single “Never Really Over” is a synth-pop belter about a will-they-won’t-they relationship. Perry’s voice is typically resplendent – like gossamer in the intimate moments and then suddenly awe-inspiring in the anthemic ones, and with a serious knack for making breathlessness sound powerful. At times her phrasing and intonation are reminiscent of <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/music-theatre/2020/07/folklore-taylor-swift-new-album-review-lyrics-cardigan\">Taylor Swift</a>, her melodies reaching skywards before a pulsating beat enters to mark the incoming chorus. But every so often a clumsy lyric trips the song up. “Cause I can’t even go on the internet / Without even checking your name”, Perry sings. She may skim over the clunky beat filler with vocal grace, but its very existence jars.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t“Champagne Problems”, too, could have been a B-side on Swift's <em>Reputation</em>, its sharp syllables punctuated with snappy percussion and a certain venom rarely heard from typically smiley Perry. The chorus of “Tucked”, an electric guitar-led song about a love lived inside your head, is reminiscent, harmonically and rhythmically, of the dubstep shuffle of Katy B’s “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NNQxN448Tk\">Lights On</a>”, while the opening lines of “Only Love” nod to “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsj15wPpjLY\">Seasons of Love</a>” from the musical <em>Rent</em>. Where Perry was once setting the pop agenda, she is now borrowing sonic titbits from others to pull herself back together.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\tIf a lack of musical originality wasn’t enough, <em>Smile</em> is too over-burdened with declarations of self-improvement to ever feel truly authentic. “Resilient” relies on an extended flower metaphor which sees Perry “growing through the cracks” and overcoming “weeds” and “concrete”. Perry is no stranger to such imagery – “Do you ever feel like a plastic bag / Drifting through the wind / Wanting to start again?” she asked, somewhat ridiculously, on 2010’s “Firework”. This goofy dramatisation of every emotion became part of Perry’s appeal. But on “Resilient”, her articulation of her personal growth is weak, her lyrics forgettable. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\tThe album closer, “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_JTAO-8xgc\">What Makes a Woman</a>”, starts as a country-inflected ballad, before the production steps up and Perry’s vocals are accompanied by a glimmer of glitchy electronics. Before long, it's tripping full pelt into a melancholic dance-floor number, and her voice becomes almost unrecognisable. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t“Is it the way we keep the whole world turning in a pair of heels? / Yeah, that’s what makes a woman,” she sings, before the music suddenly stops, and Perry is left to comfort herself: “There it is, Katheryn,” she says.

Those 12,000-word blogs he used to spew out into the ether with depressing regularity would be packed with learned references to history and political economy. In mid-summer he </span><a href=\"https://www.theweek.co.uk/107397/what-books-dominic-cummings-told-aides-to-read\">insisted</a> staff read two books before attending a “weekend boot camp”, which can’t possibly have been as fun as it sounds: <em>High Output Management</em> (1983) by Andrew Grove, the former chief executive of Intel, and <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/2020/02/better-explanations-translate-better-predictions-superforecasters-author-philip-tetlock\">Philip Tetlock’s <em>Superforecasting</em></a> (2015), which sounds a lot like someone read about “psychohistory” in Isaac Asimov’s <em>Foundation</em> series without realising that the whole thing was made up.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<em><strong>[see also: <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2020/08/dangerous-legacy-cummings-affair\">The dangerous legacy of the Cummings affair</a>]</strong></em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-eedd7c27-7fff-fa21-8ea0-371969474ca8\">But something Cummings appears not to have read is any news coverage of major government IT projects over the past 20 years, because he’s just proposed another one. From the </span><em><a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/digital-id-cards-lead-the-dominic-cummings-data-revolution-v750fn3kt\">Times</a></em>: </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<em><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-92fb9c57-7fff-4358-8a3e-22b6eca7aa8a\">“No 10 plans to create online ‘ID cards’ for British citizens as Dominic Cummings tries to revolutionise the use of data across government. </span></em><em><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-92fb9c57-7fff-4358-8a3e-22b6eca7aa8a\">Under proposals announced yesterday each person will be assigned a unique digital identity to help them with such tasks as registering with a new GP.”</span></em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-eedd7c27-7fff-fa21-8ea0-371969474ca8\">At the risk of saying something nice about Classic Dom, this might not be an entirely terrible idea. Digital ID cards could, in theory, make life easier for anyone trying to engage with the tax or welfare systems online, for landlords checking tenant references, even for bar staff checking that they aren’t about to sell three pints of Stella and a bottle of WKD to an unusually tall chap who was, nonetheless, born in 2005. Making it easier for people to prove who they are when interacting with the government or other services is probably A Good Thing.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-eedd7c27-7fff-fa21-8ea0-371969474ca8\">But the key words in that last paragraph are “in theory”. Let’s leave aside for now the privacy concerns inherent in big government databases, or the moral questions around whether forcing people to prove their immigration status might prevent vulnerable people from gaining access to the housing or healthcare they need (the problem there is less the entirely theoretical big scary database than </span><a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/2017/12/how-theresa-may-s-hostile-environment-created-underworld\">years of hostile government policies</a> towards migrants). Because the odds are this new database is never, ever going to happen.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-eedd7c27-7fff-fa21-8ea0-371969474ca8\">So familiar is the tale that </span><em>Computer World</em> put together a <a href=\"https://www.computerworld.com/article/3412308/the-uk-s-worst-public-sector-it-disasters.html#slide1\">slideshow</a> as a sort of greatest hits of government IT failure – a phenomenon it summarises as “ambitious project, outsourcing, bloat, disaster, crash, spend, spend, spend”. Particularly exciting examples of major IT project failures include:</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-eedd7c27-7fff-fa21-8ea0-371969474ca8\">1. </span><a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2019/01/z-universal-credit\">Universal Credit</a> which, apart from being a terrible welfare policy, has also been a terrible IT project. From 2010, the Department for Work and Pensions tasked Accenture, IBM, Hewlett Packard and BT with building a tech platform for the new policy. It didn’t work, was decommissioned and its functions brought back in-house, but only after costing <a href=\"https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Rolling-out-Universal-Credit-Summary.pdf\">£837m</a> in taxpayer money. And this, remember, on a policy that was supposed to cut costs.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-eedd7c27-7fff-fa21-8ea0-371969474ca8\">2. The modernisation of the Home Office’s Disclosure &amp; Barring Service. A 2018 </span><a href=\"https://www.computerworlduk.com/it-management/home-offices-dbs-modernisation-project-slammed-by-committee-3678053/\">report</a> from the public accounts committee described it as a “masterclass in incompetency”, which was running four years late and £229m over budget.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-eedd7c27-7fff-fa21-8ea0-371969474ca8\">3. The e-borders programme, when the UK Border Agency abandoned its supplier Raytheon after it had already paid it </span><a href=\"https://www.computerworld.com/article/3412308/the-uk-s-worst-public-sector-it-disasters.html#slide7\">£188m</a>, but before the company was awarded another <a href=\"https://www.cms-lawnow.com/ealerts/2014/08/raytheon-wins-arbitration-award-of-gbp224-million?cc_lang=en\">£224m</a> in compensation for the unlawful termination of its contract.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-eedd7c27-7fff-fa21-8ea0-371969474ca8\">4. My personal favourite: the Emergency Services Mobile Communications Programme, intended to create new radio infrastructure for said emergency services, but which as of May 2019 was running an eye-watering </span><a href=\"https://www.nao.org.uk/report/progress-delivering-the-emergency-services-network/\">£3.1bn</a> over budget.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-eedd7c27-7fff-fa21-8ea0-371969474ca8\">The list goes on, each story as depressingly predictable as the last. As a client, the government isn’t sure what it wants, keeps changing its mind, and is terrible at negotiating contracts. The inevitable results are delays, failure to deliver and, often, enormous compensation payments to contractors which, it turns out, are rather good at negotiating contracts.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-eedd7c27-7fff-fa21-8ea0-371969474ca8\">One other government IT failure is worth noting: the “Verify” system, which sounds suspiciously similar to what No 10 wants to create now. The programme, which was launched by the Government Digital Service in 2016, was </span><a href=\"https://www.nao.org.uk/report/investigation-into-verify/\">intended</a> to give people a single system to prove their identity. By this year it was meant to have 25 million users; as of February 2019 it had managed only 3.6 million, and I’m guessing that, if Dom Cummings wasn’t aware of it, you probably weren’t either. The fact this new system was announced without even mentioning that the old one existed is very, very striking.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-eedd7c27-7fff-fa21-8ea0-371969474ca8\">I would bet a not insignificant sum of money that what happens next will go roughly like this. The government will award a juicy contract to a tech company, which specifies the parameters of this project so vaguely as to make it unachievable, but which nonetheless locks ministers into paying tens, if not hundreds, of millions of pounds of public money regardless of delivery. A pilot scheme will be attempted, and fail; full rollout will be repeatedly delayed. And then, years from now, when Boris Johnson and Cummings are long gone and no one can remember what this thing was meant to do anyway, it will be quietly cancelled. Cummings’ latest big idea is nothing more than a promise to spend untold sums of public money on not doing the thing he says he wants to do.</span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-eedd7c27-7fff-fa21-8ea0-371969474ca8\">All of this has happened before; all of this will happen again. Matt Warman, the digital minister, told the </span><em>Times</em> that he is looking forward to “working with partners in the private sector”. I’ll bet he is.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em><strong>[see also: <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2020/07/here-s-problem-dominic-cummings-plan-shake-government-comms\">Here’s the problem with Dominic Cummings’ plan to shake-up government comms</a>]</strong></em></p>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n          Peter Summers/Getty Images.      \n\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-image-caption field-type-text field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\">Dominic Cummings arrives for a cabinet meeting at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office on 21 July 2020.</div></div></div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 04 Sep 2020 12:27:18 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1227714397.jpg?itok=l1D1_rSx","linkMd5":"c1c3913ca3e54c3b02fa530ec3033399","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn12@2020_1/2020/09/05/09-02-08-828_8a02e777f0623381.webp","destWidth":790,"destHeight":350,"sourceBytes":43416,"destBytes":22612,"author":"Jonn Elledge","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1227714397.jpg?itok=l1D1_rSx":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn12@2020_1/2020/09/05/09-02-08-828_8a02e777f0623381.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528279},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"The return of American fascism","link":"https://www.newstatesman.com/international/places/2020/09/return-american-fascism","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-field-subheadline field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"> <p>\n\tHow a legacy of violent nationalism haunts the republic in the age of Trump.</p>\n </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><noscript class=\"adaptive-image\" data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=\"300 768\" data-adaptive-image-300-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;300&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_866_450/public/Longreads_2020/09/2020_36_churchwell_opener.jpg?itok=UJbDkeWc&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-768-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;768&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_360_203/public/Longreads_2020/09/2020_36_churchwell_opener.jpg?itok=dhbkRylT&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-max-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;max&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_730/public/Longreads_2020/09/2020_36_churchwell_opener.jpg?itok=YHvu0aJc&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\"><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_730/public/Longreads_2020/09/2020_36_churchwell_opener.jpg?itok=YHvu0aJc\" alt=\"\" /></noscript>\n</div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\" property=\"content:encoded\"> <p>\n\tIn 1933 <em>Mussolini Speaks,</em> a “cine-biography of Il Duce,” received its Broadway premiere on 10 March, only five days after the Nazi Party seized control of the Reichstag, and six days after the inauguration of Franklin D Roosevelt as  US president. “Who is this modern ­Caesar?” asked a national advertising campaign for the film; “What is his secret  of success?” <em>Mussolini Speaks</em> promised  to sell fascism as just another version of the American Dream: “The past does not exist,” said Il Duce, and Americans were ready to listen.</p>\n<p>\n\tProduced in Hollywood, the film was made with Mussolini’s full cooperation and met with rave reviews. To be sure, it showed “only a glorified Mussolini”, ­admitted the <em>Boston Globe</em> in representative terms, but, “Mussolini rises above personality. He is a great figure, perhaps one of the greatest in the world today.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe US greeted Mussolini with widespread enthusiasm in the interwar years; as early as 1926, the nation’s favourite magazine, the<em> Saturday Evening Post</em>, was offering paeans to his “masterfulness” and the “impressive commercial renaissance” fascism had enabled. The cover of the issue offering this panegyric featured a Norman Rockwell painting of Benjamin Franklin signing the Declaration of Independence, but no one seems to have minded that the magazine swerved from celebrating ­democratic republicanism to applauding ­fascistic dictatorship with the turn of a page.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe role that patriotic symbolism, mass entertainment and a corporate state might play in an incipient American fascism was clear to astute observers at the time. In Sinclair Lewis’s novel, <em>It Can’t Happen Here </em>(1935), an American fascist dictatorship is brought about by the “Corporatist” party, led by the reactionary populist Buzz Windrip. Windrip takes power by forging alliances with media giants, including Father Prang, a character based on Father Charles Coughlin, whose weekly radio show was listened to by millions of Americans at its height in the mid-1930s. Coughlin was virulently, and conspiratorially, anti-Semitic, disseminating the (fraudulent) <em>Protocols of the Elders of Zion</em> and confirming Nazi accusations of a Jewish-Communist plot for world domination led by a cabal of “international bankers”. Windrip whips his crowds to a frenzy with patriotic music and populist jingles about clearing the “rot” in Washington, taking power thanks to the carnival he’s created. “Great ­showmanship,” the reporter who serves as Lewis’s resistant voice of liberal democracy observes of Windrip’s performance. “PT Barnum or Flo Ziegfeld never put on a better.”</p>\n<p>\n\tOr, he might have added, Leni ­Riefenstahl, whose tour de force of cinematic propaganda, <em>Triumph of the</em> <em>Will</em>, had been released earlier that same year. Decades before reality television, Riefenstahl invented a type of reality cinema for Hitler, admitting that the famed Nuremberg Rally itself was designed to work as a film spectacle: “The preparations for the party congress were made hand in hand with the preparations for the camera work.” Fascist reality was shaped by, and for, the entertainments of mass spectacle.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhatever one’s opinion of Donald Trump, there is no denying that his political success to date represents its own kind of triumph of the will, one built on a political carnivalesque. Trump’s manifest need for the adoration of his crowd, his desire to exhibit to the world the cheering hordes of his political rallies, may seem like an ersatz copy of the authentic rallies of fascist leaders of yore. The fact that show business is at the heart of Trump’s unstable political ­project sometimes leads to the argument that Trump isn’t fascist, but merely an ­entertainer. Fascism was always about entertainment, however: the deep root of its poison was that it made hatred entertaining.</p>\n<p>\n\tTrump may lack the discipline and ­grandeur to which the original fascist spectacles aspired, but he doesn’t lack the grandiosity. What makes Trump so clownish is the delusional gap between the claims he makes and the figure he presents. Without discipline, the attempts at impressive bombast collapse into bathetic farce. The first fascists emphasised individual heroism and physical perfection: Trump emphasises it, too, but only in regards to himself. He is his own fascist sublime.</p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\">\n\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"media-image attr__typeof__foaf:Image img__fid__113371 img__view_mode__media_large attr__format__media_large\" height=\"532\" src=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/2020_36_churchwell_closer_new.jpg?itok=cqThwjCY\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" width=\"800\" /><br />\n\t<em>The right bear arms: the West Ohio Minutemen at the Republican National Convention, Ohio, 2016. Credit:</em> <em>Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call/getty images</em></p>\n<p>\n\tAnyone doubting this needs only to consider the iconography he and his family routinely share, such as the photo of Trump’s face superimposed on to the sculpted body of Rocky Balboa, which Trump himself trumpeted on social media<strong>.</strong> As <a href=\"http://hyperallergic.com/573716/trumps-sinister-appropriation-of-the-nazi-triangle-camp-badge/\">historians have pointed out</a>, this is fascist imagery, in its glorification of the physical perfection of a mythologised leader. Meanwhile, on 4 July, Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr, shared a meme of his father’s head Photoshopped on to George Washington’s body, standing in front of the American flag and holding a Minigun and an eagle. Both memes rework images from the entertainment industry, whether it’s <em>Rocky</em> or an image made by the <em>Call of Duty</em> video-game franchise, into neo-fascist propaganda.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe absurdity of this bizarrely entertaining spectacle does not make it less dangerous, but more so. The clownish aspect of both Hitler and Mussolini were often noted at the time – not for nothing did Charlie Chaplin lampoon Hitler in <em>The Great Dictator</em> (1940). The Ku Klux Klan was clownish, too, with its pointy hats, its puerile rituals, its risible attempts at occultism. As a historian observed in 1931, the Klan’s “preposterous vocabulary” and “infantile love of hocus-pocus” offered a “chance to dress up the village bigot and let him be a Knight of the Invisible Empire”. That didn’t make the Klan any less murderous.</p>\n<p>\n\tPublic lynchings in the United States, at which thousands sometimes gathered in the early 20th century, functioned as a spectacular display of white power that terrorised the black population and exhilarated white audiences with a sense of their own racial superiority. But they were sold as amusement. Lynchings were often advertised ahead of time in the local press and on neighbourhood flyers, just as a funfair or circus might have been. Sometimes street vendors sold popcorn and other snacks.</p>\n<p>\n\tLynchings were the violent obverse of folk traditions such as minstrelsy that had long unified white crowds over the degradation of black people. Whether through ostensibly comic mockery or overtly sadistic violence, both were performed for the pleasure of a crowd enjoying its political dominance by dehumanising other people. The forms that lynching took included not only hangings, but public torture, dismemberment, castration and burning alive, sometimes for hours. Spectators took photographs that circulated openly in the mail as postcards, and collected body parts as souvenirs. It was all just another carnival.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat lynching was a barbaric form of mass entertainment was perfectly clear at the time. The influential journalist HL ­Mencken observed as early as 1917 that lynchings were a local “sport” that took “the place of the merry-go-round, the ­theatre, the symphony orchestra and other diversions” in larger communities.</p>\n<p>\n\tWithin a few years, movie theatres were advertising Westerns with a “special added attraction” of exciting footage showing the “Klu Klux Klan in Action” during a “midnight initiation”. In 1934 the <em>New Yorker </em>published a cartoon that showed a grandmotherly white woman holding up a small girl in a large crowd in front of a burning house while excitedly telling her neighbour: “This is her first lynching.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThen, as now, groups like the Klan were motivated not purely by racial hostility, but by a sense of economic grievance they had been encouraged to understand in terms of race. In a 1926 pamphlet called “The Klan’s Fight for Americanism”, the Klan’s imperial wizard argued that the organisation’s members were the “average citizen of the old stock” motivated by “economic distress” who found themselves “increasingly uncomfortable and finally deeply ­distressed” as “the assurance for the ­future of our children dwindled. We found our great cities and the control of much of our industry and commerce taken over by strangers, who stacked the cards of success and prosperity against us.” But the Klan was also itself a money-making venture, a pyramid scheme populated by grifters and hucksters, literally setting up stalls at state fairs so that racial violence and economic ­resentment could make a buck.</p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\">\n\t<span class=\"divider\">****</span></p>\n<p>\n\tWhether the nativist groups that incited racial violence during the interwar years in the US – with the aim of keeping the nation “one hundred per cent American”, in their words – are properly, or usefully, understood as “fascist” is a question that has exercised historians for decades. More than 100 such groups were identified in the early 1930s by the American Civil Liberties ­Union, most of which either imitated the European coloured shirt movements (so that by 1934 the US had the Silver Shirts, the White Shirts and Gentile League, the Khaki Shirts, the Gray Shirts, and many others) or formed militant Christian groups, such as “Defenders of the Christian Faith” or the “Christian Front”. Together they declared their hatred of “alien” elements and ideas, including not only other religions (primarily Judaism) and races, but also liberalism, socialism and communism, all of which they lumped together in the name of jingoist nationalism: such groups always ­declared themselves “pro-American”.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs such groups could originate in economic populism, evangelical Christian nationalism (which could be anti-Semitic, anti-Catholic, or both), or in historical white supremacy, some historians have concluded that they represent uniquely American disorders: aberrations created by the nation’s fraught history of the tension between its ideals of liberal democracy for (white male) citizens and the authoritarian systems under which it subjugated everyone else.</p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\">\n\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"media-image attr__typeof__foaf:Image img__fid__113370 img__view_mode__media_large attr__format__media_large\" height=\"618\" src=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/2020_36_churchwell_2_new.jpg?itok=hMHQAb8y\" style=\"text-align: center;\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" width=\"800\" /><br style=\"text-align: center;\" /><br />\n\t<em style=\"text-align: center;\">Raising the flag: a youth camp of the pro-Nazi US organisation the German American Bund, in Griggstown, New Jersey, in the 1930s. Credit: Bettmann</em></p>\n<p>\n\tThe argument that American nativist, xenophobic, conspiratorially anti-Semitic and white supremacist paramilitary groups were categorically different from their counterparts in Europe was much less likely to be made during the interwar years, however – not least because almost ­everyone could see the way they both leveraged ­existing bigotries on behalf of reactionary populism.</p>\n<p>\n\tHistorians of fascism have also demonstrated that all fascism is indigenous by definition. As Robert O Paxton explained in his seminal 1998 essay “The Five Stages of Fascism”, “authentic fascism is not for export” because all fascisms draw “their slogans and their symbols from the patriotic repertory of one particular community”. Paxton also noted that “religion, for example, would certainly play a much greater role in an authentic fascism in the United States than in the first European fascisms”.</p>\n<p>\n\tAmerican fascism will be ultra-American. It will reject the atheism and statism of European models; it will be self-righteous, certain of its own innocence, and understand itself as libertarian. Nativist agrarianism goes to the heart of these American populist mythologies, as it did to the rhetoric of both Mussolini and Hitler, promising to regenerate the nation – to make it great again. It elevates an authentic, preferably rural, national folk and defines them as “real Americans”, while denying first the loyalty, then the citizenship, then the humanity of everyone else. That authoritarian, nativist solutions to political problems did not find traction in the US in the 1930s does not prove that they never could; American exceptionalism did not immunise it against fascism, and it had its own organically ­fascistic movements that enjoyed popular support and sought entrenched power ­during the interwar years.</p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\">\n\t<span class=\"divider\">****</span></p>\n<p>\n\tThe authoritarian, charismatic leader is crucial to fascism. It requires spectacle, a performance of power. Fascist leaders are never women in patriarchal societies, because power is not troped as feminine. The rallies are the point. The military parades and theatrical displays of reactionary ideas of power are the point. The performative nostalgia is the point. The cults of martial tradition are the point – even (or perhaps ­especially) when they’re spurious.</p>\n<p>\n\tFascism is not a principled or ­ideological stand; it is the politics of grievance, an ­instrumentalist response to a ­political ­situation it perceives as unacceptable. ­Fascism is the counter-revolutionary politics of force, justified by ultra-nationalism, glorified by myths of ­regeneration and purification, performed by masculine cults of personality and sold as the will of the people.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is why contemporary observers in the US viewed the Klan as a fascist organisation; indeed, the comparison was widespread across the country in the early 1920s as Mussolini consolidated power in Italy. “Has it occurred to you that our American Fascisti are the gentlemen of the Ku Klux Klan?” the <em>Washington Times</em> asked its readers at the end of 1922. A decade later, a Jewish American columnist was writing of his travels in Hitler’s Germany:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n\t\tThe uniforms, the red emblems, the flaming torches – what did they recall to my mind? The Ku Klux Klan!… The appeal to the emotions, the Jew-baiting, the cry of Nordic supremacy and 100 per cent Germanism – what are these but  the tom-toms of the Klan beating out revised versions of old tunes? The  Klan hoods and nightshirts have become the brown shirts; the flaming cross has become the sign of the swastika; the torches and dramatic conclaves remain unchanged.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tThe second iteration of the Klan had emerged in 1915, propelled by the combined force of the anti-Semitic lynching that summer of Leo Frank, a Jewish factory superintendent accused (probably wrongfully) of the rape and murder of 13-year-old Mary Phagan, and the release of <em>The Birth of a Nation</em>, a film that glorified the rise of the Ku Klux Klan in the American South after the end of the Civil War. The first Klan spread rapidly from its origins in Tennessee in 1865, but never consolidated into organised political power, and was eradicated by federal forces in the early 1870s.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Klan was far from the only white supremacist group to emerge during Reconstruction, merely the most famous; there was also the more aristocratic Knights of the White Camellia, as well as violent paramilitary groups including the Red Shirts of Mississippi and the Carolinas, and the White League of Louisiana.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe White League helped overthrow a racially integrated government in Louisiana, as the disputed election of 1872 led to the Colfax massacre of 1873, when as many as 150 black Americans were murdered by a white militia, in what has been described as the worst incident of racial violence in the Reconstruction South. It was followed by the Battle of Liberty Place, when the White League fought police and state militia to unseat the Republican governor; almost 20 years later, veterans of that battle publicly lynched 11 Sicilian men in order to raise money to build a monument to their white supremacist coup. That monument was not removed until 2017, along with statues of General Robert E Lee and General GT Beauregard, both of whom also had military forts named in their honour.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn June 2020, as millions of Americans protested against systemic racial injustice following the murder of George Floyd – a killing described by many as a modern lynching – the proposal that some military bases be renamed after someone other than white supremacists prompted a tirade from Trump. He tweeted that they were “Monumental and very Powerful Bases”, “Magnificent and Fabled Military Installations” that “have become part of a Great American Heritage”, a “history of Winning, Victory, and Freedom” – in brazen denial of the fact that they had started a war over slavery and lost. Thus for “Winning, Victory, and Freedom”, we must read “losing, defeat, and slavery”, while remembering the importance of the big lie to the Nazi propaganda machine.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Klan became mythologised while many of its fellow paramilitary travellers were forgotten, thanks in large part to the so-called “Plantation School” of American literature, devoted to glorifying the Lost Cause of the noble South, especially Thomas Dixon’s enormously popular <em>The Clansman</em> (1905), the novel that inspired <em>The Birth of a Nation</em>. Dixon was drawing on the tradition established by Thomas Nelson Page, in whose fiction grateful, deferential black slaves loyally serve benevolent, ­paternalistic white masters on idyllic Southern plantations until the perfidious and ­corrupt Yankees start the “War of Northern Aggression” – as some Americans below the Mason-Dixon line call the Civil War to this day. This includes the statement of the great-grandson of the Louisiana governor who took power after the Colfax massacre, in which he objected to the removal of his ancestor’s memorial while insisting that the white supremacist confederate generals who had led a treasonous war against the US were “good people”.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs such contemporary examples demonstrate, these old depictions of chattel slavery in the American South went well beyond cultural mythology into dangerous propaganda that continues to undermine the American social contract. Page’s final novel, <em>The Red Riders</em>, published posthumously in 1924, glamorised the fictional paramilitary Red Riders, based on the Red Shirts, as “men who had achieved military honours and were impelled by the love of home, the pride of ancestry and the desire to save the civilisation they had inherited”.</p>\n<p>\n\tEven as the novel was published, political movements in Germany, Italy and Spain were forming around men who had achieved military honours and were motivated by love of home, pride of ancestry and desire to “save” their civilisation; they would end in genocide. Page was appointed by fellow Virginian Woodrow Wilson as his ambassador to Italy from 1913-19. His nephew, George Nelson Page, who renounced his American citizenship under Mussolini and headed the radio division of the Fascist Ministry of Popular Culture – its propaganda bureau – was described as “the most fascist of fascists” by an American journalist in Rome at the time.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn other words, it was not much of a step from the Red Shirts who dominated North Carolina politics between 1875 and 1900 to the Silver Shirts established in North Carolina by William Dudley Pelley in 1933. There was a reason why Sinclair Lewis decided that his fictional dictator Buzz Windrip would admire the writings of Pelley, who said he modelled his Silver Shirts on Hitler’s Brown Shirts.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn 1940 a writer named Ward Greene published a forgotten novel called <em>King Cobra </em>under the pseudonym Frank Dudley, which is also the name Greene gives to the reporter who narrates his story. Set in the 1920s, <em>King Cobra</em> tells of the rise and fall of a white supremacist group called the “Red Riders”, “a national secret society with more than a million members” that “made you wonder, ‘Can this be America?’”</p>\n<p>\n\tGreene appears to have borrowed the group’s name from Thomas Nelson Page, and its attributes from the second Klan. Although some in the novel fear the Red Riders are plotting to “overthrow ­democratic government and establish an empire of Anglo-Saxon white Protestant supremacy which they would rule like lords”, ­Dudley himself thinks “the simple itch for money was the motive of them all”. One of their leaders, a “messiah, a drunkard, a ­demagogue and a clown”, was driven only by “greed for money… There was so much money!” Like the Klan, the Red Riders charge for membership, and soon in-fighting breaks out among the leadership over the ­millions said to be flowing into their bank accounts. Their “Supreme Palace” is “like a ­Hollywood movie set”, “grotesque”, ­“gimcrack and ridiculous, as though it had been dropped there by mistake on the way to a world’s fair”. Before long middle ­Americans are reading about the Red ­Riders in the newspapers, with “details of ­floggings and brandings, of hooded horsemen and fiery serpents, of Dread Scorpions and Terrible Tarantulas, of an invisible power creeping by night into their neighbourhoods and their homes”, led by “those implacable ‘one hundred per cent Americans’”. Their motto is: “First for America and for ­Americans first.”</p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\">\n\t<span class=\"divider\">****</span></p>\n<p>\n\tThe menace behind such apparently clownish and gaudy facades is also the subject of Lewis’s <em>It Can’t Happen Here</em>. Buzz  Windrip is encouraged by his special adviser – known as the “brain  behind” – to keep up “all of the clownishness” that had so “endeared him to his simple-hearted constituents”. So Windrip attends beauty contests, tells shaggy dog stories in his speeches “with detailed accounts” of his down-to-earth experiences, and challenges the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court to “a duel with sling-shots”.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn 1936 Hollywood acquired the film rights to <em>It Can’t Happen Here</em>, already adapted into an enormously successful play. Newspapers belonging to William Randolph Hearst, which had ­periodically flown the slogan “America First” above their masthead since the First World War, denounced it as “PROPAGANDA – naked and unconcealed”, demanding: “Since when has Uncle Sam become the ­financial angel for the delirious ­propaganda of the American Civil Liberties Union and the American League Against War and Fascism?”</p>\n<p>\n\tUndeterred, the MGM studio announced a cast that included Lionel Barrymore and Basil Rathbone, but then suddenly pulled the project. Executives offered ­different excuses, but it was reported that the studio feared “international complications”. Nazi and Italian officials proclaimed their governments “pleased” that the production had been “banned”. “It is very friendly of America to halt such a film,” said a Nazi spokesman. An Italian official was likewise “glad the film industry has seen fit to halt the spread of such propaganda”.</p>\n<p>\n\tMost of the American press was outraged. “It Did Happen in Hollywood,” one angry column responded in 1936, arguing Americans should not worry about “offending fascist governments” given that “those governments have not been so tender-hearted over the feelings of democracies”. The German government’s meddling in Hollywood was often chronicled in the American press at the time: “Long Arm of Hitler Extends to Hollywood Studio,” read a 1937 <em>Newsweek</em> headline. Many planned films were altered or prevented by German officials, and Jewish characters began to disappear from Hollywood movies, as studio heads – several of whom were themselves Jewish – sought to safeguard European markets for their films.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs late as June 1939, MGM was giving Nazi newspaper editors a “good-will tour” of its Hollywood studio. That year a producer was reported to have “dusted off the script” of <em>It Can’t Happen Here</em>, rewriting it to “show a dictatorship in Washington and showing it being kicked out by disgruntled Americans as soon as they realised what had happened”. As the situation in Europe deteriorated, the market there “was shot anyway”, so the studios were said to have decided they had much less to lose. But then war came, and the film was never made. (There is a postscript to the story: in 1982, producer-director Kenneth Johnson wrote a television adaptation of <em>It Can’t Happen Here</em> called “Storm Warnings”. But NBC executives during the Reagan years weren’t “sure Americans would get fascism”, Johnson recalled, and suggested the US should be invaded by aliens instead – which is how a miniseries called <em>V</em> came to be made.)</p>\n<p>\n\tOne film that Hollywood did make which envisioned an incipient American fascism, largely forgotten today, was <em>Keeper of the Flame</em> (1943), the least well-known screen partnership of Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, in which a successful businessman turned popular demagogue leads a conspiratorial group planning a fascist coup. After his death, his widow reveals the plot to a journalist: “I saw the face of fascism in my own home: hatred, arrogance, cruelty. I saw what German women were facing. Of course, they didn’t call it fascism. They painted it red, white and blue, and called it Americanism. In here are the funds to see it through. Fantastic amounts subscribed by a few private individuals to whom money didn’t mean anything any more but who wanted political power. Knew they could never get it by democratic means.” <em>Keeper of the Flame</em> does not depict mob violence, but it does recognise the dangers of the incipient mob: “The crowds loved him. The crowds always loved him.” But as the conspiracy is revealed, the film ends with a montage of the people restored to decency through the heroic power of journalism.</p>\n<p>\n\tHollywood tended to prefer stories that exorcised the spirit of American fascism by showing Americans naturally recommitting to the principles of liberal democracy, such as Frank Capra’s <em>Meet John Doe</em> (1941), in which a businessman tycoon tries to harness a populist movement for his own purposes, but the people turn on him in the name of democracy: “I get mad not just for myself but for a guy named Washington, and Jefferson, and Lincoln,” declares an editor (the voices of American liberal democracy in these interwar stories warning against domestic fascism are almost always plucky journalists). Fascism is again defeated by a handful of decent Americans, leading to the valedictory line: “There you are,  Norton, the people! Try and lick that!”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe question, however, has always been whether the American crowd flirting with fascism was a spontaneous republic waiting to assert its nobility – or a lynch mob waiting to form. Less consoling engagements with this question drew darker conclusions. It is easy to forget that <em>Citizen Kane</em> (1941), regularly named the greatest film ever made, was Orson Welles’s vision of an American fascism that rose to power by controlling the media. Charles Foster Kane was modelled on William Randolph Hearst, who had used his “America First” newspapers to lobby against the US joining the Great War and then the League of Nations in 1918, before lending his support in 1940 to the “America First Committee”, the leading isolationist pressure group in the country at the time. Hearst had visited Hitler in 1934 and spoke approvingly of him in terms Welles echoes in his opening scene, as Kane declares there will be no war and then appears on a balcony with Hitler. An early draft of <em>Kane</em> made the character’s links with fascism more explicit, having his son grow up to become a Nazi.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe novelist Nathanael West imagined an American fascism in similar terms in his final two novels, a fascism powered by corporate interests and triggered by mobs who feel betrayed by the broken promises of the American dream. In his 1934 novel <em>A Cool Million</em>, West burlesques the American success story, especially the novels of Horatio Alger and Capra’s sentimental portraits of the common man. A hapless American Candide is destroyed by his gullible optimism, eventually murdered by a fascist demagogue (said to have been modelled on William Dudley Pelley) in order to transform him into a martyr for the “Leather Shirt” movement. The novel ends with fascist youth parading up Fifth Avenue in front of the dictator who has liberated the US from “sophistication, Marxism, and International Capitalism”, so that “America became again American”.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn <em>The Day of the Locust</em> (1939), West’s characters orbit around Hollywood while fantasising about violence and fame and power. A Hollywood set designer who aspires to be a great artist toils away at a painting he calls “The Burning of Los Angeles”, a modern-day bonfire of the vanities, in which “the people who come to California to die”, lured by false promises and real delusions, turn into a “crusading mob”, carrying baseball bats and torches. Hollywood is filled with “savage and bitter” people who “realise they’ve been tricked and burn with resentment. Every day of their lives they read the newspapers and went to the movies. Both fed them on lynchings, murder, sex crimes, explosions, wrecks, love nests, fires, miracles, revolutions, war… Nothing can ever be violent enough to make taut their slack minds and bodies. They have been cheated and betrayed. They have slaved and saved for nothing.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so they await the spectacular violence that will amuse them by avenging their grievances. West’s original title for his novel was <em>The Cheated</em>, a brief, terrible story of Americans whose resentment at broken promises burns as brightly as the torches they are lighting. “All those poor devils who can only be stirred by the promise of miracles and then only to violence” came together, “marching behind [a] banner in the great unified front”, an assemblage of crackpots and cranks determined “to purify the land. No longer bored, they sang and danced joyously in the red light of the flames.” Only one conclusion to the story of the modern US was possible: “There would be civil war.”</p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\">\n\t<span class=\"divider\">****</span></p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so we come to the summer of 2020, as escalating violence in American streets makes all too literal the metaphor of “battleground states”. Even as Trump and his attorney general sent unidentified “police” and heavily armoured federal troops into cities dominated by their ­political opponents, armed vigilantes have responded to the president’s reckless incitement of violence with murderous effect.</p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\">\n\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"media-image attr__typeof__foaf:Image img__fid__113373 img__view_mode__media_large attr__format__media_large\" height=\"1038\" src=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/2020_36_churchwell_opener.jpg?itok=wrnbl-yq\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" width=\"800\" /></p>\n<p>\n\tKyle Rittenhouse, a 17-year-old Trump supporter, travelled from Illinois to protests in Kenosha, Wisconsin, armed with a rifle, and is suspected to have shot three people, killing two. The conservative commentator Ann Coulter tweeted that he should be president. In Portland, Oregon, clashes between residents and Black Lives Matter protesters and “caravans” of armed Trump supporters – who drove into the city from rural areas waving Trump flags after promising “retribution” on social media – left another dead.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt was Trump’s adviser Kellyanne  Conway who made the administration’s strategy clear, amid ongoing violence in Portland. “The more chaos and anarchy and vandalism and violence, the better it is for the very clear choice on who’s best on public safety, law and order,” she told Fox News on 27 August. It is yet another lesson learned from interwar fascism: deliberately instigating disorder to manufacture the ersatz “need” for a strongman to performatively restore the order he has destroyed.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn the face of it, Conway’s statement makes no sense, but its implicit meaning is clear: the more chaos and violence, the better for Trump. His campaign as a “law and order” candidate – despite his brazen disregard of the law and his well-publicised love of chaos – represents a coded approval for mob violence, as his supporters make clear. The Fox host Tucker Carlson purported to be “shocked” that “17-year-olds with rifles decided they had to maintain order when no one else would”. It’s no coincidence that this was precisely the rationale offered for lynching, which its supporters often referred to as “extralegal justice”. But in the end extralegal is just another word for illegal. Trump offers no law, only orders – his orders.</p>\n<p>\n\tAll this happened against the backdrop of a Republican National Convention that was broadcast, for the first time in history, and in violation of federal laws, from the grounds of the White House – using the symbols of the American state to conflate the nation itself with Trump’s cult of personality. This, too, is straight out of the fascist playbook.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the 2020 presidential election the cult of the leader has also, for the first time in American history, been codified in the official ­platform of the Republican Party, which promises only to “continue to enthusiastically support the president’s America-first agenda” regardless of what that agenda might be. The Republicans’ current stated allegiance is not to the United States of America, but only to their own “modern Caesar”: in Trump they trust.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow Trump is closing what is a very vicious circle, and tightening it into a noose. Soon it won’t only be black Americans who can’t breathe, but by then the white Americans turning a blind eye and deaf ear to what is happening may have found that they, too, are in a chokehold, and there is no one with enough breath left to speak for them.</p>\n<p>\n\t<a href=\"https://play.acast.com/s/world-review/all-americanfascism\"><em>Sarah Churchwell recently joined the New Statesman's Jeremy Cliffe and Emily Tamkin, to talk about this piece on the World Review podcast.

In nearly every major speech since he became prime minister, he has used the term “levelling up” to describe his plan to rebalance the economy like never before.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe following January, a blog by his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, urged “weirdos and misfits with odd skills” to apply for jobs at No 10. Searching the term “Dominic Cummings maverick” throws up 663,000 results on Google; it's a reputation built on the unexpected success of the Vote Leave campaign he masterminded, the “dark arts” he deployed as special adviser at the Department for Education, his clashes with the lobby of parliamentary journalists, his warnings that a “hard rain is coming” for Whitehall, and a wardrobe of oversized tracksuits.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is a government that claims to be doing things differently: a government unafraid of dismissing the status quo and disregarding the structures, norms and interests of previous governments and Tory party administrations.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe fairly prosaic issue of remote working, however, shows how undeserved this reputation really is.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor nearly a week, ministers and Tory MPs have been begging workers to begin returning to their offices. This is seen as necessary to propping up the commuter, lunchtime and after-work economy, supported perhaps by a sense that being physically present at work is the proper way to go about it.</p>\n<p>\n\tA truly radical government would already have planned for the implications of an increasingly remote workforce. After all, modern working practices were shifting long before coronavirus came along. Between 2012 and 2016, flexi-time rose by 12.35 per cent, according to data released by the Office for National Statistics, and the Trades Union Congress found in 2016 that the number of people working remotely had increased by nearly a quarter of a million over the preceding decade.</p>\n<p>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/business-and-finance/2020/03/work-from-home-zoom-factory-amazon-divide\"><strong><em>See also: Courtney Fingar on why working from home is a privilege</em></strong></a></p>\n<p>\n\tNo serious programme to redress regional economic imbalances could ignore the opportunities presented by this trend. There are already <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-53582122\">hopes among the UK business community</a> that increased home-working will benefit local shops and cafés, and could lead to a revival of the suburban high street.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is a chance to “level up” that is being ignored by government ministers who are desperately trying to revive the old model: spending heavily on cars and trains fares five days a week, to travel to an arbitrary (and expensive) central location.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Boris Johnson has set out an agenda for levelling up every part of the UK – not just investing in our great towns and cities, as well as rural and coastal areas, but giving them far more control of how that investment is made,” reads the 2019 Conservative <a href=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5da42e2cae7ebd3f8bde353c/5dda924905da587992a064ba_Conservative%202019%20Manifesto.pdf\">manifesto</a>.</p>\n<p>\n\t“In the 21st century, we need to get away from the idea that ‘Whitehall knows best’ and that all growth must inevitably start in London.”</p>\n<p>\n\tBut at the moment, ministers are <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/08/31/civil-servants-tell-staff-no-point-coming-back-work-second-wave/\">literally attempting to “lead by example”</a> by reinstating civil servants in their departments, rather than fostering a potential boom for residential businesses and thoroughfares.</p>\n<p>\n\tWith the scale and swiftness of the introduction of the furlough scheme, and the unique nature of Eat Out to Help Out, this government has shown it can dream up successful and unconventional solutions to unavoidable economic shocks.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is strange, then, that it is so eager to leave that approach behind as a one-off moment of summer madness and return to an uncreative, backward-looking version of a country that no longer exists.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong><em><a href=\"https://play.acast.com/s/newstatesman/officepolitics\">See also: Anoosh and the New Statesman podcast team discussed this theme in more depth on Tuesday’s podcast:</a></em></strong></p>\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"188px\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://embed.acast.com/newstatesman/officepolitics\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden;\" title=\"Embed Player\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></p>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n          Getty      \n\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 14:19:46 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1208077113.jpg?itok=Oyqn98XV","linkMd5":"345868ff463d151828057f3cf2f58506","destWidth":790,"destHeight":350,"sourceBytes":68363,"destBytes":53572,"author":"Anoosh Chakelian","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1208077113.jpg?itok=Oyqn98XV":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528291},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"The Liberal Democrats don’t need to “listen” – they need to lead ","link":"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2020/08/liberal-democrats-don-t-need-listen-they-need-lead","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-field-subheadline field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"> <p>\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-8bd6cd08-7fff-ae5f-b210-dbaa20025b45\">The party should </span>collaborate <span id=\"docs-internal-guid-9b9d4752-7fff-8846-c75b-bca87ea05e0a\">with Keir Starmer’s Labour</span> to resist this disgraceful government as forcefully as possible. </p>\n </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><noscript class=\"adaptive-image\" data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=\"300 768 1024\" data-adaptive-image-300-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot;

They have held four leadership elections over the past five years, each a de facto referendum on the party’s future direction. This last one was triggered by Jo Swinson’s resignation more than eight months ago, leaving the party effectively voiceless during the gravest crisis to afflict this country since the Second World War.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-3017b3ea-7fff-7df6-15a3-14a1dad29684\">Davey ascribes December’s election result to the fact that “voters don’t believe we share their values” and “don’t believe we are on the side of people like them”, but that is plain wrong.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-3017b3ea-7fff-7df6-15a3-14a1dad29684\">In the European Parliament elections just six months earlier, the Lib Dems won 16 MEPs (up from just one) and nearly 20 per cent of the vote, beating both the Conservatives and Labour. A month before that they had gained 704 councillors and won 19 per cent of the vote in the local government elections. They were demonstrably and unequivocally in tune with at least half the population on the two greatest issues (Covid-19 apart) that Britain has faced this century – the Iraq War and Brexit. Their core values of tolerance, inclusion, openness, economic fairness, social justice, environmental protection and internationalism have never been more needed than in this present age of blinkered, divisive, jingoistic populism.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-3017b3ea-7fff-7df6-15a3-14a1dad29684\">The Lib Dems were reduced to a rump of 11 MPs last December not because they were out of touch with voters, had the wrong values or opposed Brexit. They suffered because, in the wake of their success in the European and local elections, they fell foul of their own hubris by agreeing to Johnson’s demand for a general election, presenting Swinson as the next prime minister, and promising to cancel Brexit without a second referendum.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-3017b3ea-7fff-7df6-15a3-14a1dad29684\">They suffered because Britain’s polarised politics deterred Tory moderates from voting Lib Dem lest they let Jeremy Corbyn into Downing Street, and disgruntled Labour voters from backing them through fear of enabling another extreme Tory government.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-3017b3ea-7fff-7df6-15a3-14a1dad29684\">Despite that, the Lib Dems still won 3.7 million votes, which was approximately 1.3 million more than they secured in either the 2017 general election or that of 2015. At a time when the country faces both a health and an economic emergency, it would be a grotesque waste of time, an act of almost criminal self-indulgence, for Davey to spend the next few weeks or months criss-crossing the country listening to voters telling him what to do.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-3017b3ea-7fff-7df6-15a3-14a1dad29684\">He should show leadership.

When the president lies, suggesting that the pandemic is under control even as the US death toll surges beyond 175,000, or when he espouses nonsense, speculating that injecting bleach could cure coronavirus, reporters cannot ignore him. And yet the act of reporting such statements, even if only to refute them, lends weight to them by creating a false equivalence, elevating meaningless ramblings to what might be described as an “alternative fact”. Trump makes “the job of a journalist impossible,” Gessen <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/international/places/2020/07/masha-gessen-why-revolutionary-moment-american-democracy\">told me recently</a>. “I mean, we manage. We try to squeeze into that crack between the two impossibilities. But if you do it long enough, it will destroy journalism completely.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAn optimist might observe that the challenge of reporting on Trump, and of writing about this summer’s nationwide civil rights protests, has prompted a necessary reassessment of journalistic norms. Black and minority ethnic reporters have been among the most vocal critics of the traditional journalistic ideal of “objectivity”. These journalists argue that true objectivity doesn’t exist and that so-called “objective” reporting often encodes a white, male worldview. They believe that reporters should be free to publicly express their support for the Black Lives Matter movement, and that their organisations should be willing to describe Trump’s statements as lies or as racist, rather than resorting to euphemism.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe counterargument is that the line between news and opinion is becoming blurred, or that using such emotive language to describe the president risks alienating readers. Yet many media organisations aim to challenge, as well as inform, and abandoning the pretence of objectivity doesn’t require giving up on fundamental journalistic values such as fairness, honesty and rigour. If anything, it underlines their importance and makes clear the urgency of moving beyond a lazy “he said, she said” approach to balance, the style of reporting more focused on canvassing diverse opinions than on establishing underlying facts. To quote a popular journalistic adage: if one person says it’s raining and another says it’s dry, the journalist’s job isn’t to quote them both, it’s to look out the window and check. Trump’s attacks on American democratic norms and institutions, and on Americans’ sense of reality, makes strong, investigative reporting more important than ever. They also make it even harder.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em><strong><a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/media/2020/07/fight-save-local-news\">[See also: Why this is a revolutionary moment for US democracy]</a></strong></em></p>\n<p>\n\tTrump’s frequent invectives against the media as “fake news” and the “enemy of the people” and his habit of insulting individual reporters, has contributed to a hostile and dangerous press environment. In 2018, a gunman killed five staff at the offices of the <em>Capital Gazette </em>newspaper in Maryland; later that year Cesar Sayoc, a fervent Trump supporter, posted pipe bombs to CNN’s New York headquarters, as well as to a number of prominent Democrats. Trump supporters have attacked reporters at his rallies, and the US Press Freedom Tracker, created by over two dozen press freedom groups, has documented over 600 incidents of journalists coming under rubber bullet fire, being tear-gassed, pepper-sprayed, assaulted, arrested or otherwise impeded by police while covering Black Lives Matter protests.</p>\n<p>\n\tMeanwhile, the pandemic has exacerbated the financial crisis facing local newspapers: since the spring more than 50 newsrooms have closed across the US. Since 2004, more than 1,800 American newspapers have closed, creating “news deserts”, communities no longer served by a local newspaper. Not only does this damage local democracy and accountability but it severs the connections between the journalists and the communities they report on, making it easier for Trump to recast reporters as “bad people”.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong><em><a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/media/2020/07/fight-save-local-news\">[See also: The fight to save local news]</a></em></strong></p>\n<p>\n\tThe<em> New York Times</em>, however, has thrived during Trump’s presidency: subscriptions have risen to a historic high of over six million, and the papers’ share price has more than quadrupled since 2016. (That the <em>Times </em>is frequently singled out by the left as an example of an outdated and harmful approach to journalistic “objectivity” has done little damage.) But while rising subscriptions are encouraging evidence that many Americans are willing to pay for high-quality news, it is also a sign of a shrinking news ecosystem: the <em>New York Time</em>s and its main rival, the <em>Washington Post</em>, now make up around half of all digital subscriptions in the US.</p>\n<p>\n\tTo stand the best chance of resisting Trump’s attempts to delegitimise the upcoming election, and to hold the president to account over his appalling coronavirus response, the media needs to be diverse, locally engaged and well-resourced. The <em>Times </em>may find that its long-term interests, and the survival of American liberal democratic traditions, depend on it finding a way for other news organisations to share its success.</p>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n          Doug Mills/The New York Times/Bloomberg via Getty Images      \n\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-image-caption field-type-text field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\">President Trump&#039;s invectives against the media have contributed to a hostile and dangerous press environment. </div></div></div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Sat, 05 Sep 2020 07:03:30 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-1215964493.jpg?itok=LMiIQ-fp","linkMd5":"e443603cb82f71a175b330a078a8cffa","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn72@2020_6/2020/09/05/09-02-08-795_8a41da0b16900758.webp","destWidth":790,"destHeight":350,"sourceBytes":61375,"destBytes":38996,"author":"Sophie McBain","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-1215964493.jpg?itok=LMiIQ-fp":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn72@2020_6/2020/09/05/09-02-08-795_8a41da0b16900758.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528277},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"The greats outdoors: Lord Leighton’s lesser-known landscapes","link":"https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/art-design/2020/09/greats-outdoors-lord-leighton-s-lesser-known-landscapes","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-field-subheadline field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"> <p>\n\tThe grandest of all Victorian artists was most himself painting silvers of nature. </p>\n </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><noscript class=\"adaptive-image\" data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=\"300 768 1024\" data-adaptive-image-300-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;300&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/09/2020_36_michael_art.jpg?itok=BoV_95w7&amp;amp;c=1721feba93f73288e76d1229b1f018d4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-768-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;768&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/09/2020_36_michael_art.jpg?itok=BoV_95w7&amp;amp;c=1721feba93f73288e76d1229b1f018d4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-1024-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;1024&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/09/2020_36_michael_art.jpg?itok=BoV_95w7&amp;amp;c=1721feba93f73288e76d1229b1f018d4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-max-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;max&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/09/2020_36_michael_art.jpg?itok=BoV_95w7&amp;amp;c=1721feba93f73288e76d1229b1f018d4&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\"><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/2020_36_michael_art.jpg?itok=NAUXgsH8\" alt=\"\" /></noscript>\n</div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\" property=\"content:encoded\"> <p>\n\tThe Victorian art world had its full share of knights – John Everett Millais, Edward Burne-Jones, Lawrence Alma-Tadema, and Edward Poynter, for example, all received peerages – but the grandest of its grandees, by some distance, was Frederic Leighton (1830-96). In 1896 Leighton, already a baronet, was created Baron Leighton. His elevation was, however, short-lived; he died the following day of angina pectoris, and since he was unmarried and without children, his hereditary title became immediately extinct – a record for the peerage.</p>\n<p>\n\tBy then he was the nation’s most respected artist and had been for decades. He had served the Royal Academy (RA) as president for 18 years; been commanding officer of the Artists Rifles; and was revered, hugely rich and the owner of a glamorous Moorish palace by Holland Park. An augury of this success came in 1855 when the unknown 25-year-old painter’s first exhibit at the RA, a huge painting showing Cimabue’s Madonna carried in procession through Florence, was bought by Queen Victoria.</p>\n<p>\n\tLeighton’s place atop the Victorian Parnassus had been won by paintings that were modern incarnations of the works of the fabled High Renaissance masters. Like them, he treated ennobling subjects in the grand style and produced mythologies, religious and historical scenes, and glamorous portraits as if he were Raphael or Titian reborn. His immaculate technique, which married fine draughtsmanship with harmonious colour, was learnt abroad – in Frankfurt, Florence and Paris – and was well suited to large compositions (he was also an important sculptor). He favoured emotive pictures of limpid women, moist-eyed with feeling, which reflected back to his audiences their own classical learning and morality with its admixture of beauty and sensibility. He was the perfect artist for the age – accomplished, Olympian, and slightly unknowable. His works have not all worn well and can sometimes seem bombastic and operatic, but there are passages of<br />\n\tbeauty in everything he painted.</p>\n<p>\n\tLeighton’s aim, as both painter and figurehead, was to raise the status of British art. As he told the students in the RA schools, great art comes from “a noble personality” and never from “a disordered or vulgar temperament”. To develop this nobility, he encouraged the tyro artists to “study with deep and revered admiration – and that admiration cannot be too deep or too reverent – the works of the great men who have gone before you”. This, however, did not mean becoming Victorians in togas and living off a purely Hellenistic diet, but studying the early Italian painters as well as the Spanish and German schools – wherever excellence was to be found.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe public Leighton was, if not a front, then not the whole man. Unusually, most of Leighton’s youth had been lived abroad; when his grandfather, who had been physician to the Tsar, died and left the family a hefty sum, they set off on an extended tour of Europe and Leighton himself did not return to England to live until 1860. He was by then continental in his outlook, while a love of travel remained with him for the rest of his life. Unencumbered by dependants (his personal life and sexuality remain mysterious), he would set off for the Mediterranean each year and spend August to October in Italy, Capri, Greece, Spain or Egypt.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe trips were partly for his health, partly to escape his usual way of painting, and partly to lift the burden of being Frederic Leighton and the worthiness and workload that involved. Over the course of these foreign sojourns he painted some 200 small oil landscape sketches that are quite different from his exhibited works. In them, not only could he emulate an unlikely hero, the resolutely unacademic Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, but revel in rapid brushstrokes and sinuous texture.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs in this picture, <em>The Isle of Chios</em>, circa 1867, now in Manchester Art Gallery, Leighton’s little landscapes lack the high finish of his public paintings and have a bravura freedom and spontaneity he denied himself elsewhere. It is the masses of the landscape and the quality of the light that are paramount. The foreground sea is thinly painted while the rocks are tactile with thick dabs; a swirl and a flick lays in the vegetation but the transition of the sky from dusty nougat pink to blue is handled with delicacy. It is as if he is reminding himself of what he could do.</p>\n<p>\n\tA few such pictures were repurposed in the backgrounds of his mythologies or served as “a reminiscence and suggestion”, but they were painted first and foremost for his own pleasure. As he wrote back to a friend, he spent his time abroad “sketching (landscape bits) from nature – it is the most irresponsible restful thing I can do and fills time delightfully”.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe great majority, like this view, also show his near spiritual devotion to the sun. Life and art were heliocentric, he believed: “Sunlight can never be accessory – its glory is paramount where it appears, everything except water is tributary to its song of splendour.” When working in oils outside he could luxuriate in sunlight while trying to render it in paint, almost as a substance itself. He became particularly alive too to the sun’s effect on colours: in a brief passage in a letter sent from Egypt in 1868 Leighton describes a spot by the Nile in terms of his palette – “fawn-coloured brown…  cool purple mystery of shadow… broad coffee-coloured sweep of the river… a fillet of green… golden light which inundates it”. This is landscape as a sensual experience.</p>\n<p>\n\tBack in England he would tuck this lusciousness and spontaneity away and become the dignitary once more. If his landscape sketches revealed his true painterly instincts then, Leighton hid them from sight. His personal sheen could, however, sometimes act as a shield itself, as Whistler, at the Royal Academy and surrounded by a group of women cooing over Leighton’s multiple attributes – “Such a wonderful musician! Such a charming host! Such an amazing linguist!” – felt forced to remind them: “H’m, paints too, don’t he?” </p>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n          Historic Images / Alamy      \n\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 09:39:28 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/2020_36_michael_art.jpg?itok=NAUXgsH8","linkMd5":"04308605417099da81ef3ef88cfde398","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn55@2020_6/2020/09/05/09-02-08-958_0bd9c03ebfbaef76.webp","destWidth":790,"destHeight":350,"sourceBytes":44879,"destBytes":22272,"author":"Michael Prodger","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/2020_36_michael_art.jpg?itok=NAUXgsH8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn55@2020_6/2020/09/05/09-02-08-958_0bd9c03ebfbaef76.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528299},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"Narrating 400 years of American history ","link":"https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/tv-radio/2020/09/narrating-400-years-american-history","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-field-subheadline field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"> <p>\n\tA new series of monologues, broadcast on Radio 4 to mark the Mayflower 2020 anniversary, understands the sheer scale of the country.</p>\n </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><noscript class=\"adaptive-image\" data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=\"300 768 1024\" data-adaptive-image-300-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;300&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1266838306.jpg?itok=w1jx59Yo&amp;amp;c=6fc72fcf24020ec96abc76ad27354c14&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-768-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;768&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1266838306.jpg?itok=w1jx59Yo&amp;amp;c=6fc72fcf24020ec96abc76ad27354c14&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-1024-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;1024&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1266838306.jpg?itok=w1jx59Yo&amp;amp;c=6fc72fcf24020ec96abc76ad27354c14&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-max-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;max&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1266838306.jpg?itok=w1jx59Yo&amp;amp;c=6fc72fcf24020ec96abc76ad27354c14&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\"><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1266838306.jpg?itok=nQOhAI-0\" alt=\"\" /></noscript>\n</div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\" property=\"content:encoded\"> <p>\n\tBefore the plague and the fall, if you sought a commission from BBC radio you wrote a short pitch, followed by an expansive and unlikely one detailing lists of potential contributors you might force to take part. At which point things would go cavernously silent. Then at the exact moment you realised how relieved you were that it had never happened an email would land saying: RECORD.</p>\n<p>\n\tDon’t knock it. Some of the best radio in the history of the universe has been made this way. It’s a <em>system</em>. Since March, so much has changed. Long-imagined essays and features completely re-pivoted to respond to the “new normal”. How much the subjects and sentences of this series of monologues (4 September, 9pm) written and delivered by Joe Queenan, about 400 years of America (broadcast to mark the Mayflower 2020 anniversary) must have been pruned and scrapped to embrace not just the physical limitations of lockdown recording, but the (growing, daily) realisation that the US probably hasn’t been this strained since 1861. How well Queenan does it.</p>\n<p>\n\tWith his cunning radio voice – sardonically Philadelphian, hard and then tender – he talks about, say, Vitus Bering suicidally crossing the Bering Strait, or the forced relocation of native Americans, with the requisite despair (“America is all about how much you can get away with”), but also with awe. The scale of things. Snakes, alligators, tribes on tribes, mercury so cold it congealed in a thermometer, 47 per cent of the Louisiana population enslaved in the days before the Civil War. The mountains, the genocide, the money, the delusions. Queenan says he prefers Longfellow to Whitman. You hear jags of that storytelling hurtle in his writing. (“Back then, America elected presidents who were interested in flora and fauna and minerals and astronomy and anthropology and everything…”)</p>\n<p>\n\tBut, crucially, there is in Queenan’s tone the air that our current “pessimism” about the US could be proven wrong. Because it’s a babyish overestimation (a fantasy, even) to suggest things “used to be better”. This is us, Queenan seems to be saying. Human beings. And we’re no stupider or less stupid than we always have been.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>From the Mayflower to the Moon</strong><br />\n\tBBC Radio 4</p>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n          Getty Images      \n\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 09:33:32 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1266838306.jpg?itok=nQOhAI-0","linkMd5":"e0394091a6ffe3f3459fdde7342b7a90","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn63@2020_3/2020/09/05/09-02-08-845_ae6d3096f5953777.webp","destWidth":790,"destHeight":350,"sourceBytes":44523,"destBytes":28258,"author":"Antonia Quirke","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1266838306.jpg?itok=nQOhAI-0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn63@2020_3/2020/09/05/09-02-08-845_ae6d3096f5953777.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528296},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"Lebanese wine is superb.

The city was fascinating, although it’s still my only experience of a hotel room with a view of a neighbouring building pocked with bullet holes. This sinister welcome was drowned out by hospitality almost overwhelming in its generosity.</p>\n<p>\n\tI’m used to morning tastings – but only in Lebanon have I had to gently discourage a winemaker from offering glasses of wine with breakfast. The arak, a grape spirit flavoured with fresh aniseed, was delicious, but I didn’t understand its purpose until it was served with what I took to be a capacious lunch of dips, salads and meatballs. When this turned out to be the starter, only that arak, a fine, stomach-relaxing digestif, enabled me to force down the bare minimum of grilled meats that manners required.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the wines were superb. Most English drinkers associate Lebanese wine with Château Musar – testament to the Hochar brothers’ sheer determination, trudging around the UK with a suitcase of samples, despite the 15-year Lebanese Civil War, which began in 1975. Their rich, spicy reds linger in our collective memory, along with the story of wine made under impossible conditions (in 15 years, they missed just one vintage).</p>\n<p>\n\tBut Lebanon has over 40 other wineries, some equally good. Ixsir, which was just starting out when I was there, blends the Spanish grape Tempranillo with the Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon that are a reminder of France’s long-standing influence in the region. Château Ksara, the country’s oldest winery, combines Grenache Gris and Carignan into a perfumed, apricot-coloured rosé called Gris de Gris. Domaine des Tourelles makes a Syrah so delicious that I’m salivating writing this. And while the two indigenous grapes, Obaideh and Merweh, are used mainly for arak, they also appear in some interesting oxidative white wines.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere has been winemaking in Lebanon since biblical times, and the Bekaa Valley, where the vineyards cluster, still has a magnificent second-century temple to Bacchus, Roman god of wine, its upright pillars more of a miracle than the water Jesus supposedly upgraded at Cana – which may also be located in Lebanon. And wine and politics, here more than elsewhere, are intertwined. I heard stories of Israeli planes strafing vineyards, and met a winemaker’s wife who ensured her baby was born in Canada, for the second passport. Over lunch in a beautiful restaurant overlooking a calm Mediterranean, Serge Hochar (who died in 2014) and his brother Ronald told me of their agreement, during the war, never to be in the country at the same time, so that the survivor could look after their families.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow Lebanon has endured a terrible explosion that has killed more than 170 people, injured thousands and destroyed Beirut’s port; and wine has a role to play once again. Good wine is a conversation in which the language is land and water, sunshine and grapes, and  hope, one way or another, is the subject. Wine is also Lebanon’s principal export – and to buy it now is to continue that conversation, celebrating the resilience of these winemakers, their strength of character and their kindness. It’s a way to drown out the noise of explosions and let generosity, that signature attribute of the Lebanese people and of their wines, have the last word.</p>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n          Maurizio MIlanesio / Alamy      \n\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 14:38:02 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/08/2020_35_drink.jpg?itok=_amrOmZ1","linkMd5":"c60d373bdb081bc3183bd700ad367bd7","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn71@2020_1/2020/09/05/09-02-10-099_e1d19e4f7769b490.webp","destWidth":790,"destHeight":350,"sourceBytes":101289,"destBytes":79436,"author":"Nina Caplan","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/08/2020_35_drink.jpg?itok=_amrOmZ1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn71@2020_1/2020/09/05/09-02-10-099_e1d19e4f7769b490.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528311},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"Rediscovering an unsentimental World War Two memoir","link":"https://www.newstatesman.com/john-bowen-undercover-jungle-world-war-two-memoir","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-field-subheadline field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"> <p>\n\tJohn Bowen’s remarkably restrained story relates a chance encounter some 45 years after the war ended.</p>\n </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><noscript class=\"adaptive-image\" data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=\"300 768\" data-adaptive-image-300-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;300&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_866_450/public/Longreads_2020/09/2020_36_boyd.jpg?itok=wtFzOBgu&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-768-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;768&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_360_203/public/Longreads_2020/09/2020_36_boyd.jpg?itok=mHh-AB2S&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-max-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;max&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_730/public/Longreads_2020/09/2020_36_boyd.jpg?itok=QCeEfgSD&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\"><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_730/public/Longreads_2020/09/2020_36_boyd.jpg?itok=QCeEfgSD\" alt=\"\" /></noscript>\n</div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\" property=\"content:encoded\"> <p style=\"clear: both;\">\n\tOne common feature, it seems to me, unites all the millions of men and women who experienced the Second World War. “Reticence” is perhaps the most succinct way of describing it, though “modesty” or “silence” might do just as well. My own family history is typical. One uncle, in the navy, was present at D-Day. Another uncle won the Distinguished Flying Cross for successfully outmanoeuvring three Japanese Zero fighters over half an hour in his unarmed Auster spotter plane. An aunt was a radio operator contacting clandestine Special Operation Executive (SOE) forces from a base in India. My father-in-law was captured, aged 20, at Tobruk in 1941 and spent the rest of the war in Italian and ­German POW camps. When liberated in 1945 he commandeered a bicycle and headed west through the ruins of the Third Reich towards the advancing Americans.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe common factor is that in my recollection none of these individuals – whom I knew very well – ever spoke about their extraordinary experiences. I only learned about their “war” decades after their deaths. Luckily my father-in-law was persuaded in his eighties to write down his story, otherwise we would know next to nothing of it. But so many participants remained silent about their wartime history. Maybe that explains their apparent absence of trauma, the seeming lack of enduring stress.  Perhaps the very fact of not talking about your ­astonishing experiences rendered them paradoxically mundane, or at least tolerable, and normal life could be more easily resumed. In any event, it is in stark contrast to our rush-to-confession age.</p>\n<p>\n\tJohn Bowen, the author of the following postwar reminiscence, did, however, eventually write up his experiences of fighting with insurgents behind the Japanese lines in Burma in a memoir published in 1978. But even though he tells his story – it was published as <em>Undercover in the Jungle</em> – the tone remains remarkably restrained. What he experienced was not only incredibly dangerous, arduous and unprecedented, but also appears almost surreal when one considers the brutal, sweaty, terrifying ­reality of his day-to-day life. There is absolutely no hint of vainglory or exceptionalism. If anything, the opposite applies: his prose is unsentimental and matter-of-fact. In ­memoir after memoir of the Second World War the same candid self effacement seems to apply. It’s the reader, in a way, who has to perform the thought-experiment and ­register the true, almost unbelievable ­nature of a life experience that would never be repeated again.</p>\n<p>\n\tJohn Bowen was born John Gebhard in 1915 in South Africa. He returned to live in England in 1924 after the divorce of his ­parents. On leaving boarding school, he began a career in journalism and worked in Paris as a sub-editor on the <em>Continental Daily Mail </em>for two years, before going to Cambridge, graduating in 1938.</p>\n<p>\n\tDespite being deaf in one ear (a result of the polio he contracted as a small boy) and with pretty poor eyesight, he still managed to pass his army medical examination and served in the Royal Warwickshire Regiment with the British Expeditionary Force in France before being evacuated from Cherbourg to Weymouth in 1940. He transferred to the 5/16th ­Punjab Regiment in 1942, and then joined “V” Force and Force 136, the SOE’s branch in the Far East. Working behind Japanese lines, SOE’s “V” Force, and later Force 136, were reconnaissance, intelligence-gathering and guerrilla organisations. Led by British officers, they employed local insurgents as guerrilla fighters harassing Japanese lines of supply.</p>\n<p>\n\tDuring his time in Burma, John Bowen was twice mentioned in dispatches and was granted the Military Cross. In the recommendation for the award, his commander wrote: “His example of outstanding leadership, following continuous operations since 1942, first in the Arakan then Imphal, and leading patrols ahead of our regular troops across the Chindwin and Irrawaddy rivers has been of the highest order. This officer has now completed three-and-a-half years of almost continuous active operations in the Field.” <em>Undercover in the Jungle</em> is the remarkable memoir of his time with “V” Force and Force 136. He also wrote three novels, one of them about a young officer in the Indian Army during the Second World War, which remain unpublished.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn 1941 he married Elaine Winbolt ­Lewis, who became a Wren officer. They had three sons, born after the war. He changed his ­surname from Gebhard to Bowen (his mother’s maiden name) in 1947, and ­qualified as a solicitor before eventually  becoming a legal civil servant. He was made OBE in 1966. He retired in 1977 and died in 2002.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis short memoir, only recently d­iscovered by his son, relates a chance re-encounter some 45 years after the war had ended with one of the “irregular” Burmese soldiers he had fought alongside, one Saw Thet Wa. Saw Thet Wa was a Karen from south-east Burma. The Karens were loyal to the British, the former colonial power, after the main Japanese invasion of Burma in January 1942, and suffered many savage reprisals from the Japanese as a result.</p>\n<div>\n<h3 class=\"rtecenter\">\n\t\tA voice from the past<br />\n\t\t<em>By John Bowen</em></h3>\n</div>\n<p>\n\tIt was after ten o’clock in the evening when the telephone went. In the Dorset village where I live it does not often ring so late. A foreign lady’s voice asked for “Major Gebhard”. This was a name which had been mine 40 years before. It had a very Teutonic ring to it and I had changed it when I came back from the war at a time when I believed that it would be held against me.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Do you remember someone called Saw Thet Wa?” The lady asked. “I am his sister.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThis triggered an explosion of memories. I have not always lived in Dorset, or in England for that matter. There had been a time in the Second World War when I had dropped by parachute on to a mysterious paddy field in a remote part of Burma called Karenni, where a resistance movement was operating behind Japanese lines. It was there that I met Saw Thet Wa. He had been a good-looking young Karen from the Irrawaddy Delta who had fled from Burma before the Japanese invasion in 1942. He had subsequently been trained as a wireless operator and dropped blind in the Karen hills to contact a British officer called Major Seagrim who had stayed behind during the retreat. Seagrim was one of the heroes of the resistance and was awarded the George Cross, posthumously. Eventually he surrendered to the Japanese in an attempt to dissuade them from taking reprisals against the Karens for sheltering him. Saw Thet Wa had been captured about the same time. They were both condemned to death. Seagrim had been executed but Saw Thet Wa had escaped into the mountains. Together we survived until the end of the war. I was repatriated to England almost immediately afterwards and I had never seen him again or known how to contact him. I had often wondered what had happened to him.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat night I found myself talking to him on the telephone after 45 years. It was an ­eerie experience. He told me he had been living in the US for the past 20 years. He was about to go back.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe arranged to meet outside the ticket office at Charing Cross station on what was his last day in England. The problem of identifying one another arose. Forty-five years was a long time. Strange suggestions were made as to how this should be done. Should I carry in my hand the faded red arm band with a black spider on it which we had worn in the resistance? Or the silk maps of Burma issued to the SOE parachutists? In the end we decided that it would be sufficient if I carried in my hand a copy of the book I had written about the operation some years before, by means of which Saw Thet Wa had been able to find me.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe met at the appointed place. I recognised him at once after he had tapped me on the shoulder. But I knew that I would never have done so if we had passed one another by chance on the street. He seemed smaller than I remembered, but he was still a trim figure. We were both wearing spectacles and I was walking with a slight limp. He had with him his sister and his wife, two attractive Karen ladies in Western dress. I had made no plans as to what we should do. It was 12 o’clock. On the spur of the moment I decided that we would all go to lunch at the Charing Cross Hotel. It proved a good choice. The dining room was quiet and we were able to eat our meal at leisure. The dish of the day was roast beef, but I felt fish might be more appropriate. I ordered sole for all of us. Saw Thet Wa and I drank a bottle of Chablis and the ladies had soft drinks.</p>\n<p>\n\tSuddenly it was as if the time warp had been reversed. It got about in the dining room among the waiters that we were old comrades from the war meeting improbably after 45 years. They made a great fuss of us.</p>\n<p>\n\tSaw Thet Wa had lived more dangerously than I had in the meantime. He told me his story. When Burma became independent he had been granted a commission in Aung San’s new army. Then Aung San had been assassinated and more sinister figures had succeeded him. Once again Saw Thet Wa had taken to the jungle in a new ­Karen resistance movement. He told me that the next few years had been the most rewarding in his life. He had helped to form a little rebel enclave in the country called ­Kawthoolei. He had married his wife, who was a doctor of medicine.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn due course there had been an amnesty and they had come in from the jungle hoping for a new start in a more liberal climate. He had been taken back into the Burmese army in a much more exalted rank. The Ne Win government had dispatched him to take over a rather ­famous missionary ­hospital, which had been founded and run by an American ­doctor called Seagrave. ­Seagrave had died but another American was running the hospital. Saw Thet Wa had orders to replace him. He began to have new ­misgivings about developments in Burma. The more liberal climate proved to be an illusion. Suddenly the Karens were once again in revolt.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen the American doctor handed over to Saw Thet Wa he told my friend that if the situation became too difficult he would sponsor him and his wife in the United States. In the end Saw Thet Wa decided to accept this offer, but the Burmese  authorities forbad him from leaving Burma. ­After much deliberation he and his wife fled across the Salween River border through the jungle into what is now Thailand. From there they made their way to Minnesota, where the American doctor was running a hospital. Saw Thet Wa’s wife requalified as a doctor in the United States. He ­himself went off to help the American forces in the Laos campaign. They had a daughter and a grandchild who were born American citizens.</p>\n<p>\n\tI told Saw Thet my own story. I had become a lawyer after the war and it was much more prosaic. I asked him how he had traced me. He had been shown a copy of my book by a mutual acquaintance living in England. There had been photographs in it of the two of us in a group of tribesmen. He had been puzzled by the fact that the man whom he had known as Gebhard had become Bowen. I explained the change of name. It emerged that he had changed his own in the United States to “Charles Kinson”, something more comprehensible to the American man on the street. We laughed about these ­complications. There is clearly more in a name then one realises.</p>\n<p>\n\tSaw Thet had been amused by my book. I told him that I had written it as soon as I was demobilised after the war, but that no publisher had been interested in it at that time. Everyone – myself included – was anxious to forget the war. Then after 30 years had passed, one of my sons, born in the meantime, had found the manuscript in a cupboaard and suggested I try again. That had been a few years back. It was accepted straight away and is now out of print.</p>\n<p>\n\tThree hours passed as if in no time, and then it was time to say goodbye. Both of us were visibly moved. We were unlikely to meet again. On my way to Waterloo Station I bought an evening paper. The war drums were sounding again. This time in Kuwait. </p>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n          COURTESY OF WILLIAM BOYD      \n\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-image-caption field-type-text field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\">Old comrades: John Bowen, third from left, with Saw Thet Wa beside him, wearing a beret</div></div></div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 16:31:04 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_730/public/Longreads_2020/09/2020_36_boyd.jpg?itok=QCeEfgSD","linkMd5":"1eeddd248cb80fe92314cbf2c8f9f148","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn80@2020_4/2020/09/05/09-02-09-952_2628a1bd37cc6e72.webp","destWidth":730,"destHeight":520,"sourceBytes":75388,"destBytes":42968,"author":"William Boyd","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_730/public/Longreads_2020/09/2020_36_boyd.jpg?itok=QCeEfgSD":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn80@2020_4/2020/09/05/09-02-09-952_2628a1bd37cc6e72.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528287},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"The long history of corruption in Spanish politics","link":"https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/books/2020/08/long-history-corruption-spanish-politics","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-field-subheadline field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"> <p>\n\tPaul Preston’s <em>A People Betrayed</em> explores decades of misrule in modern Spain.</p>\n </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><noscript class=\"adaptive-image\" data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=\"300 768\" data-adaptive-image-300-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;300&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_866_450/public/Longreads_2020/08/2020_35_franco.jpg?itok=BO9cWbxP&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-768-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;768&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_360_203/public/Longreads_2020/08/2020_35_franco.jpg?itok=tiLodxW6&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-max-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;max&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_730/public/Longreads_2020/08/2020_35_franco.jpg?itok=wJVBx_26&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\"><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_730/public/Longreads_2020/08/2020_35_franco.jpg?itok=wJVBx_26\" alt=\"\" /></noscript>\n</div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\" property=\"content:encoded\"> <p>\n\tVisiting Spain in 2015, when the country’s unemployment rate was still a quarter of the workforce and higher than the US experienced at the deepest point of the Great Depression, I wondered aloud what so many people were doing with themselves all day. “Er, that?” said my wife, pointing over my shoulder. Behind me, 30 or 40 men were making a sport of balancing stones from the beach on top of one another. The tallest effort could not have reached more than eight or nine inches before it collapsed, but this occupied them for perhaps half an hour before they went back to shaking empty beer cans to see if any dregs were left.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe locals did not blame greedy bankers for their predicament. They had no doubt that the culprits were their own corrupt politicians. And no wonder, because while British MPs were claiming on expenses for duck houses and X-rated movies, Spanish officials were creaming off fortunes worth tens of millions of euros from the country’s building boom. As Paul Preston shows in <em>A People Betrayed</em>, his 13th book on Spain, this has long been the way.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe historian writes of a nation “bedevilled by a level of corruption that involved virtually every institution in the country from the monarchy, via all the principal political parties, the banks and employers’ organisations, to the trade unions and local administrations”. Worse was the violence used to defend this system. At the outbreak of the Civil War in 1936, the fascist general Emilio Mola declared: “It is necessary to spread terror… eliminating without hesitation or scruple all those who do not think as we do.” It transpired there were at least 150,000 such thinkers. These unfortunates died so that General Francisco Franco – a man the Nazis rejected as an even bigger liability than Mussolini – could rule for four decades.</p>\n<p>\n\tFranco believed he could solve every economic problem by printing money, large sums of which found its way to his family and cronies. When that failed, he employed an alchemist to boost the country’s gold reserves and another conman proffering a magical formula for synthetic oil. It was probably a mercy that the dictator spent most of his time hunting and fishing and watching political prisoners build his personal mausoleum, occasionally muttering about Jews and freemasons in between reloading his shotgun.</p>\n<p>\n\tEven before the Civil War, the ruling class went to brutal lengths to protect its interests. The military ended one strike in Barcelona in 1917 with an artillery barrage. When miners went on strike in Asturias in the same year, a force of army regulars and Guardia Civil responded with a harrowing of the valleys that recalled the Norman conquest of England. But the framing is curious. What this account calls a “strike”, others (including some by the same author) call “the October Revolution”. In case there was doubt as to the miners’ intentions, they described themselves as “the Red Army”. They were 30,000 strong and armed with rifles and machine guns. Arsenals were looted, banks were robbed, towns were taken. Arthur Scargill’s lot were capitalist running dogs by comparison. Preston presents this, fairly enough, as what happens when democratic means of redress are unavailable. Unfortunately, there was no means of reprisal the authorities would deny themselves, including systematic rape of the strikers’ wives and daughters.</p>\n<p>\n\tAmnesties for the good of the peace are one thing, but it would stretch credulity if, say, Derry’s Bogside was content to be policed by the Parachute Regiment today. Yet the same institution that now keeps Spain’s streets safe was guilty of atrocities that dwarf Bloody Sunday. The Guardia Civil were shooting and torturing striking workers well into the 1970s. For much of the period covered here, they were glorified private bailiffs, set up to defend the mines and factories from organised labour. The author tuts that the Barcelona police didn’t even have a proper filing system until 1895, which is rather like ending a list of Adolf Hitler’s faults with the observation that he had poor handwriting (which he did).</p>\n<p>\n\tPreston can be a capricious tour guide. It is strange that we do not get a description (or photograph) of the bizarre <em>garrote vil </em>method of execution, which features many times, whereas we get a full list of the ingredients of gazpacho soup. It is possible that after you have written a dozen books on Spanish history, bizarre torture devices begin to seem commonplace, perhaps even more so than gazpacho soup. Nevertheless, a helpful guide anticipates your questions and does not leave you stranded as he whisks you to the next point of interest. We learn, for example, that the 1920s dictator Primo de Rivera liked to send brief, ill-advised “official notes” to the press in the early hours, much like Donald Trump’s tweets. Yet we have to wait what feels like a further 900 pages of a 600-page book before we see any examples (my favourite was the dictator’s complaint that journalists never mentioned his attractiveness to women). Even King Juan Carlos – he of the $100m backhanders and several thousand lovers, if recent revelations are to be believed – is rather quiet here.</p>\n<p>\n\tPrimo and Franco are the only characters given any depth amid a blizzard of names and acronyms. One gets little sense that the innumerable other ministers and civil servants had personalities, or that the information has been weighted in accordance with importance. It seems that when it comes to misrule, even Britain’s foremost historian of 20th-century Spain is overcome by the wealth of material.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Whether anyone can resolve endemic political incompetence remains to be seen,” Preston writes. For British Eurosceptics, a closer European Union meant moving towards less democratic accountability and more corruption. For the Spanish, despite the economic pain caused by membership of the euro, it still means travelling in the opposite direction.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt would seem there is a long way to go. It was embarrassing for Boris Johnson when a YouGov survey in June found that only 41 per cent of Britons thought his government was doing a good job of handling the coronavirus pandemic. Whereas when precisely 41 per cent of Spaniards said the same of their local government later that month, it was reported as a political triumph. Prior to the pandemic, Spanish unemployment already stood at “only” 14 per cent, and stone balancing had become such a popular pastime that some local authorities were reportedly considering a ban to protect coastal geology. With the full economic impact of the pandemic yet to be felt, they had better hurry up. </p>\n<p>\n\t<strong style=\"text-align: center;\">A People Betrayed: A History of <br />\n\tCorruption, Political Incompetence and Social Division in Modern Spain </strong><br />\n\t<span style=\"text-align: center;\">Paul Preston</span><br />\n\t<em style=\"text-align: center;\">William Collins, 768pp, £30</em></p>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n          Lebrecht Music &amp; Arts / Alamy      \n\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-image-caption field-type-text field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\">Francisco Franco</div></div></div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 16:28:37 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_730/public/Longreads_2020/08/2020_35_franco.jpg?itok=wJVBx_26","linkMd5":"d93ba9255548f4d454b03dae84c5b6bf","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn99@2020_3/2020/09/05/09-02-09-906_72dde41c7aa20b02.webp","destWidth":730,"destHeight":520,"sourceBytes":86657,"destBytes":53236,"author":"Nicholas Fearn","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_730/public/Longreads_2020/08/2020_35_franco.jpg?itok=wJVBx_26":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn99@2020_3/2020/09/05/09-02-09-906_72dde41c7aa20b02.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528307},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"The shiny new remake of All Creatures Great and Small","link":"https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/tv-radio/2020/09/shiny-new-remake-all-creatures-great-and-small","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-field-subheadline field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"> <p>\n\tThe Darrowby from Channel 5's remake is neat and non-Thirties looking: the Daylesford organics or Toast catalogue version of the countryside. </p>\n </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><noscript class=\"adaptive-image\" data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=\"300 768 1024\" data-adaptive-image-300-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;300&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/09/2020_36_tv.jpg?itok=Im5DErdC&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-768-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;768&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/09/2020_36_tv.jpg?itok=Im5DErdC&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-1024-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;1024&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/09/2020_36_tv.jpg?itok=Im5DErdC&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-max-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;max&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/09/2020_36_tv.jpg?itok=Im5DErdC&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\"><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/2020_36_tv.jpg?itok=-S4AtoNs\" alt=\"\" /></noscript>\n</div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\" property=\"content:encoded\"> <p>\n\tIt’s almost impossible to convey now just how beloved <em>All Creatures Great and Small </em>was in its day (based on James Herriot’s bestselling books about life as a Yorkshire vet, the series ran on the BBC from 1978 until 1990). People talk about <em>Doctor Who</em>, and the effect its title sequence had on their youthful hearts (thump, thump, thump), but memory tells me that the <em>All Creatures Great and Small </em>theme – a tinkling, then soaring affair in which a piano was made to sound vaguely like a beck after rain – had just as dramatic an effect in its way. If you didn’t have (ka-boom, ka-boom, ka-boom) major hots for Tristan Farnon (Peter Davison in a fair isle tank top), either you didn’t have a telly, or you were probably dead.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnyway, the big news is that Channel 5, currently the nation’s leading purveyor of televisual Xanax, has remade <em>All Creatures Great and Small</em> (1 September, 9pm) for the <em>Call the Midwife</em> generation. How to feel about this? Even before I started watching it, I was preparing for PTSD. Would there be canal boats? (Channel 5’s commissioning editors are obsessed with barges, caravans and Wallis Simpson; if they could commission a series called “Celebrity Royal Divorcees on Staycation” – well, they would). How floppy would Tristan Farnon’s hair be? Above all, could Mrs Pumphrey, owner of the pampered and endlessly windy Pekingese, Tricki Woo, possibly live to see another day? When I was nine, Tricki’s toxic emissions were pretty funny (OK, I mean hysterical). But now? I know we’re in the middle of a culture war, but surely we’re not going to fight for the right to tell fart jokes.</p>\n<p>\n\tPerhaps, though, we are. Mrs Pumphrey (she’s played by – yes, really – Diana Rigg) is indeed in <em>All Creatures</em> 2.0, where she remains an avid feeder of her obese pooch: Tricki <em>must</em> have his morsels. So far, he hasn’t released any noxious gases, not even when James (Nicholas Ralph) was (ugh) draining his glands, something for which “Uncle Herriot” was rewarded with a personal invite from Tricki to one of “mummy’s” parties. But I sense we’re only one piece of Turkish delight away from a serious nose-wrinkler. Meanwhile, I must also report that Tristan (Callum Woodhouse) is not sexy at all, his hair being completely immobile; that Mrs Hall (Anna Madeley), who keeps house for James and his boss, Siegfried Farnon, is no longer an old bat, but a pert young woman; and that Darrowby (now filmed in Grassington) is so neat and non-Thirties looking, you’d hardly be surprised to find Mrs Hall strolling the aisles of Daylesford organics in search of a geranium candle for James to deploy in Tricki emergencies.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd what of Siegfried? Last time around, he was played by Robert Hardy (sidebar: as a young reporter, I once had to find male actors who’d pose for our newspaper’s magazine naked, the better to make some kind of feminist point; Hardy, then 70, was the only one who agreed). What was exciting about him – it still is, if you look at old clips – was that you never knew when he was going to go off, like a firecracker (he and his brother have Wagnerian names for a reason). In the remake, Samuel West has the role. The series’ writer, Ben Vanstone, has made the character far less temperamental, and too obviously misty-eyed when it comes to his feckless little brother, Tristan. But Siegfried/West is still the best thing in the series, by a mile. When he smokes his pipe – that little clack against the teeth! – I rather adore him.</p>\n<p>\n\tStill, this is mushy stuff, even for one like me, who aches for Swaledale as for a lover. Siegfried and James (who’s too often soppy where he should be sardonic) have no chemistry, and the rackety-ness I remember is all gone, replaced by something very Toast catalogue. Even the animals seem styled; they use prosthetic cows’ backsides nowadays, so there’s nothing too squidgy on show either. Who’s it for, this show? Those for whom the words “Ow do, vitnry!” (translation: greetings, veterinary!) still have the power of a magic spell – or, perhaps, a sleeping tablet – will be disappointed. Everyone else, meanwhile, will be as baffled as the permanently flustered young Mr Herriot.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>All Creatures Great and Small </strong><br />\n\tChannel 5</p>\n </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-image-caption field-type-text field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\">Nicholas Ralph as James Herriot in All Creatures</div></div></div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 09:31:19 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/2020_36_tv.jpg?itok=-S4AtoNs","linkMd5":"d69cad830632de92eccb16f6ec1ca3fd","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn52@2020_4/2020/09/05/09-02-09-952_c988894c0bb1b67d.webp","destWidth":790,"destHeight":350,"sourceBytes":104757,"destBytes":81526,"author":"Rachel Cooke","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/2020_36_tv.jpg?itok=-S4AtoNs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn52@2020_4/2020/09/05/09-02-09-952_c988894c0bb1b67d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528296},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"Why thinking as a team is more important than ever","link":"https://www.newstatesman.com/2020/09/why-thinking-team-more-important-ever","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-field-subheadline field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"> <p>\n\tThe rationality of collective thought, not individual reasoning, is fundamental to addressing modern crises.</p>\n </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><noscript class=\"adaptive-image\" data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=\"300 768 1024\" data-adaptive-image-300-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;300&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-90300760.jpg?itok=-G6HKfm4&amp;amp;c=8cad8cfdeae238adc015bb87c7d5f1ed&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Ice figures in Berlin form part of an installation on the urgency of climate change.&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-768-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;768&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-90300760.jpg?itok=-G6HKfm4&amp;amp;c=8cad8cfdeae238adc015bb87c7d5f1ed&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Ice figures in Berlin form part of an installation on the urgency of climate change.&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-1024-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;1024&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-90300760.jpg?itok=-G6HKfm4&amp;amp;c=8cad8cfdeae238adc015bb87c7d5f1ed&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Ice figures in Berlin form part of an installation on the urgency of climate change.&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-max-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;max&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-90300760.jpg?itok=-G6HKfm4&amp;amp;c=8cad8cfdeae238adc015bb87c7d5f1ed&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Ice figures in Berlin form part of an installation on the urgency of climate change.&quot; /&gt;\"><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-90300760.jpg?itok=gMMNsqFV\" alt=\"\" title=\"Ice figures in Berlin form part of an installation on the urgency of climate change.\" /></noscript>\n</div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\" property=\"content:encoded\"> <p>\n\tEconomists, philosophers and other students of the human condition often find themselves puzzled by the general public’s readiness to cooperate. Why do so many of us wait in line, support community projects, vote in elections and generally do our bit as good citizens? What’s in it for us?</p>\n<p>\n\tFrom the self-centred perspective of economic rationality, this kind of public-spiritedness can seem irrational. After all, if the others are going to cooperate, then your contribution won’t be needed; and if the others aren’t going to cooperate, then your contribution won’t do any good.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn reality, people do cooperate much of the time – which is just as well, or we’d be in a nasty, brutish mess. But this doesn’t answer the theoretical puzzle. Why do we work together so readily, if economic analysis shows it’s irrational to do so? Are we too dumb to work out what’s in our best interests?</p>\n<p>\n\tThe theorists have not been slow to suggest answers. Perhaps we help others in the expectation that they’ll return our favours. Perhaps we are moved by altruistic impulses and so weigh the welfare of others alongside our own. Or perhaps we are guided by a sense of duty rather than any calculations about the consequences of our actions.</p>\n<p>\n\tThese are all serious suggestions, and no doubt play some part in accounting for human cooperation. But another, simpler answer has been largely ignored. Who said that rational decisions have to be made by individuals? Margaret Thatcher was wrong to say that there is “no such thing as society”; people often form themselves into groups, and these groups are perfectly capable of making decisions and acting on them.</p>\n<p>\n\tConsider what happens when a group of friends thinks about how to spend a night out, or the members of a sports team devise the best strategy for the next match. They don’t each start thinking about their own best options. Instead, they collectively ask: “What should we do?” and proceed to discuss what joint combination of actions will best achieve their aims.</p>\n<p>\n\tMoreover, once they have collectively arrived at an answer, they normally each play their part without complaint, even if it isn’t what they would have chosen on their own. In effect, such groups are acting as unified agents. When I make an individual choice, the various parts of my body carry out my plan. In the same way, when a collective group arrives at a decision, its members each then play their part.</p>\n<p>\n\tThree decades ago, the late Oxford economist Michael Bacharach suggested that this kind of “<a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691120058/beyond-individual-choice\">team reasoning</a>” holds the key to much cooperation. He started with basic examples from game theory. Take what he called “the footballer’s problem”. Harry Winks has the ball in midfield and can slide it to Harry Kane down either the left or right channel. Kane’s run and Winks’ pass must be simultaneous. Both know the defender on the left is significantly weaker. What should they do?</p>\n<p>\n\tGo left, of course. But, surprisingly, orthodox economic game theory fails to deliver this result. This is because game theory starts with the choices of each agent, and the best choice for each agent depends on what the other might do. Both right and left are good choices if you happen think the other player will do likewise. So, orthodoxy runs into sand and fails to select left as the uniquely rational option. (Technically, in this game left and right are both “Nash equilibria”, stable states named after the mathematician John Nash.)</p>\n<p>\n\tHowever, suppose now the two players are thinking as a team. This then gives them four joint options. Pass right, run left; pass left, run right; pass right, run right; pass left, run left. What should we do? It’s a no-brainer. Given the weaker defender is on the left, the last option is clearly best.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt’s a simple enough idea. There’s nothing wrong with the game theorists’ technical analysis. They go wrong only in supposing that agents have to be single individuals. Once we recognise that groups can be agents too, our original puzzles about cooperation simply dissolve.</p>\n<p>\n\tChoices that seemed puzzling for individuals become obvious for groups. What’s the best way for us to choose a government? Let’s all cast a vote and see who wins. What’s the best way for us to raise money for the school? Let’s each provide a stall at a fair. What’s the best way for us to board the bus? Let’s form a queue as we arrive at the stop.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe notion that groups can be agents is simple enough, but <a href=\"https://era.ed.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1842/1979/17-Peter-Chap12.pdf?sequence=3&amp;isAllowed=y\">few economists</a> have taken up Bacharach’s idea. Many view his solution as a cheat. Teams are made of individuals, they argue, and so joint decisions must be compounds of individual decisions. But the conclusion doesn’t follow.</p>\n<p>\n\tGroups are made of individuals, but this doesn’t mean that group choices must be made of individual choices. You are made of cells, but your choices aren’t made of your cells’ choices. In fact, we are all perfectly familiar with group decisions, and no metaphysical argument from the priority of parts to wholes can show that my friends, or my cricket team, or my country, are incapable of asking “What shall we do?”– and then all doing their bit once they’ve answered the question.</p>\n<p>\n\tOther sceptics invoke Darwin to discredit the possibility of team reasoning. Isn’t it part of our evolved nature to choose actions that put the individual ahead of the group? But we’ve been here before. The evolution of altruistic desires that favour kin and other conspecifics is <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/altruism-biological/\">now well understood</a> by biologists. There’s no reason why the selective processes that explain altruistic desires should not also have given rise to forms of decision-making that prioritise whole groups and not just their individual members.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn recognising the rationality of team reasoning, we don’t need to dismiss individual reasoning altogether. Sometimes it is appropriate to incorporate ourselves into group agents, and sometimes it is right to strike out as individuals.</p>\n<p>\n\tA good sports team needs its members all to play their role in its optimal strategy, even if that means most will forgo the starring role. But it doesn’t follow that you shouldn’t look out for yourself when, say, you’re competing for a job. It is a substantial challenge for moral theory to work out which form of reasoning should come to the fore in which circumstances.</p>\n<p>\n\tCan we really let go of the idea that individual self-interest is fundamental? Surely, in the end it comes down to what’s good for each of us. Think about how I argued earlier that we would all suffer a nasty brutish life if we weren’t able to cooperate. Isn’t that an argument that team reasoning will serve everybody’s individual self-interest?</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is certainly true that we all individually benefit from certain kinds of team thinking. But that scarcely shows that individual rationality is fundamental. After all, just as we can have individual reason to foster team thinking, so too can we sometimes have collective reason to foster individual thinking.</p>\n<p>\n\tThink of Adam Smith’s argument that we all benefit from the “invisible hand” that flows from the individual pursuit of profit. It is not too fanciful, I think, to view Smith as asking the team question “How should we organise the economy?” and answering that our best option is to allow economic agents to pursue their individual goals.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe relative roles of individual and team reasoning raise a number of deep and interesting questions about human action. Still, whatever the precise answers, there seems little doubt that team reasoning plays a positive role in many aspects of our lives. It allows groups to operate as units and achieve results that individual reasoning cannot reach.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe will do well not to take this power for granted. Team reasoning rests on the knowledge that everybody will play their part once a strategy is agreed on. This kind of trust can be fragile. We need only think of the way successful sports teams can unravel once they lose confidence in each other.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe modern world places particular pressures on team reasoning. Traditional affiliations are being weakened by migration and globalisation, at the very moment that crises such as climate change and the Covid-19 pandemic call for collective solutions.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn response, we should nurture existing forms of trust and find ways to forge new ones. We all need to believe in the power of groups to act together in the pursuit of collective interests.

The racist cartoon accompanied a fictional story in which Obono finds herself sold into slavery by Africans in 18<sup>th</sup>-century Chad. An investigation has been launched by the justice system.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe magazine’s story and accompanying cartoon is doubly racist. First, it is hardly a coincidence that Obono, who was born in Gabon, was chosen as the protagonist of the fictional narrative: she is one of only around 25 black members of parliament. The MP has become a hate figure for the far-right because of her perceived proximity to groups such as the Indigenous People of the Republic Party, which advocates decolonial politics – a taboo in French public discourse.</p>\n<p>\n\tSecond, the story fits into a long pattern of white people, from the Old World and New alike, deliberately playing up the role of Africans in the slave trade in order to exculpate Europeans from guilt. The <em>Valeurs Actuelles</em> story was taglined: “In which the deputy from the France Unbowed party experiences for herself the responsibilities of Africans in the horrors of the slave trade.”</p>\n<p>\n\t“When right-wing writers attempt to divert this discussion to the so-called “African” responsibility for the slave trade they are simply avoiding their own responsibility in perpetuating very old stereotypes of African populations and keeping racism and white supremacy alive,” Ana Lucia Araujo, a historian of slavery, told the <em>New Statesman</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\tAfrican traders played a crucial and long-misunderstood role in the slave trade, capturing and handing over slaves to white Europeans. The 1977 TV show <em>Roots</em> showed many Americans for the first time how African slavers contributed to the slave trade, selling the protagonist, Kunta Kinte, to the British. Mathieu Kérékou, a former president of Benin, which as the Kingdom of Dahomey sold hundreds of thousands of Africans into slavery, apologised in 1999 to African-Americans for his country’s role in the “abominable” slave trade.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the <em>Valeurs Actuelles</em> story, written by a pseudonymous author, was not intended to educate but to harass. It is a bizarre work of political fanfiction, using the past as a fig leaf to comment on the present. The subtext to the story is that Obono’s anti-racist activism misstates the real dynamics of the slave trade, suggesting that her views on contemporary politics are wrong as a result. In a pseudo-apology <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Valeurs/status/1299689598751301632/photo/1\">published</a> by the magazine, its editorial team stated that the goal of the story was to fight the “falsification of history” perpetuated by “decolonial activists and dismantlers of history”. The magazine explained that they had chosen Obono because of her supposed adherence to such erroneous theories.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe symbolism of drawing a black member of parliament as a slave – a trade in which France played a crucial role for hundreds of years – is unmistakable. It is an extreme example of the widespread racism in the French press, which frequently targets French people of Arab and black African descent. <em>Valeurs Actuelles</em> has in the past appeared with covers terming a Muslim minister “the ayatollah” or disparaging “anti-white racists” above a photo of Lilian Thuram, a black football player who criticised white supremacy in French society.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Valeurs Actuelles</em> (to which president Emmanuel Macron gave a controversial interview last year, calling the magazine “very good”) is the most extreme publication on newsstands, but even more respectable newspapers have published such inflammatory articles, such as an infamous 1991 <em>Le Figaro </em>cover featuring a likeness of the national symbol, Marianne, in a veil, asking: “Immigration or invasion?” Other magazines such as <em>L'Express</em> fret about “the West versus Islam”.</p>\n<p>\n\t“In France, women in politics are often attacked for doing their jobs – and this is even more the case for female politicians of colour. Just because we are talking about this publication now, does not mean that racism isn't happening away from the spotlight,” Gwendoline Delbos-Corfield, a French MEP for the Green Party, told the <em>New Statesman</em>. “President Macron’s granting an interview to this magazine gave it more credibility, and seemed to normalise their extreme ideas.”</p>\n<p>\n\tCondemnation of the cartoon spanned the entire political spectrum, from Obono’s own France Unbowed party to Marine Le Pen’s National Rally. Whether this incident will lead to a long-overdue reckoning about how far the all-encompassing pretext of <em>laïcité</em> can be used as a thinly veiled cover for the basest instincts remains to be seen.</p>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n          KENZO TRIBOUILLARD/AFP via Getty Images      \n\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-image-caption field-type-text field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\">Danièle Obono speaks at an International Women&#039;s Day meeting</div></div></div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Sep 2020 13:41:41 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1129092908.jpg?itok=sXzSzjJs","linkMd5":"e13c76d2a913d307672d6c917d2e6716","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn76@2020_6/2020/09/05/09-02-09-883_1a2283f43a2e5bb4.webp","destWidth":790,"destHeight":350,"sourceBytes":28189,"destBytes":15068,"author":"Ido Vock","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1129092908.jpg?itok=sXzSzjJs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn76@2020_6/2020/09/05/09-02-09-883_1a2283f43a2e5bb4.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528283},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"Rishi Sunak’s popularity gives him real power.

There is one partial exception: the Treasury, which has not one but three different systems. The finance ministry shares its offices with the Cabinet Office, whose one-way system runs in the opposite direction to that of the Treasury; and HM Revenue and Customs, which doesn’t appear to have a system at all. (One Cabinet Office official has dubbed HMRC “the badlands” as a result.) </p>\n<p>\n\tThat Rishi Sunak’s writ doesn’t run even to the ends of his department’s offices could serve as an easy metaphor for the limits of his power: it’s hard to imagine that George Osborne or Gordon Brown would have allowed the Treasury’s housemates to go their own way. But the analogy is misleading: the real measure of Sunak’s strength can be found wherever his face adorns a poster for Eat Out to Help Out, the government voucher scheme designed to encourage people back into restaurants and cafés.</p>\n<p>\n\tHis omnipresence attests to two things. The first is his structural and internal power compared to that of his boss. Shortly before Sunak unveiled the voucher scheme, Boris Johnson gave a speech in which he talked of the need for “Rooseveltian” ambition in public spending. The speech, which has since been forgotten, contained little new policy and even less in the way of money, and Sunak was able to make the announcement that defined the summer.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Chancellor’s ubiquity on promotional posters attests to the other source of his authority: his astonishing popularity. Sunak is, for the moment, the only politician whose face could appear on a billboard without repelling one of either Remainers or Leavers, Conservatives or Labour supporters. Sunak’s standing with voters – he is more popular than Johnson and Keir Starmer – is surely responsible for what remains of the government’s opinion poll lead, when it still has one.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe institutional might of the Treasury, coupled with Sunak’s popularity, makes him both a considerable force inside the government and a source of consolation for worried Conservative MPs (an increasingly large group). Many fear that Downing Street has no philosophical or ideological moorings, and no setting other than perpetual campaign mode, leaving the Conservatives vulnerable to a Labour Party majoring on competence and cool-headedness. “Culture war is an effective tool for the right if the left plays,” one MP despairs, “but when the Labour Party doesn’t – and under Keir Starmer they’ve got too much sense – we just look like frothing idiots.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile the public’s approval of Sunak gives solace to Conservatives, it continues to demoralise Labour MPs. Some fear that while Starmer has done a masterful job of prosecuting the case against Johnson, he has yet to do the same to the Conservative Party as a whole. Most Labour MPs assume that Tory MPs, just as they deposed Theresa May to boost their electoral chances against Jeremy Corbyn in 2019, will in turn ditch Johnson and pick the candidate best-placed to defeat Starmer. At the moment that’s Sunak, not least because he and Starmer share so much in the way of underlying appeal: competence, a private decency that comes across well on TV, and good prime ministerial hair. All of this adds to the Chancellor’s power. The unwritten story of the pandemic is that Sunak has won the important battles, including the case for beginning to ease the lockdown.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe situation in his office, then, is not a sign of weakness: there are two good reasons the Treasury continues to be one building with three systems. First, so few civil servants have returned to Great George Street that they can easily work around the overlapping systems. Second, the Chancellor himself is rarely in the building, preferring to work from his Downing Street office. This is a departure from how Sajid Javid and George Osborne ran things, and a return to the approach favoured by Philip Hammond. Civil servants often complain when ministers keep away from their departments, saying that it makes it harder to seek direction quickly. The ministers who are regularly praised for having a grip on their briefs – such as Michael Gove or Thérèse Coffey, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions – tend to spend a lot of time in and with their teams.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Treasury is usually no different, but many think Sunak is in the right place, because, in the words of one official, he needs to “keep an eye on them” – meaning Downing Street. Treasury staff have a sceptical view of No 10. This is not because they are unreconciled Remainers, but because they think that Johnson has never encountered a spending commitment he didn’t like and that there is no one in his set-up who speaks both economics and Johnsonian, as his adviser Gerard Lyons did in City Hall.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is Sunak who has the job of speaking both tongues now. The painful process of bringing the UK’s debt-to-GDP ratio under control – in May, the ratio rose above 100 per cent for the first time since 1963 – or at least halting the rise in the national debt, must begin, hopefully as soon as the Budget in the autumn. The problem is that Sunak is allowed to do as he pleases because of his high approval rating – the product of an era in which he has spent freely, on everything from paying people’s salaries to giving them a tenner off their dinner. What happens when the spending stops? Will Sunak’s likeability and therefore his influence in No 10 end when the furlough scheme does? His allies fear it will and that, ultimately, his popularity can only head one way from here: down. </p>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n          Getty      \n\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 10:27:16 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1227946916.jpg?itok=OY8_-WPE","linkMd5":"0d1b0702d44af1fd02eace648b72685c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn47@2020_5/2020/09/05/09-02-10-012_11cbe801a860396b.webp","destWidth":790,"destHeight":350,"sourceBytes":34264,"destBytes":18562,"author":"Stephen Bush","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1227946916.jpg?itok=OY8_-WPE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn47@2020_5/2020/09/05/09-02-10-012_11cbe801a860396b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528295},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"Death in the  countryside","link":"https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/books/2020/09/death-countryside","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-field-subheadline field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"> <p>\n\tMarieke Lucas Rijneveld, the youngest winner of the International Booker Prize, discusses grief and memory. </p>\n </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><noscript class=\"adaptive-image\" data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=\"300 768 1024\" data-adaptive-image-300-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot;

Rijneveld wore a grey suit, white shirt and tie, their shoulder-length blond hair obstructing some of their face.</p>\n<p>\n\tHutchison said she first came across Rijneveld at a poetry reading in 2018, where she was struck by their voice, which rings out “like a bell”. She was drawn to the book’s “fresh view of the world” and to Rijneveld’s poetic tone. Hutchison also warmed to the novel’s familiar rural setting; she grew up in Lincolnshire, “which looks like the Dutch countryside: it’s got tulips and windmills”.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>The Discomfort of Evening</em> is a dark and visceral novel full of precise descriptions and unnerving frankness. It follows ten-year-old Jas and her family, who are strict Reformed Christians and live and work on a dairy farm. Jas’s experience of the natural world is inseparable from her home life. She observes warts on toads and declares them “just like capers”, and fears her pet rabbit Dieuwertje will end up “in a layer of butter in the big casserole dish on the gas stove”.</p>\n<p>\n\tRijneveld grew up in a similar environment, on their family’s farm in the village of Nieuwendijk, in the south of the Netherlands. They left home at 19 and now live in Utrecht, spending most of their time writing, and, once a week, mucking out cows on a farm just outside the city – a routine they don’t plan on changing because they’ve won the International Booker Prize.</p>\n<p>\n\t“I like to get a change from sitting at my desk,” Rijneveld said, through an interpreter. “I think it’s really good to do something physical – it’s essential, actually – it helps me think and reflect.”</p>\n<p>\n\tSpending time in both the city and the countryside brings out different sides of Rijneveld’s character and is imperative to their creativity. “I need the city, because I need the noise and the sound there. But the countryside keeps me grounded; it’s a different kind of awareness, where I find peace and calm. I need both the sound and the silence.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAs a child growing up in a small village, Rijneveld had “freedom”. “I was able to play outside, I could climb trees, I was building huts… all of that’s great when you’re a kid.”</p>\n<p>\n\tChildren who grow up in the countryside, around so many animals, are also aware of death at an earlier age than their urban counterparts.</p>\n<p>\n\tRijneveld experienced this feature of rural life early: they were three when their 12-year-old brother died after he was knocked over by a bus on his way to school. “At that age, I had only a physical memory of it – a memory of the body as opposed to the memory you have in your mind. You know the story but you can’t really express it in words.”</p>\n<p>\n\tAfter their brother’s death, Rijneveld became scared of getting sick. “I was afraid of things to do with the body, I became very, very anxious”.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn <em>The Discomfort of Evening</em>, Jas’s brother, 12-year-old Matthies, dies in a tragic accident and the family’s grief propels them into an emotional neglect of one another. Jas’s mother stops eating; her father spends more time with his cows; Jas, like Rijneveld, becomes fearful of sickness, and with her siblings, begins a strange series of rituals. She sticks a pin into her navel and leaves it there; she keeps two toads in a bucket and encourages them to mate – if they do, she thinks, her parents will too, and that will make them happy. She believes she is making bargains with God, who will bring her brother back.</p>\n<p>\n\tThese scenes, the apex of which comprises animal abuse and sex acts between children, are grossly uncomfortable to read. But, Rijneveld said, “I’m not sure that they’re such unusual rituals.” The experiments “are something that’s almost normal in the countryside. Children are interested in death, they’re very curious. It’s not something you can imagine in the same way at all in the city. On a farm, people see nature, animals and people differently.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen foot and mouth disease strikes the farm and the slaughtering of cows begins, Jas feels a new tension in the air. “If you don’t learn how to cope when a person has died,” said Rijneveld, “then every animal that dies is something that’s very, very painful for you.”</p>\n<p>\n\tRijneveld has said that their mother has read their novel but finds it difficult to understand that it is fiction and not wholly the family’s truth. They are unsure whether their father has read it. “I think we can be afraid of emotions,” they said.</p>\n<p>\n\t“There’s a sense that they may be unbearable. As a child, you have to learn how to deal with your feelings. Lots of people don’t.” </p>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n          JEROEN JUMELET/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock      \n\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-image-caption field-type-text field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\">Marieke Lucas Rijneveld is the first Dutch author to win the International Booker Prize</div></div></div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 09:32:13 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/2020_36_encounter.jpg?itok=K5UfZeS5","linkMd5":"425994bbe7f9ebba075d36f330195a5d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn62@2020_2/2020/09/05/09-02-11-355_e576f556ad8980d7.webp","destWidth":790,"destHeight":350,"sourceBytes":36289,"destBytes":19768,"author":"Ellen Peirson-Hagger","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/2020_36_encounter.jpg?itok=K5UfZeS5":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn62@2020_2/2020/09/05/09-02-11-355_e576f556ad8980d7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528296},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"Imogen Heap: “I’m so frustrated with the music industry”","link":"https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/music-theatre/2020/09/imogen-heap-i-m-so-frustrated-music-industry","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-field-subheadline field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"> <p>\n\tThe musician and tech pioneer on why social media pushed her away from music, and how she found her way back.</p>\n </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><noscript class=\"adaptive-image\" data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=\"300 768\" data-adaptive-image-300-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;300&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_866_450/public/Longreads_2020/09/190508_imogenheap_0056.jpg?itok=25V10BSb&quot; alt=&quot;Imogen Heap&quot; title=&quot;Imogen Heap&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-768-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;768&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_360_203/public/Longreads_2020/09/190508_imogenheap_0056.jpg?itok=eJziuudq&quot; alt=&quot;Imogen Heap&quot; title=&quot;Imogen Heap&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-max-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;max&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_730/public/Longreads_2020/09/190508_imogenheap_0056.jpg?itok=g25ZL1DW&quot; alt=&quot;Imogen Heap&quot; title=&quot;Imogen Heap&quot; /&gt;\"><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_730/public/Longreads_2020/09/190508_imogenheap_0056.jpg?itok=g25ZL1DW\" alt=\"Imogen Heap\" title=\"Imogen Heap\" /></noscript>\n</div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\" property=\"content:encoded\"> <p dir=\"ltr\">\n\tImogen Heap never stops. As our video call connects, the Grammy Award-winning musician is pouring herself a cup of coffee from a cafetière. She’s wearing a grey hoodie and her long hair is tied up. She didn’t get much sleep, she tells me. I’m not surprised: she was emailing me past midnight. Before she’s sat down or I've had the chance to ask how she is, she’s bringing up a piece of text on her computer and asking if she can read it to me. “I wanted to share this with you,” she says.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\tIt’s an excerpt from a newsletter she’s received from artist Jonathan Harris at <a href=\"http://wefeelfine.org/\">We Feel Fine</a>, a website that describes itself as “an exploration of human emotion on a global scale”. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t“You’re falling through the air, nothing to hang on to, no parachute. The good news is: there is no ground,” she says, reading the final lines of a long paragraph. She breathes a sigh of relief. “I felt so relaxed after I read that: there’s no point trying to build walls or doors or floors or anything any more. Just embrace the now, the flux of everything around us, just do what we can in the means that we have. Suddenly, everything felt a lot more manageable.”</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\tLooking at her long list of projects, it is unsurprising that Heap’s character relies on a certain degree of restlessness, and that she must consciously look to outside forces to bring her back down to earth. For the last 24 years, she has forged a career as a forward-thinking purveyor of technology within the music industry. Classically trained on the piano, cello and clarinet as a child, Heap released her debut album, the alt-rock inspired <em>iMegaphone</em>, in 1998.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\tHer most commercially successful track, “Hide and Seek” from 2005’s <em>Speak For Yourself</em><strong>, </strong>soundtracked a climactic moment in<em> The OC</em> (and, <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2020/05/why-is-imogen-heaps-hide-and-seek-in-normal-people.html\">more recently, a scene in <em>Normal People</em></a>)<strong> </strong>and was heavily sampled in Jason Derulo’s ubiquitous 2009 single “Whatcha Say”. Heap has also composed the music for the West End play <em><a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/music-theatre/2016/07/harry-potter-and-cursed-child-jukebox-musical-without-music\">Harry Potter and the Cursed Child</a></em>, which opened in 2016. But since releasing her most recent solo album in 2014, her focus has been primarily on embracing technology within music and seeking out ways to make the industry more equitable.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\tIn an attempt to push back against the unfair deals that streaming services offer to musicians, in 2015 she released the single “Tiny Human” on Mycelia, an experimental distribution platform that uses a blockchain-based technology called Ethereum – a type of cryptocurrency. Her most idiosyncratic endeavour is the development of a pair of high-tech musical gloves, which allow their wearer to play electronics without being confined behind a bank of gear. Heap’s Mi.Mu gloves have been used on tour by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcdvBGEEXcU\">Ariana Grande</a>, the singer gesturing with her hands to create fade-outs or volume increases.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<em><strong>[see also: <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/music-theatre/2020/04/spotify-s-new-tip-jar-won-t-save-industry-it-asks-us-consider-music-s\">Spotify’s new “tip jar” won’t save the industry – but it asks us to consider music’s value</a>]</strong></em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\tBut Heap has spent the past few months at home in Hackney, east London with her five-year-old daughter Scout. In that time,<strong> </strong>she has considered what it might mean to slow down. “Usually we run at this ridiculous pace, like a spring, ready to fire at any moment. I feel lucky to have had this point to put a stop to the pace life was going at, and to be forced into a rethink.”</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\tTime away from her usual work – she has had to put most of her team on furlough, and halted a project to kick-start a community arts centre in the London Borough of Havering – brought perspective. “I realised the thing I was really missing was playing the piano,” she says. “I didn’t realise in my whole life how valuable that had been, ever since I was a child, having this connection with the moment, and just improvising and letting the flow of thoughts pass through me, rather than have them all sticking to my head.”</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\tSo each Tuesday during lockdown she has sat at her piano, <a href=\"http://imogenheap.com/livestreams/\">improvising live to fans</a> watching at home. At first, it was simply a way of giving herself a schedule: her days were “turning into one big mush”. But, having lost out on pay from <em>Harry Potter</em> once theatres closed (Heap says approximately 70 per cent of her income comes from the show), she realised she could use it to bolster herself financially too. She is now charging £100 per song request and £500 per cover request (she needs extra time to learn to play the latter). She calls these live-streams “digital busking”. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\tBut, being Heap, she couldn’t stop there. She has also launched <a href=\"https://imogenheap.app/\">an app</a>, which fans can sign up to for a small monthly fee (most pay £2 a month, she says), to access demos and working ideas, unreleased material and lyrics. It’s also somewhere Heap hosts “listening parties” and chats with fans, using Discord, a freeware instant messaging and video application. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\tHeap is fortunate that she has many generous fans. Lower-profile musicians, who have been struck hard by the loss of live tour revenue, would not have the fan base to make this work, and Heap is aware that the large one-off donations for song requests won’t last forever. But her Patreon-like model is a reminder that musicians’ work is work – that their time and talent shouldn’t be given away for free, as has become the norm across the industry due to the domination of social media.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<strong><em>[see also: <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/music-theatre/2020/08/thing-i-miss-most-dancing-rush-euphoria-all-caught-thrill-moment\">The thing I miss most is dancing: that rush of euphoria, all caught up in the thrill of the moment</a>]</em></strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\tIt was social media, Heap says, that changed her relationship with her fans in the first place. “It feels a bit like we’re back to the old days, back to this community, a small, manageable group, where we can discuss all kinds of things. I had this when I made <em>Speak For Yourself</em>, I had a message board. But social media took over and everything got so big. The one-to-many media is not a place of comfort and private discussion. I lost touch with these people. They were still there, but they were smothered by thousands of other people. I couldn’t find a way to reach them. In a way, I feel like social media contributed to my moving away from music.” </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\tLockdown pushed Heap into realising that she had left behind the most satisfying aspect of her career:<strong> </strong>playing and writing music. “In a way, I’m now retreating into the arms of my fans, into the arms of my Heapsters, and becoming more of a musician again.”</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\tOn Tuesdays, before the piano sessions, Heap sits in her “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbwEHNBipW0VfTj30HjYVylqqIEazadpc\">listening chair</a>” to speak with a fan, who has purchased a ticket for a one-to-one virtual conversation with her. “They usually end up being a couple of hours,” she says. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t“By the end of it, I come out feeling completely refreshed and ready to take on the world, because we’ve been having real conversations. To be honest, I spend 95 per cent of my time with my five-year-old, and I love my five-year-old, but it’s not always the kind of conversation you need. Having this professional time which is also a very deep connecting time has been like a weird therapy. There have been many tears. I lost my sister in November so we talk often about that.”</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\tDo her interactions with fans feel odd, I ask, given how much they have come to learn about her, and how little she knows about them? “From the outside, it might seem a bit strange, but it’s very difficult to describe the relationship. Obviously, there’s a financial relationship there, there is. But we trust that they’re there and they’re supporting me. They have paid to enter that space, but they think it’s worth it.” </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\tA Q&amp;A section of the “listening chair” sessions also contributes to the growth of Heap’s early-stage AI project, “Augmented Imogen”, which is intended to be an open-source resource for “Heapsters” in the future. She hopes this AI version of herself will be “witty, but a little bit offhand” – which is how, it seems, Heap likes to imagine her real self. Heap says the issue of handling<strong> </strong>data ethically is “very close to my heart”: she uses her time in the listening chair to discuss the practicalities of the AI project with her fans, while their sound bites contribute to it.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\tIt is clear that,<strong> </strong>for Heap, each new project is not simply a destination, but one more strand in her interconnected web of ideas. But how positively each initiative will affect its target audience is not so clear – and anyway, Heap’s mind is always leaping ahead to the next thing.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\tHer dedication to these extra-musical projects stems from a dissatisfaction that a lot of artists feel, particularly those on independent labels or those who self-release, as Heap does. “I’m so frustrated with the music industry,” she says. “Simply making a record by itself doesn’t pay the bills. You end up spending way more money than you get back on your return, unless you’re very lucky. In a way, I’d almost given up on it.”</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\tMany believe the halt to tours and music festivals this year has highlighted the industry’s systemic problems – the reliance on tour income, because streaming services pay artists so little, being a major one.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t“I do feel like it has come to the point where we are able to ask, without live [music], what are we really left with? It becomes completely unviable and, to be honest, it is completely unviable – even for me – to rely on just making music.”</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<em><strong>[see also: <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/music-theatre/2020/07/i-lost-my-identity-artists-who-left-major-record-deals-form-their-own\">“I lost my identity”: The artists who left major record deals to form their own indie labels</a>]</strong></em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\tHeap’s primary project, which she and her team have been working on for more than six years, is the <a href=\"https://creativepassport.net/\">Creative Passport</a>, a personalised ID system for music-makers. The global music industry generates $45bn a year, but 50 per cent of those payments don’t make it to their rightful owners, says Heap, and the old-fashioned administrative processes behind the scenes are costly too. Creative Passport aims to offer a solution: users can create one profile with correct and up-to-date data about themselves and their work and connect it to relevant websites, including Spotify and Apple Music. Heap hopes it will combat the problems of missing and incorrect data, and provide a searchable network for artists, engineers and producers to find each other on.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\tThe project, which Heap is hoping to roll out before the end of this year, isn’t a total overhaul of the current system. Rather, it works with pre-existing platforms and neatens up administration in aid of greater efficiency. “Right now we are individual musicians with no union. If we can prove that by having your information organised and being able to connect to all the different services that you use in your own micro eco-system – that you can help all those other services become more than the sum of their parts, by being interactive, data-organised and ready for action – we can shift it around.”</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\tIt’s no small task, but if anyone has the energy for such a project, it’s Heap. Besides, she knows<strong> </strong>her loyal fans will be there, too. She’s already, instinctively, adopting the calming language she read out to me at the start of our conversation as she talks of her rekindling with them: “I feel this time has been a homecoming in many ways, home to me, like falling out of a window and feeling like someone’s caught you.”</p>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n          Alexandra Arnold      \n\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-image-caption field-type-text field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\">Imogen Heap</div></div></div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 04 Sep 2020 11:00:14 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_730/public/Longreads_2020/09/190508_imogenheap_0056.jpg?itok=g25ZL1DW","linkMd5":"8c82bca90c3fceb74bac5dc5517b940d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn96@2020_4/2020/09/05/09-02-16-143_b30cc8366e3c65b3.webp","destWidth":730,"destHeight":520,"sourceBytes":65105,"destBytes":39174,"author":"Ellen Peirson-Hagger","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_730/public/Longreads_2020/09/190508_imogenheap_0056.jpg?itok=g25ZL1DW":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn96@2020_4/2020/09/05/09-02-16-143_b30cc8366e3c65b3.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528280},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"US presidential election 2020: is Donald Trump or Joe Biden leading in our poll tracker?","link":"https://www.newstatesman.com/international/2020/08/us-presidential-election-2020-donald-trump-or-joe-biden-leading-our-poll","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-field-subheadline field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"> <div id=\"nsmg-us20-widget\" style=\"min-width:320px;

it just wasn’t his style. He was a humble man better known for falling asleep at summit meetings than for cultivating a public profile.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut through his role in fashioning the US-led world order from the 1970s, Scowcroft had an outsized influence on all of our lives, even if we’re not aware of it, or indeed of him.</p>\n<p>\n\tScowcroft was a personal friend and I have a happy memory of him from the 1990s, when he joined my husband, the diplomat and foreign policy adviser Charles Powell, and I for lunch at our home in London. We wanted to watch the Clinton impeachment on television as did our other guest Paul Johnson, editor of the <em>New Statesman</em> in the 1960s.</p>\n<p>\n\tUnfortunately, the main television set stopped working; we adjourned to my bedroom and the four of us lay spread-eagled on the bed to watch. Scowcroft remarked that it gave a whole new meaning to the “special relationship”.</p>\n<p>\n\tScowcroft had many talents and achievements: air force pilot, fluent Serbo-Croat speaker, organiser of Richard Nixon’s and Kissinger’s visit to Beijing in 1972, and of the American withdrawal from Vietnam a year later. He also helped manage the peaceful end of the Cold War, and the ejection of Saddam Hussein from Kuwait in the first Gulf War in 1991.</p>\n<p>\n\tLess visible to the public, Scowcroft also possessed a philosophy of government from which we could learn. The core of this emerged in a remarkable interview Scowcroft gave for the Miller Center at the University of Virginia in 2000, which he insisted should only be published after his death.</p>\n<p>\n\tHis approach was partly a matter of conduct. He believed the two most important qualities anyone could bring to office were integrity and competence. The public interest, not partisan political advantage, should guide policy.</p>\n<p>\n\tDecisions should be reached after the right questions had been asked and rigorously debated. Advisers should not worry about their reputation or career prospects in tendering their advice. They should tell politicians what they need to hear, not what they want to hear. </p>\n<p>\n\tBut Scowcroft’s thinking went beyond notions of style, and encompassed wider ideas of institutional reform. </p>\n<p>\n\tBringing outsiders into government is normal practice in the US, and is increasingly favoured in the UK. But in Britain we seem to have a different definition of what makes the right sort of outsider. Scowcroft hired people for their outstanding expertise, such as Robert Gates (US secretary of defence between 2006 and 2011) and Condoleezza Rice (national security adviser and secretary of state between 2001 and 2009). In Whitehall, ideology and party loyalty count for more than integrity and expertise.</p>\n<p>\n\tScowcroft sought out candidates with people skills who could work with cabinet officials to prevent them from operating in silos, and instead share information across government departments. Judging by what we read about today’s Downing Street, bullying skills seem more in demand than gentler, more artful forms of persuasion.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnother of Scowcroft’s maxims was that the central team of officials and advisers could be made more effective by reducing its size rather than increasing the number of people involved in strategic affairs. He thought you got more impact by working with the grain of the wider government rather than trying to override it from the centre. </p>\n<p>\n\tScowcroft tried hard to keep out of the media headlights. If you want to be credited with being the hidden hand of government then it’s best to remain… hidden. He regarded leaking as treachery. It was one of the few things which made him really angry. </p>\n<p>\n\tI am not sure how Scowcroft would have handled introducing modern techniques such as big data analysis and science into government affairs, though he would surely have shared the objective of better and faster analysis underpinning policymaking. He was notoriously bad with technology and struggled with modern devices. My husband recalls Scowcroft waxing lyrical to him in the 1980s about a (then) new JSTARS military reconnaissance and surveillance system. When Charles asked him to explain what it actually was, Scowcroft had no idea. </p>\n<p>\n\tIn his posthumously published interview, Scowcroft regrets not having pushed harder for the integration of the National Security Council with the Office of Management and Budget, bringing together diplomatic and economic strategy-making in a single organisation. Whitehall is moving in the same direction by creating a Cabinet Office that has essentially become the prime minister’s own department.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf Scowcroft were managing such a project, it would be done behind the scenes, and presented as someone else’s idea – probably the cabinet secretary’s. And he would ensure that the numbers of staff would be small, so it wouldn’t look like political centralisation. </p>\n<p>\n\tFor Scowcroft, to be radical you don’t have to break things and shout from the rooftop. Being nice and avoiding credit gets you a lot further. </p>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n          Diana Walker/The LIFE Images Collection via Getty Images      \n\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-image-caption field-type-text field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\">Brent Scowcroft </div></div></div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 15:17:59 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/08/2020_35_brent_scowcroft.jpg?itok=3QwZjKF0","linkMd5":"f73cf31cf44d28a5de4328eda46fa3c8","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn32@2020_5/2020/09/05/09-02-09-935_93d515874b203a67.webp","destWidth":790,"destHeight":350,"sourceBytes":58871,"destBytes":31264,"author":"Carla Powell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/08/2020_35_brent_scowcroft.jpg?itok=3QwZjKF0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn32@2020_5/2020/09/05/09-02-09-935_93d515874b203a67.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528320},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"Elena Ferrante’s world of interiors ","link":"https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/fiction/2020/09/elena-ferrante-s-world-interiors","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-field-subheadline field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"> <p>\n\tThe formation of female identity in the Neapolitan quartet and <em>The Lying Life of Adults</em>. </p>\n<p>\n\t </p>\n </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><noscript class=\"adaptive-image\" data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=\"300 768 1024\" data-adaptive-image-300-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;300&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/09/2020_36_elena_ferrante.jpg?itok=Ez4Oiato&amp;amp;c=4728f5c3d3017da2901222fbd7bb46bd&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-768-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;768&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/09/2020_36_elena_ferrante.jpg?itok=Ez4Oiato&amp;amp;c=4728f5c3d3017da2901222fbd7bb46bd&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-1024-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;1024&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/09/2020_36_elena_ferrante.jpg?itok=Ez4Oiato&amp;amp;c=4728f5c3d3017da2901222fbd7bb46bd&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-max-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;max&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/09/2020_36_elena_ferrante.jpg?itok=Ez4Oiato&amp;amp;c=4728f5c3d3017da2901222fbd7bb46bd&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\"><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/2020_36_elena_ferrante.jpg?itok=qjctf2V8\" alt=\"\" /></noscript>\n</div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\" property=\"content:encoded\"> <p>\n\tIn the first paragraph of Elena Ferrante’s story of a teenage girl’s progression towards young adulthood, we are powerfully returned to the world of the Neapolitan quartet. The narrator, having related the moment on which she believes her childhood turned, tells us that it remains fixed in time and place. But she herself “slipped away, and am still slipping away, within these lines that are intended to give me a story, while in fact, I am nothing, nothing of my own, nothing that has really begun or really been brought to completion”.</p>\n<p>\n\tNobody who has read <em>My Brilliant Friend </em>and its three successors – the pseudonymous Italian author’s quartet became a cultural phenomenon as it was published between 2012 and 2015 – would miss the echo of Lila’s “dissolving margins”, episodes in which she loses hold of the boundaries between herself, others and her surroundings. These moments become key to our understanding of both her internal fractures and those that repeatedly disrupt the narrative. But Lila’s life is described to us by her friend Lenù – and inflected by her apprehension of their relationship and by her gradual metamorphosis into the chronicler of their story. What difference, then, occurs when the central character and the events of her life appear to be unmediated?</p>\n<p>\n\tIn some respects, much remains the same; Lenù was interrogating her own life as well as Lila’s, and it was just as turbulent and often mysterious to her as that of ­Giovanna’s, the narrator of <em>The Lying Life of Adults</em>. But the lack of another in ­Giovanna’s life, of the close companion who both ­mirrors and ­violently distorts her ­experience of ­herself, represents a ­profound shift, ­plunging the reader into a kind of chaos that feels as though it might be unresolvable, an impenetrable singleness.</p>\n<p>\n\tGiovanna is a single child, and her parents have also isolated themselves; her father, in particular, has cut ties with his family and, in her mother’s words, “had to climb a mountain with his bare hands” to reach a place of professional and social respectability. The incident that opens the novel is a rare foray back into that milieu; he tells his wife that Giovanna, whom he mistakenly believes cannot hear him, is becoming ugly and, more specifically, starting to resemble his estranged sister. Beyond Giovanna’s hurt arrives the consequence that she becomes fascinated, and then fixated, by the ghost of the monstrous Vittoria, and determines to begin a relationship with her lost aunt.</p>\n<p>\n\tLies are both plentiful and obscure: aside from Giovanna’s clandestine meetings with Vittoria, which involve a literal descent from the high parts of Naples where she lives to the poorer and dirtier Vomero, there are the different explanations for the enmity between Andrea, her father, and his sister. These contain all the stuff of melodrama: a broken love affair between Vittoria and a married man who died shortly afterwards, a scrabble for property between siblings, a natural mutual loathing exacerbated by Andrea’s ascent up the class ladder. While ­Vittoria lives a straitened life, Andrea’s is typified by books, conversation, argument and work. While she is loveless, he is married, with a child. But it is not a version of events to which she subscribes, telling her niece that, “I’ve had everything, I <em>have</em> everything. It’s your father who has nothing.”</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the novel’s present day, too, are confusions that seem only to multiply with examination. Is Giovanna’s mother having an affair with her husband’s closest friend, or are they simply consoling each other because their spouses are intimately entangled? (“Please don’t tell Papa,” begs Giovanna, when she confides her suspicions about her mother to her aunt, only to receive the response “Papa? You think Papa gives a fuck about the ankles of Mariano and Nella under the table?”) Why does Vittoria herself appear so close to her lover’s widow and to almost co-parent her three children?</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen Giovanna’s father eventually leaves the family home for his mistress Costanza (also the mother of Giovanna’s two closest childhood friends), a spell is broken and Vittoria – permanently angry, vituperative and bullying, with flashes of vulnerability – has the upper hand, emblematised by a bracelet, a family heirloom, that changes from wrist to wrist, and is both coveted and rejected by multiple characters. Here, she occupies some of the same territory as Lila in the Neapolitan quartet: plugged into both the sublime and sordid aspects of desire, alive to the venality of others, and contemptuous of intellectual abstractions and bourgeois convention. In Ferrante’s scheme, the two women are simultaneously admirable and troubling, their fearlessness veering ­between honesty and the unhinged, almost too potent for us to see directly without the projections of those around them.</p>\n<p>\n\tThroughout, Giovanna is the novel’s unsteady focus. She begins as a 12-year-old, and we follow her to just past her 16th birthday, when she has briefly crossed the threshold of Naples for Milan, in pursuit of an older man betrothed to someone else, who represents romantic promise and intellectual and spiritual freedom. For most of the intervening time, she operates in confusion, her allegiances to her parents in ruins, her sexual appetites bewildering, her inner world by turns seductive and abhorrent to her.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is a gift to write so freely about the chancy formation of identity, and one that Ferrante exploits in a particular, peculiar way. Even allowing for the lost nuances of reading in translation – and this well-established partnership between author and translator suggests that readers in English are getting as true a version of the text as possible – she is breathtakingly cavalier about the grace and prettiness of sentences. Scenes tumble over one another, characters barge in and flounce out (including Giovanna’s would-be suitors, a pair of Shakespearean comic villains, in a yellow car), dialogue takes the form of staccato cut and thrust or long, unlifelike soliloquy.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd yet, if you submit to the constant propulsion, it is irresistible. Always, there is the sense of being held in a pattern, and of being distracted by its surface as shapes shift and collide beneath. Ferrante’s use of spatial dynamics – Vittoria’s ramshackle Fiat shunting between the high and low ground of a mythic city, a threatening graveyard, a claustrophobic train carriage – is always present. The socio-politics of Italy, in an unspecified time that feels like the not-too-distant past, subtly underwrite the characters’ actions. And throughout, we are placed in close proximity to those characters’ bodies, displayed or disguised, gazed at in mirrors and found unnaturally beautiful or ­irretrievably ugly, sometimes a reflection of their ­spiritual worth and sometimes entirely divorced from it.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs <em>The Lying Life of Adults</em> ends, there is another departure, and the promotion of another character, a hitherto sidelined young girl who has ambitions to become a writer and who has promised – or possibly threatened – to make stories from the lives of her friends and family. It feels like the start of something else; and on the evidence of this book, there is more to tell.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>The Lying Life of Adults </strong><br />\n\tElena Ferrante, translated by Ann Goldstein<br />\n\t<em>Europa Editions, 300pp, £20</em></p>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n          Valentina Giovinazzo/millennium images, UK      \n\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 16:24:18 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/2020_36_elena_ferrante.jpg?itok=qjctf2V8","linkMd5":"48bc9bfd47b278afdfead650c4f9b4ec","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn22@2020_2/2020/09/05/09-02-10-252_5b8117e5b5890f6c.webp","destWidth":790,"destHeight":350,"sourceBytes":31278,"destBytes":11672,"author":"Alex Clark","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/2020_36_elena_ferrante.jpg?itok=qjctf2V8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn22@2020_2/2020/09/05/09-02-10-252_5b8117e5b5890f6c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528288},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"The challenges facing Ed Davey as the new Liberal Democrat leader","link":"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2020/08/challenges-facing-ed-davey-new-liberal-democrat-leader","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-field-subheadline field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"> <p>\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-03183acd-7fff-c074-3954-539043e8bc05\">The former cabinet minister inherits a party with just 11 MPs </span>– but the Lib Dems are in a stronger position than it may appear. </p>\n </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><noscript class=\"adaptive-image\" data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=\"300 768 1024\" data-adaptive-image-300-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;300&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-1175052176.jpg?itok=-Wrp0aQG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-768-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;768&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-1175052176.jpg?itok=-Wrp0aQG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-1024-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;1024&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-1175052176.jpg?itok=-Wrp0aQG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-max-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;max&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-1175052176.jpg?itok=-Wrp0aQG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\"><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-1175052176.jpg?itok=6ujwJoSQ\" alt=\"\" /></noscript>\n</div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\" property=\"content:encoded\"> <p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-ddc9ffbb-7fff-e607-cf74-09c1c0945f1b\">Ed Davey has been elected leader of the Liberal Democrats, beating opponent Layla Moran by 42,756 votes to 24,564.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-ddc9ffbb-7fff-e607-cf74-09c1c0945f1b\">Davey, the former energy secretary, who had been acting co-leader of the party since Jo Swinson lost her seat in the December 2019 general election, was the bookies’ favourite to win after polling in January indicated a strong lead in his favour. With no polling during the contest, however, and an energetic campaign from Moran, party insiders had expected the final results to be tight. In the end, it was a decisive victory for Davey, which was announced this morning at a closed event in central London. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-ddc9ffbb-7fff-e607-cf74-09c1c0945f1b\">At the somewhat muted affair, the new leader delivered a short speech to the small number of socially distanced attendees, in which he paid tribute to Moran and to the party, before saying the Liberal Democrats need to “wake up and smell the coffee” after three disappointing general election results.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-ddc9ffbb-7fff-e607-cf74-09c1c0945f1b\">“The truth is voters don’t believe we share their values,” Davey said. “Nationally, voters have been sending us a message, but we are not listening. I have got that message, I am listening now.” Marking a break with the party’s “Stop Brexit” message at the last general election, he added: “Whether you voted for Brexit or Remain, my message for you is this: I will travel up and down the country to meet you.”  </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\tDavey fought a campaign strongly predicated on his prior experience as a cabinet minister, his track record as a campaigner, and his dogged focus on two issues: the climate emergency – he pointed to his record of tripling renewable energy during the coalition government – and social care, having been a carer to his ill mother in his teenage years and, now, the father to a young disabled son. Davey secured support from many of the party’s most senior figures, including former leader Tim Farron and the highly regarded new MP for St Albans, Daisy Cooper. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\tThe new leader chose to be clear-sighted about the challenge ahead for the Liberal Democrats, which fell to 11 MPs at the last election and lost their leader. Moran’s team emphasised during the contest that the party is now trailing at a disappointing 6 per cent in the polls, a case, they argued, for a decisive break with the past and a fresh start. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-ddc9ffbb-7fff-e607-cf74-09c1c0945f1b\">Davey inherits a challenge, but the party is </span><a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2020/07/where-next-liberal-democrats\">in a stronger position to rebuild itself</a> than these headline figures would indicate: the 2019 general election represented a recovery of sorts for the Lib Dems, and they are now second in 91 seats, compared with 38 in 2017. The new leader and his team are well aware that Liberal Democrat success is strongly correlated with the popularity of the Labour leader.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\tIn most of their target seats for the next general election, the Liberal Democrats are the main challengers to a Conservative incumbent, with the next-closest party a distant third. Between a more polarising Conservative leader and a more popular Labour one, Davey’s hope is to establish the Liberal Democrats as the main progressive challenger to the Tories in their target seats, and then to win over enough moderate Conservative voters to clinch those seats. If he can do that, he may slowly turn the party’s fortunes around.</p>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n          Getty      \n\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-image-caption field-type-text field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\">Ed Davey, the new leader of the Liberal Democrats</div></div></div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 27 Aug 2020 11:23:56 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-1175052176.jpg?itok=6ujwJoSQ","linkMd5":"433f253b17d03b0e27a4f51ea3aec0bc","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn21@2020_4/2020/09/05/09-02-11-106_f356dd070c4d735a.webp","destWidth":790,"destHeight":350,"sourceBytes":44535,"destBytes":26022,"author":"Ailbhe Rea","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-1175052176.jpg?itok=6ujwJoSQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn21@2020_4/2020/09/05/09-02-11-106_f356dd070c4d735a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528305},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"Why does the government keep making such bad policies?","link":"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2020/08/why-does-government-keep-making-such-bad-policies","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-field-subheadline field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"> <p>\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-d2253651-7fff-9191-2d0b-399fe64737e3\">There have been so many U-turns that it might be quicker to explore when ministers </span>don’t change their minds.</p>\n </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><noscript class=\"adaptive-image\" data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=\"300 768 1024\" data-adaptive-image-300-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot;

(I assume he was joking, but hey, I need an intro.) His reasoning was that we could cite not one, but</span> <em>two</em>, different things I had thundered about in recent weeks, on which the government almost immediately changed its line.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-0ec8200f-7fff-58c7-2d04-0e1904e9d6cc\">Exhibit A. In early July, face masks were theoretically compulsory on public transport and in healthcare settings. Yet not only was the government refusing to extend these rules to cover England’s rapidly reopening retail and hospitality sector: cabinet ministers were frequently going about their business, or occasionally waiting tables as a publicity stunt, with no face covering to prevent them from breathing all over any hapless passers-by. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-0ec8200f-7fff-58c7-2d04-0e1904e9d6cc\">I used these pages to </span><a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2020/07/why-earth-aren-t-english-politicians-wearing-face-masks\" target=\"_blank\">express my bafflement</a> about this; mere days later, face masks were suddenly compulsory in England, with fines threatened for non-compliance. Score one to me.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-0ec8200f-7fff-58c7-2d04-0e1904e9d6cc\">Exhibit B. A fortnight later, I </span><a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2020/07/why-hasn-t-government-extended-ban-rental-evictions\">asked</a> why the government hadn’t extended the rental eviction ban in England and Wales. Once it expired, housing charities warned, some of the estimated 200,000 private renters who had fallen into arrears owing to the pandemic were almost certain to be out on the streets.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-0ec8200f-7fff-58c7-2d04-0e1904e9d6cc\">But then, in the nick of time on 21 August – two days before it was due to run out – Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick bravely overruled the statements put out by his own department hours before, and announced that <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/economy/2020/08/banning-rental-evictions-won-t-fix-tenants-real-problem\" target=\"_blank\">the eviction ban was to be extended</a> by four weeks. Cometh the hour, cometh the man, cometh the U-turn.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-0ec8200f-7fff-58c7-2d04-0e1904e9d6cc\">On two occasions I said that the government should do something, and then, as if by magic, it did it. Hmm.</span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-0ec8200f-7fff-58c7-2d04-0e1904e9d6cc\">Far be it from me to reject the call to serve my country, or to miss an opportunity to promote myself like the publicity hungry monster I clearly am, but I think there’s a problem with my editor’s suggested headline: so many U-turns has this government made of late that I suspect it’s mathematically impossible to write about politics on a regular basis without accidentally predicting a few of them. A more appropriate headline might be, “Is Jonn Elledge a stopped clock?” </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-0ec8200f-7fff-58c7-2d04-0e1904e9d6cc\">What seems to have happened in both those cases is that it became clear that the government’s first line was going to get it into trouble so it changed its view. In the case of the masks, as Ailbhe </span><a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2020/07/why-did-uk-government-change-its-position-face-masks\" target=\"_blank\">wrote</a> at the time, the shift “seemed to be more swayed by public opinion than ideology”. (It was also, she noted, not clear it had actually changed its line, so much as belatedly realised that it should actually have one.) Regarding the eviction ban, my suspicion is that public mood mattered less than the very real possibility of an enormous and avoidable spike in homelessness in the middle of a pandemic. Because while this government may often be stupid, it isn’t <em>stupid</em>.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-0ec8200f-7fff-58c7-2d04-0e1904e9d6cc\">And there have been, remember, so many other U-turns that it’d almost be quicker to start looking for explanations when ministers </span><em>don’t</em> change their minds. This month alone, there was the U-turn over the near-universally loathed attempts to guess what grades A-level students would have achieved in exams they never took, based on how past cohorts did, which, now I write it down, is clearly an insane thing to do. Not only was it obvious this U-turn was going to happen: it was obvious that it had literally already happened, in Scotland, the previous week. And yet, right up until the moment the Education Secretary, Gavin Williamson, U-turned, the entire government maintained it wasn’t going to.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-0ec8200f-7fff-58c7-2d04-0e1904e9d6cc\">That led, sharply and </span><a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/economy/2020/08/two-government-u-turns-have-placed-many-britain-s-universities-life-support\" target=\"_blank\">inexorably</a>, to another U-turn – lifting the cap on the number of places universities can offer.

Living standards remained below their 2008 level, GDP growth was mediocre and the budget deficit was not eliminated. But millions of new jobs were created.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis apparent triumph was never as impressive as it first appeared. Two-thirds of the growth in jobs was accounted for by self-employment, zero-hours contracts and agency work. As living standards fell or stagnated, more women, lone parents and older people entered the labour market in an attempt to preserve their spending power.</p>\n<p>\n\tYet the headline figures still provided the Conservatives with a potent narrative. In an audacious piece of political appropriation, in 2014 they claimed the mantle of “full employment” – a goal traditionally associated with centre-left governments. The memory of the 1980s and early 1990s – when Tory rule became synonymous with mass joblessness – had, they hoped, been banished.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the story of this summer has been one of job destruction, not job creation. In the first half of this year the UK endured the worst recession of any G7 country (GDP fell by 22.1 per cent), and almost every day has brought further redundancies: 9,000 at Rolls-Royce, 7,000 at Marks &amp; Spencer, 6,500 at Debenhams, 2,800 at Pret A Manger, and 1,500 at WHSmith. The total number of paid employees in the UK fell by 730,000 between March and July, the largest quarterly decline since 2009.</p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\">\n\t<br />\n\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"media-image attr__typeof__foaf:Image img__fid__113364 img__view_mode__media_large attr__format__media_large\" height=\"1039\" src=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/2020_36_eaton_cover_story.jpg?itok=J17dBOzL\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" width=\"800\" /><br />\n\t<em>Credit: Michelle Thompson</em></p>\n<p>\n\tYet as if reflecting a parallel universe, the unemployment rate has remained at a near-record low of 3.9 per cent. In the US, by contrast, the jobless rate rose to 14.7 per cent in April – the highest level since the Great Depression – and is currently 10.2 per cent. But Britain’s record is flattered by two factors: the first is an increase in people classed as economically inactive between April and June: 82,000 more are out of work but are not looking for work. The second is one of the most dramatic economic interventions in postwar history: the Job Retention Scheme.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe furlough scheme, as it has become known, was an enlightened act of statecraft. Faced with a lethal pandemic, and the need to place the economy in cryogenic suspension, the government undertook to pay 80 per cent of furloughed workers’ wages (up to a maximum of £2,500 a month). The speed and clarity with which Sunak announced the programme on 20 March contrasted with the late and haphazard lockdown presided over by Boris Johnson. Len McCluskey, the general secretary of Unite, was among the Conservatives’ unlikely cheerleaders. “Rishi Sunak’s wage support measures are a historic first for this country, but are bold and very much necessary,” he said.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn May, after a senior government source complained that “people are addicted to the scheme”, the Chancellor distanced himself from such briefings and extended the programme until October. Combined with the Eat Out to Help Out scheme, the policy helped make Sunak the UK’s most popular politician (a recent Ipsos Mori poll gave him a net approval rating of +47 compared to Johnson’s zero).</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the furlough programme – which has supported a total of 9.6 million jobs since its introduction – is now being unwound. Since 1 August, firms have had to pay their employees’ National Insurance and pension contributions – one cause of the tide of summer redundancies. Then, on 1 September, the government’s wage subsidy fell to 70 per cent (with employers required to pay the remaining 10 per cent). At the start of next month it will fall to 60 per cent, before the scheme is ended entirely on 31 October.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is then that the four million workers that think tank the Resolution Foundation estimates are still reliant on the programme will be exposed to the vagaries of the market. As autumn approaches, the UK is once more facing mass unemployment. For now, like the cartoon character Wile E Coyote, the labour market is suspended in mid-air – the risk is that it will soon fall to earth.</p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\">\n\t<span class=\"divider\">****</span></p>\n<p>\n\tThe last time UK unemployment reached nearly 12 per cent was in 1984. Ronald Reagan was US president, Arthur Scargill and Margaret Thatcher were fighting for supremacy amid the miners’ strike, and Prince released <em>Purple Rain</em>. It is to this era that the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts the UK will return, with joblessness peaking at 11.9 per cent in the final quarter of this year – more than three times its pre-crisis level. The Bank of England is more optimistic: it estimates that unemployment will peak at 7.5 per cent. But this would still be nearly double the current rate.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe risk is perhaps greatest for the 800,000 young people who have left school or university this year – the Resolution Foundation has estimated that youth unemployment could rise by 640,000 this year, taking the total above one million.</p>\n<p>\n\t“A spell of unemployment when you’re young creates a permanent scar, not a temporary blemish,” Professor David Blanchflower, a former member of the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee, warned when we spoke. “A spell of unemployment when you’re 40 doesn’t appear to have had an effect when you’re 50, you get over it. The problem for the young is if they don’t get a foothold in the labour market, and make the transition from school to work, it permanently scars them and it hurts us – everyone else is hurt.”</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen Sunak delivered his summer statement on 8 July, he declared: “I want every person in this House and in the country to know that I will never accept unemployment as an unavoidable outcome.” His words contrasted with those of former Conservative chancellor Norman Lamont, who in 1991 remarked that “rising unemployment” was “a price well worth paying” to reduce inflation.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut there was a marked disparity between Sunak’s rhetoric and the modesty of the fiscal measures he announced, such as the £1,000 Jobs Retention Bonus for each furloughed worker companies bring back. A recent survey by Lloyds Bank found that only 18 per cent of businesses with furloughed workers expect to retain all their staff.</p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\">\n\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"media-image attr__typeof__foaf:Image img__fid__113356 img__view_mode__media_large attr__format__media_large\" height=\"477\" src=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/1_8.jpg?itok=Lpopid-v\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" width=\"800\" /></p>\n<p>\n\tElsewhere in Europe, countries including Germany, France and Italy have extended their versions of the furlough scheme until the end of this year or beyond. Not for the first time during the pandemic, the UK appears a troubling outlier.</p>\n<p>\n\tAfter the 2008 financial crisis, Germany was the only G7 country not to suffer a fall in employment. This remarkable achievement was attributed to the <em>Kurzarbeit</em> (or “short work”) programme through which the government subsidises the wages of workers retained on a part-time basis. The scheme – which is available to companies at all times, not only during global crises – was limited to claims lasting a maximum of 12 months, but has now been extended by Angela Merkel’s government to 24 months. Employees who have been partially furloughed for seven months or more receive up to 80 per cent of lost earnings (or 87 per cent if they have children).</p>\n<p>\n\tWhy, then, is Sunak, who originally emulated the German model, now retreating? Economists cite two factors that are shaping the Chancellor’s approach. The first is the extent of government borrowing: the national debt has surpassed 100 per cent of GDP for the first time since 1963. Sunak, an instinctive fiscal conservative who argued in 2015 that “in normal times public spending should not exceed 37 per cent of GDP”, has made it his aim to “right the ship”. He intends to achieve this through tax rises on the wealthy and on companies – Treasury proposals include increasing corporation tax and capital gains tax – but also by curbing state spending.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile the first factor reflects the household economics of Margaret Thatcher and George Osborne, the second is based on the Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter’s idea of “creative destruction”, which “continuously revolutionises the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one”. As Carys Roberts, executive director of the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), told me: “The argument is that we can’t just freeze the [pre-Covid-19] economy and preserve it as it was, that we have to plunge forward into the new economy and embrace creative destruction. It’s a very neoliberal approach: for a really strong economy we need to unleash the market.”</p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\">\n\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"media-image attr__typeof__foaf:Image img__fid__113357 img__view_mode__media_large attr__format__media_large\" height=\"477\" src=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/3_4.jpg?itok=EcuMVZkN\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" width=\"800\" /></p>\n<p>\n\tBoth halves of this intellectual logic are flawed. Though the UK’s borrowing has rarely been higher it has also rarely been cheaper. Such is the demand for British debt from investors that this summer the government has sold bonds at negative interest rates (in other words, investors are paying the government to take their money). The National Institute of Economic and Social Research has estimated that extending the furlough scheme until the middle of next year would likely pay for itself by reducing the number of redundancies (which increase benefit claims and reduce tax revenue).</p>\n<p>\n\tEconomists are divided on whether the furlough scheme should simply be extended but most agree that a wage subsidy programme – whether focused on part-time work or the hardest-hit sectors – is essential. Without such intervention, the IPPR has estimated, “up to two million jobs could be lost, not because business owners are not working hard or smart enough, but because of continuing social distancing measures.”</p>\n<p>\n\tTorsten Bell, the chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, warned against overestimating the capacity of the UK’s flexible labour market, or “creative destruction”, to generate new jobs.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Retail and restaurant activity is going to reallocate, to some extent, from city centres to local residential high streets,” he told me. “Some of that will happen but we shouldn’t be gung-ho about how painful this is for people along the way. From a human perspective it really matters whether unemployment hits 8 per cent or 10 per cent now; that’s a lot of lives.”</p>\n<p class=\"rtecenter\">\n\t<span class=\"divider\">****</span></p>\n<p>\n\tIn an economy, as the <em>New York Times </em>columnist Paul Krugman likes to remark, “my spending is your income and your spending is my income.” For this reason, a rise in unemployment has negative knock-on effects. This is particularly true in the UK, where benefit payments as a share of previous earnings are among the lowest in the OECD (even after temporary increases). A spike in joblessness would help thwart the UK’s recovery.</p>\n<p>\n\tFaced with the imminent end of the furlough scheme, the government is urging people to return to their offices in order to help sustain adjacent cafés, bars and restaurants. But combined with the reopening of schools, increased mobility will heighten the risk of a second wave – the greatest possible anti-stimulus. In these circumstances, the unconditional end of the furlough scheme appears reckless.</p>\n<p>\n\tSunak has insisted that while “many more” people will lose their jobs, “nobody will be left without hope and opportunity.” In the long run, he implies, the storm will pass. But as JM Keynes observed, “in the long run we are all dead.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe government has already presided over one avoidable human tragedy. Had the lockdown been imposed one week earlier, epidemiologists estimate, tens of thousands of lives could have been saved. Now, as the threat of mass unemployment draws nearer, the risk is that the government is once more sleepwalking into catastrophe. </p>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n           Jonathan McHugh      \n\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 13:49:42 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_730/public/Longreads_2020/09/2020_36_leader.jpg?itok=ZnIyVg4H","linkMd5":"007f86409075e41830d8ce9a99ddea8c","destWidth":730,"destHeight":520,"sourceBytes":78841,"destBytes":46494,"author":"George Eaton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_730/public/Longreads_2020/09/2020_36_leader.jpg?itok=ZnIyVg4H":null,"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/2020_36_eaton_cover_story.jpg?itok=J17dBOzL":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn78@2020_3/2020/09/05/09-02-42-184_451a12a1355e164c.webp","https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/1_8.jpg?itok=Lpopid-v":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn54@2020_6/2020/09/05/09-02-42-040_cfab291723490a2f.webp","https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/3_4.jpg?itok=EcuMVZkN":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn65@2020_2/2020/09/05/09-02-42-152_872134dd73461445.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528293},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"First Thoughts: Public Health England, catastrophe bonds, and the Last Night of the Proms","link":"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2020/08/first-thoughts-public-health-england-catastrophe-bonds-and-last-night-proms","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-field-subheadline field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"> <p>\n\tMatt Hancock says the replacement for the disgraced Public Health England will be “world-renowned”.

In 2018, when allegations of anti-Semitism began to assail the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn’s aides proposed options for reclaiming “an overwhelmingly hostile narrative”. According to a new book by the journalists Gabriel Pogrund and Patrick Maguire, serialised in the <em>Times</em>, these included a visit to Auschwitz, a meeting with children at London’s Jewish Free School, and an interview with <em>Haaretz</em>, Israel’s liberal broadsheet. None was taken up.</p>\n<p>\n\tThey would have been mere gestures, events staged specially for the media, as so many politicians’ public performances are. They required Corbyn to swallow his pride and pretend empathy for the fears of British Jews, even though he believed that they were far more secure than other minorities and that he risked seeming to betray the Palestinian cause to which he had devoted his political life. Corbyn clung to what he considered his biggest strengths: his sincerity and authenticity. He ended up losing an election to a man who lacked either quality and who was himself guilty of indulging racism.</p>\n<h4>\n\tLowering expectations</h4>\n<p>\n\tMatt Hancock, the Health Secretary, says the replacement for the disgraced Public Health England will be “world-renowned”. What will it be renowned for? Until now, most of this government’s responses to the pandemic have been allegedly “world-beating”. Does this new category represent lower expectations, implicitly accepting that the new body may be world-renowned in the same way as King Harold’s performance at the Battle of Hastings in 1066?</p>\n<h4>\n\tEnglish asses</h4>\n<p>\n\tOr perhaps the new body will be world-renowned in the fashion of the Last Night of the Proms: as an example of the English making asses of themselves. “Land of Hope and Glory”, proclaiming that “wider still and wider shall thy bounds be set”, sounds pretty daft with the UK struggling to keep Scotland on board. So, with England boasting one of the world’s highest Covid-19 death rates, does the reference in “Rule Britannia” to “nations, not so blest as thee”. This year, in the absence of a flag-waving audience, orchestral versions will be performed without lyrics. The Tory press is enraged. But the decision is right, not so much because it prevents offence to minorities but because it saves the white majority from displaying its delusions.</p>\n<h4>\n\tCat bonds</h4>\n<p>\n\tStruggling for a decent return on your savings? I don’t want to sound like an advertisement for a dodgy investment fund, but I feel bound to point out that holders of catastrophe bonds can get an annual return of around 7.5 per cent while most bank accounts and government bonds offer 1 per cent or less. “Cat bonds” are issued by businesses that wish to protect against natural disasters caused by global warming. The market for them, now worth more than £75bn, has increased rapidly since they were invented in 1996.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe more the world is hit by hurricanes and floods, the more investors lose.But global warming deniers, if they believe what they write, should regard the bonds as risk-free.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the past, I have challenged deniers such as Peter Hitchens and James Delingpole to reveal whether or not they hold cat bonds. They have not responded. I hereby challenge them again.</p>\n<h4>\n\tMarxist rugby proles</h4>\n<p>\n\tWith 70 editorial jobs to cut, the cash-strapped <em>Guardian</em> tells its sports department to reduce coverage of horse racing and club rugby union. The thumbs-down for racing is no surprise: following its founders’ nonconformist principles, the paper didn’t cover the sport at all for more than a century.</p>\n<p>\n\tEven today it doesn’t publish racing cards. But why rugby union? Presumably it is singled out as a sport followed mainly by right-wing, semi-fascist toffs.

The strategy to accomplish this often employs candidates whose messages of optimism or fear are meant to inspire more of their voters while disheartening those who support the competition. But sometimes, a more direct approach is taken: voter suppression.</p>\n<p>\n\tEnacting frivolous and cumbersome requirements to help win elections is nothing new. The votes of people of colour, black Americans in particular, were intentionally suppressed during the era of Jim Crow’s racial segregation laws through a variety of exclusionary measures: poll taxes levied a fee for voter registration; literacy tests were ostensibly administered to assess prospective voters’ mental fitness; grandfather clauses were intended to exempt white voters from new eligibility restrictions; and old-fashioned violence used to physically prevent black Americans from voting and intimidate others from even making the attempt.</p>\n<p>\n\tToday, preventing voter fraud is the rationale offered for why stricter voting requirements and procedures are needed. The goal, however, is the same as in decades past – to win elections by making it more difficult for certain voters to participate. And voters of colour continue to bear the brunt of that difficulty.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs the 2020 US presidential election approaches, both parties have hinted at the respective approach to voting mechanics that they think gives them the best chance of winning the White House. Democrats recently <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/13/vote-mail-poll-255281\">passed a bill </a>in the House that seeks to increase turnout by requiring states to adopt voting by mail, especially given the election day disruptions that the coronavirus pandemic is likely to cause. But Republicans are resisting such efforts, their position best captured in President Trump’s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/article/mail-in-voting-explained.html\">assertions</a> that “mail ballots are very dangerous for this country because of cheaters”, and that high voter turnout will lead to the party’s defeat.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn short, Democrats want to shape the electorate to their advantage by expanding it; Republicans by shrinking it. And given the changing demographics of party coalitions over the last couple of decades, with voters of colour clustering in the Democratic Party, efforts to reduce the electorate will target voters of colour.</p>\n<p>\n\tSince 2010, more than 25 states have <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/new-voting-restrictions-america\">implemented</a> restrictive measures such as more stringent voter identification requirements, purging of registration rolls, reduction of polling locations and early voting days, gerrymandered districts, and complicating absentee and early voting. In one of those states, North Carolina, a federal judge <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/07/29/the-smoking-gun-proving-north-carolina-republicans-tried-to-disenfranchise-black-voters/\">found</a> that the batch of voter requirements proposed in a new statute “target African Americans with almost surgical precision”.</p>\n<p>\n\tAccusations of voter suppression are often met with the rebuttal that rooting out voter fraud is reason enough for stricter provisions. Yet voter fraud is exceedingly <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/dirty-tricks-9-falsehoods-could-undermine-2020-election\">rare</a>, having a national incident rate of just 0.0025 per cent – the same chances of being struck by a meteor. Even President Trump’s voter fraud commission, established within months of his taking office, was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/03/us/politics/trump-voter-fraud-commission.html\">reportedly</a> unable to uncover any significant occurrences of voter fraud.</p>\n<p>\n\tNo matter the rationale, the threat of voter suppression is of even more concern in the middle of a public health crisis. The coronavirus pandemic will affect the mechanics of voting, whether in-person or otherwise. There are worries that there will be fewer poll stations, longer lines and wait times, and a decrease in voter registration. In this way, many of the objectives of voter suppression are inadvertently achieved by the restrictions put in place to stall the spread of the virus.</p>\n<p>\n\tPreventing coronavirus from being co-opted by those who want to reduce the size of the electorate for political gain will be a particular challenge for voting rights advocates in the 2020 race. It will require proactive efforts, like the expansion of vote by mail, to ensure every eligible voter who wants to participate in the election is able to do so without undue complications.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe circumstances surrounding the upcoming presidential will be unlike any other in our lifetimes. If the nation truly values participatory democracy, it will need to modernise its electoral processes and guard against attempts to exclude eligible voters. The pandemic will pass, but the threat of voter suppression is a much more difficult scourge to overcome.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Theodore R.

Everyone really. But young people are very near the top of my list, caught as they are in the impossible position of being apparently pretty impervious to coronavirus, while having their lives turned completely upside down by it.</p>\n<p>\n\tAll their rites of passage have been disrupted, from first days at school to last days, from exams to results. They’ve been robbed of key moments of bonding, either through celebration or commiseration, and at the same time have had no agency in what has happened to them. Their frustration and resentment, I imagine, must be limitless.</p>\n<p>\n\tNone of mine have been in the A-level fiasco year group, but two are about to go back to university, not really knowing what to expect, while the other one has just finished her course, in the most anti-climactic manner possible.</p>\n<p>\n\tOne day back in March she packed her things and came home, and four years of study came abruptly to an end. She completed her essays and exams online, was sent her results, and that was that. What should have been a bang was instead the tiniest of whimpers: no partying, no ball, no graduation to mark the achievement.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so, in the spirit of Covid DIY, we decide to do our own ceremony for her, right here in the garden.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt first we can’t decide how serious to be about it. On the one hand, this is an occasion we’re marking, and a milestone, and we’re proud of her and want to express that. But on the other hand, there is no escaping the strangeness, or the underlying sadness of the fact that the expected culmination of her years at university hasn’t happened, and that instead we are on the lawn, making it up as we go along.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we decide to be playful, which suits us all better. We’re not great ones for over-the-top displays of sentiment, or anything that veers into pomposity. I ask her if she wants me to invite any other friends or family but no, she wants it to be just the five of us, and I understand. Low key feels like the right key at the moment.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the end, I think the afternoon is a lot more fun than my own graduation 36 years ago, which was a weird day all round. My parents had driven up from Hertfordshire to Hull, fully expecting to meet Ben’s parents, as we’d now been living together for two years. When I greeted them with the news that he wasn’t attending the ceremony, and nor were his parents, they were speechless.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt was perhaps the first time they were shocked by Ben, though it certainly wouldn’t be the last. All I remember of the day now is being bored and hot in an uncomfortable outfit, and having to flatten my spiky hair under a mortar board.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe home-made event for our daughter is shorter and sweeter. It’s the middle of the heatwave, so I wear the dress I would have worn for the real thing, but with flip flops instead of heels. The three kids decide to raid the old dressing up box, emerging with silly wigs, and bunny ears, and the graduating one wears a Slytherin robe and a wizard’s hat.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe’ve set up four socially distanced dining chairs on the lawn, and a music stand at the front, from where Ben delivers a speech which is full of praise, but also fantastical lies about her childhood, which make them all hoot. He hands her a diploma he has printed off, which bears the status of her degree above a photo of her aged about five, grimacing at the camera with a face like Johnny Rotten singing “Pretty Vacant”.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe’ve ordered a mortar board online, so she wears it for 30 seconds and then tosses it high in the air for us to catch the moment in a photograph – her wide grin, her bare feet, the board sailing up above her head into the clear blue sky. And although the whole thing is hilarious, it ends up being sentimental and emotional, and I’m glad we did it.

Earlier this year, huge, out-of-control bushfires burned an area the size of South Korea, killed 33 people, left thousands homeless and killed or displaced three billion animals. It was one of the <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/environment/2020/01/what-we-lost-fire\">worst wildlife disasters in modern history</a>, said climate scientists, and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-51590080\">even more catastrophic</a> than their climate models had predicted.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut according to Tony Abbott, the climate science agreed upon by every credible scientific organisation in the world is “<a href=\"https://www.news.com.au/national/politics/tony-abbott-tells-climate-sceptics-forum-global-warming-may-be-good-and-climate-science-is-crap/news-story/dc42c5598f4c63e0e9689d6eacaf3b07\">absolute crap</a>”.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em><strong>[see also: <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/environment/2020/01/how-trade-deal-us-could-destroy-uk-s-climate-change-goals\">How a trade deal with the US could destroy the UK’s climate change goals</a>]</strong></em></p>\n<p>\n\tAdd to this his record of opposing equality for the LGBT+ community and of repellent misogyny (if you haven’t already seen it, I recommend <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiFAQkUutwQ\">watching</a> former Australian prime minister Julia Gillard’s brilliant takedown of Abbott’s attitude towards women), and it’s no wonder that his own constituents dumped him in Australia’s general election last year. Aptly, he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/may/18/australian-election-tony-abbott-loses-his-warringah-seat-to-zali-steggall\">beaten</a> by a female candidate who campaigned on the environment.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat should have been that. Yet somehow a politician, who is widely viewed by his fellow citizens as the worst prime minister Australia <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/opinion/is-tony-abbotts-regime-the-worst-federal-government-ever-20150804-giqtnx.html\">has ever had</a>, could have his career resurrected by being appointed a UK trade adviser. Not content with choosing a cabinet of none-of-the-talents, Boris Johnson is now trawling the world for failed politicians to represent our country in trade negotiations.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf it wasn’t so serious, it would be a joke.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is not only Abbott’s repellent views that are alarming. So is his record for blatant lying with little regard for the impact. On a visit to China in 2014, he told a press conference he was “very confident” that the black box of the Malaysian airliner MH370, which had disappeared on its way to Beijing, had been located. But the Australian Maritime Safety Authority and Abbott's own chief envoy later <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/21/tony-abbott-not-advised-mh370-search-had-found-black-box-senators-told\">confirmed</a> that no significant developments had been made in the search. The claim about the black box was untrue, and made only to inflate Abbott’s sense of self-importance. It gave false hope to the Chinese families waiting desperately for news of what had happened. The plane, tragically, has never been found.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe broke numerous promises in office – on health, education, taxation and funding for broadcasting. Even among his fellow politicians, he was known as someone who could not be trusted.</p>\n<p>\n\tSomehow, according to the International Trade Secretary Liz Truss, <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/article/liz-truss-says-questions-over-tony-abbotts-women-and-lgbt-record-irrelevant-as-former-australian-pm-lined-up-for-uk-trade-job?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Breakfast%2520Briefing%2520%25202808&amp;utm_content=Breakfast%2520Briefing%2520%25202808+CID_cae904b07f9261c7919b38987bee2357&amp;utm_source=Email%2520newsletters&amp;utm_term=Cabinet%2520minister%2520Liz%2520Truss%2520has%2520said%2520questions%2520over%2520former%2520Australian%2520prime%2520minister%2520Tony%2520Abbotts%2520controversial%2520comments%2520on%2520women%2520and%2520gay%2520people%2520are%2520irrelevant%2520to%2520any%2520job%2520he%2520will%2520do%2520for%2520the%2520UK%2520on%2520trade\">none of this matters</a>. Yet it should.</p>\n<p>\n\tOur departure from the EU has put trade deals at the top of the political agenda. With a no-deal Brexit looming on 31 December, ministers are desperate to sign deals with whoever they can to try to shore up the pretence that we will be much better off outside the EU.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em><strong>[see also: <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/brexit/2020/07/how-government-quietly-revealed-all-ways-which-brexit-will-make-our-lives\">How the government quietly revealed all the ways in which Brexit will make our lives worse</a>]</strong></em></p>\n<p>\n\tTony Abbott has openly boasted that he was able to negotiate trade deals because he wasn’t bothered by “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/aug/30/fresh-controversy-over-tony-abbotts-brexit-trade-role?CMP=share_btn_link\">peripheral issues</a>” such as labour and environmental standards. How does that square with the government’s insistence that it will maintain British standards on food, the environment and workers’ rights?</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen these rights are unprotected in law, they are vulnerable to be signed away in the pursuit of a quick deal. And with Abbott holding the pen, the risk is even greater.</p>\n<p>\n\tTrade deals are also a vital way of driving up environmental standards and ensuring compliance with the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate. Emmanuel Macron has already said <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/macron-paris-climate-accord-agreement-trade-deal-us-trump-un-nicaragua-a8554916.html\">France will not sign trade deals</a> with countries who don’t respect the agreement. The EU has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/19/austria-rejects-eu-mercosur-trade-deal-over-amazon-fires\">pressured</a> Brazil over its government’s failure to protect the Amazon from logging by putting on hold the huge EU-Mercosur trade deal.  </p>\n<p>\n\tBoris Johnson boasts of the UK being a climate leader, yet seems prepared to see our trade negotiations guided by someone who thinks the climate crisis is a good thing.</p>\n<p>\n\tAustralians decided several years ago that they didn’t want him representing their country. He shouldn’t represent ours either. </p>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n          Ryan Pierse / Getty images      \n\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Sep 2020 15:17:56 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1248875543.jpg?itok=K_qRU06V","linkMd5":"8a9e13d2d20f15e291f91565728ad779","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn53@2020_4/2020/09/05/09-02-11-378_f03273fd23543adf.webp","destWidth":790,"destHeight":350,"sourceBytes":26596,"destBytes":13018,"author":"Caroline Lucas","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-1248875543.jpg?itok=K_qRU06V":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn53@2020_4/2020/09/05/09-02-11-378_f03273fd23543adf.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528283},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"A long, long time ago, I thought I was brilliant in a crisis.

She was great, and earned the acronym BGE, for Best Girlfriend Ever, and the nickname the Beloved, which is, OK, fairly nauseating for you, but accurately expressed how I felt about her.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut that’s not the point. The point is what her best friend asked her as our relationship began. Her best friend, I should add, is not a flake but an award-winning author and academic, and what she asked was not, “What the hell are you doing even thinking of going out with him?” but, instead, “Is he any good in a crisis?” As my girlfriend had yet to see me in a crisis, she couldn’t answer honestly herself, so she put the question to me.</p>\n<p>\n\t“Are you good in a crisis?” she asked. “— wants to know.”</p>\n<p>\n\tI remember, at the time, being very pleased with this question. A lot easier to answer than “was he a faithful husband?” or “are his finances in order?” (To which the answers are, “no, but what you have to remember is…” and “are my what in what?”) I thought to myself: “Yeah, I’m <em>brilliant</em> in a crisis.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe typical crisis, in the mind of a man who spent a portion of his childhood years reading war comics, tends to involve foxholes and overwhelming odds; the sudden assumption of command; both grace and grit under pressure. Basically, anything better than bursting into tears counts as being “good in a crisis”, but there is some scope for varying degrees of heroism. Also, I liked to joke, I am very good in a crisis (from the ancient Greek <em>krísis</em>: choice, decision, judgement, and a few other shades of related nuance) as I have experienced so many of them.</p>\n<p>\n\tI am not so sure these days. Right now feels like a crisis, and I am not thinking so much of the ancient Greek roots of the word, as that moment in a submarine film where the enemy blows a bloody great hole in the submarine. There’s not a huge amount of deliberation going on, but there is an awful lot of screaming and panic, and even more seawater coming at you in powerful jets and generally disturbing one’s peace of mind.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere is also more than one crisis going on. There is our old friend, the environmental crisis. Any meaningful action on this is really beyond me, however sympathetic and alert I am to what is going on; but I do my bit. I put my empty bottles in the recycling bin, and believe me, that’s almost a full-time job.</p>\n<p>\n\tThen there is the whole Covid-19 thing, and we all know what we think about that .(I would like to think that there are very few, if any, <em>New Statesman</em> readers who think this is all some kind of government plot, or whatever loony conspiracy theories that MAGA hat-wearers and their kind sign up to.)</p>\n<p>\n\tIn this I bracket the economic disaster about to befall this country, or rather, the one that’s already befalling it; and to this we can add – sorry, I know this is meant to be the happy-go-lucky column that offsets the serious and informed stuff that the rest of this magazine is renowned for – the absolute shitstorm that will be a no-deal Brexit. If you want to get very depressed very quickly, then type “consequences of a no-deal Brexit” into your search engine and have a look at what comes up.</p>\n<p>\n\tHowever, there’s nothing I can do about that, except freak myself out, so in a way there’s no point in worrying about it. There are no <em>decisions</em> one can make about it.</p>\n<p>\n\tNo, I have my own very personal crisis going on at the moment, and as regular readers will know, that’s my imminent eviction. If I may return to a kind of martial metaphor, it is a bomb with a very clearly indicated timer on it, ticking down to 1 October. Now <em>that</em>’s a crisis.</p>\n<p>\n\tI have dealt with this in a way that might not impress the best friend of any putative romantic partner. I have looked at estate agents’ websites, and at <em>rightmove.com</em>, and even, God help me, Facebook Marketplace, and that’s about it. I have noted some of the properties, but on the whole Plan A has been to hide under the duvet and read Sherlock Holmes stories.</p>\n<p>\n\tPlan B has been to work on a plot for a sitcom with my old friend Razors, who these days actually is a Hollywood film and TV producer, so this isn’t as much of a deluded fantasy as it might be for most of us.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut still, it is not exactly the same as going round properties and wondering where I’ll be putting my chair when I get round to buying one. It’s not even wondering if I’ll be able to get away with sleeping on the floor because I can’t afford a bed. I used not to be like this, I dimly remember. But sorry, BGE’s best friend: my answer has changed.</p>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n          Getty      \n\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 14:42:32 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-2633366.jpg?itok=311p1oya","linkMd5":"a29df51cfb88fc24ffc84856652a6686","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn61@2020_3/2020/09/05/09-02-10-455_886333f112a0b200.webp","destWidth":790,"destHeight":350,"sourceBytes":52237,"destBytes":26976,"author":"Nicholas Lezard","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-2633366.jpg?itok=311p1oya":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn61@2020_3/2020/09/05/09-02-10-455_886333f112a0b200.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528295},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"Why Donald Trump isn’t Hitler – he poses a new threat","link":"https://www.newstatesman.com/2020/08/why-donald-trump-isn-t-hitler-he-poses-new-threat","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-field-subheadline field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"> <p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-fc19406d-7fff-0b50-dde8-62e20b26279b\">US liberals who compare the president with the Nazi leader are externalising responsibility for their country’s failings.</span></p>\n<div>\n\t </div>\n<p>\n\t </p>\n </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><noscript class=\"adaptive-image\" data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=\"300 768 1024\" data-adaptive-image-300-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;300&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-621959776.jpg?itok=zP4_4sNX&amp;amp;c=c0a701866c9f39c995076dab67f0d57f&quot; alt=&quot;A protestor in London holds a placard comparing US President Trump to Hitler&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-768-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;768&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-621959776.jpg?itok=zP4_4sNX&amp;amp;c=c0a701866c9f39c995076dab67f0d57f&quot; alt=&quot;A protestor in London holds a placard comparing US President Trump to Hitler&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-1024-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;1024&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-621959776.jpg?itok=zP4_4sNX&amp;amp;c=c0a701866c9f39c995076dab67f0d57f&quot; alt=&quot;A protestor in London holds a placard comparing US President Trump to Hitler&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-max-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;max&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-621959776.jpg?itok=zP4_4sNX&amp;amp;c=c0a701866c9f39c995076dab67f0d57f&quot; alt=&quot;A protestor in London holds a placard comparing US President Trump to Hitler&quot; /&gt;\"><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-621959776.jpg?itok=F1wbwEHT\" alt=\"A protestor in London holds a placard comparing US President Trump to Hitler\" /></noscript>\n</div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\" property=\"content:encoded\"> <p>\n\tIn Friedrich Meinecke’s <em>The German Catastrophe</em>, published in 1946, the German historian tried to reckon with the disaster that had befallen his country.</p>\n<p>\n\tMeinecke had some difficulty acknowledging that the Second World War was Germany’s own doing. He wrote that in the “actions and character” of the war’s instigator, Adolf Hitler, “there lay something foreign to us Germans”. Later, he added that the German people “were not fundamentally diseased with criminal sentiments but were only suffering for a while… from poison administered to [them]”.</p>\n<p>\n\tI was reminded of Meinecke’s book as I read accounts of the hair-raising Republican National Convention this past week. Chip Franklin, a talk show host, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chipfranklin/status/1297694745754566656\">tweeted</a> an open call for followers to, “Name something in common with the US now and early Nazi German[y], then pass it on.” (3,600 people weighed in.) Mikko Alanne, a screenwriter, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MikkoAlanne/status/1297756776440328193\">compared</a> the Republican platform of support for Donald Trump and little else to the Nazi oath of allegiance to Hitler. Several speakers at the conference itself were compared to fascists, including Donald Jr’s <a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2020/08/25/were-don-jr-and-kimberly-coked-up-maybe-not-but-its-all-part-of-the-fascist-tradition/\">girlfriend</a> Kimberly Guilfoyle.</p>\n<p>\n\tJust as Meinecke failed to fully acknowledge that Germany bore full responsibility for Hitler and his war, American liberals comparing Trump with the Führer is a way to externalise responsibility for the failings of a country they no longer recognise. After all, if Trump is like Hitler then he is the very definition of a foreign outsider.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe reality is that right-wing extremism mutates to fit the specificities of time and place. The United States in 2020 is not the same as Germany in 1933. Trump is dangerous, racist, and unquestionably anti-democratic. His supporters <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/08/26/trump-not-fascist/\">draw</a> from a legacy of brutal white supremacy that stretches back to the post-Reconstruction terror waged for close to a century on African-Americans in the Southern states. Trump himself traffics in unsubtle racism and glorifies and encourages violence. Still, he is not Hitler, and to draw parallels between the two men is not only to cheapen the memory of the victims of Nazism, but to critically misunderstand the threat Trump poses to the US and the world.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em><strong>[see also: <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/world/north-america/2020/08/democrats-need-plan-stop-donald-trump-stealing-election\">The Democrats need a plan to stop Donald Trump from stealing the election</a>]</strong></em></p>\n<p>\n\tErnst Fraenkel, the German jurist who emigrated to the US in 1939, argued that Nazi Germany comprised two distinct and parallel states: the “normative” and the “prerogative”. The normative state consisted of the legal remnants of the Weimar Republic: its constitution, the rule of law, up to a point, and the traditional civil service. The prerogative state, by contrast, consisted of the parallel institutions of the party, where the only law was the word of the Führer and the interests of the people, as interpreted by the party.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe two states were in constant struggle, a curious marriage that gave rise to what the historian of fascism Robert Paxton termed the regime’s “bizarre mixture of legalism and arbitrary violence”. The Nazi Party had its own foreign policy office, paramilitary force and party court. Early on, the normative state’s police force was put under party control; by 1938, the Foreign Office had been too. Simultaneously, party institutions such as the SS grew in power, acting mostly outside of the normative state’s legal regime.</p>\n<p>\n\tNone of this applies to Trump’s America. There are no parallel party structures competing with the normative state, even if Trump has elicited the loyalty of previously sceptical conservatives, an essential precondition of fascism taking root. There are no concentration camps for political opponents, though the internment of migrant families is a moral outrage. Some of his supporters have taken it upon themselves to act as extralegal paramilitaries, such as the suspect in the fatal shooting of two Black Lives Matter protesters this week in Kenosha, Wisconsin. They are dangerous – but they are different to the organised party militias that marauded around early 1930s Europe.</p>\n<p>\n\tFlippant, ahistorical comparisons with the 1930s misunderstand how rapidly Weimar Germany slid into totalitarianism. Dachau concentration camp opened in March 1933, two months after Hitler took power. Germany was declared a one-party state in July that year. The anti-Semitic Nuremberg Laws were passed in 1935. </p>\n<p>\n\tDavid Runciman, a political scientist, argues in his book <em>How Democracy Ends</em> that the material conditions that led to 1930s fascism no longer exist in wealthy societies: “Our societies are too different – too affluent, too elderly, too networked – and our collective historical knowledge of what went wrong then is too entrenched.” As Runciman writes, the danger is not that the US is like Nazi Germany. It is that US democracy is being eroded in new and unfamiliar ways that do not perfectly match the 1930s.</p>\n<p>\n\tAmerican democracy is being undermined. Trump officials used the White House and taxpayer funding during the RNC, defying both norms and laws, according to House Democrats who have opened an investigation. In his speech accepting the Republican nomination for president, Trump said to those Americans who disagree with him, “We’re here, and they’re not.” The taunt was not exactly a sign of a functioning government operating under the rule of law.</p>\n<p>\n\tMuch as Meinecke could not grasp that Hitler was a uniquely German phenomenon, Americans who compare Trump to Hitler fail to understand that Trump fits his time and place. If the collapse of American democracy comes, it will not parallel the 1933 Enabling Act. It will fit the American context, the American here and now – and it will be the responsibility of Americans.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em><strong>[see also: <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/international/places/2020/08/do-not-be-fooled-polling-donald-trump-could-very-well-win-second-term\">Do not be fooled by the polling.

He has written three spoken-word albums and five books, including “A Portable Paradise”, which won both the TS Eliot and Ondaatje Prizes.</em></p>\n<h3>\n\tWhat’s your earliest memory?</h3>\n<p>\n\tTaking an egg mayonnaise sandwich from my mum in a car, aged two. We were travelling from Scotland to London.</p>\n<h3>\n\tWho are your heroes?</h3>\n<p>\n\tI didn’t have a childhood hero: I didn’t pay attention to the world then. Now my hero is Bernardine Evaristo, who I’ve known for a long time. She encouraged me as a young poet and, quietly, has done so much for black writers.</p>\n<h3>\n\tWhat book last changed your thinking?</h3>\n<p>\n\t<em>Sum</em> by David Eagleman. It’s 40 vignettes about what could happen after you die. Sometimes they contradict each other.  It made me realise that death is just another part of the cycle.</p>\n<h3>\n\tWhich political figure do you look up to?</h3>\n<p>\n\tKwame Nkrumah, a former president of Ghana. He was an important leader in the pan-African movement. He talked to other states and did a lot of organisation for the independence of Ghana from England.</p>\n<h3>\n\tWhat would be your <em>Mastermind</em> specialist subject?</h3>\n<p>\n\tI have two: songs from <em>Sesame Street </em>and African-American poetry in the 1970s.</p>\n<h3>\n\tIn which time and place, other than your own, would you like to live?</h3>\n<p>\n\tLife for black people would not be better in any time in history. I’d choose the future – I’d love to watch my son grow to be a man.</p>\n<h3>\n\tWhat TV show could you not live without?</h3>\n<p>\n\t<em>Chef’s Table</em>. To me it is not just about cooking, but obsession, skill and training.</p>\n<h3>\n\tWho would paint your portrait?</h3>\n<p>\n\tChris Ofili, Lynette Yiadom-Boakye or Hurvin Anderson. They all deal with alternative ideals of utopia.</p>\n<h3>\n\tWhat’s your theme tune?</h3>\n<p>\n\tFela Kuti, “Zombie”. It’s a groove. I come in grooving.</p>\n<h3>\n\tWhat’s the best piece of advice you’ve ever received?</h3>\n<p>\n\t“You are enough: stop being ashamed.” In my life, shame has stopped me from doing so many things: Am I too fat? Am I too loud? Am I impinging on their time? I let go of that. I’m 52, but these new millennials have body positivity, they let go of Christian shame – I learn from them.</p>\n<h3>\n\tWhat’s currently bugging you?</h3>\n<p>\n\tThe invisibility of black British people in media, in politics, in management, in any decision-making context whatsoever. It will be a long journey. The fact that I’m thinking about it, that I’m telling you now: every little thing helps.</p>\n<h3>\n\tWhat single thing would make your life better?</h3>\n<p>\n\tBeing able to provide a house for my son to live in when he is an adult, so that he never has to pay a mortgage.</p>\n<h3>\n\tWhen were you happiest?</h3>\n<p>\n\tNow. I have a certain amount of freedom, kudos, space, recognition, health and lots of time with my family.</p>\n<h3>\n\tIn another life, what job might you have chosen?</h3>\n<p>\n\tI have absolutely no skill except writing poems.</p>\n<h3>\n\tAre we all doomed?</h3>\n<p>\n\tAbsolutely not. There is a lot of hope for the world, no matter how dark it seems. It’s time for everybody to pull up their boots and start fighting against evil. </p>\n<p>\n\t<em>“A Portable Paradise” by Roger Robinson is published by Peepal Tree Press.

In 1977 scientists fertilised an embryo outside the human body and successfully transferred it for the first time. Seven years later, the first birth following human embryo cryopreservation – where the embryo is frozen and stored – was reported. In 1985 the UK entered an age of gestational surrogacy and “wombs for rent”. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis was successfully tested in 1989, and today allows us to screen embryos for more than 600 genetic conditions. Now we have gene editing, the first hacked human beings, with the rogue Chinese scientist, He Jiankui, reportedly modifying a gene in twin girls in an attempt to make them resistant to HIV.</p>\n<p>\n\tTechnology has not only enabled new ways of having babies; it has transformed how we think about the old-fashioned method of procreation. This is because a technological society is not just one with ever-more sophisticated tools. It is also one that views everything as a form of making, including unassisted procreation (IVF accounts for around 2 per cent of all births in the UK).</p>\n<p>\n\tBreakthroughs in artificial reproduction have obscured the ways we treat natural procreation as if it were also a form of manufacturing. This means that while novelists have been obsessed with human cloning; while parliament has wrangled over mitochondrial replacement therapy; while academic journals publish articles about the desirability of designer babies; and while bioethics students are preoccupied with saviour siblings (a child that is born to provide an organ to a sibling who needs a transplant), we have missed the more urgent ethical question: how has technology redefined our perspective of having children?</p>\n<p>\n\tThis reality was brought home to me while teaching and writing about ethical controversies at the beginning of life. Embarrassed by my rudimentary grasp of biology, I consulted a medical textbook. What struck me as I read the chapter on reproduction was the nomenclature. Where I expected to find the word “foetus”, I instead encountered “products of conception” to describe the tissue derived from fertilisation.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe consequence of this encounter was a disconcerting defamiliarisation, and I started to see the phraseology everywhere. For example, at the beginning of <em>Far from the Tree</em> (2012), a riveting book about the experience of parenting a child who is radically different from oneself, Andrew Solomon writes, “When two people decide to have a baby, they engage in an act of production.” Or as Debora Spar puts it in <em>The Baby Business</em> (2006), “Baby-making is the oldest production known to humankind.”</p>\n<p>\n\tThe use of words such as “product” and “production” suggests we are dealing with commodification. The global fertility treatment market was worth almost $15bn in 2019, and the product in this market, the tradeable good, is ultimately the “newone” (my preferred and, I hope, ideologically unloaded term for the pre-natal human organism). </p>\n<p>\n\tProducts, however, do not exist strictly for the purposes of sale; it is possible to make things with no intention of selling them. What we are really talking about is broader than commodification – it is reification. </p>\n<p>\n\tDerived from the Latin for “thing” (<em>res</em>), “reification” was the term coined in 1923 by the Hungarian Marxist philosopher György Lukács to describe occasions when “a relation between people has taken on the character of a thing”. Members and associates of what came to be called the Frankfurt School, including Theodor Adorno, Max Horkheimer, Walter Benjamin and Herbert Marcuse, expanded the category to include our objectifying relationship with nature.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn their view human beings, by means of their technological interventions, had misconstrued the animate as the inanimate, the living earth as dead matter, reducing the world to a source of raw material for industrial projects – with deleterious social and environmental effects. </p>\n<p>\n\tEnthralled by the reifying language of reproduction, we imagine a product moving down an assembly line toward us, arriving in the light of day, governed by a strict logic of cause and effect.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe arrival of this manufactured thing is expected and predictable. If the conveyor belt is disturbed and one of the items it is carrying falls off and breaks, a replacement is easily produced. Products are repeatable, uniform and, therefore, disposable. </p>\n<p>\n\tYou don’t have to look far to see the ethical implications of reification on human parenting. Consider the evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins’s advice that a woman knowingly pregnant with a child with Down’s syndrome should “abort it and try again”. By the logic of mechanical reproduction, the newone is considered merely as a defective object that is replaceable. </p>\n<p>\n\t“Reification,” Adorno writes, “is a forgetting.” What is it about procreation that reification forgets? A couple decide they want children and try for a baby. Their act determines the coming forth of a newone. They play a causal role, obviously. That which comes to exist would not exist were it not for their action.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut what about what comes to exist? After all, there are limits on what parents can create. The newone will be what it is by virtue of its parents being what they are: that is, human. Reification thus forgets that procreation is the sharing of one’s being.</p>\n<p>\n\tReification forgets the gifted character of human existence, the fact that while parents certainly give life to their offspring, they are giving what they have been given: human life.</p>\n<p>\n\tYou don’t have to believe in a deity to feel the force of Molly Bloom’s humbling of human pretensions in James Joyce’s <em>Ulysses</em>: “As for them saying there’s no God I wouldn’t give a snap of my two fingers for all their learning why don’t they go and create something.” </p>\n<p>\n\t<em>James Mumford is the author of “Vexed: Ethics Beyond Political Tribes” (Bloomsbury)</em></p>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n          Getty      \n\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-image-caption field-type-text field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"> A donated human embryo seen through a microscope. </div></div></div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 15:04:08 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-73453554.jpg?itok=0AGYHhKW","linkMd5":"3fd22175027ff4ae8e97f006623175bd","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn16@2020_4/2020/09/05/09-02-09-029_74ebdfa980a68386.webp","destWidth":790,"destHeight":350,"sourceBytes":19523,"destBytes":8680,"author":"Anonymous","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/08/gettyimages-73453554.jpg?itok=0AGYHhKW":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn16@2020_4/2020/09/05/09-02-09-029_74ebdfa980a68386.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528320},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"First Thoughts: The commuting and coffee economy, a British Fox News and damning Starkey","link":"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2020/09/first-thoughts-commuting-and-coffee-economy-british-fox-news-and-damning-starkey","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-field-subheadline field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"> <p>\n\tLocal businesses in my suburb report sharply increased custom, after years of struggle.

Many people who work in city centres produce nothing at all. As little as half a century ago, one in five London jobs was in manufacturing. Now the proportion is barely one in 50. Instead, people provide “services”: they shuffle money around, buy and sell property, draft legal contracts and offer “consultancy”.</p>\n<p>\n\tMuch of this business can perfectly well be performed in suburban homes, where the average worker puts in an extra hour a day, according to one study. Employers save on expensive office space, employees on the hassle of commuting and the planet on absorbing a few carbon emissions. But people consume more when they travel to an office: they dress up, use perfume and make-up; buy sandwiches, coffee and bottled water; gather in wine bars, pubs and restaurants. For the sake of the purveyors of such goods and services, employees are commanded to return to their desks.</p>\n<p>\n\tI feel sorry for the waiters, office cleaners and shop assistants who will lose their jobs. But in Loughton, Essex, a commuter suburb where I live quietly and unfashionably, local businesses – from the butcher to the jeweller – report, after years of struggle, sharply increased custom. In such areas new jobs will emerge, often closer to workers’ homes.</p>\n<h4>\n\tExit Johnson</h4>\n<p>\n\tCould Boris Johnson, after winning the largest Tory majority since 1987, be overthrown within the next year? It seems improbable, but many good judges consider it likely, particularly since his near-death experience with coronavirus may have permanently weakened his health. Moreover, there’s a precedent. In May 1955, Anthony Eden, weeks after becoming premier, secured a handsome Tory majority with 49.7 per cent of the general election vote. By December, he was being accused of dither and weakness. The <em>Daily Telegraph</em>, as Tory then as now, called for “the smack of firm government” and in 1956 came the Suez calamity. By January 1957, despite his continuing popularity with the public, Eden was out, ostensibly on grounds of ill-health. He was succeeded by his chancellor, Harold Macmillan. Will history, with extraordinary exactness, repeat itself?</p>\n<h4>\n\tNews from the right</h4>\n<p>\n\tWith ministers doing everything they can to weaken the BBC – they are expected soon to decriminalise non-payment of the licence fee – the vultures are circling. Rupert Murdoch’s News UK, it is reported, plans a round-the-clock TV news channel, Murdoch having sold his stake in Sky News in 2018. More advanced are rival plans for GB News, led by Robbie Gibb, chief Downing Street spin doctor during Theresa May’s premiership.</p>\n<p>\n\tSources connected with both projects – which may, I suspect, eventually combine forces – deny any intention of imitating the US’s rabidly right-wing, pro-Trump Fox News. GB News, we are told, will be “truly impartial” and totally committed to “factual reporting”. One would be more confident of that if a former executive of Fox News weren’t running the Murdoch project and if a GB News co-founder hadn’t described the “woke, wet” BBC as “possibly the most biased propaganda machine in the world”.</p>\n<h4>\n\tA word to the unwise</h4>\n<p>\n\tTwo months after being shamed for saying that the slave trade was not genocide because “otherwise there wouldn’t be so many damn blacks” alive now, David Starkey re-emerges in the right-wing <em>Critic</em> magazine. A wise man would write about something different. Starkey is not a wise man. He intended no offence, he pleads: he was using “damn” as “a numerical intensifier” in the same way as he may describe a room as having “so many damn books”.</p>\n<p>\n\tI am reminded of what the Duke of Gloucester said when presented with the second volume of <em>The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire </em>by its author Edward Gibbon. “Another damned, thick, square book! Always scribble, scribble, scribble. Eh, Mr Gibbon!” Gibbon didn’t get the joke either. </p>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n          Getty      \n\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 12:24:25 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-458558342.jpg?itok=WaxeVYfk","linkMd5":"16654dff35c15b661737025575090d3f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn46@2020_5/2020/09/05/09-02-10-356_be300fff22c7b694.webp","destWidth":790,"destHeight":350,"sourceBytes":60455,"destBytes":37546,"author":"Peter Wilby","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/gettyimages-458558342.jpg?itok=WaxeVYfk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn46@2020_5/2020/09/05/09-02-10-356_be300fff22c7b694.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528293},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"What we should learn from the face mask U-turn","link":"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/health/2020/09/what-we-should-learn-face-mask-u-turn","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-field-subheadline field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"> <p>\n\tYou don’t need to be a scientist to understand that face masks work.

Getting into our car, I said to my fellow passengers, “We need to go, fast!” No, I had not just pulled off a diamond heist. I had bought a family pack of ice cream, and we needed to get it to a freezer. But masks add a certain charge to moments like this, a hint of mystery and subterfuge that I’m determined to enjoy, if only to compensate for having to wear these annoying, fiddly bits of fabric that make you feel like your head is in a bag.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe best part of wearing a mask, of course, is that it makes it less likely I will infect you if I am, unknowingly, a carrier of the virus. This is common sense, and you don’t need to be a scientist to understand it. In fact, it might be helpful if you’re not.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn early March, as it became clear that Covid-19 was a pandemic, news reports showed people in Asian countries, which were at an earlier stage of the outbreak, wearing masks. Many here wondered if we should be doing the same. Our government’s scientists were clear: we shouldn’t. The chief medical officer Chris Whitty said, “We do not advise that”, explaining that wearing a mask does not protect people from the virus. Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer, explained masks can pick up germs when left on surfaces and trap the virus close to your face. Jake Dunning, an epidemiologist at Public Health England, said there was “very little evidence of a widespread benefit” from wearing masks.</p>\n<p>\n\tBy July, mask-wearing was mandatory in enclosed public spaces. The government’s swift reversal on masks in schools on 26 August – when Boris Johnson said that face coverings should be worn in confined spaces in secondary schools in “hot spot” areas – was merely the capsule version of the slow-motion U-turn it has been performing since March. In terms of evidence, little has changed – no game-changing new study has been published. All that happened is we arrived slowly at a decision that countries which dealt with the virus most effectively arrived at quickly. Politicians must answer for this, ultimately, but perhaps public health authorities might learn lessons from it too.</p>\n<p>\n\tFirst of all, they should accept there are different kinds of evidence. Not all policies need to be supported by randomised controlled trials (in which participants are randomly split into groups and studied under different conditions), or indeed by hard data at all. The wearing of masks has always been part of the standard response to dealing with infected people. We don’t need a scientific trial to tell us that face coverings, however imperfectly made or used, are going to present airborne droplets with an additional obstacle in jumping from one person to another. In places such as Hong Kong and Taiwan, which were experienced in dealing with coronavirus epidemics, health officials strongly advised wearing masks. That is also a form of evidence.</p>\n<p>\n\tSome scientists can display a strange form of tunnel vision on questions like this. I recently found myself laughing at a sober article on the pros and cons of plastic visors. An epidemiologist who had been asked for comment expressed wariness, telling the reporter: “We don’t have the research to say they will offer protection for those around you.” A pro-visor scientist responded by explaining that, well, we kind of do: “Everything that flies out of your mouth is going forward, and it’s hitting a giant piece of plastic. It just physically can’t go through.” Yes, that should do it.</p>\n<p>\n\tSecond, in a crisis, policymakers should follow what we might call the “Nike principle”. If the cost of doing something is relatively low, and the cost of not doing it may be very high, <em>just do it</em>. Don’t wait for more evidence to come in, because by the time it does, it’s too late. Masks are easy to produce, cheap to buy and – hot breathing aside – not hugely inconvenient to wear. As the government guidance now recognises, they do not have to be PPE standard to do a job, which is why the idea that the public would put NHS staff at risk by acquiring masks was always dubious. Even if they slow transmission only a little, masks can have a large benefit at scale.</p>\n<p>\n\tThird: trust in the public. When Whitty and Harries explained that masks won’t stop people catching the virus, they must have known the point is to stop carriers from passing it on, but perhaps felt that was too complicated to explain. The authorities may also have been concerned that masks would create a false sense of security; that people would use them as a licence to start shaking hands again, and throw away the soap. Yes, some mask wearers might feel emboldened to take more risks, but masks also serve as a public reminder of the problem. By wearing a mask, I send a silent, visible message to those around me, and to myself, to be careful. It’s a useful virtue signal.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe scientists’ flawed attempts to second-guess the public mind are of a piece with the way that concerns over “behavioural fatigue” delayed lockdown. Perhaps experts in public-facing roles should recognise they simply aren’t very good at predicting how citizens will behave in a crisis and that, despite the best efforts of sociologists, there isn’t any hard evidence to turn to in that area. The best they can do, then, is be straight with the public, and hope that people react responsibly, which, most of the time, most of us will.</p>\n<p>\n\tThese days, when I’m on a train or in a shop, the majority of people around me are wearing a face covering. Some are not, however, and although I wish they would, I find it hard to blame them. After all, they probably heard the scientists saying, not long ago, that masks don’t do anyone any good.

The war over the economics of the Covid-19 crisis has been fought in metaphors. The future will be too. Which ones should we expect? Which ones should we hope for?</p>\n<p>\n\tThe three decades after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 were dominated by metaphors of frictionless movement: flows, scapes and webs. We were presented with a latticework of circuitry strewn across the Earth’s surface, constructed with great precision to line up consumer demand and supply.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis year another metaphor became inescapable: supply chains. And the chains were heavy. Fights over face masks, hand sanitiser, testing kits and rubber gloves revealed simmering conflicts over economic dependency, especially between the US and China.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe US-China trade wars of the past three years had pointed in two different directions: either towards a globalisation rebooted under the fist of American unilateralism, or a reduction in the volume of cross-border flows. Despite predictions from commentators and economists, the latter has not yet happened. As the <em>Wall Street Journal </em>pointed out, global trade contracted by 1 per cent in 2019 – but this still left it the second biggest year on record.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf the pandemic does provoke a reversal of globalisation, the metaphor primed to capture it is in the headlines of the financial press: “decoupling”. A battle cry for some, and a death knell for others, decoupling has come to mean the mutual disengagement of the US and Chinese economies and the  “reshoring” of supply chains and manufacturing capacity to the US.</p>\n<p>\n\tAlthough the chief proponent of decoupling in the US is Peter Navarro, an economic adviser to Donald Trump, the idea is also preached by the US trade representative Robert Lighthizer. They seem to have popular support. A recent survey showed that nearly 60 per cent of Americans believe that the US should “withdraw manufacturing from China”, and more than half of US businesses based in China thought that decoupling was possible (an increase of 22 per cent from October 2019).</p>\n<p>\n\tOne of the low-key accomplishments of the Trump administration has been shifting the cross-party consensus on China from business partner to economic threat. The Democratic candidate Joe Biden has joined the anti-China chorus.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf decoupling becomes the new horizon for political common sense, it is worth asking about the origins of the term. Decoupling was first used widely after the last global financial crisis in 2008. Observers felt that the rising industrial economies of China and India were showing remarkable resilience even amid a US slowdown. They speculated (incorrectly as it turned out) that these countries, like train carriages, had successfully “decoupled” from the locomotive of the US economy and may be running under their own power.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe decoupling of the early 2000s was the vision of a multipolar world originating from the Global South. That vision has now been co-opted by the Global North. But visions of autarky are far-fetched. As prominent political scientists put it in <em>Foreign Affairs</em> in December, “it’s too late to decouple” without intolerable levels of disruption to people’s lives. The left should not welcome the fantasy of decoupling. Neither climate change nor future pandemics stop at borders no matter how high the tariff wall, while any kind of effective internationalism would be undermined by a zero-sum logic of competition.</p>\n<p>\n\tInstead of seeing supply chains as bonds to be snapped, we should re-envision them as circuits of mutual dependence, testaments to our inability to opt out of the world. Rather than entertain the fantasy of self-sufficiency, which will only be used as a bludgeon to beat out better terms from competitors, we need to see supply chains as eco-socialists do, as strings of opportunities for transnational labour. Speaking at the World Social Forum in 2004, Marcos Arruda of the Brazilian Solidarity Economy Network offered his own metaphor: instead of supply chains, “solidarity chains”.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe last cycle of world history between 1989 and the present was based on sunny depictions of “unfettered markets” and win-win globalisation that flew in the face of the facts – and the facts won’t stop whatever narrative comes next. Without our own metaphors, we’ll be forced to live with the ones the nationalist right makes for us.</p>\n<h4>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/international/coronavirus/2020/08/world-come\"><em>Read the rest of the \"world to come\" series here</em></a></h4>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n          Getty      \n\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-image-caption field-type-text field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\">Immigrant farm workers have their temperatures checked at their accommodation in California, ahead of their shift on 28 April 2020</div></div></div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 13:36:44 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_730/public/Longreads_2020/08/gettyimages-1211310270.jpg?itok=aTrm4BpJ","linkMd5":"eecf11a51efdc48c0db672de8be82661","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn18@2020_6/2020/09/05/09-02-10-515_4d2bc55a9251b335.webp","destWidth":730,"destHeight":520,"sourceBytes":74576,"destBytes":46200,"author":"Quinn Slobodian","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_730/public/Longreads_2020/08/gettyimages-1211310270.jpg?itok=aTrm4BpJ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn18@2020_6/2020/09/05/09-02-10-515_4d2bc55a9251b335.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528312},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"Jane Birkin Q+A: “It’s a comfort to know ‘Je T’aime’ will be my funeral song”","link":"https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/qa/2020/08/jane-birkin-qa-it-s-comfort-know-je-t-aime-will-be-my-funeral-song","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-field-subheadline field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"> <p>\n\tThe actor talks Serge Gainsbourg, childhood nostalgia, and her mother's wisdom.</p>\n </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><noscript class=\"adaptive-image\" data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=\"300 768 1024\" data-adaptive-image-300-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;300&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/08/2020_35_jane_birkin_q_a.jpg?itok=pDivJ2lf&amp;amp;c=20e151d2aefa54d7f07eb0b65912cbc1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-768-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;768&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/08/2020_35_jane_birkin_q_a.jpg?itok=pDivJ2lf&amp;amp;c=20e151d2aefa54d7f07eb0b65912cbc1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-1024-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;1024&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/08/2020_35_jane_birkin_q_a.jpg?itok=pDivJ2lf&amp;amp;c=20e151d2aefa54d7f07eb0b65912cbc1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-max-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;max&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/08/2020_35_jane_birkin_q_a.jpg?itok=pDivJ2lf&amp;amp;c=20e151d2aefa54d7f07eb0b65912cbc1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\"><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/08/2020_35_jane_birkin_q_a.jpg?itok=hOtBkai4\" alt=\"\" /></noscript>\n</div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\" property=\"content:encoded\"> <p>\n\t<em>Jane Birkin was born in London in 1946 and is known for her work as an actor, singer, songwriter and model. She is also the namesake of the Hermès Birkin handbag.</em></p>\n<h3>\n\tWhat’s your earliest memory?</h3>\n<p>\n\tBeing on a farm that my father had, with my brother and sister, Andrew and Linda, in cornfields. We giggled about a cat that was being put down and my father was so angry. We were so ashamed afterwards. I would have been about five.</p>\n<h3>\n\tWho are your heroes?</h3>\n<p>\n\tMy father, who was a navigator in the war and a great mathematician, and my mother. As I get older, I try to resemble her in a way, but I know I can’t: she had a spirit of her generation, of the war. She was a Scarlett O’Hara. When I touch my forearm where the skin’s gone a bit, I think, oh yes, that’s how I used to love touching my mother’s forearm, that marshmallow feeling. I’m getting it too.</p>\n<h3>\n\tWhat book last changed your thinking?</h3>\n<p>\n\t<em>Anna Karenina</em>. I’ve always liked books that have everybody’s side to a story.</p>\n<h3>\n\tWhich political figure do you look up to?</h3>\n<p>\n\tJacinda Ardern. I have confidence in her. But I’m nervous now of having admiration for anybody, given that I stuck up for Aung San Suu Kyi for nearly 20 years. You’re never quite sure of how people will be when they gain power.</p>\n<h3>\n\tWhat would be your <em>Mastermind</em> specialist subject?</h3>\n<p>\n\tI don’t have one. Maybe a little on history.</p>\n<h3>\n\tIn which time and place, other than your own, would you like to live?</h3>\n<p>\n\tDuring the reign of Elizabeth I. I read too many of Antonia Fraser’s books. But it would be miserable if you were poor.</p>\n<h3>\n\tWhat TV show could you not live without?</h3>\n<p>\n\tI can live without them all, but I’d be sad to live without David Attenborough. He was the only bright spot in the shutdown.</p>\n<h3>\n\tWho would paint your portrait?</h3>\n<p>\n\tToulouse-Lautrec would be the most fascinating because of his portraits of women sitting on a sofa, idling about. He’s the most wonderful capturer of loneliness.</p>\n<h3>\n\tWhat’s your theme tune?</h3>\n<p>\n\t“Je T’aime… Moi Non Plus”, the song I sang with Serge Gainsbourg. It will stay with me. When I die, that’ll be the tune they play, as I go out feet first. It’s quite a comfort to know what it will be.</p>\n<h3>\n\tWhat’s the best piece of advice you’ve ever received?</h3>\n<p>\n\tI suppose it’s my mother: “Smile and the world smiles with you. Cry and you cry alone.” It was a form of delicacy, too, not to bore others with what is annoying you.</p>\n<h3>\n\tWhat’s currently bugging you?</h3>\n<p>\n\tThat my bulldog is going to be operated on soon. I’m frightened about her anaesthetic.</p>\n<h3>\n\tWhat single thing would make your life better?</h3>\n<p>\n\tThat my daughter Kate would come back. She died nearly seven years ago.</p>\n<h3>\n\tWhen were you happiest?</h3>\n<p>\n\tAs a child. Looking back, there’s a nostalgia that’s nearly a sickness. It seems that everything I do is in aid of trying to go back to my childhood again.</p>\n<h3>\n\tIn another life, what job might you have chosen?</h3>\n<p>\n\tI hope I would have been a social worker, but I’m not sure I would be good enough. I mean good in a religious way of speaking – kind enough, thoughtful enough.</p>\n<h3>\n\tAre we all doomed?</h3>\n<p>\n\tI saw your question and I thought: what am I meant to answer to that? I always think things are going to be all right. </p>\n<p>\n\t<em>“Munkey Diaries” by Jane Birkin is published by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson</em></p>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n          kristian hammerstad      \n\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 13:36:12 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/08/2020_35_jane_birkin_q_a.jpg?itok=hOtBkai4","linkMd5":"52e27c65941be9222a80de7fcaf2bfd0","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn100@2020_1/2020/09/05/09-02-11-359_4138505da4b12127.webp","destWidth":790,"destHeight":350,"sourceBytes":53749,"destBytes":33176,"author":"New Statesman","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/08/2020_35_jane_birkin_q_a.jpg?itok=hOtBkai4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn100@2020_1/2020/09/05/09-02-11-359_4138505da4b12127.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528313},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"Pointless host Richard Osman: “Loneliness is a form of lockdown”","link":"https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/tv-radio/2020/09/pointless-host-richard-osman-loneliness-form-lockdown","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-field-subheadline field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"> <p>\n\tThe quiz master on the future of TV and his debut novel <em>The Thursday Murder Club</em>.</p>\n </div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-field-node-image field-type-image field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><noscript class=\"adaptive-image\" data-adaptive-image-breakpoints=\"300 768 1024\" data-adaptive-image-300-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;300&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/09/richardosman012.jpg?itok=-rsgvv59&amp;amp;c=75cc758f0c2dc35da37b3e4ca2df1b9b&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-768-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;768&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/09/richardosman012.jpg?itok=-rsgvv59&amp;amp;c=75cc758f0c2dc35da37b3e4ca2df1b9b&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-1024-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;1024&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/09/richardosman012.jpg?itok=-rsgvv59&amp;amp;c=75cc758f0c2dc35da37b3e4ca2df1b9b&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\" data-adaptive-image-max-img=\"&lt;img class=&quot;adaptive-image&quot; data-adaptive-image-breakpoint=&quot;max&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/cropped_article_image/public/blogs_2020/09/richardosman012.jpg?itok=-rsgvv59&amp;amp;c=75cc758f0c2dc35da37b3e4ca2df1b9b&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\"><img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/richardosman012.jpg?itok=ZJ3d0m4E\" alt=\"\" /></noscript>\n</div></div></div><div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\" property=\"content:encoded\"> <p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-df4b7f29-7fff-f826-c5eb-9d6af3facb47\">If we get the politicians – and indeed the quiz shows – we deserve, what do TV quizzes tell us about our times? That change is coming and the end of the format is nigh, according to quiz master general, Richard Osman.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-df4b7f29-7fff-f826-c5eb-9d6af3facb47\">The </span><em>Pointless</em> co-host, 49, who was raised in West Sussex by a “strong and inspirational” single mother alongside his brother (Suede bassist Mat Osman), immersed himself in television from an early age. Following his graduation from Cambridge University, and much to his mother's disappointment, there was no question over his career plans: he wanted to move into television. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-df4b7f29-7fff-f826-c5eb-9d6af3facb47\">Having spent his thirties helping to create some of the world’s most popular quiz shows – </span><em>Who Wants to Be A Millionaire?</em>, <em>Big Brother</em> and <em>The Million Pound Drop</em> – Osman became a co-host in 2009 on <em>Pointless</em>. The BBC show asks contestants to provide answers to general knowledge questions that few others would think of. Hosted by Alexander Armstrong, with Osman as wing-man and chief fact-checker, the absurd but accessible programme has become a mainstay of British teatime television, especially during lockdown. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-df4b7f29-7fff-f826-c5eb-9d6af3facb47\">Eleven years after </span><em>Pointless’</em> launch, its popularity endures: it is the most-watched quiz show on the BBC. But its fact-master is on the move again. As he approaches his 50th birthday in November, Osman is pursuing the biggest prize in publishing – a number one best-seller. His evolution from producer to host, and now author, forms part of a carefully crafted career trajectory that is centred on the power of language. “Everything is words,” he said when we spoke. “For me, there is an absolute continuum between all of the jobs I've done. You have to do things authentically. I want to be writing novels for the next ten years so it was important to get it right. And I want as many people to read my writing as possible, because I’m really proud of it.” </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-df4b7f29-7fff-f826-c5eb-9d6af3facb47\">Osman’s debut novel, </span><em>The Thursday Murder Club</em>, is published today (3 September) – the so-called Super Thursday when <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/observations/2020/08/coming-avalanche-why-pandemic-has-shaken-book-world\">600 new titles will be released</a> in advance of Christmas. The novel was subject to a record-breaking, ten-way, seven-figure bidding war and the film rights have been acquired by Steven Spielberg. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<em><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-df4b7f29-7fff-f826-c5eb-9d6af3facb47\">The Thursday Murder Club</span></em> ostensibly offers readers a cosy crime novel centred on four geriatric protagonists in an upmarket residential home. But in Osman’s hands, the safe and familiar tropes of golden-age crime fiction are cleverly mobilised as the means by which to grapple with some of the most pressing contemporary concerns facing British society, from ageing and gentrification to the pervasive role of technology in our lives. Like Osman himself, <em>The Thursday Murder Club</em> uses a disarmingly friendly facade to disguise a steely, intelligent heart. </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-df4b7f29-7fff-f826-c5eb-9d6af3facb47\">As a celebrity synonymous with popular culture and the middle ground, Osman was drawn to the proven commercial success of crime fiction and its capacity to offer new ways of understanding society. In common with quiz shows, crime fiction can teach us much about the times in which we live. “</span><em>Pointless</em> is popular because it responds to the last decade of British history. It wasn’t designed as that, but when shows hit, it’s for a reason. <em>Pointless</em> is successful because it goes against what we are told about the times we are living in, that they are times of extremes, because most of Britain is not like that at all. Most of Britain is like the contestants you see on <em>Pointless.</em>” </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-df4b7f29-7fff-f826-c5eb-9d6af3facb47\">During lockdown, </span><em>Pointless</em> rose to new prominence because it was broadcast before the government’s daily 5pm coronavirus press conferences and the early evening news. Osman commented at the time that viewing figures for the show varied according to which politician was giving the briefing each day. “Some people spend their whole lives in lockdown, and a daily routine is incredibly important. Quiz shows are an important part of that. Loneliness is a form of lockdown. People love the interactivity of <em>Pointless</em> – they always say to me ‘oh we love it when you say, did you get that one at home?’ as if that’s an affectation, and it’s not. The whole way through every show I do I’m thinking about the audience at home because I want people to feel entertained and involved and happy. It’s a different kind of showmanship. I value success in the mainstream enormously.” </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-df4b7f29-7fff-f826-c5eb-9d6af3facb47\">Yet the future of the TV quiz show has never looked less certain in a post-pandemic world of declining real-time viewing and ubiquitous subscription services such as Netflix. As </span><em>Pointless</em> begins recording its 24th season in November (minus a studio audience to comply with social distancing), does Osman have the desire to kill off a national institution and continued ratings success?  </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-df4b7f29-7fff-f826-c5eb-9d6af3facb47\">“I host </span><em>Pointless</em> with Alexander Armstrong, so it’s like a big relationship decision. If we do leave <em>Pointless</em> in the future then you could replace us, but you’d have to be careful. Gavin Williamson would be a bad host of <em>Pointless</em>. But I guess you never know? Imagine 20 years ago saying, ‘I’ll tell you what the British public are going to love: a series where we put Michael Portillo on a train around the world.’ But like the heart knows what it wants, the public know what they like. And sometimes that’s Michael Portillo. The daytime TV audience is the most discerning audience because they are watching these shows every single day, and if they don’t like something they will just turn over and watch something else.’ </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-df4b7f29-7fff-f826-c5eb-9d6af3facb47\">The respect Osman holds for daytime television, and popular culture more generally, underpins all his creative endeavours. He continues to work as creative director at the production company Endemol Shine UK, “blue sky thinking” the next quiz show concept, as he puts it. But he fears the format has run its course on terrestrial television. “Entertainment TV will soon be gone forever, because the internet just does it better. It doesn’t do drama, or comedy, or long-form documentary better, but it does do entertainment better. People will always love quizzes, but in ten years’ time the stats suggest that TV quiz shows will be gone. </span><em>Pointless</em> could be one of the last quiz shows.” </p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-df4b7f29-7fff-f826-c5eb-9d6af3facb47\">This data-driven quantitative approach to facts and figures underpins Osman’s approach to popular culture. “The two exams that I use every single day of my life are A-level sociology and O-level statistics. Between those two things, that’s the filter through which I see everything. I absolutely love a poll. That’s why I love American politics and elections. That thing now of not trusting pollsters, it’s just mad. It might generate a truth you don’t want to hear, or that you struggle to interpret, but it’s as close to the truth as we are going to get.\" </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-df4b7f29-7fff-f826-c5eb-9d6af3facb47\">For a man with skills in stats and a proven understanding of what motivates people, could Osman’s next move be to parliament? “I am very happy to be small-p political. I think I would be a good adviser to a politician,” he replied. “But if someone wants to put me in the Lords as a crossbencher, I would do that in a heartbeat. Consider this a ‘come and get me plea’ to the Lords, like footballers make in the transfer window.” </span></p>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n          Christopher Owens      \n\n","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Sep 2020 11:40:06 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/richardosman012.jpg?itok=ZJ3d0m4E","linkMd5":"239342990f5c7d7225e87aeccd69a533","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn34@2020_4/2020/09/05/09-02-11-094_ce2ddebc73b1e1e8.webp","destWidth":790,"destHeight":350,"sourceBytes":36388,"destBytes":20418,"author":"Katy Shaw","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/nodeimage/public/blogs_2020/09/richardosman012.jpg?itok=ZJ3d0m4E":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn34@2020_4/2020/09/05/09-02-11-094_ce2ddebc73b1e1e8.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528284},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"The world to come: What should we value?

All other species have a natural environment and a natural way to sustain their form of life. While some animals have to build things to make their environment what it ought to be (as in the case of beavers building dams), there is no question of what they ought to build and how the species ought to make a living for itself. As in all environments, things can go wrong: a falling rock can break the dam, the water can become poisoned, a virus may spread. Yet when something goes wrong in the life of beavers, it is not because they have the wrong idea of how to organise their lives. Indeed, beavers cannot have the wrong idea of how they should live, since it is set by their nature.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor human beings, by contrast, the question of how we should lead our lives is always at issue, even if we try to forget that fact. We can discover the ideal conditions for other species by studying their natural way of life. But we cannot discover the best way for us to live simply by studying our present or past societies. We are the only animals – among the species known to us – who do not have a given place in nature. We have to make a home for ourselves. By the same token, we are liable to create conditions that are inimical to our own flourishing. Thus, when we are hit by a pandemic, we cannot treat it merely as a natural, unfortunate event that happens to befall our form of life. Like all animals, we can be infected for contingent reasons, but unlike other animals, we are answerable for the social causes and consequences. A pandemic inevitably raises the question of who we are as a species and how we organise our societies.</p>\n<p>\n\tOur ability to engage the question of who we are – and who we ought to be – is at the heart of what the young Karl Marx called our “species-being.” His notion is often dismissed as a naive appeal to a supposed human essence, but such a critique is misleading. The species-being of the human is precisely that we have no given essence. We are certainly subject to biological constraints – and we cannot even in principle transcend all such constraints – but for us there is always a question of how we are supposed to deal with these constraints.</p>\n<p>\n\tUnlike other species where every generation repeats the same life cycle, our species has a history that reflects different ways of reproducing our life-form: we have been masters and slaves, lords and serfs, capitalists and wage labourers. Moreover, our species-being entails that we can take a stand on the goodness or badness of the way we live. As Marx underlines in <em>Capital</em>, we are the only animal that can imagine a better world than the one we inhabit, and transform the conditions of our existence in light of commitments rather than mere instincts.</p>\n<p>\n\tRevolutionary change, however, cannot happen merely through imagination and ideas. It requires material transformation of how we sustain our lives through production and consumption. The existential questions of our lives – what we value – cannot be separated from the economic organisation of our society. We may profess that we value our lives, and the life of other species on the planet, as ends in themselves. But we live under an economic system where we cannot in practice treat one another as ends in ourselves. Rather, our economy requires that we treat one another as means (“human capital”) for the end of producing profit. What counts in a capitalist economy is that we are producing and consuming commodities, rather than that we are flourishing as human beings. Our well-being, and the well-being of the ecosystem of which we are a part, does not have any economic “value” in itself but only insofar as we can profit from it.</p>\n<p>\n\tTo grasp our responsibility for the environmental crisis, and have any chance of shaping a better world to come, Marx’s analysis of the problem of value is indispensable. As a result of the pandemic, many are now questioning our economic priorities and challenging production for profit. Yet these critiques are merely abstract and moralising unless they are linked to the objective conditions of our political economy. The generation of profit is our collective priority not because of what we have to think but because of what we have to do under capitalism. All of us depend for our survival on the profits that are accumulated in the form of capital and distributed as wealth. Without such “growth” in the economy there would be no wages, revenue, social welfare, or public goods, since the state itself is financed by the taxation of capital wealth.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs a consequence, production and delivery of vital goods was already built on sacrificing the lives of impoverished workers, even before the pandemic made that reality painfully clear. The generation of capital wealth has always depended and will always depend on those who have no choice but to be exploited as cheap labour, whether domestically or in poorer countries to which production is moved. If we are serious about learning from our historical experience, we will have to do more than applaud “essential workers” from our windows or change our priorities as individuals. Only the overcoming of capitalism through organised collective action can fulfil the commitment to a sustainable and flourishing world. We will be told that this is impossible, but the stakes could not be higher. The being of our species depends on it.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Martin Hägglund is the author of “This Life: Why Mortality Makes Us Free” (Profile)</em></p>\n<h4>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/international/coronavirus/2020/08/world-come\"><em>Read the rest of the \"world to come\" series here</em></a></h4>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED AND IS HERE AS A STARTING POINT FOR CUSTOMIZATION ONLY.\nSee http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_field/7 for details.\nAfter copying this file to your theme's folder and customizing it, remove this\nHTML comment.\n-->\n\n  \n          Getty      \n\n<div class=\"field field-name-field-image-caption field-type-text field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\">Tenants of Lissenden Gardens, north London, join in the weekly applause to thank NHS and key workers for their work throughout the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, on 9 April 2020</div></div></div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 14:08:42 +0000","feedId":14024,"bgimg":"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_730/public/Longreads_2020/08/gettyimages-1217878026.jpg?itok=bKbPe89c","linkMd5":"9b4214d6082e08328b7d53aec18bba9b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn44@2020_6/2020/09/05/09-02-40-669_31f7866bf80508a0.webp","destWidth":730,"destHeight":520,"sourceBytes":107017,"destBytes":71290,"author":"Anonymous","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_730/public/Longreads_2020/08/gettyimages-1217878026.jpg?itok=bKbPe89c":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn44@2020_6/2020/09/05/09-02-40-669_31f7866bf80508a0.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599296528311},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 17:02:08","title":"Federal government to states: Get ready to distribute vaccine before election","link":"https://www.newstatesman.com/2020/09/federal-government-states-get-ready-distribute-vaccine-election","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-field-subheadline field-type-text-long field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"> <p>\n\t<em>Emily Tamkin writes:</em></p>\n<p>\n\tThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/02/cdc-states-vaccine-distribution-407783\">sent</a> a letter to governors to prepare to distribute a vaccine by November 1.

The message in the text was that “activist lawyers” are delaying the removal of migrants who have no right to remain in the UK.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe animation was taken down last night (27 August), following a complaint. The Home Office’s Permanent Secretary said that video \"should not have been used on an official government channel”.</p>\n<p>\n\t<img alt=\"\" class=\"media-image attr__typeof__foaf:Image img__fid__113298 img__view_mode__media_large attr__format__media_large\" height=\"344\" src=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/egdtfuiwoaapv2l.jpg?itok=35ubV1wH\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" width=\"198\" /></p>\n<p>\n\tDo not expect this temporary setback to put off Priti Patel, though. The video was viewed more than 1.5 million times before it was taken down. Its point was made. And the <em>Telegraph</em> <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/08/27/priti-patel-abandons-deportation-flight-multiple-last-minute/\">reports</a> that the Home Secretary is planning on overhauling the UK’s asylum laws, which, it is claimed, are being “exploited by leftie Labour-supporting lawyers”.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat is an “activist lawyer”? It’s difficult to say. My best guess is that the Home Office is referring to those who act in cases against the government, particularly in cases involving asylum, refugee and human rights law. The very worst of them, it seems, are those who succeed on behalf of their clients, for example by gaining a temporary reprieve while a court examines the legality of a decision. Effectively representing a client's rights has become a political position. </p>\n<p>\n\tI suppose I am an activist lawyer, by the Home Office’s reckoning. I regularly act for clients against the government, and sometimes I am successful on behalf of my client. I thought I was simply doing a good job.</p>\n<p>\n\tI sometimes act in asylum cases. These are among the most difficult, personally, as more often than not the outcome means life or death for my client. A bad Home Office decision can lead to a person who needs protection from, for example, religious or political persecution in their home country, being sent back to face potential torture or death.</p>\n<p>\n\tI have been on both sides of this. For five years, earlier in my career, I regularly acted for government departments. I experienced first-hand the frustration of ministers when their department’s decisions were found to be unlawful by a court. But I can report that for the most part they acted responsibly, and followed legal advice. The Home Office was the exception. It was, and remains, a mess of a department where ministers are so deeply invested in the hostile politics of migration targets that they lose sight of their duty to uphold international rules and laws, set by our parliament, which require refugees to be given sanctuary.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em><strong>[see also: <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/coronavirus/2020/05/coronavirus-makes-immigration-bill-look-even-worse-idea\">Coronavirus makes the Immigration Bill look like an even worse idea</a>]</strong></em></p>\n<p>\n\tSo who, or what, is the real target here? Despite the rhetoric, I would suggest it’s not lawyers; it’s laws, and the rule of law.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor the most part, this is nothing new. A home secretary with an antipathy towards the international and local laws that constrain their actions is not unusual. At the Conservative Party conference nine years ago, Theresa May told the audience that a cat had prevented a man being deported. She said she wasn’t making it up, but it was later shown that <a data-auth=\"NotApplicable\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2011/oct/04/theresa-may-wrong-cat-deportation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">she was</a>.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat speech wasn’t about cats, just as the current farrago isn’t about lawyers. May was opposed to human rights laws, which were holding back the untrammelled deportation policies that would have made life easier for her, but not for the thousands who would have been unfairly and dangerously swept up in the \"hostile environment\" policy – a policy which has, in the wake of the Windrush scandal, been entirely discredited.</p>\n<p>\n\tAfter “catgate”, illiberal voices in various Conservative-led governments tried desperately to water down the system of human rights laws and judicial review, a system that effectively holds government to account and scrutinises bad decisions by the executive.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut again and again they have been defeated, often by members of the public such as the <a data-auth=\"NotApplicable\" href=\"https://www.savetheact.uk/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Hillsborough families</a>, who spoke out about how human rights laws had helped them achieve justice, or by <a data-auth=\"NotApplicable\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/26/dominic-grieve-no-reason-to-think-prime-minister-would-fire-me\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">liberal Tories</a> who pointed out that human rights laws were liberal ideas developed not by “left-wing campaigners” but by dyed-in-the-wool Conservatives such as <a data-auth=\"NotApplicable\" href=\"https://eachother.org.uk/david-maxwell-fyfe/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">David Maxwell-Fyfe</a> and <a data-auth=\"NotApplicable\" href=\"https://eachother.org.uk/churchills-fight-human-rights/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Winston Churchill</a>.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn recent years, however, the focus has shifted. In 2013, Chris Grayling described <a data-auth=\"NotApplicable\" href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2413135/CHRIS-GRAYLING-Judicial-review-promotional-tool-Left-wing-campaigners.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">judicial review</a> as a promotional tool for left-wing campaigners. Brexit put the campaign to weaken accountability laws on hold. But the successful channelling of anger against “elites” has enabled the campaign to personify the target of the argument in favour of making ministers even more powerful (for that is the effect of reducing legal protections), and to move the debate away from the countless individuals whose lives have been improved in areas as diverse as <a data-auth=\"NotApplicable\" href=\"https://eachother.org.uk/the-human-rights-acts-legacy-is-a-rights-focused-inquest-system/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">inquests</a>, <a data-auth=\"NotApplicable\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80wYfyXauJI\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">social security benefits</a>, <a data-auth=\"NotApplicable\" href=\"https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/its-reassuring-to-know-the-courts-get-religious-rights/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">religious rights</a> and <a data-auth=\"NotApplicable\" href=\"https://eachother.org.uk/tomorrow-world-press-freedom-day-human-rights-protect-press-freedom/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">freedom of the press</a>.</p>\n<p>\n\tLate last year, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-49810261\">the Supreme Court </a>ruled that the government had unlawfully attempted to shut down parliament for six weeks. It is difficult to imagine a more straightforward case of executive overreach and the importance of the courts in protecting democratic norms. But that case motivated this government to press forward with its plans to “<a data-auth=\"NotApplicable\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-launches-independent-panel-to-look-at-judicial-review\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">reform</a>” (ie “weaken”) judicial review.</p>\n<p>\n\t<em><strong>[see also: <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/elections/2019/09/proroguing-and-prerogative-have-courts-just-upended-our-constitution\">Proroguing and prerogative: have the courts just upended our constitution?</a>]</strong></em></p>\n<p>\n\tThis time, it has learned from past mistakes: keep the focus on lawyers, not the people they represent or the laws set by parliament that the courts apply. This has the added bonus of undermining an articulate and competent Leader of the Opposition, who also happens to be a former human rights lawyer.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe <em>Times</em> reports this morning an anonymous (but now familiar-sounding) “government source” railing against a “bunch of particularly loudmouthed lawyers and barristers who spend more time on social media than representing their clients” (presumably, someone would need to spend a lot of time on social media to know this). We will hear more of the same in the coming weeks and months. Lawyers will defend themselves, as they must. But we shouldn’t allow the government to frame this important debate. Because this is not about me as a lawyer, doing a job for my client, but about all of us, as citizens in a democracy that respects the rule of law.</p>\n </div></div></div><!--\nTHIS FILE IS NOT USED
