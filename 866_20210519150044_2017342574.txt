And as expected, the screen and the processor are mind-blowingly good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&#38;url=https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor&#38;xcust=1-1-346943-0-0-0&#38;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dieter Bohn at the Verge</a> calls the iPad Pro&#8217;s Liquid Retina XDR display &#8220;the best thing for watching movies that isn&#8217;t a high-end television&#8221; and &#8220;functionally equivalent to a high-end OLED TV.&#8221; It&#8217;s so good, he says, that you won&#8217;t even notice it at first: &#8220;The magic kicks in when you are viewing videos or photos in full-screen. When you do that, the iPad Pro kicks into a different HDR mode (or in Apple&#8217;s parlance, XDR, for &#8220;Extreme Dynamic Range&#8221;) that really is stunning.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&#38;url=https://www.macstories.net/stories/ipad-pro-2021-review/#liquid-retina-xdr-display&#38;xcust=1-1-346943-0-0-0&#38;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Federico Viticci writing at MacStories</a> agrees. He concludes that &#8220;from a mere hardware standpoint, the new iPad Pro is everything I could have possibly dreamed of this year,&#8221; with &#8220;the best display I&#8217;ve ever seen in a portable computer.&#8221; He had a similar eureka moment as Bohn when playing HDR videos: &#8220;if you&#8217;re a videographer or photographer, you&#8217;ll instantly see and understand the impact of wider color reproduction; if you&#8217;re a &#8220;regular&#8221; iPad user who doesn&#8217;t work in those fields, you won&#8217;t see the effects of the XDR display in the UI of Apple Mail or Files, but you&#8217;ll &#8220;get it&#8221;, just like I did, as soon as you watch HDR content, play a game, or browse your photo library.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"product-widget__title\" id=\"12-9-inch-ipad-pro-2021\">12.9-inch iPad Pro (2021)</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-outer-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__image-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img class=\"product-widget__image\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ipad-pro-12-2021.jpg?quality=50&#38;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"12.9-inch iPad Pro (2021)\"></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div classname=\"product-widget__information\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>At <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&#38;url=https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/19/apple-12point9-inch-ipad-pro-2021-review-the-best-ipad-you-can-buy.html&#38;xcust=1-1-346943-0-0-0&#38;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">CNBC, Todd Haselton</a> found the 12.9-inch iPad Pro&#8217;s display &#8220;looked brighter outside in direct sunlight than my 2018 11-inch iPad Pro,&#8221; while <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&#38;url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/2021-ipad-pro-review-more-of-the-same-but-way-way-faster-thanks-to-m1/&#38;xcust=1-1-346943-0-0-0&#38;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ars Technica&#8217;s Samuel Axon</a> found &#8220;the difference in contrast and black levels (between the new iPad Pro&#8217;s display and the old one) is, no pun intended, night and day.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of the reviews we read praised the iPad&#8217;s speedy M1 processor but also had a common refrain: Why?

I love the iPad, but Apple&#8217;s hardware continues to move at a pace that its software can&#8217;t keep up with. The iPad Pro is ready.
