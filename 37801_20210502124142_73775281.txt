As the full social and economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic rolled around the world, ICIJ’s reporting partners were forced to divert resources away from the investigation (or, in some cases, make drastic budget cuts to ensure survival), and the team of international journalists working on this complex, cross-border financial investigation were finding borders closed and travel near impossible.</p> \n<p>But ICIJ’s model of collaborative journalism was uniquely placed to weather this storm. Journalists were able to turn to the network and get on-the-ground help from each other in chasing down leads, sourcing footage, and recording key interviews. The publication of the FinCEN Files investigation in September 2020 was both a logistical feat of incredibly dogged reporting, as well as a testament to the power of journalists working as a team on groundbreaking global stories.</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p><em><a href=\"https://media.icij.org/uploads/2021/04/ICIJ_2020_Annual_Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Read ICIJ’s 2020 Annual Report.</a></em></p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>The success and impact of these two investigations also capped a banner year for ICIJ’s storytelling, despite the many challenges to travel, fundraising, network building and other key business operations wrought by COVID-19. ICIJ’s <a href=\"https://media.icij.org/uploads/2021/04/ICIJ_2020_Annual_Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2020 annual report</a>, published this week, reflects the innovative ways ICIJ’s team adapted to this unprecedented year and reiterates the importance of harnessing technology to empower investigative reporting around the world.</p> \n<div class=\"row banner-custom-1\" style=\"background-image:url(https://media.icij.org/uploads/2019/04/panama-papers-news-headlines-pp3.jpg)\"> \n <div class=\"col-12\"> \n  <div class=\"row\"> \n   <div class=\"col-4 col-md-3\"> \n    <h2 class=\"title-left\">5</h2> \n   </div> \n   <div class=\"pl-0 col-8 col-md-9 align-self-center\"> \n    <div class=\"line-1\">\n     Five Years On\n    </div> \n    <div class=\"line-2\">\n     The Panama Papers\n    </div> \n   </div> \n  </div> \n  <div class=\"row justify-content-center mb-2\"> \n   <div class=\"col-10 mb-3 col-md-6 banner-custom-text\">\n     Support ICIJ today and help us find new global investigations that shake the world \n   </div> \n   <div class=\"col-6 col-md-3 align-self-center\"> \n    <a href=\"https://checkout.fundjournalism.org/memberform?org_id=icij&amp;installmentPeriod=once&amp;theme=fiveyear&amp;campaign=7015G000000Tbwh\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"btn-banner-link\" rel=\"noopener\">Join ICIJ Insiders</a> \n   </div> \n  </div> \n </div> \n</div> \n<p>In his introduction to the annual report, ICIJ Director Gerard Ryle has showcased the incredible impact of both Luanda Leaks and the FinCEN Files as evidence that this work is more necessary — and in more need of support — than ever before.</p> \n<p>“A few things are clear from these stories. The first, based on enthusiastic and encouraging responses from our readers, is that regular people don’t like corruption,” Ryle said.</p> \n<p>“The second is that once presented with clear evidence of corruption, authorities are prepared to act.</p> \n<p>“The third is that ICIJ’s model of ‘radical sharing’ and collaboration allows journalists to marshal their individual capabilities to track down and expose high-level corruption — and advance the growing demand for accountability coming from people in every corner of the world.”</p> \n<div class=\"row inline-shortcode-wrap
