The B2C market is where the question of number of apps is most often asked. And we have many thousands*.</p>\n<p>B2B (Business to Business) and B2G (Business to Governments) are markets that are much less publicly facing, but only require two or three apps beyond the core basics. These few apps are easily tested and can be verified to work for large-scale deployments.</p>\n<h2>Native or External</h2>\n<p>Native applications are defined as a local application written and integrated into the operating system PureOS, these are what we also call &#8220;pixel perfect&#8221; applications to showcase that they are curated applications for the best user experience. There are two approaches to native applications; Porting, direct port of the application from a different platform; and Adapting, modifying a desktop application to make it adaptive (usable on a small screen).</p>\n<p>External applications are websites that can be rendered in an isolated application, emulated application from Android, or even an application that is served from the Internet (cloud).</p>\n<p>As you can quickly see, the number of applications are ever increasing from Native as soon as you include Web Apps from external sources.</p>\n<h2>Mobile or Desktop</h2>\n<p>One area where Purism&#8217;s vision and innovation far outpaces Apple or Google is around true convergence. With the Librem 5 phone you are running a full-blown desktop computer in a mobile form factor. If you plug it into a keyboard, mouse, and monitor you will have PureOS and the many thousands of applications available as you would from any desktop computer. This means that we are starting with many thousands of applications that &#8220;just work&#8221; as a desktop application; where to be usable from a finger on touch-screen in a mobile form factor separated from the monitor, is just adapting it using Purism&#8217;s libhandy library.</p>\n<h2>Number of Apps</h2>\n<p>Even though we have many thousands of applications* available today within PureOS, we recognize that to increase in the B2C market it takes consistent effort and perseverance to transition that asterisk away from the answer. The asterisk can be removed when the applications the majority <b>needs</b> are available natively or as optimized web apps, while we march on toward applications the majority <b>wants</b>.</p>\n<h2>Fund Your App</h2>\n<p>To bring awareness to this we are launching a <a href=\"https://puri.sm/fund-your-app/\">Fund Your App</a> page to allow people to vote on applications they desire with their wallet, so we can fund greater development directly advancing on a regular release schedule with an ever increasing number of applications.</p>\n<p>Fund Your App is available for app selection and donation from <a href=\"https://puri.sm/fund-your-app/\">https://puri.sm/fund-your-app/</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://puri.sm/posts/fund-your-app-to-vote-for-the-future/\">Fund Your App to Vote for the Future</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://puri.sm/\">Purism</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 08 Oct 2020 15:28:58 +0000","feedId":18220,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"818b7e233313f1c89ae45ecc487936b3","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Purism","publishedOrCreatedDate":1602257592710}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-10-09 23:33:12","updatedTime":"2020-10-09 23:33:12","feedId":18220,"fetchDate":"Fri, 09 Oct 2020 15:33:12 +0000","fetchMs":2260,"handleMs":722,"totalMs":299077,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":454,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"d29e7b16565154882990b6eed02f7029","hostName":"us-012*","requestId":"01557314beec4d15a3039a9d1ef829d5_18220","contentType":"text/xml","totalBytes":0,"bgimgsTotal":0,"bgimgsGithubTotal":0,"articlesImgsTotal":0,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":0,"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 02:16:59","updatedTime":"2020-09-07 02:50:00","id":18220,"name":"Purism","url":"https://puri.sm/feed/","subscriber":182,"website":null,"icon":"https://puri.sm/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/cropped-purism-logo-rectangle-1-32x32.png","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx63/cdn89@2020_2/2020/09/06/18-49-55-434_c2d7a6cdd8a20bba.png","description":"High-quality laptops that protect your freedom and privacy","weekly":null,"link":null},"noPictureArticleList":[],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1602257293639,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":298350,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":722,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":0,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"},{"spend":0,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"}]},"extra5":0,"extra6":0,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[],"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}}
