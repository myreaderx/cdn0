Hold your camera well</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of blur in the photos that I see is a direct result of camera shake (i.e., the movement of your camera for that split second when your shutter is open). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the best way to tackle camera shake is to use a tripod (see below!), there are many times when using one is impractical, and you&#8217;ll need to shoot while holding your camera. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve written a tutorial previously on <a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-hold-a-digital-camera/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">how to hold a digital camera</a>, but in brief:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use both hands, keep the camera close to your body, and support yourself with a wall, tree, or some other solid object.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 data-section id=\"use-a-tripod\">2. Use a tripod</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Regular readers of this site will have seen our articles on <a aria-label=\"tripods (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/tripod-buying-guide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">tripods</a> and know that we&#8217;re a big fan of using tripods as a way to reduce (and even eliminate) camera shake. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While tripods are not always practical, the result you&#8217;ll get when you do go to the effort of hauling one around can be well worth it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><b>Related</b> <strong>Article</strong>: <a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/a-beginners-guide-to-tripods/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">A Beginner&#8217;s Guide to Tripods</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 data-section id=\"select-a-fast-shutter-speed\">3. Select a fast shutter speed</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps one of the first things to think about in your quest for sharp images is the <a aria-label=\"shutter speed (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/shutter-speed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">shutter speed</a> that you select.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, the faster your shutter speed, the less impact camera shake will have, and the more you&#8217;ll freeze movement in your shots. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result, you reduce the likelihood of two of the main types of blur in one go (<em>subject movement</em> and <em>camera movement</em>). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But how do you pick the right shutter speed? I recommend the <a aria-label=\"&#34;rule&#34; for handholding (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/back-to-basics-what-is-the-reciprocal-rule-in-photography/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">&#8220;rule&#8221; for handholding</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><i>Choose a shutter speed with a denominator that is larger than the focal length of the lens. </i></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>If you have a lens that is 50mm in length, don&#8217;t shoot any slower than 1/60th of a second</li><li>If you have a lens with a 100mm focal length, shoot at 1/125th of a second or faster</li><li>If you are shooting with a 200mm lens, shoot at 1/250th of a second or faster</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep in mind that the faster your shutter speed is, the larger you&#8217;ll need to make your aperture to compensate (see the next section!). And this will mean you have a smaller depth of field, which makes focusing more of a challenge.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 data-section id=\"choose-a-narrower-aperture\">4. Choose a narrower aperture</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a aria-label=\"Aperture (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/aperture/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Aperture</a> impacts the <a aria-label=\"depth of field (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/understanding-depth-field-beginners/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">depth of field</a> (the zone that is in focus) of your images. Decreasing your aperture size (which means increasing the f-number) will increase the depth of field &#8211; meaning that the zone in focus will include both close and distant objects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do the opposite (by moving to f/4, for example), and the foreground and background of your images will be more out of focus. Therefore, you&#8217;ll need to be exact with your lens focusing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep in mind that the smaller your aperture, the longer your shutter speed will need to be &#8211; which makes moving subjects more difficult to keep sharp.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 data-section id=\"keep-your-iso-as-low-as-possible\">5. Keep your ISO as low as possible</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The third element of the exposure triangle is <a aria-label=\"ISO (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/iso-settings/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\"><em>ISO</em></a>, which has a direct impact on the noisiness of your shots. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Choose a larger ISO, and you&#8217;ll be able to use a faster shutter speed and a smaller aperture (which, as we&#8217;ve seen, helps with sharpness). On the other hand, this will increase the noise in your shots. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on your camera (and how much you plan to enlarge your images), you can probably get away with using an ISO of up to 400 (or even 800 or 1600 on some cameras) without too much noise. But for pin sharp images, keep the ISO as low as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 data-section id=\"if-you-have-image-stabilization-use-it\">6. If you have image stabilization, use it</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Many cameras and lenses are now being released with different forms of image stabilization (IS). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Image stabilization won&#8217;t eliminate camera shake, but can definitely help reduce its impact. I find that using IS lenses gives me an extra two or three stops (i.e., I can drop the shutter speed by around two to three stops) when handholding my camera. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep in mind that IS helps with camera movement but not subject movement &#8211; so it&#8217;s not helpful in low-light action scenarios. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, <a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/image-stabilization-on-tripods/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"ek-link\">don&#8217;t use image stabilization when you mount your camera to a tripod</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 data-section id=\"nail-focus-as-often-as-possible\">7. Nail focus as often as possible</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps the most obvious technique to work on when aiming for sharp images is focusing. Most of us use our camera&#8217;s autofocusing, and this works well &#8211; but don&#8217;t assume that your camera will always get it right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure you check what part of the image is in focus before hitting the shutter. And if the focusing isn&#8217;t right, then try again or switch to <a aria-label=\"manual focus (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/dont-afraid-manual-focus/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">manual focus</a>. This is particularly important if you&#8217;re shooting with a large aperture (small depth of field), where even the slightest focusing error can result in your subject being noticeably out of focus.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/take-sharp-images-11.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"taking sharp photos ibis\" class=\"wp-image-199334\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/take-sharp-images-11.jpg?w=1500&#38;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/take-sharp-images-11.jpg?resize=300%2C200&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/take-sharp-images-11.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/take-sharp-images-11.jpg?resize=768%2C512&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/take-sharp-images-11.jpg?resize=90%2C60&#38;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/take-sharp-images-11.jpg?resize=717%2C478&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Most modern cameras have a range of focus modes you can shoot in, and choosing the right focusing mode is very important. <a aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/choosing-a-focus-mode/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">You can learn how to do that <strong>here</strong></a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 data-section id=\"make-sure-your-lenses-are-sharp\">8. Make sure your lenses are sharp</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This one is for DSLR and mirrorless owners:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have the budget for it, invest in good-quality lenses, because this can have a major impact upon the sharpness of your images.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, shortly after buying my first DSLR, I was in the market for an everyday zoom lens that would give me the ability to have both wide and telephoto zoom capabilities. I bought a <a aria-label=\"Canon EF 28-135mm lens (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://geni.us/Canon28-135\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Canon EF 28-135mm lens</a>. It was a good lens (and reasonably priced), but it wasn&#8217;t as sharp as some of my other lenses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few months later, I borrowed a <a aria-label=\"Canon EF 24-105mm &#34;L&#34; lens (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://geni.us/Canon24-105\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" class=\"ek-link\">Canon EF 24-105mm &#8220;L&#8221; lens</a> (&#8220;L&#8221; is Canon&#8217;s professional series of lenses) from a friend, and I was amazed by the difference in sharpness between the lenses. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the first lens was good for what I paid for it, I ended up going for an upgrade. The new lens is now almost permanently attached to my camera.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 data-section id=\"get-your-eyes-checked\">9. Get your eyes checked</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Since I was young, I&#8217;ve worn glasses. But in recent years, I&#8217;ve been a little slack in getting my eyes checked. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently, I got them tested for the first time in a number of years, and I was surprised to find that they&#8217;d deteriorated significantly. Getting new glasses improved a number of areas of my life, one of which was my photography. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also connected to this is checking the <em>diopter</em> on your camera, if it has one. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What&#8217;s a diopter? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s usually a little wheel positioned next to your viewfinder that lets you tweak the sharpness of the image you see when shooting. The diopter is particularly useful for people with poor eyesight, because you can use it to compensate for your vision (so you won&#8217;t have to remember to wear glasses when out shooting!).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 data-section id=\"clean-your-equipment\">10. Clean your equipment</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently, my wife and I went on a window-cleaning frenzy at our place. Over the previous months, the grime on our windows had gradually built up without us really noticing it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But when we did clean the windows, we were amazed at how much more light got through and how much better the view outside was!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same can be true for your lens. <a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/clean-care-camera-gear/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"Keep it clean (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Keep it clean</a>, and you&#8217;ll eliminate the smudges, dust, and grime that can impact your shots. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, a clean image sensor is a wonderful thing if you have a DSLR or a mirrorless camera, as getting dust on it can produce noticeable blotches in your final images.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/take-sharp-images-10.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"taking sharp photos little blue heron\" class=\"wp-image-199332\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/take-sharp-images-10.jpg?w=1500&#38;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/take-sharp-images-10.jpg?resize=300%2C200&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/take-sharp-images-10.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/take-sharp-images-10.jpg?resize=768%2C512&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/take-sharp-images-10.jpg?resize=90%2C60&#38;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/take-sharp-images-10.jpg?resize=717%2C478&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 data-section id=\"use-your-lenss-aperture-sweet-spot\">11. Use your lens&#8217;s aperture sweet spot</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Lenses have some spots in their aperture ranges that are especially sharp.

If you wanted to give the picture a green tint, you could simply drape a sheet of green cellophane over it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s <em>exactly </em>how adjustment layers work in Photoshop: They let you change the visual properties of your image without destroying the underlying file. You can add as many adjustment layers as you want and use them to change things like <a aria-label=\"white balance (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/introduction-to-white-balance/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">white balance</a>, <a aria-label=\"exposure (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/learning-exposure-in-digital-photography/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">exposure</a>, <a aria-label=\"hue/saturation (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-use-the-hue-saturation-adjustment-in-photoshop-a-video-tutorial/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">hue/saturation</a>, and over a dozen other properties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words: </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Photoshop adjustment layers are like stacking sheets of digital cellophane on top of your images. Each layer can be controlled individually and combined with <a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/layer-masks-in-photoshop-beginners/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">layer masks</a> to apply edits to specific parts of your images. All of this might seem needlessly complicated compared to the simplicity of other programs, but once you get the hang of Photoshop adjustment layers, you&#8217;ll never want to go back.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-with-caption\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/photoshop-adjustment-layers-dandelion.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Photoshop adjustment layers dandelion\" class=\"wp-image-198301\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/photoshop-adjustment-layers-dandelion.jpg?w=1500&#38;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/photoshop-adjustment-layers-dandelion.jpg?resize=300%2C200&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/photoshop-adjustment-layers-dandelion.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/photoshop-adjustment-layers-dandelion.jpg?resize=768%2C512&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/photoshop-adjustment-layers-dandelion.jpg?resize=90%2C60&#38;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/photoshop-adjustment-layers-dandelion.jpg?resize=717%2C478&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Nikon D7100 | 50mm f/1.8G | 50mm | 1/2000s | f/2.8 | ISO 100</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Another way to think about Photoshop adjustment layers is by comparing them to panels in the <a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/steps-for-getting-started-in-the-lightroom-develop-module/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"Develop module of Lightroom (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Develop module of Lightroom</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the Develop panels only offer a handful of adjustments that you can use. Photoshop lets you stack as many layers as you need &#8211; even multiple layers of the same type of adjustment &#8211; so you can tweak your images as much as you could possibly want. There is a bit of a learning curve, but the results are well worth the effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"how-to-add-an-adjustment-layer\">How to add an adjustment layer</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The first step when working with adjustment layers is to load an image into Photoshop. Then click on the Adjustments panel, which is usually located above the Layers panel. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>(If you don&#8217;t see the Adjustments panel, go to the Window menu and choose <em>Adjustments</em>.)</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-with-caption\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"866\" height=\"808\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/photoshop-adjustment-layers-panel.png?resize=866%2C808&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Photoshop adjustment layers\" class=\"wp-image-198302\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/photoshop-adjustment-layers-panel.png?w=866&#38;ssl=1 866w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/photoshop-adjustment-layers-panel.png?resize=300%2C280&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/photoshop-adjustment-layers-panel.png?resize=600%2C560&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/photoshop-adjustment-layers-panel.png?resize=768%2C717&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/photoshop-adjustment-layers-panel.png?resize=717%2C669&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 866px) 100vw, 866px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Load an image into Photoshop and then click the Adjustments panel.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The Adjustment panel offers sixteen adjustments to choose from, and sorting through all of these can be overwhelming (especially if you&#8217;re used to the simple, straightforward editing parameters available in Lightroom).</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-with-caption\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"366\" height=\"256\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/photoshop-adjustment-layers-panel-icons-2.png?resize=366%2C256&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Photoshop adjustments\" class=\"wp-image-198456\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/photoshop-adjustment-layers-panel-icons-2.png?w=366&#38;ssl=1 366w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/photoshop-adjustment-layers-panel-icons-2.png?resize=300%2C210&#38;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 366px) 100vw, 366px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Each one of these icons is a specific type of adjustment.

But using the adjustments is much different from working in Lightroom and, in some ways, more complicated. Fortunately, that also means you can get much better results.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To see how this process works, I&#8217;ve included an image (below) that clearly needs some editing.

The next thing I want to do is set the white balance, but this option is missing from the Adjustments panel. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, you have to use the <a aria-label=\"Curves adjustment (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/understand-curves-tool-photoshop/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Curves adjustment</a>, then click the gray point eyedropper. Next, click a neutral or slightly gray portion of your image to counteract any color casts. Note that this process essentially replicates the White Balance function of Lightroom.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-with-caption\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"876\" height=\"938\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/photoshop-adjustment-layers-tooltips-gray-point.png?resize=876%2C938&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"curves adjustment\" class=\"wp-image-198314\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/photoshop-adjustment-layers-tooltips-gray-point.png?w=876&#38;ssl=1 876w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/photoshop-adjustment-layers-tooltips-gray-point.png?resize=280%2C300&#38;ssl=1 280w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/photoshop-adjustment-layers-tooltips-gray-point.png?resize=560%2C600&#38;ssl=1 560w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/photoshop-adjustment-layers-tooltips-gray-point.png?resize=768%2C822&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/photoshop-adjustment-layers-tooltips-gray-point.png?resize=717%2C768&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 876px) 100vw, 876px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Select the gray point tool, then click a slightly gray or neutral area of your photo to set the white balance of the image.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing you might notice is that the Curves options in Photoshop are much more comprehensive than the Curves options in Lightroom. This should give you an indication of how much more flexibility you have with adjustment layers. You can use Curves to do everything you would do in Lightroom, along with much, much more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The final operation to fix this image involves a Hue/Saturation adjustment layer. Click on the <em>Hue/Saturation</em> icon to bring up a panel that looks like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-with-caption\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"876\" height=\"636\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/photoshop-adjustment-layers-hue-saturation.png?resize=876%2C636&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Photoshop adjustment layers\" class=\"wp-image-198445\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/photoshop-adjustment-layers-hue-saturation.png?w=876&#38;ssl=1 876w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/photoshop-adjustment-layers-hue-saturation.png?resize=300%2C218&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/photoshop-adjustment-layers-hue-saturation.png?resize=600%2C436&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/photoshop-adjustment-layers-hue-saturation.png?resize=768%2C558&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/photoshop-adjustment-layers-hue-saturation.png?resize=717%2C521&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 876px) 100vw, 876px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>The Hue/Saturation adjustment layer parameters</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The key to this panel is the hand icon in the top-left. Click it, then click on a part of your image that you would like to saturate or de-saturate. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this case, I want to start with the grass below the sign.

So if you don&#8217;t want the sign to be affected by the Hue/Saturation adjustment layer, simply paint black over the portion of the mask that covers the sign!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s how it works:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, select the <a aria-label=\"Brush tool (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/5-things-to-know-about-photoshop-brushes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Brush tool</a> (press <em>B</em> or click the <em>Brush</em> icon in the left-hand toolbar). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure your foreground color is white and your background color is black (to do this quickly, just hit <em>D</em>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now it&#8217;s time to actually paint the mask.

This can be done using the <em>Image>Adjustments</em> menu, which gives you common editing options such as <em>Brightness/Contrast</em>, <em>Hue/Saturation</em>, and more. Unlike adjustment layers, these edits are not easy to work with, nor are they easy to alter once they have been implemented.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Photoshop adjustment layers, on the other hand, are nondestructive. You can tweak and change layers <em>after </em>they have been implemented, and you can easily delete them. That&#8217;s why layer adjustments are much more flexible than edits applied directly to an image.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-with-caption\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"876\" height=\"560\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/photoshop-adjustment-layers-options.png?resize=876%2C560&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Photoshop adjustment layers\" class=\"wp-image-198451\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/photoshop-adjustment-layers-options.png?w=876&#38;ssl=1 876w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/photoshop-adjustment-layers-options.png?resize=300%2C192&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/photoshop-adjustment-layers-options.png?resize=600%2C384&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/photoshop-adjustment-layers-options.png?resize=768%2C491&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/photoshop-adjustment-layers-options.png?resize=115%2C75&#38;ssl=1 115w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/photoshop-adjustment-layers-options.png?resize=717%2C458&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 876px) 100vw, 876px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Adjustment layers can be renamed, re-sorted, locked, disabled, and made transparent. And that&#8217;s just the beginning!</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>You can perform all manner of custom tweaks and changes to adjustment layers, such as:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Showing/hiding a layer by clicking the <em>eye </em>icon</li><li>Editing the adjustment by clicking the <em>light/dark circle</em> icon</li><li>Adjusting the opacity of a layer</li><li>Changing the <a aria-label=\"blend mode (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/first-3-photoshop-blend-modes-need-understand/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">blend mode</a>, which adjusts how the layer interacts with layers below it</li><li>Adjusting the order of the layers by clicking and dragging</li><li>Locking a layer to prevent further changes by clicking the <em>lock </em>icon</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Photoshop adjustment layers open up new editing possibilities that simply cannot be achieved in Lightroom. For example, the image of a leaf from the beginning of this article can be altered with a selective color adjustment in a matter of seconds. All I need to do is add a Black &#38; White adjustment layer. I can then select the leaf with the Magic Wand tool and paint over the selection on the layer mask.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-with-caption\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/photoshop-adjustment-layers-leaf-bw.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"leaf in color with black and white background\" class=\"wp-image-198227\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/photoshop-adjustment-layers-leaf-bw.jpg?w=1500&#38;ssl=1 1500w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/photoshop-adjustment-layers-leaf-bw.jpg?resize=300%2C200&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/photoshop-adjustment-layers-leaf-bw.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/photoshop-adjustment-layers-leaf-bw.jpg?resize=768%2C512&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/photoshop-adjustment-layers-leaf-bw.jpg?resize=90%2C60&#38;ssl=1 90w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/photoshop-adjustment-layers-leaf-bw.jpg?resize=717%2C478&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Adding a selective color black and white effect took about four seconds.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"photoshop-adjustment-layers-conclusion\">Photoshop adjustment layers: conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a <a aria-label=\"Creative Cloud Photography subscription (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://clk.tradedoubler.com/click?p(264300)a(3193397)g(22913526)url(https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/photography/compare-plans.html?promoid=9DJJ4N49&#38;mv=other)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" class=\"ek-link\">Creative Cloud Photography subscription</a>, you can use Photoshop in addition to Lightroom at no extra charge.

Play with eye contact</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It is amazing how much the direction of your subject&#8217;s eyes can impact an image. Most portraits have the <a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/eye-contact-smiles/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">subject looking down the lens</a> &#8211; something that can create a real sense of connection between a subject and those viewing the image. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there are a couple of other things to try:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A.</strong> <strong>Looking off-camera.</strong> <span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Have your subject focus their attention on something outside the field of view of your camera. This can create a feeling of candidness and also create a little intrigue and interest as the viewer of the shot wonders what the subject is looking at. This intrigue is particularly strong when the subject is showing some kind of emotion (i.e., &#8220;What&#8217;s making them laugh?&#8221; or &#8220;What is making them look surprised?&#8221;). Just be aware that, when you have a subject looking out of the frame, you can also draw the eye of the viewer to the edge of the image, and this will take them away from the point of interest in your shot: the subject.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1385\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ways-to-take-stunning-portraits-3.jpg?resize=1385%2C1500&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"subject looking off-camera\" class=\"wp-image-198528\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ways-to-take-stunning-portraits-3.jpg?w=1385&#38;ssl=1 1385w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ways-to-take-stunning-portraits-3.jpg?resize=277%2C300&#38;ssl=1 277w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ways-to-take-stunning-portraits-3.jpg?resize=554%2C600&#38;ssl=1 554w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ways-to-take-stunning-portraits-3.jpg?resize=768%2C832&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ways-to-take-stunning-portraits-3.jpg?resize=717%2C777&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><strong>B. Looking within the frame</strong></span></strong><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">. </span><strong><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Alternatively, you could have your subject looking at something (or someone) within the frame. A child looking at a ball, a woman looking at her new baby, or a man looking hungrily at a big plate of pasta &#8211; it can all work. You see, when you give your subject something to look at that is inside the frame, you create a second point of interest and a relationship between it and your primary subject. It also helps create a story within the image.</span></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ways-to-take-stunning-portraits-4.jpg?resize=1500%2C1000&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"woman looking at child stunning portrait\" class=\"wp-image-198529\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ways-to-take-stunning-portraits-4.jpg?w=1500&#38;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ways-to-take-stunning-portraits-4.jpg?resize=300%2C200&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ways-to-take-stunning-portraits-4.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ways-to-take-stunning-portraits-4.jpg?resize=768%2C512&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ways-to-take-stunning-portraits-4.jpg?resize=90%2C60&#38;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ways-to-take-stunning-portraits-4.jpg?resize=717%2C478&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 data-section id=\"break-the-rules-of-composition\">3. Break the rules of composition</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a lot of &#8220;rules&#8221; out there when it comes to <a aria-label=\"composition (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/5-elements-of-composition-in-photography/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">composition</a>, and I&#8217;ve always had a love-hate relationship with them. My theory is that, while composition rules are useful to know and employ, they are also useful to know so you can purposely break them &#8211; as this can lead to eye-catching results.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/rule-of-thirds/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">rule of thirds</a> is one rule that can be effective to break.

Move your subject out of their comfort zone</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I was chatting with a photographer recently who told me about a corporate portrait shoot that he had done with a businessman at his home. They&#8217;d taken a lot of head and shoulder shots, shots at the desk, shots in front of framed degrees, and other &#8220;corporate&#8221; type images. The photos had all turned out fairly standard &#8211; but there was nothing that really stood out from the crowd.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The photographer and the subject agreed that there were plenty of usable shots, but they wanted to create something special and out-of-the-box. The photographer suggested they try some &#8220;jumping&#8221; shots. The subject was a little hesitant at first, but stepped out of his comfort zone &#8211; and then, dressed in his suit and tie, started jumping!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The shots were amazing, surprising, and quite funny. The shoot culminated with the subject jumping into his pool for one last image!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While this might all sound a little silly, the shots ended up being featured in a magazine spread about the subject. It was the series of out-of-the-box images that convinced the magazine the subject was someone they&#8217;d want to feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ways-to-take-stunning-portraits-9.jpg?resize=1000%2C1500&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"man jumping\" class=\"wp-image-198534\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ways-to-take-stunning-portraits-9.jpg?w=1000&#38;ssl=1 1000w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ways-to-take-stunning-portraits-9.jpg?resize=200%2C300&#38;ssl=1 200w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ways-to-take-stunning-portraits-9.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#38;ssl=1 400w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ways-to-take-stunning-portraits-9.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ways-to-take-stunning-portraits-9.jpg?resize=717%2C1076&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 data-section id=\"shoot-candidly\">6.

You might even want to grab a longer zoom lens to give your subject space and get really &#8220;paparazzi&#8221; with them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I find that this can work particularly well when <a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/authentic-photos-children-simple-tips/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"photographing children (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">photographing children</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"996\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ways-to-take-stunning-portraits-10.jpg?resize=996%2C1500&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"candid child image\" class=\"wp-image-198535\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ways-to-take-stunning-portraits-10.jpg?w=996&#38;ssl=1 996w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ways-to-take-stunning-portraits-10.jpg?resize=199%2C300&#38;ssl=1 199w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ways-to-take-stunning-portraits-10.jpg?resize=398%2C600&#38;ssl=1 398w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ways-to-take-stunning-portraits-10.jpg?resize=768%2C1157&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ways-to-take-stunning-portraits-10.jpg?resize=717%2C1080&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 996px) 100vw, 996px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 data-section id=\"introduce-a-prop\">7.

you&#8217;ll want to see for yourself), one of the biggest features for amateur and<em> </em>professional photographers is the set of color editing tools: the Color Wheel and the Tone Wheels. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a quick peek at the Color Wheel:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"501\" height=\"762\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/photo-studio-ultimate-tone-wheels-color-wheel-4.jpg?resize=501%2C762&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Color Wheel\"

501px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>And here is the Tone Wheels panel:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"501\" height=\"1044\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/photo-studio-ultimate-tone-wheels-color-wheel-5.jpg?resize=501%2C1044&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Tone Wheels\" class=\"wp-image-200240\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/photo-studio-ultimate-tone-wheels-color-wheel-5.jpg?w=501&#38;ssl=1 501w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/photo-studio-ultimate-tone-wheels-color-wheel-5.jpg?resize=144%2C300&#38;ssl=1 144w,

501px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Together, these two tools can revolutionize your photo editing workflow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And here&#8217;s why:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the Color and Tone Wheels, you can make both broad and targeted adjustments to the colors in your images. You can shift, brighten, and saturate colors selectively, you can push colors into the shadows, highlights, and midtones separately, and <em>so much more</em> &#8211; all with a few easy-to-use wheels and sliders. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As someone who&#8217;s a bit color-obsessed, I&#8217;ve used quite a few color adjustment tools in many different post-processing programs. But I can honestly say that Photo Studio Ultimate&#8217;s version is one of the best implementations I&#8217;ve ever seen (if not <em>the </em>best). Yes, the wheels are amazingly powerful, and they should offer any amateur or professional all the color adjustment power they need. But they&#8217;re also just so fun and intuitive to work with, which is what&#8217;s really sold me on this program.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter

class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"533\" height=\"1409\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/photo-studio-ultimate-tone-wheels-color-wheel-8.jpg?resize=533%2C1409&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Color Wheel panel\"

533px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s what you need to know: </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The color wheel itself <strong>lets you select the colors you&#8217;re targeting in the photo</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the sliders below it <strong>allow you to adjust the targeted colors</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So once you have your Color Wheel panel open, here&#8217;s what I recommend you do:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 data-section id=\"step-select-the-colors-you-want-to-adjust\">Step 1: Select the colors you want to adjust</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Selecting the colors you&#8217;d like to adjust pretty easy, and there are a couple of methods you can use. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, you can simply hover your cursor over different parts of your photo, and watch as it turns into a dropper icon:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"994\" height=\"1065\"

https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/photo-studio-ultimate-tone-wheels-color-wheel-9.jpg?resize=280%2C300&#38;ssl=1 280w,

994px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, by clicking once on the photo, you&#8217;ll select that color for adjustment. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you click on a pinkish-purple part of your photo, you&#8217;ll select all the pink-purple colors:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"579\"

1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you click on a yellow part of your photo, you&#8217;ll select all the yellow colors:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"825\"

1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, as soon as you click on a part of your photo, you&#8217;ll see the color wheel change. This is to show you the color range you&#8217;ve selected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also use the display on the color wheel to either <em>select</em> colors (instead of the eyedropper), or to <em>refine </em>your color selection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To select colors, just click on the relevant part of the wheel:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"513\" height=\"780\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/photo-studio-ultimate-tone-wheels-color-wheel-12.jpg?resize=513%2C780&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"selecting a color on the color wheel\" class=\"wp-image-200247\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/photo-studio-ultimate-tone-wheels-color-wheel-12.jpg?w=513&#38;ssl=1 513w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/photo-studio-ultimate-tone-wheels-color-wheel-12.jpg?resize=197%2C300&#38;ssl=1 197w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/photo-studio-ultimate-tone-wheels-color-wheel-12.jpg?resize=395%2C600&#38;ssl=1 395w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 513px) 100vw, 513px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>And to fine-tune the color selection, just narrow the range of colors on the color wheel &#8211; by dragging the edges of the selection inward or outward. That way, the adjustments you make via the sliders will affect a narrower or broader<em> </em>range of colors in your photo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here, I&#8217;ve narrowed the color selection:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"507\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/photo-studio-ultimate-tone-wheels-color-wheel-43.jpg?resize=507%2C750&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"narrow selection on the color

507px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>And here I&#8217;ve broadened it:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"496\" height=\"749\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/photo-studio-ultimate-tone-wheels-color-wheel-13.jpg?resize=496%2C749&#038;ssl=1\"

496px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, if you want to get really picky with your selection, you can drag your color range upward from the center of the wheel:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"504\" height=\"753\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/photo-studio-ultimate-tone-wheels-color-wheel-14.jpg?resize=504%2C753&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"selecting only saturated

504px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>And this will ensure you only select the more saturated colors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also drag downward from the rim of the wheel to select only the less-saturated colors:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"495\" height=\"744\"

Look at the color wheel! Colors that are opposite one another are <em>contrasting/complementary </em>colors, whereas colors next to one another are <em>analogous </em>colors.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While color contrast will generally create a more powerful, in-your-face photo, analogous colors can result in a more peaceful final image. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, once you&#8217;ve adjusted the hue, I recommend turning to the Saturation slider. This works the way it sounds: It lets you selectively boost or reduce the saturation of your selected color range. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So by selecting the yellows in the image below, then adjusting the Saturation slider, you can boost the yellow intensity:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1029\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/photo-studio-ultimate-tone-wheels-color-wheel-20.jpg?resize=1500%2C1029&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"shifting the saturation\" class=\"wp-image-200257\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/photo-studio-ultimate-tone-wheels-color-wheel-20.jpg?w=1500&#38;ssl=1 1500w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/photo-studio-ultimate-tone-wheels-color-wheel-20.jpg?resize=300%2C206&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/photo-studio-ultimate-tone-wheels-color-wheel-20.jpg?resize=600%2C412&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/photo-studio-ultimate-tone-wheels-color-wheel-20.jpg?resize=768%2C527&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/photo-studio-ultimate-tone-wheels-color-wheel-20.jpg?resize=717%2C492&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Or you can dial it back:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1011\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/photo-studio-ultimate-tone-wheels-color-wheel-21.jpg?resize=1500%2C1011&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"shifting the saturation\" class=\"wp-image-200258\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/photo-studio-ultimate-tone-wheels-color-wheel-21.jpg?w=1500&#38;ssl=1 1500w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/photo-studio-ultimate-tone-wheels-color-wheel-21.jpg?resize=300%2C202&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/photo-studio-ultimate-tone-wheels-color-wheel-21.jpg?resize=600%2C404&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/photo-studio-ultimate-tone-wheels-color-wheel-21.jpg?resize=768%2C518&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/photo-studio-ultimate-tone-wheels-color-wheel-21.jpg?resize=90%2C60&#38;ssl=1 90w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/photo-studio-ultimate-tone-wheels-color-wheel-21.jpg?resize=436%2C293&#38;ssl=1 436w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/photo-studio-ultimate-tone-wheels-color-wheel-21.jpg?resize=717%2C483&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In general, boosting the saturation of your main colors looks pretty good, as long as you don&#8217;t overdo it. That way, a few colors in your photo will stand out and keep the viewer interested. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it can also be helpful to reduce the saturation of colors that distract from the main subject. So if your photo includes a red &#8220;Exit&#8221; sign in the background, you might reduce the saturation of those reds to keep the viewer focused on the foreground. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, I recommend experimenting with the Brightness slider. This allows you to adjust the brightness of your selected color range. So you can brighten up your selection to make it pop: </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"987\"

size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"512\" height=\"325\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/photo-studio-ultimate-tone-wheels-color-wheel-34.jpg?resize=512%2C325&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"using the saturation slider\"

512px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus you can change the brightness of the shadows with the right-hand slider:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"491\" height=\"312\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/photo-studio-ultimate-tone-wheels-color-wheel-45.jpg?resize=491%2C312&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"using the brightness slider\"

https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/photo-studio-ultimate-tone-wheels-color-wheel-45.jpg?resize=300%2C191&#38;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 491px) 100vw, 491px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Personally, my favorite way to select colors is to use the wheel, but start by pushing the Saturation slider all the way up:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"505\" height=\"323\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/photo-studio-ultimate-tone-wheels-color-wheel-36.jpg?resize=505%2C323&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"saturation pushed all the way to its maximum\" class=\"wp-image-200273\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/photo-studio-ultimate-tone-wheels-color-wheel-36.jpg?w=505&#38;ssl=1 505w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/photo-studio-ultimate-tone-wheels-color-wheel-36.jpg?resize=300%2C192&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/photo-studio-ultimate-tone-wheels-color-wheel-36.jpg?resize=115%2C75&#38;ssl=1 115w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 505px) 100vw, 505px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>That way, you can clearly see the effects of your color grade &#8211; and once you&#8217;ve chosen the right color, you can dial it back. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, while it&#8217;s always a good idea to experiment, the best shadow colors are generally <em>cool</em> &#8211; blues, greens, and purples. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;d also recommend paying careful attention to the colors already present in your shadows &#8211; by matching the shadow color with already-existing colors, you can unify the darker parts of your photo and make it even stronger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this flower photo, I like blue-green shadows:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\"

just like selecting a color for the Shadows wheel. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use the eyedropper tool:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img

504px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Or you can click on the wheel directly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, you can also fine-tune with the Saturation slider and the Brightness slider:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"502\" height=\"331\"

502px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally, you&#8217;ll want a warmer color for the highlights: an orange, yellow, or red. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s also a good idea to pay attention to your existing highlight colors. For instance, if your photo has a lot of warm sunlight, such as in the shot of the Black-eyed Susan flowers, you might want to accentuate the yellows with some nice golden highlights:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"775\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/photo-studio-ultimate-tone-wheels-color-wheel-40.jpg?resize=1500%2C775&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"warmer highlights example\" class=\"wp-image-200277\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/photo-studio-ultimate-tone-wheels-color-wheel-40.jpg?w=1500&#38;ssl=1 1500w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/photo-studio-ultimate-tone-wheels-color-wheel-40.jpg?resize=300%2C155&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/photo-studio-ultimate-tone-wheels-color-wheel-40.jpg?resize=600%2C310&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/photo-studio-ultimate-tone-wheels-color-wheel-40.jpg?resize=768%2C397&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/photo-studio-ultimate-tone-wheels-color-wheel-40.jpg?resize=717%2C370&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;d also recommend looking at your shadow colors even when adjusting the Highlights wheel. For a nice result, you might choose a color that contrasts with the shadows to create a complementary color pair (as I discussed in the Color Wheel section, above). </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 data-section id=\"step-adjust-the-midtones\">Step 3: Adjust the midtones</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Adjusting the midtones is a bit less common than adjusting the highlights and the shadows. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For one, if you adjust the midtones, your photo will often take on a more obvious tinted look, because we humans expect midtones to be more neutral compared to colder shadows and warmer highlights. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, the midtones can correspond to skin tones, which you (generally) want to keep as natural as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I recommend you be careful when experimenting with the Midtones color wheel. If you do decide you want to make changes, I&#8217;d recommend keeping things closely aligned with the highlights, because too many colors in your scene will start to look messy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sense? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you&#8217;d expect, adjusting the midtones is just like adjusting the highlights and shadows. You have the Midtone color wheel that you can click on:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"509\" height=\"1021\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/photo-studio-ultimate-tone-wheels-color-wheel-41.jpg?resize=509%2C1021&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"midtones color wheel\" class=\"wp-image-200278\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/photo-studio-ultimate-tone-wheels-color-wheel-41.jpg?w=509&#38;ssl=1 509w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/photo-studio-ultimate-tone-wheels-color-wheel-41.jpg?resize=150%2C300&#38;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/photo-studio-ultimate-tone-wheels-color-wheel-41.jpg?resize=299%2C600&#38;ssl=1 299w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 509px) 100vw, 509px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus your eyedropper:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"502\" height=\"1020\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/photo-studio-ultimate-tone-wheels-color-wheel-42.jpg?resize=502%2C1020&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"midtones eyedropper\" class=\"wp-image-200279\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/photo-studio-ultimate-tone-wheels-color-wheel-42.jpg?w=502&#38;ssl=1 502w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/photo-studio-ultimate-tone-wheels-color-wheel-42.jpg?resize=148%2C300&#38;ssl=1 148w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/photo-studio-ultimate-tone-wheels-color-wheel-42.jpg?resize=295%2C600&#38;ssl=1 295w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 502px) 100vw, 502px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Which you can use to give your midtones a slight color grade!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"acdsees-color-and-tone-wheels-the-next-steps\">ACDSee&#8217;s Color and Tone Wheels: the next steps</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you&#8217;ve finished this article, you know how to make pro-level color adjustments. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with Photo Studio Ultimate 2021&#8217;s Color Wheel and Tone Wheels tools, you have everything you need to take your color editing to the next level. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So make sure you grab ACDSee Photo Studio Ultimate 2021.

Does it work as well as advertised? And how do you use it for file recovery? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s what this article is all about.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In it, I put Stellar Photo Recovery to the test, using some formatted memory cards of my own.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I share all my findings with you.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So to find out whether Stellar Photo Recovery is a worthy purchase…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Spoiler alert: The software works <em>incredibly </em>well!)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230;keep reading.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"stellar-photo-recovery-why-might-you-need-it\">Stellar Photo Recovery: Why might you need it?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Stellar Photo Recovery is a DIY recovery package, designed to help you find and recover lost photos, videos, and audio files.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But why, specifically, might you need Stellar Photo Recovery?&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine you’re out taking pictures and fill up several cards. You go home, download all the photos to your storage drives, and then &#8211; as many photographers do &#8211; format every card in-camera.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moments later, you feel a dawning sense of horror, as you realize that you failed to transfer the photos from one of the <em>now formatted cards</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At this point, your hard-earned photos are deleted, the card has been wiped, and your only real option is recovery software.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s just <em>one </em>of the many ways you could accidentally delete photos and videos. You could also format a hard drive and realize it had photos you needed. Or you could stick a full memory card into your camera while out shooting, format it, then suddenly realize that you hadn’t transferred the previous photos over to your storage drives. Or you could clear a flash drive, then realize it had valuable media that you needed for a client. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could also end up with corrupted files thanks to faulty memory cards or old drives or viruses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve been doing photography for a while, then you’re probably aware:&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This sort of thing happens <em>all the time</em>. If it hasn’t happened to you yet, then it will, because it’s just the nature of having lots of easy-to-wipe memory cards. You’ll make a mistake.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when you do, you’ll want to have software like Stellar Photo Recovery.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right off the bat, you’ll be impressed by the sheer volume of scenarios Stellar Photo Recovery can handle.

So if you accidentally recovered the wrong files, you can just go back into the list of recoverable media and check off a different set of files &#8211; without having to scan the drive again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s even nicer is that you can save your scan data when you exit Stellar Photo Recovery. So if you’re tired of recovering images and want to continue later, you can work from a previously-scanned drive without needing to go through the whole process again.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"stellar-photo-recovery-performance\">Stellar Photo Recovery: Performance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking as a longtime photographer, I’m always worried about losing my photos.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet I’ve never managed to find any recovery software that I really, truly trust, especially because there’s all sorts of dodgy options out there that aren’t worth the money.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I am genuinely so impressed by Stellar Photo Recovery. It’s easy to set up, easy to use, and it works amazingly well. I tested it out on a 32 GB SD card that was full of Olympus RAW files. The card had been formatted twice in recent days &#8211; but Stellar Photo Recovery managed to bring back every photo from before the second wipe, and what appeared to be all 400+ photos from before the <em>first </em>wipe, all in perfect condition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most difficult thing about Stellar Photo Recovery is the waiting &#8211; as I explained above, the scan takes some time. But you don’t have to babysit the software, so you can easily get the scan started, go do something else, and come back in 30 minutes or so.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, I do think it’s important to be up front, here:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I didn’t try to restore any corrupted files, and my sense is that Stellar Photo Recovery works here but won’t always do a perfect job. So it’s certainly worth using for that sort of thing, but while recognizing that repairing corrupt files is inherently difficult and might not happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also recognize that the more you overwrite files, the more Stellar Photo Recovery will struggle to recover the originals.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t take pictures, format the card, take more pictures, and only <em>then</em> try to recover the originals; instead, make sure any accidentally-formatted cards are immediately put aside for recovery. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don’t do this, your results will vary, depending on the amount of new photos you took.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sense?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, I’m now a huge fan of Stellar Photo Recovery. And I guarantee it’ll be the software I turn to the next time I lose images.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"stellar-photo-recovery-pricing\">Stellar Photo Recovery: Pricing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are three Stellar Photo Recovery packages (all are available for both <a aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.stellarinfo.com/mac-photo-recovery.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored\" class=\"ek-link\">Mac</a> and <a aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.stellarinfo.com/photo-recovery-software.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored\" class=\"ek-link\">Windows</a>): </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Standard package, which costs $39.99 for a one-year subscription, and offers complete recovery capabilities, but cannot repair corrupted files.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Professional package, which costs $49.99 for a one-year subscription, and offers complete recovery capabilities <em>plus </em>the ability to repair corrupted photo files.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the Premium package, which costs $69.99 for a one-year subscription, and offers complete recovery capabilities, the ability to repair corrupted photo files, <em>plus </em>the ability to repair corrupted video files.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"737\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/stellar-photo-recovery-review-23.jpg?resize=1500%2C737&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Stellar Photo Recovery software review pricing\" class=\"wp-image-200343\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/stellar-photo-recovery-review-23.jpg?w=1500&#38;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/stellar-photo-recovery-review-23.jpg?resize=300%2C147&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/stellar-photo-recovery-review-23.jpg?resize=600%2C295&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/stellar-photo-recovery-review-23.jpg?resize=768%2C377&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/stellar-photo-recovery-review-23.jpg?resize=717%2C352&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Which should you get?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re just looking to recover deleted files, the Standard package will work just fine.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you have corrupted image files, then the Professional package is a must.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you have corrupted video files, you’ll want to go for the Premium option.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So make sure to grab your version of Stellar Photo Recovery software <a href=\"https://www.stellarinfo.com/photo-recovery-software.php\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored\" class=\"ek-link\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"who-should-get-stellar-photo-recovery\">Who should get Stellar Photo Recovery?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Stellar Photo Recovery is a fantastic option for photographers and videographers looking to recover files.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s simple to use, its performance is impeccable, and I can’t recommend it enough. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the next time you find yourself needing to perform file recovery or repair…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230;turn to <a href=\"https://www.stellarinfo.com/photo-recovery-software.php\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored\" class=\"ek-link\">Stellar Photo Recovery</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Stellar is a paid partner of dPS.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/stellar-photo-recovery-software-review/\">Stellar Photo Recovery Software Review: An Easy Way to Reclaim Your Precious Photos</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com\">Digital Photography School</a>.

Boring gray skies make for boring landscape photos, after all! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, capturing a dramatic sky in-camera is trickier than it seems. When the sky is lighter than the land, your camera will typically <a aria-label=\"overexpose (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/learning-exposure-in-digital-photography/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">overexpose</a> it, turning a brilliant blue into a vague and unexciting gray or white.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But with a little fine-tuning, it is possible to capture a sky that is the cherry on top of a great scene! Here are six tips for capturing more dramatic skies in your landscape photography.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"913\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tips-for-dramatic-skies-1.jpg?resize=913%2C1500&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"dramatic sky cityscape\" class=\"wp-image-198543\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tips-for-dramatic-skies-1.jpg?w=913&#38;ssl=1 913w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tips-for-dramatic-skies-1.jpg?resize=183%2C300&#38;ssl=1 183w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tips-for-dramatic-skies-1.jpg?resize=365%2C600&#38;ssl=1 365w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tips-for-dramatic-skies-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1262&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tips-for-dramatic-skies-1.jpg?resize=717%2C1178&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 913px) 100vw, 913px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"time-it-right\">1. Time it right</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Landscape photography may not require the split-second timing that&#8217;s necessary for capturing a toddler&#8217;s smile or a wide receiver&#8217;s catch, but timing is still a big part of the picture. The sky that&#8217;s gray one day could be bright blue the next. So when planning out a landscape photo, consider how the timing will impact the sky.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Watch for <a aria-label=\"weather patterns (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/time-for-landscape-weather-and-landscape-photography/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">weather patterns</a> that add interest to a shot, like a storm brewing just above the horizon. Weather plays a big role in the overall mood of the image &#8211; so if you&#8217;re hoping to capture a dark and gloomy shot, head out when the sky is stormy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, if you&#8217;re hoping to capture a more relaxed or happy photo, look for blue skies dotted with clouds.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1004\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tips-for-dramatic-skies-2.jpg?resize=1500%2C1004&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"blue sky with fluffy clouds\" class=\"wp-image-198544\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tips-for-dramatic-skies-2.jpg?w=1500&#38;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tips-for-dramatic-skies-2.jpg?resize=300%2C200&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tips-for-dramatic-skies-2.jpg?resize=600%2C402&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tips-for-dramatic-skies-2.jpg?resize=768%2C514&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tips-for-dramatic-skies-2.jpg?resize=90%2C60&#38;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tips-for-dramatic-skies-2.jpg?resize=436%2C293&#38;ssl=1 436w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tips-for-dramatic-skies-2.jpg?resize=717%2C480&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The time of day matters, too. While the middle of the day will produce the most shadows on the land, it&#8217;s when the sky tends to be the clearest blue. And <a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/new-photographers-guide-to-blue-hour/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"just after sunset and just before sunrise (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">just after sunset and just before sunrise</a> is often a good time to capture wispy clouds and a warmer tint of light. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, <a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-photograph-a-sunrise/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"sunrise (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">sunrise</a> and <a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-shoot-landscapes-at-sunset/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"sunset (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">sunset</a> is great for dramatic skies, as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"try-the-wrong-white-balance\">2. Try the wrong white balance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Photography rules are sometimes meant to be broken, including rules about always using the correct <a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/introduction-to-white-balance/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"white balance (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">white balance</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You see, the wrong white balance setting can create a more dramatic sky. This is especially true when shooting toward the beginning or end of the day &#8211; using a different white balance preset will adjust the color in the sky.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Auto, Cloudy, and Shade white balance presets will get you an orangish sunset with a light blue sky (with slight variations in warmth depending on the setting you choose). A florescent setting, on the other hand, will typically turn an orange sunset purple with a brilliant blue sky. Tungsten offers a similar effect, but with even deeper colors.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/whitebalancepresets.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"white balance examples\" title=\"whitebalancepresets.jpg\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Using Kelvin temperatures to adjust your white balance results in even greater control over the colors in the sky. At around 5500K, you&#8217;ll usually capture a sunny sky with an accurate white balance &#8211; that is, where things that are white are still white in the picture, and where things that are gray are still gray in the picture. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A higher temperature &#8211; 6500K, for example &#8211; will give the land an orange glow but also enhance the colors in a sunset. A cooler temperature, on the other hand (e.g., 3000K), will play up the blues and purples. By using the Kelvin scale, you have more options for picking a white balance setting that best captures the colors in your photos.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image size-post-large-image wp-image-94784 is-style-with-caption\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"750\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/whitebalance160000K.jpg?resize=750%2C500&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Warm white balance for a warm sky\" class=\"wp-image-94784\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/whitebalance160000K.jpg?w=750&#38;ssl=1 750w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/whitebalance160000K.jpg?resize=300%2C200&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/whitebalance160000K.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/whitebalance160000K.jpg?resize=90%2C60&#38;ssl=1 90w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/whitebalance160000K.jpg?resize=717%2C478&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Here, the white balance was altered in post-processing to warm up the sky.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>While it&#8217;s always best to get the shot right in-camera, <a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/raw-vs-jpeg/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"shooting in RAW (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">shooting in RAW</a> offers you even more flexibility when it comes to adjusting the colors in the sky (and the rest of the image, for that matter). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you overdid things by making the shot too warm or too cool, you can easily adjust a RAW photo in post-processing, so that you use the color temperature that best fits the image.

Use a filter</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two <a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/beginners-guide-buying-filters/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"filters (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">filters</a> every landscape photographer should have in their camera bag in order to capture more dramatic skies. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first is a <a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/using-graduated-neutral-density-filters-for-landscape-photography/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"graduated neutral density filter (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">graduated neutral density filter</a>. Now, a regular <a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/neutral-density-filters-landscape-photos/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"neutral density filter (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">neutral density filter</a> is like putting sunglasses over your lens &#8211; it limits the light coming in for bright scenes or long exposures. But a <em>graduated </em>neutral density filter places that darkening effect only on a portion of the image. And by positioning the dark portion of the filter over a bright sky, you can properly expose the entire scene. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without a graduated neutral density filter, the sky will often be overexposed and bland, or the land will be underexposed and dark. With the filter, you can achieve an exposure that works for both portions of the scene. The only downside is that graduated neutral density filters don&#8217;t work as well with an uneven horizon, like when shooting a <a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/10-tips-better-cityscape-photography/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"cityscape (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">cityscape</a>. Graduated neutral density filters come in both circular and square formats, but the square is often preferred because you can place the horizon anywhere in the frame.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second filter landscape photographers should use to capture more dramatic skies is a <a aria-label=\"polarizing filter (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-use-and-buy-polarizing-filters/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">polarizing filter</a>. Polarizing filters work by adjusting the reflected light coming through your camera lens. Since the sky is blue because of this reflected light, turning the front of the polarizing filter will adjust the intensity of the blues in the sky. Since polarizing filters only affect reflected light, they can still be used when mountains or buildings make the horizon uneven. Polarizing filters are also great for enhancing or removing reflections on water or other shiny surfaces.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tips-for-dramatic-skies-5.jpg?resize=1000%2C1500&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"polarizing filter example\" class=\"wp-image-198547\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tips-for-dramatic-skies-5.jpg?w=1000&#38;ssl=1 1000w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tips-for-dramatic-skies-5.jpg?resize=200%2C300&#38;ssl=1 200w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tips-for-dramatic-skies-5.jpg?resize=400%2C600&#38;ssl=1 400w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tips-for-dramatic-skies-5.jpg?resize=768%2C1152&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tips-for-dramatic-skies-5.jpg?resize=717%2C1076&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"experiment-with-motion-blur-and-long-exposures\">5.

But the tool can also adjust contrast, saturation, clarity, sharpness, and color. That opens up a lot of possibilities for applying edits just to the sky for more drama &#8211; creating effects that sometimes can&#8217;t be done in-camera.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image size-post-large-image wp-image-94789 is-style-with-caption\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"750\" height=\"498\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/dramaticsky2Original.jpg?resize=750%2C498&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"rainbow in the sky\" class=\"wp-image-94789\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/dramaticsky2Original.jpg?w=750&#38;ssl=1 750w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/dramaticsky2Original.jpg?resize=300%2C200&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/dramaticsky2Original.jpg?resize=600%2C398&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/dramaticsky2Original.jpg?resize=90%2C60&#38;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/dramaticsky2Original.jpg?resize=115%2C75&#38;ssl=1 115w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/dramaticsky2Original.jpg?resize=717%2C476&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>This is the original photo.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image size-full wp-image-94546 is-style-with-caption\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"717\" height=\"476\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/HGrigonisdramaticsky1.jpg?resize=717%2C476&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"rainbow in the sky but with a Graduated Filter to enhance the drama\" class=\"wp-image-94546\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/HGrigonisdramaticsky1.jpg?w=717&#38;ssl=1 717w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/HGrigonisdramaticsky1.jpg?resize=300%2C200&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/HGrigonisdramaticsky1.jpg?resize=600%2C398&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/HGrigonisdramaticsky1.jpg?resize=90%2C60&#38;ssl=1 90w, https://i2.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/HGrigonisdramaticsky1.jpg?resize=115%2C75&#38;ssl=1 115w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>This is the same photo, but with a Graduated Filter used on the sky to increase the drama.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"capturing-dramatic-skies-in-your-landscape-photos-conclusion\">Capturing dramatic skies in your landscape photos: conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The sky can make or break a landscape photo.

What’s your intention each time you press the shutter button? Do you visualize how you want your photo to look before you take it? When you photograph with intent, the pictures you make resonate more with the people who view them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of us have a unique worldview. No two people perceive what they see precisely the same way. Learning to express what you see through the lens of your camera requires paying attention to more than what you are looking at. You must also have <em>intent </em>as to how you want your photos to turn out.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-with-caption\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1001\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/KL26746.jpg?resize=1500%2C1001&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Woman on a red couch outdoors for photographing with intent\" class=\"wp-image-196135\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/KL26746.jpg?w=1500&#38;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/KL26746.jpg?resize=300%2C200&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/KL26746.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/KL26746.jpg?resize=768%2C513&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/KL26746.jpg?resize=90%2C60&#38;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/KL26746.jpg?resize=717%2C478&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>© Kevin Landwer-Johan. <a aria-label=\"Nikon D800 (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/nikon-d800e-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Nikon D800</a> | <a aria-label=\"35mm f/1.4 (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/dps-writers-favorite-lens-why-love-35mm-f1-4/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Nikon 35mm f/1.4</a> | 1/125 sec | f/1.8 | ISO 100 | <a aria-label=\"Manual Mode (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/shoot-manual-mode-cheat-sheet-beginners/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Manual Mode</a> | Pattern Metering</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"your-camera-does-not-take-photos\">Your camera does not take photos</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Just as a musician’s instrument or a painter&#8217;s brush creates nothing on its own, your camera does not take photographs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, the interaction you have with your camera is what creates photos. The quality and creativity of your photographs depends on the level of synergy between photographer and camera. The connection between you and your chosen subject is also significant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Modern digital cameras are all designed to be as simple as possible to use &#8211; especially consumer-level cameras. Scene modes, <a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/benefits-shooting-auto-mode/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"auto-exposure (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">auto-exposure</a>, <a href=\"https://digital-photography-school.com/focus-on-autofocus/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"autofocus (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">autofocus</a>, auto-<em>everything</em> allows unskilled photographers to take snapshots that turn out pretty well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I was a kid, our neighbors had a pianola. This was a piano that had a handy mechanism: we could push pedals with our feet and the pianola would play tunes. There were special rolls of paper with holes punched in them that could be loaded into the front of the pianola. As we pedaled, the paper roll would turn. The configuration of the holes determined what tune was played. We were playing music without being musicians.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is similar to using a camera with its auto-functions turned on. It can be fun, and there will be a certain, but limited, satisfaction as pictures are created. Just as we loved &#8220;playing&#8221; the pianola, you can take photos with minimal creative input or skill.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To take truly wonderful photos, however, you must interact with your camera and your subject with intent. Relying on camera technology to make it easy to take photos will not make you a great photographer.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-with-caption\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1001\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/KL30331.jpg?resize=1500%2C1001&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"woman taking photo\" class=\"wp-image-196136\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/KL30331.jpg?w=1500&#38;ssl=1 1500w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/KL30331.jpg?resize=300%2C200&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/KL30331.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/KL30331.jpg?resize=768%2C513&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/KL30331.jpg?resize=90%2C60&#38;ssl=1 90w, https://i0.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/KL30331.jpg?resize=717%2C478&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>© Kevin Landwer-Johan. <a aria-label=\"Nikon D800 (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://geni.us/NikonD800\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" class=\"ek-link\">Nikon D800</a> | <a aria-label=\"35mm f/1.4 (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://geni.us/Nikon35mmf1-4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" class=\"ek-link\">Nikon 35mm f/1.4</a> | 1/400 sec | f/2 | ISO 100 | Manual Mode | Spot Metering</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 data-section id=\"know-your-camera-well\">Know your camera well</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Being familiar with your camera and its controls means you can concentrate more on the art of photography.

But the more you take charge of what your camera is doing, the more creative your photography becomes.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-with-caption\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1001\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/KL50720.jpg?resize=1500%2C1001&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Lahu man smoking a bong photograph with intent\" class=\"wp-image-196140\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/KL50720.jpg?w=1500&#38;ssl=1 1500w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/KL50720.jpg?resize=300%2C200&#38;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/KL50720.jpg?resize=600%2C400&#38;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/KL50720.jpg?resize=768%2C513&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/KL50720.jpg?resize=90%2C60&#38;ssl=1 90w, https://i1.wp.com/digital-photography-school.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/KL50720.jpg?resize=717%2C478&#38;ssl=1 717w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>© Kevin Landwer-Johan.
