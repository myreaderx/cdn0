Some of them focus exclusively on the region, while others invest elsewhere as well. As they explained, the city has a lot going for it: It&#8217;s diverse, has access to locally trained engineering and business workers, and the area has already fostered many companies that are doing very well.</p>\n<h2>Investors expect Toronto to remain a fintech hub</h2>\n<p>Fintech is one of the city&#8217;s top industries, and the investors in this survey expect this to continue. Stephanie Choo, head of investments at Portag3 Ventures, said &#8220;<a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/aax-b20d\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"aax-b20d\">fintech <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> continues to see massive tailwinds from the fallout from COVID-19 as incumbents struggle to fully digitize their offerings.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ameet Shah of Golden Ventures listed fintech as one of Toronto&#8217;s key industries. Eva Lau of Two Small Fish Ventures agreed, adding that &#8220;blockchain has also been doing well because many blockchain-related technologies or companies were started in Toronto.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Other investors point to fintech business leaders in Toronto like CEOs Mike Katchen of Wealthsimple, Daniel Eberhard of Koho, Andrew D’Souza and Michele Romanow of Clearbanc and Kirk Simpson of Wave Financial.</p>\n<h2>Diversity is one of Toronto&#8217;s strengths</h2>\n<p>Nearly all of the surveyed investors cited diversity as a key reason to live and work in Toronto. Probal Lala, chairman of Maple Leaf Angels, says, &#8220;Beyond having a vibrant technology ecosystem, Toronto has one of the most diverse communities in North America and is not only a great place to find the intellectual horsepower and funding to build a great global startup, but also the mosaic of social communities that makes it a great place to live and raise a family.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Choo said the United States&#8217; current battles over immigration could benefit Canada. &#8220;Small, nimble teams that need to move fast may still choose to co-locate in person — and many will still want access to amenities that only a large, vibrant and diverse city like Toronto can offer.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She also pointed to Toronto&#8217;s claim of being one of the most diverse cities in the world. &#8220;[This] not only makes the city interesting but also very welcoming for those who relocate from elsewhere; a strong startup and tech scene, and, lastly, a vibrant cultural and food scene, especially through the lens of cost-of-living compared to comparable major cities.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>Shopify&#8217;s executives are key players in Toronto&#8217;s ecosystem</h2>\n<p>Several VCs listed <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/shopify\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"shopify\">Shopify <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> executives as local leaders, while others acknowledged the growing unicorn&#8217;s impact. Ameet Shah of Golden Ventures says, &#8220;Toronto has traditionally been strong in fintech, B2B SaaS, crypto and AI. The explosion of Shopify should also benefit companies focused on e-commerce and supply chain solutions.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Adam McNamara and Ameet Shah, when asked about local business leaders, both listed Satish Kanwar. Kanwar is GM and VP of Product at Shopify after the company purchased Jet Cooper, a startup co-founded by Kanwar. McNamara also points to Farhan Thawar, Shopify&#8217;s VP of Engineering, as a local leader.</p>\n<h2>Who we spoke to:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Probal Lala, chairman, Maple Leaf Angels Capital Corporation</li>\n<li>Stephanie Choo, head of investments, Portag3 Ventures</li>\n<li>Adam McNamara, founding partner, Ramen VC</li>\n<li>Ameet Shah, partner, Golden Ventures</li>\n<li>Matt Golden, founder and managing partner, mGolden Ventures</li>\n<li>Eva Lau, founding partner, Two Small Fish Ventures</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2>Probal Lala, Maple Leaf Angels Capital Corporation</h2>\n<p><strong>How much is local investing even a focus for you now? If you are investing remotely in general now, are you filtering for local founders?</strong></p>\n<p>Prior to COVID-19 hitting, a requirement for the majority of my investments was a face-to-face visit with the founding team. For the most part, this meant founders spending time in Toronto. As we primarily invest in seed and pre-seed, this usually meant local founders.</p>\n<p>When the pandemic hit, we shifted our process to primarily Zoom meetings (including due diligence) and as a result the mix of founding teams has expanded beyond our typical catchment area (two-hour drive from the city) to a broader base. Investment cycles appear to have slowed a bit due to the remote approach but our reach to founding teams has expanded to a broader base of geographically distributed founding teams (Mostly Canadian although we have recently seen a number of international opportunities).<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=o2FIVcq_-mY:265Yj4swDgo:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=o2FIVcq_-mY:265Yj4swDgo:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=o2FIVcq_-mY:265Yj4swDgo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=o2FIVcq_-mY:265Yj4swDgo:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=o2FIVcq_-mY:265Yj4swDgo:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=o2FIVcq_-mY:265Yj4swDgo:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=o2FIVcq_-mY:265Yj4swDgo:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=o2FIVcq_-mY:265Yj4swDgo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/o2FIVcq_-mY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 16:58:59 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/toronto-map.jpg?w=711","linkMd5":"3f5bf8d6d56eb0e28eb93e37ae4a2b67","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn43@2020_2/2020/08/13/21-02-46-536_ab7657dda1bbb1fe.webp","author":"Matt Burns","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn16@2020_2/2020/08/13/21-02-47-117_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn72@2020_4/2020/08/13/21-02-47-718_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn67@2020_6/2020/08/13/21-02-47-143_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=o2FIVcq_-mY:265Yj4swDgo:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn56@2020_2/2020/08/13/21-02-46-291_461cdba1437688f5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=o2FIVcq_-mY:265Yj4swDgo:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn59@2020_4/2020/08/13/21-02-47-478_4ad237ba8f93431c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn15@2020_5/2020/08/13/21-02-48-142_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/o2FIVcq_-mY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn51@2020_6/2020/08/13/21-02-47-396_557348d2cb892e0d.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-14 05:02:41","updatedTime":"2020-08-14 05:02:41","title":"Twitter pledges to dial up efforts to combat election misinformation","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2031028","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">In the latest sign of U.S. platforms bracing for the 2020 U.S. presidential election in November, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"twitter\">Twitter <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> has said it will step up efforts to prevent its service from being used to target voters with false information around election participation.</p>\n<p>Earlier today <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"facebook\">Facebook <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> announced the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/13/facebook-election-voting-information-hub/\">launch of a voting hub</a> aimed at combating election misinformation on its platform by gathering together genuine election resources.</p>\n<p>Twitter is spinning a bolder message &#8212; saying its aim is to &#8220;empower every eligible person to register and vote&#8221; by working to surface accurate information.

And that&#8217;s where the Kontena and Lens acquisitions fit in. Managing Kubernetes clusters, after all, isn&#8217;t trivial &#8212; yet now developers are often tasked with managing and monitoring how their applications interact with their company&#8217;s infrastructure.</p>\n<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/04v2ODsmtIs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>\n<p>&#8220;Lens makes it dramatically easier for developers to work with Kubernetes, to build and deploy their applications on Kubernetes, and it&#8217;s just a huge obstacle-remover for people who are turned off by the complexity of Kubernetes to get more value,&#8221; he added.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very excited to see that we found a common vision with Adrian for how to incorporate Lens and how to make life for developers more enjoyable in this cloud-native technology landscape,&#8221; Miska Kaipiainen, the former CEO of Kontena and now Mirantis&#8217; director of Engineering, <span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">told me. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">He describes Lens as an IDE for Kubernetes. While you could obviously replicate Lens&#8217; functionality with existing tools, Kaipiainen argues that it would take 20 different tools to do this. &#8220;One of them could be for monitoring, another could be for logs. A third one is for command-line configuration, and so forth and so forth,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What we have been trying to do with Lens is that we are bringing all these technologies [together] and provide one single, unified, easy to use interface for developers, so they can keep working on their workloads and on their clusters, without ever losing focus and the context of what they are working on.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p>Among other things, Lens includes a context-aware terminal, multi-cluster management capabilities that work across clouds and support for the open-source <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/\">Prometheus monitoring service</a>.</p>\n<p>For Mirantis, Lens is a very strategic investment and the company will continue to develop the service. Indeed, Ionel said the Lens team now basically has unlimited resources.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead, Kaipiainen said the team is looking at adding extensions to Lens through an API within the next couple of months. &#8220;Through this extension API, we are actually able to collaborate and work more closely with other technology vendors within the cloud technology landscape so they can start plugging directly into the Lens UI and visualize the data coming from their components, so that will make it very powerful.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ionel also added that the company is working on adding more features for larger software teams to Lens, which is currently a single-user product. A lot of users are already using Lens in the context of very large development teams, after all.</p>\n<p>While the core Lens tools will remain free and open source, Mirantis will likely charge for some new features that require a centralized service for managing them. What exactly that will look like remains to be seen, though.</p>\n<p>If you want to give Lens a try, you can download the Windows, macOS and Linux binaries <a href=\"https://github.com/lensapp/lens/releases/tag/v3.5.2\">here</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=MKVAGkXCSr0:vKP6H_OKRmA:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=MKVAGkXCSr0:vKP6H_OKRmA:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=MKVAGkXCSr0:vKP6H_OKRmA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=MKVAGkXCSr0:vKP6H_OKRmA:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=MKVAGkXCSr0:vKP6H_OKRmA:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=MKVAGkXCSr0:vKP6H_OKRmA:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=MKVAGkXCSr0:vKP6H_OKRmA:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=MKVAGkXCSr0:vKP6H_OKRmA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/MKVAGkXCSr0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 16:00:19 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/header-lens.png","linkMd5":"85103a741017b9324b03597acc1a04c0","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn96@2020_6/2020/08/13/21-02-44-575_71054eb615e0dc8e.webp","author":"Frederic Lardinois","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/header-lens.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn96@2020_6/2020/08/13/21-02-44-575_71054eb615e0dc8e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn16@2020_2/2020/08/13/21-02-47-117_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn72@2020_4/2020/08/13/21-02-47-718_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn67@2020_6/2020/08/13/21-02-47-143_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=MKVAGkXCSr0:vKP6H_OKRmA:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn10@2020_5/2020/08/13/21-02-46-153_f46f3ad0ce986d46.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=MKVAGkXCSr0:vKP6H_OKRmA:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn63@2020_2/2020/08/13/21-02-47-112_6a36edcbab37006b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn15@2020_5/2020/08/13/21-02-48-142_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/MKVAGkXCSr0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn36@2020_1/2020/08/13/21-02-47-333_adf5b3a48717614a.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-14 05:02:41","updatedTime":"2020-08-14 05:02:41","title":"Apple boots Fortnite from the App Store after Epic adds direct payments","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2031344","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">After its creator <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/epic-games-2\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"epic-games-2\">Epic Games <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> implemented a workaround to duck Apple&#8217;s hefty developer fees, Fortnite has vanished from the App Store.

Coming soon, those unfurls will become a default feature within Slack, even if the user who is seeing the link isn&#8217;t an Atlassian user yet.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Today, if you do drop a Jira link in your channel and you&#8217;re not a user &#8212; or even if you are and you&#8217;re not authed in &#8212; you just see a link,&#8221; Brad Armstrong said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t get the benefit of the unfurl. And so one of the things we&#8217;re doing is making that unfurl available to everybody, regardless of whether you are logged in and regardless of whether you&#8217;re even an Atlassian customer.&#8221;</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2030801\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Trello_UI-GIF_Landing-Page.gif\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2030801\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2030801\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Trello_UI-GIF_Landing-Page.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"640\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2030801\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Atlassian</p></div></p>\n<p>The two companies also worked closely together on making moving between the products easier. If you are a Jira user, for example, you&#8217;ll soon be able to click on a link in Slack and if you&#8217;re not currently logged into your Atlassian account, you&#8217;ll be automatically logged in. The two companies are taking this even further by automatically creating Jira accounts for users when they come from Slack.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Even if you&#8217;re not a user, when you click on the link, we will then map you from Slack and create a Jira user for you that provisions you and auths you in so you&#8217;re immediately becoming a Jira user by virtue of wanting to collaborate on that piece of content in Slack,&#8221; Armstrong explained.</p>\n<p>That, the two companies argue, turns Slack into something akin to a passport that gives you access to the Atlassian product suite &#8212; and that should also make onboarding a lot easier for new users.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2030800\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Jira-Cloud_UI-GIF.gif\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2030800\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2030800\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Jira-Cloud_UI-GIF.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"640\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2030800\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Atlassian</p></div></p>\n<p>&#8220;As you could probably imagine, as you know, onboarding is a pain, it&#8217;s hard because you have different roles, different size teams, so on and so forth,&#8221; said Bryant Lee, Atlassian&#8217;s head of product partnerships. &#8220;And that&#8217;s where you see some of the authentication stuff, the unfurling discovery piece really being an understanding of what those practices are. But the way that we look at it is not just about the product but people, products and practices. So it&#8217;s really about understanding who it is that we&#8217;re trying to optimize for.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In addition to these new integrations that are launching soon, the two companies are also expanding their co-marketing efforts, starting with a new 50%-off offer for Atlassian users who want to also use Slack.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We’re building on the strong foundation of our partnership’s success from the past two years, which has yielded tremendous shared customer momentum and impactful product integrations,&#8221;

with Battery Ventures in San Francisco. He focuses on consumer internet, online marketplace and software investments.\t</div>\n\t\n\t</div>\n</div><p id=\"speakable-summary\">Telehealth, or remote, tech-enabled healthcare, has existed for years in primary medical care through companies like <a href=\"https://www.teladoc.com\">Teladoc</a> (NYSE: TDOC)<em>, </em><a href=\"https://www.doctorondemand.com\">Doctors on Demand</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mdlive.com\">MDLIVE</a>.</p>\n<p>In recent years, the application of telehealth had rapidly expanded to address specific chronic and behavioral health issues like mental health, weight loss and nutrition, addiction, diabetes and hypertension, etc. These are real and oftentimes very severe issues faced by people all over the world, yet until now have seen little to no use of technology in providing care.</p>\n<p>We believe behavioral health is particularly suited to benefit from the digitization trends COVID-19 has accelerated. Previously, we’ve written about the pandemic&#8217;s impact on online learning and education, both for <a href=\"https://www.battery.com/powered/online-education-is-having-its-moment-part-1-k-12/\">K-12 students</a> and <a href=\"https://www.battery.com/powered/online-education-adult-learners/\">adult learners</a>. But behavioral health is another area impacted by the fundamental change in consumers’ behavior today. Below are four reasons we think the time is now for behavioral health startups &#8212; followed by five key factors we think characterize successful companies in this area.</p>\n<h2>Telehealth can significantly lower the cost of care</h2>\n<p>Traditional behavioral healthcare is cost-prohibitive for most people. In-person therapy costs $100+ per session in the U.S., and many mental health and substance-use providers don’t accept insurance because they <a href=\"https://www.nami.org/Blogs/NAMI-Blog/March-2020/Health-Insurers-Still-Don-t-Adequately-Cover-Mental-Health-Treatment\">don’t get paid enough by insurers</a>.</p>\n<p>By contrast, telehealth reduces overhead costs and scales more effectively. Leveraging technology, providers can treat more patients in less time with almost zero marginal costs. Mobile-based communications enable asynchronous care that further helps providers scale. Access to digital content gives patients on-going support without the need for a human on the other side. This is particularly useful in treating behavioral health issues where ongoing support and motivation may be necessary.</p>\n<h2>Technology unlocks supply in &#8220;shadow markets&#8221; of providers</h2>\n<p>Globally, we face an extreme shortage of behavioral health providers. For example, the United States <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucejapsen/2018/02/25/psychiatrist-shortage-escalates-as-u-s-mental-health-needs-grow\">has fewer than 30,000 licensed psychiatrists</a> (translating to &#60;1 for every 10,000 people). Outside of big cities, the problem gets worse: <a href=\"https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(18)30005-9/fulltext\">~50-60% of nonmetro counties have no psychologists or psychiatrists</a> at all.</p>\n<p>Even when providers are available, wait times for appointments are notoriously long. This is a huge issue when behavioral health conditions often require timely intervention.</p>\n<p>We are seeing new platforms build large networks of certified coaches, licensed psychologists and psychiatrists, and other providers, aggregating supply in what has historically been a scarce and a highly fragmented provider population.</p>\n<h2>Behavioral/mental health issues are losing their stigma</h2>\n<p>We believe the stigma associated with mental illness and other behavioral health conditions is dissipating. More and more public figures are speaking out about their struggle with anxiety, depression, addiction and other behavioral health issues. Our zeitgeist is shifting fast, and there’s an all-time high in people seeking help as the Google Trends data below demonstrates.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2031233\" style=\"width: 690px\"

These <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/go-public-now-while-software-valuations-make-no-sense/\">frothy, booming times</a> make the larger effort to take software into new parts of the larger global economy all the more exciting.</p>\n<p>After all, if public SaaS companies are worth more than ever, startups themselves are inherently worth more, which means that even more capital should pour into the young companies that want to transform <em>software eating the world</em> from catchphrase into reality.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<p>To dig into the SaaS market this year, we&#8217;ve compiled a panel of well-known investors to chat with TechCrunch at <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/disrupt-sf-2020/?utm_medium=editpost&#38;utm_campaign=disruptsf2020&#38;utm_content=saas&#38;utm_source=tc&#38;promo=futureofsaaspost&#38;display=\">Disrupt this September 14-18</a>.

After weeks, perhaps months (but hopefully not years!), of work fundraising and pitching, there is nothing like getting that email with a PDF attached to it laying out the terms and conditions of the VC relationship going forward.</p>\n<p>Of course, that rejoicing dampens quickly as all the specific nuances of the deal suddenly come to the forefront. It’s one thing to get the valuation you want, or the amount of capital you are seeking, but what about the setup of the board of directors? What should you do about deal terms that may shape your startup for a decade or more?</p>\n<p>The reality of term sheets, as our guest Lior Zorea discusses, is that the terms you agree to early on at a startup tend to be the terms that will carry through for the life of the company. That means getting that first term sheet right is critical for ensuring the financial and capital success of your business.<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=3tm_vkiXxYE:GlNsXWORnd0:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=3tm_vkiXxYE:GlNsXWORnd0:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=3tm_vkiXxYE:GlNsXWORnd0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=3tm_vkiXxYE:GlNsXWORnd0:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=3tm_vkiXxYE:GlNsXWORnd0:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=3tm_vkiXxYE:GlNsXWORnd0:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=3tm_vkiXxYE:GlNsXWORnd0:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=3tm_vkiXxYE:GlNsXWORnd0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/3tm_vkiXxYE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 18:59:56 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-900220148.jpg?w=600","linkMd5":"b4aa0870b167cf11e8b8b551d67b0e3a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn23@2020_4/2020/08/13/21-02-46-193_20a32fc941b8f36d.webp","author":"Danny Crichton","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn16@2020_2/2020/08/13/21-02-47-117_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn72@2020_4/2020/08/13/21-02-47-718_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn67@2020_6/2020/08/13/21-02-47-143_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=3tm_vkiXxYE:GlNsXWORnd0:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn75@2020_3/2020/08/13/21-02-47-196_b40328556377fc63.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=3tm_vkiXxYE:GlNsXWORnd0:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx17/cdn28@2020_3/2020/08/13/21-02-46-115_9b1933551f3b6510.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn15@2020_5/2020/08/13/21-02-48-142_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/3tm_vkiXxYE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn88@2020_1/2020/08/13/21-02-47-267_92d55d27657edeb4.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-14 05:02:41","updatedTime":"2020-08-14 05:02:41","title":"Epic Games launches a campaign (and lawsuit) against Apple","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2031378","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Epic Games is launching an all-out campaign against Apple and its App Store rules.</p>\n<p>Thursday morning, Epic Games introduced a new payment mechanic through a server side update that allowed gamers to purchase Fortnite&#8217;s in-game currency directly, allowing the app to bypass Apple&#8217;s in-app purchase framework and the substantial cut that Apple takes.

The sales tech software company put together a $200 million round at a $2.2 billion valuation after raising several other rounds in recent quarters. As Ron reports, the company&#8217;s growth has been torrid, with 1,300 customers and 2.5x revenue growth &#8220;this year alone.&#8221; But most critically, Gong&#8217;s CEO Amit Bendov said that &#8220;there’s a lot of liquidity in the market.&#8221; Yep.<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=eDxQss_LZws:6KSb9HKE6Fw:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=eDxQss_LZws:6KSb9HKE6Fw:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=eDxQss_LZws:6KSb9HKE6Fw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=eDxQss_LZws:6KSb9HKE6Fw:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=eDxQss_LZws:6KSb9HKE6Fw:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=eDxQss_LZws:6KSb9HKE6Fw:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=eDxQss_LZws:6KSb9HKE6Fw:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=eDxQss_LZws:6KSb9HKE6Fw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/eDxQss_LZws\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 14:04:53 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NSussman_Techcrunch_Exchange_v3_RD.jpg?w=533","linkMd5":"bbb10fc6fd56323ae48d6f5ab83400b5","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn15@2020_5/2020/08/13/21-02-46-500_3f8b764dbb0d98ca.webp","author":"Alex Wilhelm","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn16@2020_2/2020/08/13/21-02-47-117_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn72@2020_4/2020/08/13/21-02-47-718_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn67@2020_6/2020/08/13/21-02-47-143_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=eDxQss_LZws:6KSb9HKE6Fw:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx20/cdn60@2020_4/2020/08/13/21-02-46-188_b5ce2a8bcef7f2f0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=eDxQss_LZws:6KSb9HKE6Fw:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn88@2020_2/2020/08/13/21-02-47-938_1773058aad86f976.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn15@2020_5/2020/08/13/21-02-48-142_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/eDxQss_LZws":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn82@2020_3/2020/08/13/21-02-46-097_fa00d85667fdc765.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-14 05:02:41","updatedTime":"2020-08-14 05:02:41","title":"Cube closes $5M Seed round to scale its financial planning software","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2031045","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">This morning <a href=\"https://www.cubesoftware.com/\">Cube</a> announced that it has closed a Seed round worth just over $5 million. The software startup, focused on financial planning and analysis (FP&#38;A) work, raised $3.8 million of the total recently, with remaining $1.25 million having come in an earlier Pre-Seed round.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/christinacalross/\">Christina Ross</a>, Cube&#8217;s CEO and founder, told TechCrunch that she started raising the most recent tranche of capital in March, winding up with a few term sheets within a few weeks. Eventually the startup picked <a href=\"https://www.bonfirevc.com/\">Bonfire Ventures</a>&#8216; <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/brettqueener/\">Brett Queener</a> to lead the round, with <a href=\"https://operatorcollective.com/\">Operator Collective</a>, <a href=\"https://www.clocktowerventures.com/\">Clocktower Technology Ventures</a>, <a href=\"https://www.avgfunds.com/\">Alumni Ventures Group</a>, <a href=\"https://www.techstars.com/\">Techstars</a>, and others taking part.</p>\n<p>So, what is FP&#38;A and why is <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/cubesoftware\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"cubesoftware\">Cube <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"></span></a> attracting so many interested investors? Let&#8217;s talk about both.</p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"></div>\n<h2>Attack the spreadsheets</h2>\n<p>There&#8217;s an old startup chestnut that I can&#8217;t source this morning, but goes something like this: If you want to know where to found a startup, just go to a big company, walk around until you figure out where they still use spreadsheets, and build something that will replace them. <em>Voilà</em>, you have a company.</p>\n<p>Ross is doing something similar with Cube.</p>\n<p>She detailed her work experience in an interview, noting stints at <a href=\"https://www.ge.com/\">GE</a>, at <a href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en.html\">Deloitte</a> doing financial work, at <a href=\"https://www.renttherunway.com/\">Rent The Runway</a> as employee 34 and first head of finance, at <a href=\"https://www.criteo.com/\">Criteo</a> where she was its North America head of finance, and, finally, at <a href=\"https://www.a.ki/\">Eyeview</a> as its CFO. She has helped growing companies manage and track their monetary resources, and draw a plan for the future.</p>\n<p>Or in industry-speak, she has spent a lot of time doing FP&#38;A, a business process where she says there are still too many old-fashioned spreadsheets.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s where Cube comes in. Ross noted during our chat that lots of what a CFO does is being automated, with Carta, Bill.com, Expensify, and other tools, but that FP&#38;A is still something of a crap experience.</p>\n<p>What Cube does is collect information from a company&#8217;s general ledger (think Quickbooks), CRM (say, Salesforce), and HRIS (ADP, perhaps) into a single repository. From there the company&#8217;s FP&#38;A denizens can control and sort the data, viewing it using Cube&#8217;s own visualization tool, spreadsheets, or web interface.</p>\n<p>Once you can see the information in a manner of your choosing, you can get to the real work of FP&#38;A, namely sketching out the future. What is that sketch good for? Providing a company&#8217;s leadership with profit and loss forecasting, and other operating details.</p>\n<p>In Ross&#8217;s conception, FP&#38;A is actually pretty simple. Put away all the numbers, it&#8217;s just telling the story of the past, and writing the story of the future for any given company.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a neat problem to solve, and one that Cube can charge handsomely for helping with. Pricing <a href=\"https://www.cubesoftware.com/pricing/\">for the company&#8217;s service</a> starts at $850 per month, and goes up from there (the startup also offers a discounted startup plan).</p>\n<p>But don&#8217;t worry, Cube isn&#8217;t trying to build a slightly better note taking app and then begging people to please, <em>please</em> pay for a pittance for it. The startup wants to build a part of companies&#8217; financial brains. And as its product will sit next to the nexus of spend and cash, the startup is probably right to demand a higher fee than we often see from less mission-critical SaaS products.</p>\n<p>Its business-importance and price point, we presume, were part of why Cube didn&#8217;t struggle to raise during a pandemic. Based in New York City, the startup intends to triple its staff size in the next year now that it has closed its funding cycle.</p>\n<p>Cube&#8217;s software isn&#8217;t something that I&#8217;ll ever use, but I&#8217;ve been at a startup at the time when it began to mature its accounting and finance functions. It&#8217;s a struggle to just get the numbers in line, let alone get the books so perfect that you can raise your eyes from the fine print to glance at the horizon. If Cube can help more companies do just that, it could do well for itself.</p>\n<p>More when Cube shares growth numbers.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"bAv2vj9583\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/04/software-stocks-set-new-records-despite-earnings-pandemic/\">Software stocks set new records despite earnings, pandemic</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Software stocks set new records despite earnings, pandemic&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/04/software-stocks-set-new-records-despite-earnings-pandemic/embed/#?secret=bAv2vj9583\" data-secret=\"bAv2vj9583\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=8DzXgkxnZRI:S1PtVpRnz8s:2mJPEYqXBVI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=8DzXgkxnZRI:S1PtVpRnz8s:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=8DzXgkxnZRI:S1PtVpRnz8s:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=8DzXgkxnZRI:S1PtVpRnz8s:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=8DzXgkxnZRI:S1PtVpRnz8s:-BTjWOF_DHI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=8DzXgkxnZRI:S1PtVpRnz8s:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=8DzXgkxnZRI:S1PtVpRnz8s:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?a=8DzXgkxnZRI:S1PtVpRnz8s:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/8DzXgkxnZRI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 14:15:38 +0000","feedId":26,"bgimg":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-1216725141.jpg?w=640","linkMd5":"73a37908c8cf7788fcc022f18db243c5","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn7@2020_3/2020/08/13/21-02-48-500_4875c7679444f596.webp","author":"Alex Wilhelm","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=2mJPEYqXBVI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn16@2020_2/2020/08/13/21-02-47-117_cda007d67cf2c798.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=7Q72WNTAKBA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn72@2020_4/2020/08/13/21-02-47-718_6be3d6b3141e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn67@2020_6/2020/08/13/21-02-47-143_ae8500a395ae4c74.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=8DzXgkxnZRI:S1PtVpRnz8s:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn75@2020_6/2020/08/13/21-02-46-151_3d666741a776d7de.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?i=8DzXgkxnZRI:S1PtVpRnz8s:D7DqB2pKExk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx17/cdn84@2020_4/2020/08/13/21-02-47-784_bc70cbf569065947.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Techcrunch?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn15@2020_5/2020/08/13/21-02-48-142_749e2568e12b832a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~4/8DzXgkxnZRI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn62@2020_6/2020/08/13/21-02-46-232_86203c43861a474b.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-14 05:02:41","updatedTime":"2020-08-14 05:02:41","title":"Starting with Michigan, Sidewalk Infrastructure is looking to build roads specifically for autonomous cars","link":"https://techcrunch.com/?p=2031121","description":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"https://sidewalkinfra.com/\">Sidewalk Infrastructure Partners</a>, which spun out of Alphabet&#8217;s Sidewalk Labs to fund and develop the next generation of infrastructure, has taken the covers off its first big project &#8212; the launch of a subsidiary called <a href=\"https://cavnue.com/\">Cavnue</a> to develop roadways for connected and autonomous vehicles.</p>\n<p>Starting in Michigan, Cavnue will be working with partners including Ford, GM, Argo AI, Arrival, BMW, Honda, Toyota, TuSimple and Waymo on standards to develop the physical and digital infrastructure needed to move connected and autonomous cars out of pilot projects and onto America&#8217;s highways, freeways, interstates and city streets.</p>\n<p>The starting point for Cavnue is a 40-mile corridor between downtown Detroit and Ann Arbor, Michigan that will be dedicated to autonomous vehicles.

Now Ford is a key partner in Cavnue&#8217;s project.</p>\n<p>However, there are numerous others that Cavnue is also leaning on, including the University of Michigan with its CAV research center and Mcity Test Facility, Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI) and facilities along the proposed corridor, as well as the testing facility American Center for Mobility.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;My vision for Michigan Central is to create an open mobility innovation district that solves tomorrow’s transportation challenges and improves mobility access for everyone,” said Ford, the executive chairman of his eponymous car company, in a statement. &#8220;Building out a connected corridor cements Michigan as a leader in creating a more connected, autonomous and electrified future.

Vehicles could be scaled up and down according to demand, and shared routes could speed efficiency and reduce the time it takes to get to a destination, these planners said.</p>\n<p>Financing could come from the manufacturers of autonomous systems who would get new testing grounds for their technology and eventually individuals who owned cars with advanced driving systems could pay for access to the lanes using the dead space between public transit vehicles.</p>\n<p>Ostensibly, someone could pay $10 to access the road and then put their vehicle into autonomous mode. Public transit and private delivery fleets would be prioritized, and a vehicle would have to demonstrate it has autonomous capabilities to even access the roadways.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1479485\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1479485\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1479485\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/11.jpg\" alt=\"Autonomous Vehicle\" width=\"1024\" height=\"562\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/11.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/11.jpg?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/11.jpg?resize=300,165 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/11.jpg?resize=768,422 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/11.jpg?resize=680,373 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/11.jpg?resize=50,27 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-1479485\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Getty Images</p></div></p>\n<p>The new service would depend on a new type of public-private partnership based on outcomes that could be measured by the number of public fare rates the new lanes generate.

Upholding the target in this uncertain era of COVID-19 is newsworthy on its own.

But Lyft&#8217;s executive team said rides continued to recover from the doldrums of this spring and early summer. Ridership will need to continue to recover, but the company insists that measures it has taken will allow it to reach profitability. <div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"></div><div
