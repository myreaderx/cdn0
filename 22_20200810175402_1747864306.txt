And with <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-last-graduating-class-affordability-crisis-student-loans-housing-2019-5?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=referral\">total student debt surpassing&nbsp;$1.5 trillion this year</a>, college has never been a greater financial burden.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, for families who simply can't afford higher education, a select few schools charge nothing for tuition. However, there are still outside costs like room and board and the cost of books.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Unlike many European countries where <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/things-governments-around-the-world-pay-for-america-doesnt-2018-9?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=referral\">free (or ultra-low cost) higher education</a> is widely available, there are only a handful of tuition-free undergraduate universities and graduate programs across the US. The most recent addition is <a href=\"https://weill.cornell.edu/\">Weill Cornell Medical College</a>, Cornell University's New York City-based medical school, which <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/16/us/weill-cornell-free.html?fbclid=IwAR0id7-Cbg2jVmmIProy41jl_u2iDynKkDsL_ksNFy5t8la0ycV8Pt8R1qo\">announced</a> in 2019 that it would waive tuition and all other costs (like housing, books, and food) for those who qualify for financial aid.</p>\n<p>Other free schools include smaller institutions (like Barclay College and Webb Institute), as well as some prestigious military academies (like West Point and the United States Coast Guard Academy).</p>\n<p>Interestingly, some previously tuition-free schools are finding it untenable to remain so. For example, The Cooper Union in New York City didn't charge for tuition <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/cooper-union-architecture-students-crowdfunding-2013-12?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=referral\">until 2013</a>, at which point it began charging students for the first time in over 100 years. (The university is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/15/nyregion/cooper-union-free-tuition.html\">planning to go tuition-free once again</a> within 10 years.)</p>\n<p>Here are 14 American universities and graduate programs where tuition is covered.</p><h3>1.

look brighter and more colorful than ever &mdash; here's everything you need to know about this must-have display feature</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>A quality TV is the centerpiece of any home entertainment system, but finding the right display for your needs and the right price for your wallet can be challenging. When shopping for a TV, there are many different aspects to consider, including size, panel type, resolution, HDR support, smart TV platform, and more.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you're looking for a display with genuine home theater performance in mind, then you'll likely want to opt for a 65-inch- or- larger premium 4K TV. The <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-4k-tv?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=referral\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">best 4K TVs</a> typically use an <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-oled-tv?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=referral\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OLED panel</a>, or a high-end LED panel with quantum dots and local dimming. These display types will provide you with the best contrast, black levels, and brightness performance for dazzling <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-hdr-tv?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=referral\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">high dynamic range</a> (HDR) images.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For buyers who simply want a reliable TV for casual viewing, however, a smaller screen and a more budget-friendly LED panel should get the job done just fine. Though picture quality won't be quite as impressive as more expensive display types, there are many <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-tv-under-500-dollars?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=referral\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">affordable LED TVs</a> out there with solid performance. And, while 4K resolution and built-in smart TV interfaces were once thought of as premium features, nowadays even entry-level TVs come with 4K panels and smart TV capabilities as default features.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Once you've settled on the basics for what you're looking for in a new display, there are plenty of deals readily available from all of the major TV manufacturers, including Sony, Samsung, LG, Vizio, TCL, and Hisense. To help narrow things down, we've rounded up all of the best TV deals available right now.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It should be noted, however, that many companies are currently in the process of rolling out their latest 2020 TV models to retailers. While these new displays rarely get discounts right away, manufacturers tend to use this time to provide big deals on their older stock. With that in mind, the TV deals highlighted below are primarily for 2019 models.

Unlike traditional LED TVs (which use LCD panels), OLED TVs don't require a backlight. Instead, every pixel is able to produce its own light or shut off completely. This enables OLED displays to produce superior black levels, contrast, and viewing angles compared to regular LED models. With that said, OLED panels can't get as bright as LED TVs, and they can be susceptible to burn-in if you leave a static image on the screen for hours on end.</p>\n<p>For most buyers, however, the pros of OLED tech far outweigh the cons. Of course, the high-end picture performance of an OLED TV typically comes with a high price tag. Thankfully, OLED TVs from LG and Sony often go on sale.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The best OLED TV deal available right now is for the <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=EHFxW6yx8Uo&amp;mid=44583&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Flg-oled-cx-65%2Fp%2F16C-000P-004G1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow nofollow noopener sponsored sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">LG 65-inch CX 4K TV</a>.

Though this tech does have some drawbacks when it comes to black levels and viewing angles, high-end LED TVs are still capable of very impressive picture quality with industry-leading brightness. High brightness is particularly desirable for the best <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-hdr-tv?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=referral\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HDR</a> performance, allowing highlights to really pop from the screen.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Many high-end LED TVs are branded as QLED TVs since they include quantum dot technology. This feature allows the displays to achieve a wide color gamut for more accurate and rich colors. Premium LED TVs typically include full-array local dimming as well, enabling the backlight to dim in specific zones across the screen.
