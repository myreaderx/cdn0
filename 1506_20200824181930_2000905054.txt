It is possible these APIs could then automatically translate over to Mac apps using Catalyst, which currently lacks an API for changing mouse cursor type.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>As with the addition of the Apple Pencil, some people will decry the addition of proper pointing-device support to iPadOS as a dilution of the core iPad interface.</p>\n<p>But the introduction of the Pencil and Smart Keyboard in late 2015 did nothing to dilute the iPad interface. Rather, they provided <em>alternatives</em> for those who wanted to use them. At no point do I sit with my iPad and say to myself, “Wow, I’d like to do this but this app requires a keyboard”<sup id=\"fnref-10810-luna\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-10810-luna\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup> or “It’s a shame the Apple Pencil isn’t handy, because I’m stuck.” It just never happens. These new methods of controlling the iPad interface are additive. If you never use a mouse or a trackpad or a keyboard or a pencil, you should never notice a difference.</p>\n<p>I’m very excited about the prospect of Apple going all-in on cursor support in iPadOS 14. It opens the door for real external monitor support, the possibility of large-screen Surface Studio type devices powered by iPadOS, and a lot more.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr><ol><li id=\"fn-10810-luna\">\nThere’s one exception: Luna Display, which is not really intended to be used the way I’m using it.

Of course, that doesn’t stop industry watchers from peering at the tea leaves to see if they can divine exactly what the company might be working on.</p>\n<p>And, hey, I’m no different than those folks, because Apple does so little to telegraph its plans that even a boilerplate statement confirming an acquisition is a rare peek behind the curtain.

It’s the worst, isn’t it? Case in point: When Apple adjusted the behavior of Safari tabs on the Mac to always open after the current tab, I—a die-hard always-put-new-tabs-at-the-end lifer—was bereft. For a while, I subsisted on the <a href=\"http://lrasinen.kapsi.fi/OpenAtEnd/\">OpenAtEnd Safari extension</a>, but when the more recent macOS updates killed off the legacy Safari plugin infrastructure, I lost my only recourse.</p>\n<p>Until the <a href=\"https://rhymeswithdiploma.com\">eagle-eyed TJ Luoma</a> noticed that Safari’s hidden Debug menu contained an option to control the tab-opening behavior, including options to open new tabs at the end:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/gruber?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@gruber</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jsnell?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@jsnell</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dmoren?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@dmoren</a> ISTR that I've heard talk about frustrations with where Safari on the Mac opens new tabs in relation to existing tabs. I just noticed this setting in Safari’s “Debug\" menu, and wondered if it might fix the issue? Maybe it's new? Thought it worth mentioning <a href=\"https://t.co/vFvWs3TE2d\">pic.twitter.com/vFvWs3TE2d</a></p>\n<p>— TJ Luoma (@tjluoma) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tjluoma/status/1237533889104506880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 11, 2020</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>Sounded like exactly what I was looking for! Off on a quest I went. First step: figure out how to enable the Debug menu. Note that this is different from the <em>Develop</em> menu, which can be enabled with a simple checkbox in the Advanced pane of Safari’s Preferences. The Debug menu is intended for internal testing usage, so enabling it requires a trip to the Terminal and use of the <code>defaults</code> command.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the new security strictures put in place in macOS Mojave and Catalina mean that the old Terminal commands don’t always work. After a little poking around, I discovered that in order to use some of them, you first must make sure that Terminal has Full Disk Access in the System Preferences &#62; Security &#38; Privacy pane. (Note, of course, that you are deliberately weakening some aspects of macOS’s protections by doing that, since the Terminal app now has access to every file on your disk—though that was more or less the case in previous versions of macOS.)</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/systemprefs-fulldiskaccess-terminal-6c.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"Security &#38; Privacy pane\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>Enable Full Disk Access for Terminal before issuing the command below.</figcaption></figure><p>Once you’ve done that, you can issue the following command in Terminal:</p>\n<p><code>defaults write com.apple.Safari IncludeInternalDebugMenu 1</code></p>\n<p>You’ll then need to restart Safari, and voila! The Debug menu has appeared. To enable the tab-opening behavior, go all the way to the bottom of the menu and choose Tab Ordering &#62; Position of New Tabs &#62; After Last Tab. And, in order to make sure that tabs opened via links follow the same behavior, make sure to check off Tab Ordering &#62; Apply Position to Spawned Tabs and, for good measure, Apply Position to All Blank Tabs (or whatever combination thereof you prefer).</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/safari-tab-position-6c.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"Safari Tab Opening\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>It’s unclear how long these options will last—in theory they could be removed in any future build, or, at the very least, require you to go through this dance again.

While there are still plenty of sites devoted to covering Apple, us included, its status as one of the most valuable companies in the world is a far cry from the scrappy upstart it once was. Apple news is now mainstream business news, because as it moves, so moves much of the economy. It’s tougher than ever to find a news story that isn’t covered on a dozen other sites.

Now, components delivered under the same Entertainment Identifier Registry ID can be grouped in multiple combinations, laying the groundwork to support user-selected aspect ratio preference while maintaining existing content interaction features.</p>\n<p>  By creating the facets-based content model, DSS also was able to reuse thousands of audio and subtitle components that already existed for the 428 episodes on Disney Plus, along with episode-specific artwork and other metadata.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>To turn this on, you need to tap on the Details tab in “The Simpsons” and then turn off “Remastered Aspect Ratio.” And if you’re watching on an iPad, you’ll need to use two fingers to pinch outward in order to watch it without a big black border around the whole thing.</p>\n<p>I really appreciated Spangler’s deep dive into how a “simple” problem is actually much more complex than you might think. By altering their data model, Disney+ is now able to associate two separate video versions of an episode while keeping the subtitles and audio tracks consistent.</p>\n<p>It also paves the way for other alternate views of content. for example, TV shows with remastered special effects could be viewed with the new effects or the originals intact<sup id=\"fnref-10983-nope\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-10983-nope\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">2</a></sup>. Or you could offer an alternate version of a show with no VFX at all. More flexibility is good.</p>\n<p>That all said, there’s no reason for the cropped 16:9 versions of “The Simpsons” to exist at all. They were made in 4:3 aspect ratio and they should only be seen in that format. At least now Disney+ subscribers have the option.

A Sonos spokesperson confirmed that the Trade Up program will continue, but recycling mode is no more. If you want to get the 30 percent discount, you just need to prove you own one of the eligible “legacy” products by validating its serial number. Once that’s done, you can apply the discount to anything Sonos is currently selling at its online store. Indeed, the “Trade Up” name isn’t exactly accurate, because you can continue using the legacy hardware as long as you want. Sonos says you can give it to a friend, keep using it yourself, sell it, recycle it, send it to them — it doesn’t matter.

Like, a <em>lot</em>. And though I occasionally dip in and out of albums, listening to a track here or there, more often than not I’m using them as background music while writing or walking, starting from the first track and listening all the way through the end.</p>\n<figure class=\"pull-right\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/album-play-music.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"Music on iOS\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></figure><p>Here’s the problem, though. Sometimes, I take a break from the album to play a song from somewhere else—for example, last night I <em>needed</em> to subject my wife to They Might Be Giant’s “Shoehorn with Teeth.” Alas, this morning, when I opened the Music app for my walk to the coffee shop, intent upon picking up where I left off on the <em>Rise of Skywalker</em> soundtrack<sup id=\"fnref-11027-episodeix\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-11027-episodeix\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup>, I realized that I had lost my place.</p>\n<p>There are some workarounds for this, especially if you’re a careful user of the Up Next queue, but I certainly don’t remember to put things in the queue all the time. Fortunately, I was able to scroll back through the history of tracks I’d played and see the last cue from the album that I had listened to.</p>\n<p>But I think it would be cool if there were, say, an “Album Play” mode, perhaps triggered by a long press on the Play button in Music’s album screen. I envision this borrowing some functionality from the Podcasts app, which always remembers not only which episode you were listening to but exactly where you were, because nobody wants to try and find the place where they stopped listening.</p>\n<p>So in this Album Play mode, even if you went away to play a different song from a totally different place, you could Resume the album playback exactly where you left off. Moreover, maybe it’s an opportunity for Apple to finally do some style of Handoff for Music, letting you then pick up the album playback on a different device. (Again, Podcasts has long offered this functionality.)</p>\n<p>I realize this might be of kind of limited appeal, but it seems to me the kind of feature that Steve Jobs—music fan that he was—might approve of. Listening to an album is a kind of sacred experience, like reading a book or watching a movie.

I was focusing mostly on AirDrop, whose behavior doesn’t really make sense in a world where there’s a filesystem exposed on every iOS device. But along the way I also saved time to complain about the mystifying relationship between file types and apps on iOS and iPadOS.</p>\n<p>That relationship turns out to be even weirder than I imagined. On Tuesday on Twitter, there was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gruber/status/1232188831312613378\">a whole back-and-forth</a> among John Gruber, Federico Viticci, and Steve Troughton-Smith about how Files handles files, including a bunch of stuff that I don’t think I ever realized.</p>\n<p>The Files app never wants to let you open a bunch of file types directly in an external editor. PDFs and audio and video files? Forget it—those open in Quick Look if you tap on them or tap Open in the Get Info view<sup id=\"fnref-11011-except\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-11011-except\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup> (which is the same view that appears if you tap on a file when you’re in <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/02/25/files-app-list-and-column-view\">column view</a>).

From the resulting share sheet, choose an app from the list of apps at the very top, or swipe all the way to the end of the list and tap More to see even more options. What you want is an option to “Open in <em>[name of app]</em>.” In my case, I remapped a Markdown file that was going to open in Ulysses and told it to open in 1Writer instead.</p>\n<p>With that done, all my Markdown files now open in 1Writer when I tap on them in a list.

I had <em>no</em> idea that was a thing you could do.</p>\n<p>Which was sort of my original point. I know it’s been open season on the deficiencies of the iPad’s interface lately, but it does feel like portions of the iPad have progressed enough to have reached a sort of uncanny valley.

It’s great to be able to have a single app to focus on for controlling smart home devices, and Apple’s Home app is deeply integrated into its devices. Adding items to HomeKit also makes them available for <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/02/drying-out-a-moldy-bedroom%E2%80%94-a-homekit-adventure/\">automations</a>, another feature of HomeKit that I’ve been tinkering with lately.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/epbruff/status/1255623454444920832\">Inspired by listener Erick Brough</a>, I recently upgraded to version 1.0 of Homebridge, and it’s a huge leap forward, most notably with a better integration of a web interface for controlling the thing.</p>\n<p>To install Homebridge, you’ve first got to install Node.js, and then run a few Terminal commands to get Homebridge and the Homebridge web interface up and running. The <a href=\"https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge/wiki/Install-Homebridge-on-macOS\">details are on the Homebridge GitHub page</a> and they’re pretty straightforward. If you’re not comfortable using Terminal commands, I don’t recommend HomeBridge.</p>\n<p>My own upgrade to version 1.0 was a little more fraught, but it was a problem solved by uninstalling my existing version of Homebridge, then following the instructions to reinstall it. (All my existing settings remained intact across the reinstall.)</p>\n<p>The web interface for controlling Homebridge really is excellent. It checks to see if your Homebridge plugins have available updates, and offers you a one-click update. You can browse a library of plug-ins and install them directly. It’s easy to update Homebridge itself, right from the same interface. Some settings are editable from right within the web interface, rather than needing to edit a configuration file. But if you do need to do down-and-dirty configuration by editing the JSON file in which the app stores all its preferences, you can even do that from the web interface if you so desire.</p>\n<p>I was already a fan of Homebridge, but this update makes it so much better. If you’ve got a bunch of HomeKit-incompatible devices and an always-on server or NAS box (or even a Raspberry Pi), I highly recommend giving Homebridge a try.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 04 May 2020 23:23:19 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/homebridge-web-interface.jpg?ssl=1","linkMd5":"305401b51e561bd28caf33eeca4a41ad","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn56@2020_6/2020/08/24/18-19-08-616_f69c8b2339a77551.webp","destWidth":1360,"destHeight":1020,"sourceBytes":59374,"destBytes":59374,"author":"Jason Snell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/homebridge-web-interface.jpg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn56@2020_6/2020/08/24/18-19-08-616_f69c8b2339a77551.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144256},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"The iPad cursor is here, no wait required","link":"http://two.wordpress.test/post/2020/03/the_ipad_cursor_is_here_no_wait_required/","description":"<figure><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ipad-cursor.gif?ssl=1\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></figure><p>Support for mice and trackpads on iPadOS is real. In a world that’s gotten awfully <a href=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/FDozeGywZKu6Q/giphy.gif\">used to disappointment</a> lately, it’s far better than <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/offsite/2020/01/why-the-ipad-needs-to-embrace-mice-and-trackpads/\">I imagined</a>. And we don’t even have to wait until the fall to use it, because it’s going to arrive on every iPad capable of running iPadOS 13 next week as a part of the forthcoming iPadOS 13.4 update.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday morning, Apple announced <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/03/apples-brand-new-ipad-pro-has-lidar-and-a-trackpad/\">new iPad Pro models</a> that will ship next week, just like iPadOS 13.4. But it <em>also</em> announced a new iPad Pro accessory, the Magic Keyboard, which includes a trackpad. According to Apple, that device won’t even start shipping until May, and if 2020 has taught us anything, it’s that <a href=\"https://genius.com/Death-cab-for-cutie-what-sarah-said-lyrics\">every plan is a tiny prayer to father time</a>.</p>\n<p>That new Magic Keyboard looks amazing, but it’s for the future. iPadOS 13.4 is for today (if you’re using beta versions) or for next week (for everyone else). That means that you don’t need Apple’s fancy (and pricey!) Smart Keyboard to drive your iPad with a mouse or trackpad. The Magic Trackpad 2 will work—believe it or not, up to now the iPad didn’t support it—including all its multitouch gestures.</p>\n<figure class=\"youtube\"><p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jijhJj_rNDI\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n</figure><p>It’s important to note that if you <em>don’t</em> attach a mouse or trackpad or keyboard to your iPad, nothing will change. The iPad is, at its core, a touchscreen tablet. You should never, ever find yourself in a situation where you can’t do something on an iPad if you don’t have a mouse or trackpad handy.</p>\n<p>Using the iPad with a mouse or trackpad feels surprisingly familiar. Activate a pointing device, and a circular cursor (one that’s much smaller than the cursor included in iOS 13’s Assistive Touch accessibility ferature) appears on your screen. If you don’t move the cursor, it’ll vanish after a couple of seconds. Slide it over interface elements and it’ll vanish, but the interface element below it will highlight in a delightful, animated way, indicating that if you click, you’ll be activating that element. Keep moving the cursor and the circle will return as you exit that element.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ipad-cursor2.gif?ssl=1\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></figure><p>In a huge boost for anyone who writes and edits text on the iPad, if you move that cursor over a text area, it transforms into a text-editing I-beam cursor, making it much easier to move the cursor and select text.</p>\n<p>Apple says that most apps will work with this feature right out of the box, though there will probably be some quirks—there always are.  But app developers will be gaining extra tools to let their apps specifically support the cursor if they want. (It seems that if apps implement nonstandard text fields, for example, they’ll need to make modifications to support the text-editing cursor.) I’m looking forward to remote-desktop apps like Edovia’s <a href=\"https://edovia.com/en/\">Screens</a> supporting the cursor (if they can), and it seems like the iOS 13 feature of “desktop-class browsing” is going to gain support for cursor hovering, a concept that was previously incompatible with the iPad’s touch interface.</p>\n<p>Cursor support is good, but if iPadOS 13 Assistive Touch taught me anything, it’s that it’s no fun driving a simulated finger with a mouse—every natural finger swipe gets transformed into an ugly click-and-drag. That’s more or less resolved by iPadOS 13.4’s gesture support. Want to delete or archive a message in Mail? Move the cursor over it and swipe left or right, just as you’d do on the Mac.</p>\n<p>These gestures really shine when it comes to multitouch shortcuts. A two-finger click instantly brings up a context menu. Swipe up with three fingers slowly and you’ll get the multitasking view—and if you do it quickly, you’ll get the Home screen. Swipe left or right to move between apps.</p>\n<p>Apple has also solved the issue of how to handle gestures that were designed around swiping from the edges of the screen, like activating Slide Over or viewing Control Center or Notification Center. It works like this: You move your cursor to the boundary, and then make a second gesture in the same direction—as if you’re pushing to go a little further in that direction. That will activate the interface that’s located on that edge. The contents of the status bar at the top of the screen will also highlight when you move your cursor over them, and you can click to activate Notification Center (left) or Control Center (right).</p>\n<p>Rolling out these features in iPadOS 13.4 makes sense, given the arrival of that new Magic Keyboard. But it also makes me excited about what iPadOS 14 might have in store, given this head start. The ability to extend the interface to an external monitor (not just mirroring or offering an app-specific output like Keynote) rockets up my wish list, since the iPad can now be controlled entirely without a touchscreen. And I’m going to reheat all of my “<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3238186/why-apples-next-laptop-should-run-ios.html\">laptop that runs iPadOS</a>” dreams again.</p>\n<p>The bottom line: Months before that Magic Keyboard arrives, iPadOS 13.4 will make the iPad vastly more usable if you use an external keyboard, because you can now pair it with a pointing device. While you might assume that the makers of third-party accessories might be disappointed by Apple’s entry, I think there’s plenty of room for cheaper accessories than the Magic Keyboard. And of course, even iPads that aren’t the iPad Pro can take advantage of these features, via accessories like the newly announced <a href=\"https://store.apple.com/xc/product/HP312ZM/A\">Logitech Combo Touch Keyboard Case with Trackpad for iPad</a>.</p>\n<p>Or just bring your own keyboard, mouse, and iPad stand. The door is wide open. I’m looking forward to see where the iPad goes from here.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 18 Mar 2020 20:55:00 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ipad-cursor.gif?ssl=1","linkMd5":"2c9652a30e06880fe37df64d780a4530","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn28@2020_5/2020/08/24/18-19-07-064_12509ce7e3a96431.webp","destWidth":600,"destHeight":203,"sourceBytes":373327,"destBytes":177960,"author":"Jason Snell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ipad-cursor.gif?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn28@2020_5/2020/08/24/18-19-07-064_12509ce7e3a96431.webp","https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ipad-cursor2.gif?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn46@2020_5/2020/08/24/18-19-14-493_9f5b3a09cf23b752.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144593},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"6C Podcast: May 15, 2020","link":"http://com.sixcolors.podcast.9753","description":"<p>Imagining an ARM Mac that’s unlike any computer ever—except the iPad.

That’s long been the biggest challenge with digital media, essentially boiling down into two camps: the first, unprotected media that can be shared in a totally unlimited fashion (which rights holders aren’t usually jazzed about), and the second, protected media that can’t be shared at all (which annoys consumers).</p>\n<p>There’s a closed beta of this feature launching this afternoon; a wider beta will hit in May, and the feature should launch later this year.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/17/21182425/movies-anywhere-screen-pass-feature-share-loan-digital-movies-friends\">Go to the linked site</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/link/2020/03/movies-anywhere-testing-loaning-digital-movies-to-friends/\">Read on Six Colors</a>.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 17 Mar 2020 13:53:21 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"2a22b538b9ffbce58e26b1bdb736bfc8","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Dan Moren","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144599},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"(Podcast) #282: The iPad at 10","link":"http://two.wordpress.test/post/2020/01/282_the_ipad_at_10/","description":"<p>It’s the 10th anniversary of the announcement of the iPad!

As someone who owns an iPhone, iPad, iMac, and MacBook Air, I was a bit put out by this change: I kept all my important files in Dropbox and relied on its syncing magic to have access to that data no matter which device I was using.</p>\n<p>This wasn’t my first frustration with Dropbox, which has started focusing more on enterprise software rather than its core functionality of document sync. So I decided to bite the bullet and make the switch, moving to iCloud Drive for all my cloud storage needs.</p>\n<p>Overall, the transition has been largely smooth, but it has put into relief a few places where iCloud Drive currently just can’t match Dropbox. One of those features, the ability to share folders, looks to finally be arriving in iOS 13.4, the beta of which was released this week. But before I’m finally able to kick Dropbox to the curb, there are a few more tweaks that iCloud Drive needs.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3520791/folder-sharing-brings-icloud-drive-closer-to-dropbox-but-theres-work-left-to-do.html\">Continue reading on Macworld</a>.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 07 Feb 2020 06:32:30 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"4d32b18a68f3c76e569a0bf53739afe8","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Dan Moren","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144632},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"Apple closes the book on iBooks Author","link":"http://two.wordpress.test/post/2020/06/apple_closes_the_book_on_ibooks_author/","description":"<figure class=\"pull-right\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ibooks-author-6c-1.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"ibooks-author\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ibooks-author/id490152466?ls=1&#38;mt=12\">iBooks Author</a>, Apple’s application for creating and publishing ebooks, wrote its last chapter on Wednesday. The company announced that the <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211136\">app will be discontinued for new users as of July 1, 2020</a>.</p>\n<p>iBooks Author came out back in a January 2012 Apple special event in New York City, which I actually attended. The app was announced in conjunction with a big push from Apple on publishing digital textbooks to the then iBookstore (now Apple Books); iBooks Author was specifically designed to help create those textbooks, with a focus on design for multitouch and interactivity.</p>\n<p>However, iBooks Author was, at first, pretty limited: among other things, it could only export to either Apple’s own .ibooks format or to a PDF; it wasn’t until 2015 that the company added the ability to publish books in the standard ePub format, though the iBooks Author format itself was based on ePub. That update also saw the ability to, for the first time, create multi-touch books designed not just for the iPad, but also the iPhone, another long-awaited feature.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Apple’s textbook initiative never quite took off the way the company had clearly hoped, and development on iBooks Author was always kind of slow. The last substantial update to the app came in September 2018, adding only minor stability and performance updates. (It also probably didn’t help that Apple found itself <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2453997/apple-reaches-400-million-settlement-with-states-over-ebook-price-fixing.html\">in hot water with the U.S. government over ebook price-fixing in the early 2010s</a>.)</p>\n<p>Over time, iBooks Author has had more competition from other sources, most notably from Apple itself. The company has in recent years added more and more publishing features to its free Pages word processor, allowing those looking to create ebooks the ability to both write <em>and</em> publish a book using the same app, rather than having to use separate tools. Third party apps like Scrivener and Vellum both provide deep ebook publishing features as well, as I detailed in <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/05/from-cover-to-cover-adventures-in-self-publishing/\">my own ebook experiments earlier this year</a>.</p>\n<p>Thus, unsurprisingly, Apple’s announcement of iBooks Author’s end of life points users towards Pages as a substitute. While the app may not duplicate all of the features of iBooks Author, it seems as though Apple is committed to continuing to improve the publishing experience. For one thing, Apple says it will be offering an import feature in an upcoming update that will allow users to open and edit iBooks Author files.</p>\n<p>iBooks Author will continue to function if you’ve already installed it; if you’ve downloaded it in the past, you can still get it from your purchase history in the Mac App Store. However, it seems as though it won’t necessarily be supported on versions of macOS past Catalina.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 10 Jun 2020 18:07:57 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ibooks-author-6c-1.jpg?ssl=1","linkMd5":"eca958d62db982d2c20a645b5c3d831f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn4@2020_4/2020/08/24/18-19-06-473_7c4caee957b8e5fd.webp","destWidth":680,"destHeight":680,"sourceBytes":24584,"destBytes":24584,"author":"Dan Moren","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ibooks-author-6c-1.jpg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn4@2020_4/2020/08/24/18-19-06-473_7c4caee957b8e5fd.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144222},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"(Podcast) #340: How Often Do I Have to Wash My Hair?","link":"http://two.wordpress.test/post/2020/04/340_how_often_do_i_have_to_wash_my_hair/","description":"<p>This week, on the 30-minute tech show that is trying to keep it down, Dan and Mikah are joined by special guests newly-independent Rene Ritchie and up-and-coming podcaster Leo Laporte to discuss whether Fitbit’s new wearable can take on the Apple Watch; how we balance privacy, security, and reaching out to family during COVID-19; the shift in iPad usage with trackpad support; and whether macOS support touch interaction.</p><p><a href=\"http://relay.fm/clockwise/340\">Go to the podcast page</a>.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 02 Apr 2020 13:15:00 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"3ed91e78a39a56f9ef80451d3ea18baf","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Dan Moren","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144578},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"Apple’s security and privacy is good, but could be even better (Macworld/Dan Moren)","link":"http://two.wordpress.test/post/2020/01/apples_security_and_privacy_is_good_but_could_be_even_better/","description":"<p>Buckle up, because we’re poised for another battle on digital security.

Apple has released a new developer preview of macOS Catalina 10.15.5, and as these releases often do, it contains a new feature: <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211094\">Battery Health Management</a>.</p>\n<p>The new feature, which will only be available on Mac notebooks with Thunderbolt 3 ports<sup id=\"fnref-10894-macs\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-10894-macs\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup>, enables a new default approach to charging and discharging MacBook batteries. According to Apple, the feature is meant to reduce the rate of chemical aging of the MacBook’s battery, thereby extending its long-term lifespan—but without compromising on day-to-day battery life.</p>\n<p>The feature works by analyzing the temperature of the battery over time, as well as the charging pattern the laptop has experienced—in other words, does the laptop frequently get drained most of the way and then recharged fully, or is it mostly kept full and plugged in? In the latter case, Battery Health Management is more likely to stop a bit short of full capacity in order to extend the battery’s long-term lifespan. (All charging data is kept private on the MacBook unless the Mac has been opted in to share anonymous analytics data with Apple.)</p>\n<p>Charging a modern laptop battery to 100% and leaving it there for extended periods of time—especially at warm temperatures—can dramatically reduce the battery’s usable life. This is hardly limited to laptops: I own an electric car, and the manufacturer makes it very clear that it should be routinely charged to only 80 percent to extend its battery lifespan.</p>\n<figure class=\"pull-right\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/macos-catalina-system-prefs-energy-saver-battery-health-6c.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"System Preferences - Courtesy Apple\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>You can revert battery settings to their old defaults by turning off the feature.</figcaption></figure><p>Essentially, Apple has decided it needs to adjust the default MacBook battery-charging behavior to be less aggressive at fully charging batteries in certain circumstances in order to extend battery life. Rather than just silently roll that feature into macOS and wait for users to discover it—<a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2017/12/apple-apologizes-for-iphone-battery-communication/\">it’s been down that path before, with the iPhone</a>—it’s making the change clear. But make no mistake: by setting this as the default, Apple is sending a strong message that this is how MacBook batteries should charge.</p>\n<p>Despite all of that, you can turn the new behavior off by unchecking the Battery Health Management box in the Energy Saver section of the System Preferences app. The life of your laptop’s battery is in your hands.

Like, <em>really</em> damp. So damp that stuff starts growing on the ceiling. Since getting a new house isn’t really an option, I’m left with mitigating it as best I can.</p>\n<p>So I tried to use smart-home tech to make it better.</p>\n<p>It started when I had a HVAC guy out to the house for an unrelated issue, and asked him what made the most sense to combat the winter dampness in the house. Given the particular characteristics of my house, he suggested that I buy dehumidifiers and run them in the winter. The mold-removal guy agreed with that and added that maybe adding a ceiling fan in our bedroom would help too.</p>\n<p>I had a small dehumidifier I bought a while ago, but it didn’t make a dent. What’s worse, if you cut the power to it while it was running and then plugged it back in, it would stay off. That’s a no-no if you’re hoping to make an appliance smarter by attaching it to a smart outlet, which I was. So I bought a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00UWP07LK/?tag=incomparablepod-20\">bigger dehumidifier</a> that retains its power state across outages. This winter I finally bought a ceiling fan for the bedroom, <a href=\"https://www.homedepot.com/p/Hunter-Cavera-Wifi-Enabled-Apple-HomeKit-Google-Home-Alexa-52-in-Indoor-Fresh-White-Ceiling-Fan-with-Light-Kit-and-Remote-59557/\">one with built-in HomeKit support</a>.</p>\n<p>With this setup, I was able to create simple automations in the Home app that would turn on the fan and dehumidifier every morning and run them until the evening. It worked, but I was a little dissatisfied. Right now we’ve gone a few weeks without any rain and it’s not particularly humid in the house, so running the dehumidifier seems wasteful. I wanted something smarter.</p>\n<p>The answer was to get a HomeKit-compatible humidity sensor and put it in my bedroom. It turns out, I <em>already</em> have a sensor relaying humidity and temperature data <a href=\"https://snell.zone/weather/weather.php\">to the Internet</a>—it’s the console of my home weather station. Getting that data into something actionable proved to be trickier than I planned.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-4108\"></span></p>\n<h2>Let’s try complicated automations!</h2>\n<figure class=\"pull-right\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/home-failed-automation.jpg?ssl=1\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>This shortcut worked sporadically.</figcaption></figure><p>My first attempt to solve this problem involved building a complicated home automation, using the Home app. You may not realize this, but Apple offers a Shortcuts-style interface for building complex home automations within the Home app. Because home-automation tasks execute in the background on an Apple TV, iPad, or HomePod in your house, they don’t have access to all the rich commands that full Shortcuts do, but they can still be pretty intelligent.</p>\n<p>My Mac mini server generates a text file of raw Weather Station data that’s useful for a few applications—I have one wired to a <a href=\"https://lametric.com/en-US/time/overview\">LaMetric Time</a> that displays the time and outside temperature in my living room. I built a home automation that loaded that file via the web, parsed it for the internal stats, and then fired off an action based on the humidity (or, in the summer, temperature) in the bedroom.</p>\n<p>My web server didn’t have an SSL certificate and Apple’s home automation shortcuts won’t load pages that aren’t loaded via https. Good grief. A few days of detour into <a href=\"https://certbot.eff.org/\">installing certbot</a> later, my local web server was now secure and I could proceed with the project.</p>\n<p>I did finally get this to work, and last summer I built a simple automation that would fire off at 2pm, check to see the temperature in the bedroom, and if it was too hot, turn on the ceiling fan. Not a bad proof of concept.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I ran smack into more home automation limitations. What this function <em>really</em> demands is the ability to fire off an automation on a regular basis—say, every 15 minutes—and turn things on and off depending on the current weather data. Shortcuts just won’t do that. (Consider this an iOS 14 wish-list item.) There’s also no way to <em>duplicate</em> an automation or copy the steps out of it, so if I wanted to build 10 copies of the automation, set to trigger every hour on the hour… it would take a very long time.</p>\n<h2>Let’s try fake HomeKit sensors!</h2>\n<p>Another idea presented itself. John Voorhees wrote about <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/reviews/home-4-released-with-refreshed-design-and-ios-13-features/\">the Home+ app</a> at MacStories. It’s an app that attempts to be a better version of Apple’s Home app. But more than that, it has access to additional home automation options that are part of the HomeKit APIs but not exposed in Apple’s app. (Let’s pause for a moment at how ridiculous that is.)</p>\n<p>The automation type that caught my eye in Home+ is the ability to set a trigger based on when a sensor crosses a threshold. That’s perfect for an application like this: When the humidity gets above 45 percent in the back bedroom, turn on the dehumidifier and fan. When it gets below 40 percent, turn it off. Just what I wanted.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/homekit-humidity-sensor-room.jpg?ssl=1\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></figure><p>Here’s the catch: This approach doesn’t work with parsed URLs from my web server—it only works with actual sensors reporting data into HomeKit. Fortunately, there are so many smart sensors out there that aren’t HomeKit compatible but <em>do</em> offer web interfaces that someone wrote a plugin for <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2017/12/adding-homekit-to-incompatible-devices-with-homebridge/\">HomeBridge</a> that parses the contents of a web page and turns it into a virtual HomeKit sensor. In fact, they wrote two, one <a href=\"https://github.com/Supereg/homebridge-http-humidity-sensor\">for humidity</a> and one <a href=\"https://github.com/Supereg/homebridge-http-temperature-sensor\">for temperature</a>.<sup id=\"fnref-4108-fake\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-4108-fake\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup></p>\n<h2>Victory of a sort</h2>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/homeplus-humidity-high.jpg?ssl=1\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>The automation in Home+.</figcaption></figure><p>With these sensors set up, I was able to use Home+ to build a new automation that runs during the daytime and activates my dehumidifier and fan when the bedroom is humid, and turns it off when it isn’t. I’d like to declare victory, but the truth is that these automations still seem unreliable. Sometimes they work, sometimes they don’t—and since HomeKit basically offers no real way to debug things, I have no idea what is going on.</p>\n<p>Unless I can get this working reliability, I may try another path to see if I can get what I want. Using that HomeBridge switch plugin might be an option. Another one is to leverage the fact that my dehumidifier can be set to turn itself off when the humidity falls below a certain point, and it’s connected to a smart switch that reports the current amount of energy being drawn by whatever is plugged into it. I’ve toyed with the idea of setting up an automation that runs the ceiling fan only when the dehumidifier is pulling a lot of energy.</p>\n<p>In other words, it’s Yet Another Home Automation Story: This stuff is cool, and fun, and interesting, and doesn’t work nearly as well as it should. My home is so stuffed full of sensors, computers, and Wi-Fi-enabled devices that I should get a project like this to work reliability with minimal effort. But that’s just not the case—at least not yet.</p>\n<p>At least there’s nothing growing on the ceiling of my bedroom at the moment. A small victory.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr><ol><li id=\"fn-4108-fake\">\nOne method I didn’t try is to use an additional HomeBridge plugin to create a virtual switch that flips on or off based on sensor data.

Among all those, the one that frustrates me the most is <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2018/12/wish-list-stereo-homepod-support-for-macos/\">the inability to use a stereo pair of HomePods at the system level on macOS</a>.</p>\n<p>Yes, the Music app on the Mac can send audio to a pair of HomePods grouped together in a stereo pair. Yes, macOS can send all system audio to a single HomePod. But somehow, the twain shall never meet. That’s pretty poor performance when compared with both iOS devices and the Apple TV, all of which have no problem outputting audio to a stereo pair of <em>Apple’s own devices</em>.</p>\n<p>This might seem like a small thing, but for me it has a couple of big impacts. The first and more immediate is that I end up with a slightly ridiculous <em>four</em> speakers on my desk: two HomePods <em>and</em> two traditional computer speakers. I’d be happy to replace the clunky (though perfectly good-sounding) latter with the former, in the interests of simplifying.</p>\n<p>But the latter, and larger issue, is the place of the HomePod within Apple’s ecosystem. In the over two years since Apple released the smart speaker, it’s seen only meager improvements. It seems very much as though, like the late-lamented iPod Hi-Fi before it<sup id=\"fnref-10999-jason\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-10999-jason\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup>, the HomePod may be destined to go down in history as a weird, expensive indulgence product that never really took off.</p>\n<p>However, there is some hope. A recent update transitioned the onboard software from something based on iOS to a tvOS-based system, which suggests that perhaps development on the product is more active than previously thought. Moreover, there have for some time been whispers of a lower-priced HomePod that might help broaden its appeal in the market–though don’t expect anything as cheap as similar offerings from Amazon and Google.</p>\n<p>But when WWDC rolls around in a couple weeks, I’m hoping that the HomePod’s second coming will kick off just this little, but important update: letting you use a stereo pair as your Mac’s default speakers.

A month, a few more Facebook posts and several thousand likes later, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/244292959939686/\">the project</a> has grown into a full-scale recreation of the UC Berkeley campus with a waiting list of students trying to get in on the fun of construction.</p>\n<p>  When IRL events started to disappear around campus, students, like everyone else, turned to the internet. “It’s kind of a natural thing at this point to look online and look to virtual communities to hang out, that’s what we’re used to,” Lustic says.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>As someone who has spent hundreds of hours at California Memorial Stadium, I can attest to what a great job they’ve gone modeling it.

With a tap or two, you can read a comment left by someone in a different language. Messages is a tool built for communication, yet it comes up short in this key area.</p>\n<p>Of course there are workarounds. You can copy text out of Messages and paste it into a translation app or website. Then write your response, translate it back, copy, and paste. But that’s an awful lot of friction for something so basic.</p>\n<p>Here’s how this should work: Messages should have an on-device language detection system that figures out if an incoming message might not be in your default language(s). When that happens, the interface would change in some way to allow you to tap to translate what was sent into your default language.</p>\n<p>Yes, I get that there are some privacy implications here. That translation probably will have to be sent across the internet to a server that’s capable of performing that level of translation. I’d argue that these implications are overblown, though. Apple could certainly build a translation engine that is made with privacy in mind. And while there’s a potential issue of consent—you’re transferring someone else’s words into the cloud—they did send those words to you and intended for them to be understood by you.</p>\n<p>Of course, Apple should offer the reverse as well—offering to translate your responses back into that language. I found the <a href=\"https://itranslate.com/keyboard\">iTranslate keyboard</a>, a keyboard add-on that does this—but translation frequently needs to be in both directions. And it’s a bit much to get someone to install a third-party keyboard just so they can respond to you in your chosen language.</p>\n<p>I’m all for disclosure here. Let the message go out with both what you typed and the translation. Let Apple flag translated messages so that the sender can see that you’ve translated it.</p>\n<p>But this should be easier. Seamless, really. What more can we ask of our communication tools than that they help us communicate better? And to do it as smoothly as possible.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 29 Apr 2020 19:16:35 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/intranslate-6c.jpg?ssl=1","linkMd5":"edf962b51c99bcb8a042af111edd3b21","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn36@2020_2/2020/08/24/18-19-06-471_09f05fee497c77d7.webp","destWidth":1360,"destHeight":840,"sourceBytes":42684,"destBytes":42684,"author":"Jason Snell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/intranslate-6c.jpg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn36@2020_2/2020/08/24/18-19-06-471_09f05fee497c77d7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144271},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"The changing nature of Apple product releases (Macworld/Dan Moren)","link":"http://two.wordpress.test/post/2020/03/the_changing_nature_of_apple_product_releases/","description":"<p>Even in these trying times, it’s good to have something to look forward to.

Not only is it great to see a brand-new Mac utility, but this one hits the sweet spot for me—it’s all about creating more useful contextual menus in the Finder.</p>\n<p>To bring up a contextual menu in the Finder, you make a secondary click on a file—depending on your pointing device it might be a right-click, a click with the Control key pressed down, or a two-finger click on a trackpad. The Finder will present a bunch of standard options, and apps can add their own options. If you use Dropbox, for example, you may right-click on a file in your Dropbox folder and find a half-dozen Dropbox-related options in that menu.</p>\n<p>Users can add items to the contextual menu, too. The <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2018/06/mojave-beta/\">Quick Actions feature</a>, called Services before macOS Mojave, allows you to install plug-ins and even create your own workflows using Automator. Old-style Services show up in the Services submenu at the very bottom of the contextual menu; more modern Quick Actions show up both there and in the Quick Actions submenu, which is a little bit closer to the top.</p>\n<p>I <em>love</em> the Finder’s contextual menu, because it lets me act on a file or files on my Mac immediately. Someone else might open an app, select a file, and issue a command—meanwhile, I right clicked-on that same file, chose an item from the contextual menu, and moved on with my life. I use those items to upload podcasts to a remote server, scale and optimize images for use on Six Colors and upload them to my server, re-encode audio files, sync up podcast audio, and more. Plus, you know, mundane things like AirDropping a single file from my Mac to my iPad or my wife’s MacBook Air.</p>\n<figure class=\"pull-right\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/service-jpeg-6c.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>This very image was uploaded to our server via this very script, using Service Station.</figcaption></figure><p>What Finder contextual menus aren’t, however, is <em>flexible</em>. Apps can shove items onto the main menu, and some do, but others don’t. User-created items are consigned to those submenus. There’s very little you can do as a user to customize that menu.</p>\n<p>Or at least, there wasn’t before the arrival of Service Station, which lets you add apps and scripts to the top level of the Finder contextual menu. Any apps you want. Any scripts, too—shell scripts, AppleScript scripts, or Automator workflows.</p>\n<p>Even better, Service Station lets you create rule sets that determine <em>when</em> those items appear in the menu. I’ve got some scripts that only work on MP3 files, for example, while others will work on audio files in a wide assortment of formats. Service Station lets you create a filter for files via a simple rules interface, and then add apps or scripts to be shown when those rules are passed.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/service-filter-6c.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>Building a filter for specific audio files.</figcaption></figure><p>So if you want, for example, all image files to feature Photoshop and Preview at the top of the Finder contextual menu when you right-click on them, you can do that. Select the app, and the file will be opened in that app. (Yes, you can navigate to the Open With submenu to do this—but the entire point of Service Station is to float the items you want to see to the very top of that menu.)</p>\n<p>It took me a little while to figure out how to adapt my homebrewed automations for use with Service Station. My complex Automator actions that had been saved as Services needed to be re-saved as standard Automator Workflows, but then worked unmodified. Because Automator is the only approved way to build a Quick Action, a bunch of mine were actually just AppleScripts or shell scripts wrapped in a single Automator “do script” block. I pulled that code back out of Automator, made a couple of small changes, saved it in Service Station’s scripts folder, and everything worked just fine.</p>\n<p>Service Station is a <em>very</em> new app and it feels a little rough from time to time. There’s currently no documentation to speak of, though there’s a Read Me and a handful of sample scripts. It doesn’t yet work on files that aren’t on the current boot volume. The app is <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/service-station/id1503136033?ls=1/\">free from the Mac App Store</a> and works with up to four filters and three menu items, but it’s a $15 in-app purchase if you want unlimited filters and items and if you want to run scripts.</p>\n<p>All in all, Service Station is a promising new Mac utility. I’m looking forward to tracking its progress—and using it every day, too.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 28 Apr 2020 23:27:00 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/service-uploadmp3-6c.jpg?ssl=1","linkMd5":"64006e78f2cd2de94ed0e5f1a4b1ac5a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn31@2020_6/2020/08/24/18-19-09-724_703b065abf57a9cd.webp","destWidth":1360,"destHeight":502,"sourceBytes":39394,"destBytes":39394,"author":"Jason Snell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/service-uploadmp3-6c.jpg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn31@2020_6/2020/08/24/18-19-09-724_703b065abf57a9cd.webp","https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/service-jpeg-6c.jpg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn27@2020_5/2020/08/24/18-19-16-716_7b7711fe05acf9bb.webp","https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/service-filter-6c.jpg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn7@2020_3/2020/08/24/18-19-12-139_7000e37f8ca6c0c1.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144271},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"The science and reality of mask wearing ↦","link":"http://two.wordpress.test/post/2020/06/the_science_of_mask_wearing/","description":"<p>The Chief of Medicine at UC San Francisco, Bob Wachter, has been a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Bob_Wachter/\">must-follow</a> during the COVID-19 outbreak.

Wearing a mask shows you are concerned about the welfare of others. It’s not a sign of fear, it’s a sign of compassion.</p>\n<p>His anecdote about someone with COVID-19 riding on a packed airplane, coughing repeatedly, but wearing a mask—and not infecting anyone around them—really hits it home.</p>\n<p>And there’s this sort of practical advice, too:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  One of the most <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/should-you-wear-a-mask-when-exercising-outdoors-11588079594?mod=wsjtwittertest19\">common questions</a> is whether it is necessary to wear a mask when <a href=\"https://elemental.medium.com/wearing-a-mask-while-running-sucks-you-should-probably-do-it-anyway-90547d8eea19\">walking or exercising outside</a>. Empiric and simulation studies have shown that there is practically zero risk of viral spread when one is outdoors and keeping a distance of greater than six feet from others. I personally don’t wear a mask when walking the dog (but I do keep one with me just in case I encounter someone at close range). But I always wear a mask inside, or if an encounter within six feet is likely.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>This pretty much tracks with how I approach this, and it’s what my county’s health department has mandated: Wear a mask indoors or if you’re going to be close to people, but don’t sweat it if you’re out walking the dog and there’s nobody around.

Geographically, we set all-time records in the Americas, Europe and rest of Asia Pacific, and saw Greater China return to growth.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-4078\"></span></p>\n<p><a name=\"p4\"></a>Our record performance was fueled by iPhone, where December quarter revenue was up 8 percent year over year, and by our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth outside of iPhone, including a new all-time record for Services and another blowout quarter for Wearables.</p>\n<p><a name=\"p6\"></a>Our active installed base of devices has now surpassed 1.5 billion, up over 100 million in the last twelve months alone, reaching a new all-time high for each of our main product categories and geographic segments. Not only is our large and growing installed base a powerful testament to the satisfaction, engagement and loyalty of our customers, but it’s also fueling our growth across the board, particularly in Services. Let’s take each category one by one.</p>\n<p><a name=\"p8\"></a>On iPhone, revenue in the December quarter was 56 billion dollars. Again, that’s up 8 percent over a year ago, thanks to the exceptional demand for the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max. In fact, iPhone 11 was our top-selling model every week during the December quarter, and the three new models were our three most popular iPhones. We had double digit growth in many developed markets, including the U.S., the UK, France and Singapore, and also grew double digits in emerging markets, led by strong performances in Brazil, mainland China, India, Thailand and Turkey.</p>\n<p><a name=\"p10\"></a>These new models are by far the best iPhones we’ve ever shipped, with advanced technologies, an unprecedented leap in battery life to easily get through the day, and a best-in-class camera experience. We have been wowed with the photos customers have shared in our all-new Night Mode photo challenge this month.</p>\n<p><a name=\"p12\"></a>Turning to services, Q1 revenue reached 12.7 billion dollars, an all time record, growing 17 percent over last year. Once again, we saw double-digit growth in all five of our geographic segments and established new all time records for multiple categories, including cloud services, music, payment services, and our App Store search ad business, as well as setting a December quarter record for the App Store and AppleCare.</p>\n<p><a name=\"p14\"></a>2019 was a historic year for our services business and I’d like to touch on some highlights. For the App Store, 2020 started off strong with customers spending a new single-day record 386 million dollars on New Year’s Day alone, a 20 percent increase over last year. Apple Arcade, our new game subscription service, has been fast off the blocks, with a catalog of over 100 new and exclusive games you won’t find anywhere else, all playable across Apple devices with new games and expansions added every month.</p>\n<p><a name=\"p16\"></a>Apple TV plus is off to a rousing start, and I want to congratulate the entire team at “The Morning Show” for their multiple Golden Globe nominations, Jennifer Aniston on her Screen Actors Guild award, and Billy Crudup on his Critics Choice Award. We continue to focus on telling stories that matter, like “Little America,” which recently premiered to widespread critical acclaim, with much more great content still to come.</p>\n<p><a name=\"p18\"></a>Apple News now draws over 100 million monthly active users in the U.S., UK, Australia and Canada, and provides a curated and personalized experience using on-device intelligence to recommend stories. Apple News+ continues to add new titles, offering subscribers seamless access to the world’s top publications across all of their devices.</p>\n<p><a name=\"p20\"></a>For Apple Pay, revenue and transactions more than doubled year over year, with a run rate exceeding 15 billion transactions a year. Apple Pay transit support expanded, with customers paying for journeys on Transport for London more easily with Apple Pay Express Transit. And in spring of 2020, iPhone and Apple Watch customers will be able to simply tap to ride trains and buses in even more cities, including Shenzhen and Guangzhou. We are thrilled with the continued growth of Apple Card, and last month customers began using Apple Card monthly installments at Apple Retail and online to purchase new iPhones and pay for them over 24 months. We see great promise for these recently launched services, and we’re optimistic about what we’ve got in the pipeline for each of them.</p>\n<p><a name=\"p22\"></a>Now, turning to wearables, we had another incredible quarter. Setting an all time record in virtually every market we track around the world. And this product category is now the size of a Fortune 150 company. Demand for AirPods continues to be phenomenal, particularly for our recently launch AirPods Pro, our new addition to the AirPods family that features active noise cancelation. Apple Watch had a great start to fiscal 2020, setting an all-time revenue record during the quarter. It continues to have a profound impact on our customers’ lives, and it continues to further its reach, as over 75 percent of the customers purchasing Apple Watch during the quarter were new to Apple Watch. Both AirPods and Apple Watch were must-have holiday gifts, helping drive unprecedented results for the category, even as we face supply constraints for Apple Watch Series 3 and AirPods Pro.</p>\n<p><a name=\"p24\"></a>Mac and iPad generated 7.2 and six billion in revenue respectively. And the high level of customer satisfaction and loyalty for both products drove the active installed base of both Mac and iPad to new records in all geographic segments. For iPad, we saw growth in key emerging markets like Mexico, India, Turkey, Poland, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam. With our current lineup of iPad Pro, iPad Air, iPad Mini, and iPad, along with the new iPad OS, we give customers an unparalleled tablet experience, integrating hardware, software and services in a way that only Apple can.</p>\n<p><a name=\"p26\"></a>This was also a very exciting quarter for the Mac, as we launched our most powerful notebook ever, the 16-inch MacBook Pro as well as Mac Pro and Pro Display XDR, the most powerful tools Apple has ever put in the hands of pros. And we’ve already seen a strong response from the pro community, from developers, photographers and music producers to filmmakers and scientists who rely on the Mac to create their life’s best work. We also want to take a moment to congratulate all the Grammy winning and nominated artists this past weekend who rely on Logic Pro X and their Mac to create incredible music we all love.</p>\n<p><a name=\"p28\"></a>I want to call out and celebrate the exceptional work of our retail and online teams. This quarter, we opened a beautiful new store in Kawasaki, Japan, and exciting things are taking place inside each and every store. Thanks in part to a doubling in iPhone trade-ins versus last year, our retail and online stores set an all-time record and delivered strong double-digit growth in iPhone. We see a very bright future for these efforts, and we continue to innovate to ensure that everyone who visits an Apple retail location has a great experience.</p>\n<p><a name=\"p30\"></a>We begin 2020 with our greatest product lineup ever. And we are only deepening our commitment to do our part to make the world a better place. In November, we released a completely redesigned Everyone Can Code curriculum to help introduce more elementary and middle school students to the world of coding. The new curriculum includes even more resources for teachers, a brand new guide for students, and updated Swift coding club materials. Today, millions of students in more than 5000 schools worldwide use Everyone Can Code curriculum to bring their ideas to life and develop important skills, including creativity, collaboration and problem solving.</p>\n<p><a name=\"p32\"></a>November also saw the launch of our new research app, the latest in our ongoing effort to put the future of health in the hands of every user. Customers in the U.S. can enroll in three landmark multi-year health studies that we’re undertaking with leading academic and research institutions. The Apple Women’s Health Study, the Apple Heart and Movement Study, and the Apple Hearing Study. As in everything we do, we built user privacy into the research app from the ground up.</p>\n<p><a name=\"p34\"></a>This quarter, we also announced a 2.5 billion dollar plan to help address the housing availability and affording crisis in our home state of California. We feel a great responsibility to help the region we have always called home stay vibrant and to ensure that it remains a great place for everyone to live and raise a family, including those who do so much to serve the community like firefighters and teachers.</p>\n<p><a name=\"p36\"></a>In much more recent news, we’re closely following the development of the Coronavirus. We’re donating to groups that are working to contain the outbreak. We’re working closely with our Apple team members and partners in the affected areas. And our thoughts are with all of those affected across the region.</p>\n<p><a name=\"p38\"></a>As we close the books on a record-breaking December quarter, we are already well underway on some new and exciting developments for the future, Apple’s strength will always be its boundless creativity and innovation, and this year will be no different. But for now, for more details on the results, I’d like to turn the call over to Luca.</p>\n<p><a name=\"p40\"></a><strong>Luca Maestri</strong>: Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. Our business and financial performance in the December quarter were exceptional, as we set new all time records for revenue, net income and earnings per share. Revenue for the quarter was 21.8 billion, up 7.5 billion or 9 percent from a year ago, in spite of a one-billion dollar headwind from foreign exchange.</p>\n<p><a name=\"p42\"></a>Geographically, we established all-time revenue records in many major developed and emerging markets, including, among others, the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Brazil, the U.K., Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Poland, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam.</p>\n<p><a name=\"p44\"></a>Products revenue was 79.1 billion, up 8 percent, as iPhone returned to growth, and we had incredibly strong results in Wearables, where we set all time records for both Apple Watch and AirPods. Services revenue grew 17 percent to a new all-time record, 12.7 billion dollars, with double digit growth in every geographic segment, and new all-time records across our portfolio.</p>\n<p><a name=\"p46\"></a>Company gross margin was 38.4 percent, up 40 basis points sequentially, driven by leverage from higher revenue, in spite of a negative 60 basis point impact from foreign exchange. Products gross margin was 34.2 percent, up 260 basis points sequentially, thanks to leverage and favorable mix. Services gross margin was 64.4 percent, up 30 basis points sequentially, driven by favorable mix. Our reported tax rate for the quarter was 14.2 percent. Before discrete items, the rate was 16.5 percent, exactly in line with our guidance. A favorable one-time item impacted the rate by 230 basis points. Net income was an all time record, at 22.2 billion dollars, up 2.3 billion, or eleven percent, over last year. Diluted EPS was also an all-time record at $4.99, up 19 percent. And operating cash flow was a very strong 30.5 billion dollars, an improvement of 3.8 billion over a year ago.</p>\n<p><a name=\"p48\"></a>Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue of 56 billion grew 8 percent year over year, as we saw great customer response to the launch of our newest iPhones. We set all-time revenue records in several countries, including the U.S., Mexico, the UK, France, Spain, Poland, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam. Our active installed base of iPhones has reached an all-time high and is growing in each of our geographic segments. In the U.S., the latest survey of consumers from 451 research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 98 percent for iPhone 11, 11 Pro, and 11 Pro Max combined. Among business buyers planning to purchase smartphones in the next quarter, 84 percent plan to purchase iPhones.</p>\n<p><a name=\"p50\"></a>Turning to Services, we set an all time revenue record of 12.7 billion with double digit growth in all of our five geographic segments. As Tim mentioned, we established new all-time records for Apple Music, Cloud Services, Payment Services, and our App Store search ad business, and December quarter records for the App Store and AppleCare. We are well on our way to accomplishing our goal of doubling our fiscal year 16 Services revenue during 2020. We’ve actually already reached that goal on a run-rate basis with the results of the December quarter. Customer engagement in our ecosystem continues to grow, and the number of both transacting and paid accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all-time high, with paid accounts growing double digits in all of our geographic segments. We now have over 480 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, up 120 million from a year ago. And at this point, we expect to hit our goal of surpassing the 500 million mark already during the March quarter. Given the tremendous momentum we are experiencing across our services offerings, we are increasing our target for paid subscriptions, and aim to reach 600 million before the end of calendar 2020.</p>\n<p><a name=\"p52\"></a>App Store revenue grew strong double digits, thanks to robust customer demand for both in-app purchases and subscriptions. Our third-party subscription business grew across multiple categories and increased almost 40 percent year over year. Our first-party subscription services also continue to perform extremely well. Apple Music set an all time revenue record, offering a catalog of over 60 million songs to our customers. iCloud also generated an all-time revenue record, growing very strong double digits while offering our customers a safe, secure and seamless experience across all their devices. It was a December quarter record for AppleCare, thanks to strong service agreement attach rates and expanded distribution. Many of our partners have come to appreciate the strength of the AppleCare brand and our ability to deliver the very best service and support in the world. That value resonates with both our partners and our customers, and we’re very happy to see that quality of experience delivered to more and more of our users.</p>\n<p><a name=\"p54\"></a>Next, I’d like to talk about Mac and iPad. Mac revenue was 7.2 billion and iPod revenue was 6 billion. Both products had a difficult year over year comparison due to the launches of MacBook Air, Mac Mini, and iPod Pro during the December quarter a year ago, and the subsequent channel fill. Despite the tough compare, on a demand basis, our performance for both Mac and iPad was around even to last year. Importantly, around half of the customers purchasing Macs and iPads around the world during the quarter were new to that product, and the active installed base for both Mac and iPad reached a new all-time high. The most recent surveys from 451 Research measured an 93 percent customer satisfaction rating for iPad from consumers and 92 percent from businesses. And among both consumers and businesses who are planning to purchase tablets in the March quarter, 78 percent plan to purchase iPads.</p>\n<p><a name=\"p56\"></a>Wearables, home and accessories established a new all-time record with revenue of 10 billion, up 37 percent year over year, with very strong double-digit performance across all five geographic segments and growth across wearables, accessories and home. We set all-time records for wearables in virtually every market we track, even as we experience some product shortages due to very strong customer demand for both Apple Watch and AirPods during the quarter. We also continue to see strong demand for our products in the enterprise market, as our technology solutions enable businesses to do their best work. 100 percent of Fortune 500 companies in the health care sector use Apple technology in areas such as patient experience, clinical communications, and nursing workflows. And we are also seeing smaller companies in this sector drive innovation with our technology and apps. One example is Gauss Surgical, which uses CoreML in iOS to more accurately estimate blood loss during childbirth and surgery. This helps clinicians have more complete and timely information on whether a patient needs an intervention, which can impact both clinical outcomes and cost. Another example is Butterfly Network, a medical imaging company which makes a handheld ultrasound device that connects to iPhone or iPad to enable clinicians to take an ultrasound anywhere at a cost that is dramatically lower than other solutions on the market today.</p>\n<p><a name=\"p58\"></a>Let me now turn to our cash positions. We ended the quarter with 207 billion in cash, plus marketable securities. We issued a two billion euro denominated green bond, retired one billion dollars of maturing debt, and reduced commercial paper by one billion during the quarter, leaving us with total debt of 108 billion. As a result, net cash was ninety nine billion at the end of the quarter, and we maintain our target of reaching a net cash neutral position over time.</p>\n<p><a name=\"p60\"></a>We returned nearly 25 billion dollars to shareholders during the December quarter. We began a 10 billion accelerated share repurchase program in November, resulting in the initial delivery and retirement of 30.4 million shares. We also repurchased forty million Apple shares for 10 billion dollars through open market transactions, and we paid 3.5 billion in dividends and equivalents. As we have done for the last several years, we will share our plans for the next phase of our capital return program when we report the results for the March quarter.</p>\n<p><a name=\"p62\"></a>Finally, as we move ahead into the March quarter, I’d like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between 63 and 67 billion dollars. The wider than usual revenue range comprehends uncertainty related to the recently unfolding public health situation in China. We expect gross margin to be between 38 and 39 percent. We expect OpEx to be between nine point six and nine point seven billion dollars. We expect OI&#38;E to be about 250 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 16.5 percent. Also today, our board of directors has declared a cash dividend of 77 cents per share of common stock, payable on February 13, 2020, to shareholders of record as of February 10, 2020.</p>\n<p><a name=\"p64\"></a>With that, let’s open the call to questions.</p>\n<p><a name=\"p66\"></a><strong>Amit Daryanani, Evercore</strong>: I guess first one for me, on wearables, fairly impressive to see it’s already a ten million dollar business for you guys. Can you just touch on the growth that you see on the wearable side, how much the growth you think is coming from first-time buyers of AirPods or Apple Watch versus folks that seem to be just upgrading the products that they have? Because it looks to us adoption rates are fairly low in your installed base, so that there should be a long runway, but I’d love to understand how you see the growth divided between those two buckets.</p>\n<p><a name=\"p68\"></a><strong>Tim Cook</strong>: Amit, it’s Tim. If you look at the Wearables as a category within the Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue, wearables grew 44 percent. So it was very strong, as you say. Both Apple Watch and AirPods did very well in terms of collecting new customers. Apple Watch in particular, 75 percent of the customers are new to the Apple Watch. And so it’s still very much selling to new customers at this point.</p>\n<p><a name=\"p70\"></a><strong>Amit Daryanani, Evercore</strong>: Luca, if you could just touch on gross margins. The March quarter guide, I think implies gross margins are flat, they’re actually up 10-15 basis points. It’s rare for you guys to actually guide gross margins up in March, I think, because you have a fairly high seasonal sales deleverage happening. So what are the offsets that’s enabling what looks like a better than seasonal guide for gross margins?</p>\n<p><a name=\"p72\"></a><strong>Luca Maestri</strong>: Yes, that’s right, Amit. It’s about flat sequentially. And by the way, significantly higher on a year over year basis. But on a sequential basis, you’re right. On one side, we’ve got the loss of leverage from the usual seasonality, but we expect that that loss of leverage will be offset by better mix and cost savings.</p>\n<p><a name=\"p74\"></a><strong>Tom Forte, D.A. Davidson</strong>: Thank you for taking my question. So congrats on the launch of Apple TV+. I wanted to know internally how you’re gauging success. Is it purely on critical acclaim? Is it on number of consumers that are using the service? Contribution of service revenue, et cetera? Thank you.</p>\n<p><a name=\"p76\"></a><strong>Tim Cook</strong>: Hi Tom, it’s Tim. We are primarily measuring ourselves on the number of subscribers. As you can tell from the way that we launched the product, we started with a very aggressive price at $4.99 and in addition to that, we have our bundle where if you buy pretty much any device, you’re getting a year for free. And so we’re very focused on subscribers. That said, the product itself is about storytelling. And we think if we do that well, then we’ll find that there will be some number of those that will also be critically acclaimed. And we’re seeing that with “The Morning Show,” We’re seeing that with “Little America,” and and others.</p>\n<p><a name=\"p78\"></a><strong>Tom Forte, D.A. Davidson</strong>: Great, and then my second question is, I think you indicated that last month you started offering consumers the ability to use their Apple Card to buy an iPhone on an installment basis. Can you talk about how that’s had an impact on your unit sales for iPhones?</p>\n<p><a name=\"p80\"></a><strong>Tim Cook</strong>: The retail stores did fantastic on iPhone, very strong double digit growth in iPhone from a year over year point of view. And one of the factors that enabled that was getting to monthly payments on the Apple Card to make it very simple. Of course that’s U.S. only at this point, but the U.S. is a very key market for us. And so it was it was an important part of it.</p>\n<p><a name=\"p82\"></a><strong>Shannon Cross, Cross Research</strong>: I wanted to go back to revisit China? Tim, can you talk about what you were seeing in the region prior to the health crisis? And then can you also update us a bit in terms of your manufacturing strategy, dual sourcing, geographic diversification even within the region? Just we have some ideas of how this will be managed.</p>\n<p><a name=\"p84\"></a><strong>Tim Cook</strong>: Yeah, thanks, Shannon. In terms of China, the results from last quarter—and then I’ll get into the Corona virus in a second. For the results from last quarter, we had double-digit growth for iPhone in mainland China. So that was an important change from where we had been running. We also had double-digit growth in Services in mainland China, and we had extremely strong double digit on wearables. And so really, there were a number of different factors. In terms of the things that customers are responding to, iPhone 11 is doing particularly well there. The product has been very well received, with its battery life and the camera is unbelievable. We also, as you probably know, have certain trade-in programs going and financing programs. These have also been well received. And so it’s sort of the sum of all of this, and we’re attracting quite a large percentage of new customers on products like the Mac. Three quarters of the customers buying a Mac in China are new, and nearly two-thirds of the customers buying iPad are new. So it was a terrific quarter. We had three of the top four selling smartphones in urban China, according to Kantar.</p>\n<p><a name=\"p86\"></a>In terms of the Coronavirus, as I mentioned earlier, first and foremost, our thoughts are with all of those that are affected across the region. And as I’ve mentioned, we’re donating to groups that are working to contain the outbreak. We’re also working very closely with our team and our partners in the affected areas, and we have limited travel to business-critical situations as of last week. The situation is emerging, and we’re still gathering lots of data points and monitoring it very closely. As Luca had mentioned, we have a wider than usual revenue range for the second quarter due to the greater uncertainty. I’ll talk about supply chain and customer demand some to give you some color. With respect to the supply chain, we do have some suppliers in the Wuhan area. All of these suppliers, there are alternate sources, and we’re obviously working on mitigation plans to make up any expected production loss. We factored our best thinking in the guidance that we’ve provided you. With respect to supply sources that are outside the Wuhan area, the impact is less clear at this time. The reopening of those factories after Chinese New Year has been moved from the end of this month to February 10th, depending upon the supplier location. And we’ve attempted to account for this delayed start up through our larger range of outcomes that that Luca mentioned earlier. With respect to customer demand and sales, we’ve currently closed one of our retail stores and a number of channel partners have also closed their storefronts. Many of the stores that remain open have also reduced operating hours. We’re taking additional precautions and frequently deep cleaning our stores as well as conducting temperature checks for employees. While our sales within the Wuhan area itself are small, retail traffic has also been impacted outside of this area, across the country in the last few days. And again, we have attempted to account for this in our guidance range that we’ve provided you. I hope that gets you some color.</p>\n<p><a name=\"p88\"></a><strong>Shannon Cross, Cross Research</strong>: Yeah, that was really helpful. Luca, maybe if you could just touch on, from a gross margin perspective, the commodity pricing environment and availability. Obviously there’s been some movement on DRAM and NAND so that you can talk about how you think about inventory levels and managing that going forward. Thank you.</p>\n<p><a name=\"p90\"></a><strong>Luca Maestri</strong>: Yes, as I said earlier to the question around the gross margin guidance for the March quarter, we are seeing a benign commodity environment. Most commodities have been declining during the December quarter and we expect the same to happen in the March quarter. As always, and as you probably know, we look at the way these prices move and at times when we feel it’s appropriate, we buy certain commodities in advance. And so we will continue that practice as we go through the year.</p>\n<p><a name=\"p92\"></a><strong>Katy Huberty, Morgan Stanley</strong>: Thank you, good afternoon, Luca. Can you address the modest slowdown in Services growth this quarter, 17 percent vs. 18 percent in September? Which Services categories accelerated vs. where did you see some deceleration in the growth?</p>\n<p><a name=\"p94\"></a><strong>Luca Maestri</strong>: Katy, let me make a couple of comments here. The 17 percent during the December quarter, we look at it against our fiscal year 19 growth rate, which was 16 percent. So we feel very good about the results for the December quarter. As Tim and I mentioned during our prepared remarks, it was a very broad-based growth because we grew double digits in services across all the five geographies. We set all-time records for many, many categories, music, cloud, search ads, payment services, December records for the App Store and Apple Care. If you remember, we set two goals for ourselves in the Services segment. First, we set a goal to double our fiscal 16 revenue during 2020. And when we look at it on our run-rate basis, we’ve already achieved that goal with the results of the December quarter. We also set a goal to pass 500 million paid subscriptions during 2020. And given that we are already at four eighty at the end of December, we expect to pass that mark during the March quarter. And so now we are setting a new target for ourselves for paid subscriptions. And so we are now aiming to reach 600 million before the end of calendar 2020. So we feel that the Services business is going incredibly well. Of course, we have launched new services very recently, for example, Apple TV+ just launched in November. And so while these services did not have a material impact in our December quarter results, we expect that over time they’ll start contributing to the growth of the Services business. But, you know, we feel very happy with the 17 percent.</p>\n<p><a name=\"p96\"></a><strong>Katy Huberty, Morgan Stanley</strong>: Tim, as a follow up, at some point in the future, Apple will launch a 5G iPhone. How big of a demand driver do you view 5G capability in a handset, and what’s your view as to what the killer app will be from a consumer perspective?</p>\n<p><a name=\"p98\"></a><strong>Tim Cook</strong>: You know, we don’t comment on future products, and so I try to sidestep a bit. With respect to 5G, I think we’re in the early innings of its deployment on a global basis. We obviously couldn’t be prouder of our line-up and are very excited about our pipeline as well and wouldn’t trade our position for anybody.</p>\n<p><a name=\"p100\"></a><strong>Kyle McNeely, Jeffries</strong>: So we’re seeing some signs of new spectrum being deployed for 5G deployments and even additional 4G capacity. And it’s already having a positive impact for handset upgrades to use that new capacity. Do you get the sense that wireless carriers are getting more incentivized to upgrade handsets, to get leverage on these new network investments? How much might this be helping and do you think it will continue to accelerate?</p>\n<p><a name=\"p102\"></a><strong>Tim Cook</strong>: I think that we’ve had some great partners, not only in the U.S. but also around the world that were really helpful this quarter as partners. And so I think that probably a part of that is the level of investments they have and then a part of it is probably making sure that those customers stick with them in an environment where there’s a lot of trading back and forth. So I’m optimistic that it will continue.</p>\n<p><a name=\"p104\"></a><strong>Kyle McNeely, Jeffries</strong>: Great. And then the comment that you made about capacity in your Wearables division with AirPods Pro and Apple Watch 3. What do we think about the timeline of when those capacity constraints might be alleviated and will they come from capacity additions or the end of the natural work out of unit shipments and something on the demand side?</p>\n<p><a name=\"p106\"></a><strong>Tim Cook</strong>: I’m hopeful that the Series 3 will come into balance during this quarter. On AirPods Pro, I don’t have a estimate for that for you. I just can’t predict when at this point. We seem to be fairly substantially off there, and are working very hard to to put in additional capacity.</p>\n<p><a name=\"p108\"></a><strong>Wamsi Mohan, Bank of America</strong>: Tim, Apple has a very valuable installed base of users. Can you see a future where Apple can become larger in the advertising market as you build out TV+, given you could have the unique position and ability to drive targeted ads to users without compromising on privacy?</p>\n<p><a name=\"p110\"></a><strong>Tim Cook</strong>: I think it is possible to have advertising in a straightforward manner that doesn’t encroach on people’s privacy. I wouldn’t want to conjecture about us in that business. I think for the TV+ business, we feel strongly that what that customer wants is an ad free product. That’s not our aversion to ads, it’s what we what we believed in the customer wants.</p>\n<p><a name=\"p112\"></a><strong>Wamsi Mohan, Bank of America</strong>: Luca, can you just clarify if the services revenue this quarter had any impact of deferrals associated with TV+ at all? And how can you help us maybe size the impact of the amortization of the content costs associated with TV+ as we think about next couple of years.</p>\n<p><a name=\"p114\"></a><strong>Luca Maestri</strong>: So yes, of course we launched the service and so there was a very small contribution to revenue from the deferral, and there was also contribution to revenue from the people, the subscribers that are actually paying for the service. When you think about what goes into the Apple TV+ revenue, at this point, there are two components. There are paid subscribers, customers that pay for the service, and we recognize revenue over the subscription period. And then we’ve got the what we call the Apple TV+ bundle subscribers. These are the customers that buy an eligible hardware device and redeem the offer for a free year of TV+ services. We defer revenue for this offer based on three items. The first one is the value of the service that is being provided,  the one year of Apple TV+, the second one is the number of customers that are eligible for the offer, and the third one is our estimate of the expected number of customers that will redeem the offer. So you need to keep in mind that from our total eligible device sales, you need to make a number of reductions for family sharing, for multiple device purchases and for geographic availability.</p>\n<p><a name=\"p116\"></a>Also, the take rates can also be impacted by the availability of local content. And we also require a payment method on file. So this estimate is reviewed quarterly and gets updated based on actual trends of the offer. And so these inputs provide us with the amount of revenue that we deferred for each device sale that then gets recognized over the one-year period that the TV+ service is provided. And so when you take the combination of paid subscribers and bundle subscribers, you get the Apple TV+ revenue. Of course, because we’ve launched the service very recently, the amount of revenue that we recognized during the quarter was immaterial to our results. With regard to the cost of developing the content, we essentially as we as we incur these costs, we put them on the balance sheet and then we amortize them over a certain period of time, depending on the type of content that we produce.</p>\n<p><a name=\"p118\"></a><strong>Krish Shankar, Callan and Company</strong>: Tim, I just wanted to pick your brain a little bit on the overall smartphone market. There’s a general view that when 5G phones come out they are going to be more expensive due to higher component costs. But at the same time, it looks like you guys have proven that there is a market for low-cost geographies, with phones like iPhone SE. So how do you see these two different segments within the smartphone market evolving over the next one to three years?</p>\n<p><a name=\"p120\"></a><strong>Tim Cook</strong>: Again, I want to stay away from commenting about the future products. But generally I think it’s important when you think about 5G is to look around the world at the different deployment schedules. And some of those look very different, perhaps, than than what you might be seeing here. And so that’s very important. In terms of the price, I wouldn’t want to comment on the price of handsets that aren’t announced.</p>\n<p><a name=\"p122\"></a><strong>Krish Shankar, Callan and Company</strong>: OpEx of the percentage of sales for March looks like about 15 percent higher than in the prior quarters. Kind of curious, how much of that is driven by some of your Intel modem massive purchases or TV+ in the OpEx? Or how do we think about it in a go forward basis?</p>\n<p><a name=\"p124\"></a><strong>Luca Maestri</strong>: Yeah, I think we felt good about our OpEx results because they were at the low end of our guidance range. But, you know, clearly we want to make all the necessary investments in the business, and in terms of the new services, not only for TV+, but all the new services that we launched during 2019, this is a period where we’re making the necessary investments in advertising and marketing, and that level of investment is reflected in our OpEx results. And also, as you correctly stated, we completed the acquisition of the Intel baseband business during the December quarter. And so we reflected the run rate of the expenses related to that business partially during the quarter, after the completion of the transaction. And that is a very important core technology for the company. So we will continue to make all the necessary investments also there. There is a third category of expenses that affected the December quarter and it’s the fact that our revenue was very strong and we have certain variable expenses, for example, credit card fees that are associated with a higher volume and of course, impacted our OpEx results.</p>\n<p><a name=\"p126\"></a><strong>Mike Olson, Piper Sandler</strong>: Slightly different take on an earlier question on wearables, and that is: What impact you think wearables is having on driving people into the Apple ecosystem? You mentioned 75 percent of Watch buyers are new to the Apple Watch, but are many of them new to Apple overall? I’m sure a lot of existing iPhone, iPad or Mac users are going to be wearables customers. But do you think wearables bring people into the ecosystem to buy other devices in a material way?</p>\n<p><a name=\"p128\"></a><strong>Tim Cook</strong>: I think that—Michael, it’s Tim—with each Apple product that a customer buys, I think they get tighter into the ecosystem because that’s the reason that they’re buying into it. They like the experience, the customer experience. And so from that point of view, I think each of our products can drive another product. I would think in that case, it’s more likely that the iPhone comes first. But there’s no doubt in my mind that there’s some people that came into the ecosystem for the Watch.</p>\n<p><a name=\"p130\"></a><strong>Mike Olson, Piper Sandler</strong>: And then I think you recently mentioned that augmented reality will pervade our entire lives. And I’m wondering if you could share your thoughts about how you think it starts to impact our lives most significantly. For example, will the inflection point in AR come from gaming or industrial usage or some other category. In other words, where will the average person kind of first feel the impact of AR on their lives in a significant way?</p>\n<p><a name=\"p132\"></a><strong>Tim Cook</strong>: I think when you look at AR today, you would see that there are consumer applications, there are enterprise applications. This is the reason I’m so excited about it is, you rarely have a new technology where business and consumer both see it as key to them. And that’s the reason that I think it’s going to pervade your life is because it’s going to go across both business and your home life. And I think these things will happen in parallel. There are already companies that are deep into the enterprise business that are working on applications for the enterprise. And of course you can go on the store and see thousands of apps that are ARKit enabled at at this time, with even more coming.</p>\n<p><a name=\"p134\"></a><strong>Chris Caso, Raymond James</strong>: I guess the first question is on gross margins, and you spoke about the favorable mix. Wondering if you could expand on that a little bit. And clearly iPhone is doing well within the overall mix, that growing year on year. But if we could talk about what’s happening to the mix within iPhone, is that improving as well and also helping margins? And is there anything else you would point to with regard to the overall mix and margins?</p>\n<p><a name=\"p136\"></a><strong>Luca Maestri</strong>: Yes, I think that the mix helped us both in Q1 and it’s helping us with the guidance for Q2. And as you said, some of it is mix of iPhones, the customer response for iPhone 11, 11 Pro, and 11 Pro Max has been exceptional. And that clearly has helped our mix. iPhone 11 was our top selling model throughout the quarter, every single week of the quarter. And so certainly better mix within iPhone. The other point that I like to point out is that as we move from Q1 to Q2, the proportion of revenue coming from services increases versus the holiday quarter. And given the fact that services are accreted to gross margin for the company, we end up getting a better mix from services as well.</p>\n<p><a name=\"p138\"></a><strong>Chris Caso, Raymond James</strong>: A follow-on question with regard to OpEx. It has been growing at a faster rate than revenue for largely over the last three years or so. Can you set us some expectation with regard to when when you get a return on that on that investment? I understand there are new investments that are happening now. But how should we think about potential leverage going forward? Is there a point in time where the OpEx spending tends to level off and you get some some return on that? Or is it just a function of faster revenue growth in the future?</p>\n<p><a name=\"p140\"></a><strong>Luca Maestri</strong>: Well, I would start by saying that our expense to revenue ratio is incredibly competitive relative to other companies in our sector. There are years when our OpEx grows faster than our revenue. But we’ve also had years in the recent past where the opposite has happened. We continue to believe that we have a lot of great opportunities in front of us. And just if you look at this past year, we launched many new initiatives, for example, on the services front, which we want to support with the appropriate level of investment, not only marketing and advertising, but also in R&#38;D. As I mentioned earlier, we closed the acquisition of the Intel baseband business because we think it it’s a very important strategic core technology for the company going forward. And I think from the results that you’ve seen during this quarter and the guidance that we provided for the March quarter, I think we’re doing a pretty good job at balancing the level of investments that we are making on the expense front with the level of returns that we get both in terms of revenue and in terms of profitability that we’re getting. Our net income, for example, was up eleven percent during the December quarter.</p>\n<p><a name=\"p142\"></a><strong>Sumit Chatterjee, JP Morgan</strong>: Just want to kind of ask on the iPhone revenue growth. And it’s actually good to see a return to growth. Based on the velocity of momentum you’re seeing for the products exiting the quarter, how comfortable are you feeling about sustaining growth in iPhone revenues through the year?</p>\n<p><a name=\"p144\"></a><strong>Tim Cook</strong>: You know, we have a practice of forecasting the current quarter. And so we’ve given you the range that we expect for the current quarter and really don’t give a range beyond that.</p>\n<p><a name=\"p146\"></a><strong>Sumit Chatterjee, JP Morgan</strong>: Obviously you’ve returned to growth in most of the regions you report. One of the regions that are declining is Japan. So if you can share your thoughts on what actions you need to take there to return that segment, that geography to growth, and what are the product trends there, what’s probably the headwind that’s limiting growth there?</p>\n<p><a name=\"p148\"></a><strong>Luca Maestri</strong>: So Japan was down 10 percent during the December quarter. It was primarily due to iPhone performance, which was challenged because there were some regulatory changes that took effect on the 1st of October, where essentially the regulators decoupled the mobile phone pricing from the two year contracts and they’re capping the maximum amount of carrier discounts that can can be made. At the same time, I would say that within a more difficult macro environment, iPhone did incredibly well during the quarter. Six of the top seven selling smartphone models in Japan during the December quarter were iPhones. So it was a very strong performance by iPhone in a difficult environment. Also in Japan, we had very strong double digit growth from services, stronger than company average, and very strong double digit growth in wearables, also stronger than company average. So we feel very good. You know, Japan is is a country where historically we’ve had great success. The customers are very loyal and very engaged. And we have a very strong position there and we feel we have a very good momentum.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 28 Jan 2020 14:29:27 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"fd597d116730eb31456371285aabbac3","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jason Snell","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144660},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"(Podcast) #338: Am I Allowed to Say Whisk(e)y?","link":"http://two.wordpress.test/post/2020/03/338_am_i_allowed_to_say_whiskey/","description":"<p>This week, on the 30 minute tech podcast that’s alway here for you, Dan and Mikah are joined by special guests Georgia Dow and Matteo Doni to discuss how technology has helped us with social distancing, how we’re coping with media anxiety, our tips for working — and living — from home, and COVID-19’s effect on future infrastructure.</p><p><a href=\"http://relay.fm/clockwise/338\">Go to the podcast page</a>.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 19 Mar 2020 18:06:19 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"6a137c3e38912bf19d3cf6880e366347","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Dan Moren","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144592},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"(Sponsor) Guardian Firewall","link":"http://two.wordpress.test/post/2020/05/guardian_firewall_1/","description":"<p>Thank you to <a href=\"https://guardianapp.com\">Guardian Firewall</a> for sponsoring Six Colors this week.

The keyboard and price were both impressive, but the trackpad experience itself was poor compared to pretty much any other pointing device you can connect to an iPad.</p>\n<p>At the time, I expressed some hope that Brydge might be able to turn things around by updating the trackpad’s firmware. And that glimmer of hope got a little brighter last week with the release of a <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/brydge-connect/id1511581019?mt=8\">firmware update app</a> that improves clicking and scrolling features.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the update that Brydge rolled out along with the app doesn’t really do anything to fix the fundamental failings of the Brydge trackpad experience. Cursor movement and two-finger scrolling is still jerky and unreliable in ways that other trackpads and mice aren’t.</p>\n<p>I spoke to people at Brydge and they suggested that now that the app has been released, the company hopes to release more updates soon. The company seems to be well aware of the limitations of its iPadOS experience and is working to make it better. I’ll keep checking back with them in the hope that I can upgrade my view of the Brydge Pro+ in the future.</p>\n<p>I do have at least a little hope that the product can be rescued, eventually. We know that Apple’s own <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/04/magic-keyboard-ipad-pro-review/\">Magic Keyboard</a> and Logitech’s <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/04/logitech-combo-touch-review-not-so-magic-keyboard/\">Combo Touch</a> acquit themselves fine, as does Apple’s standalone Magic Trackpad 2. iPadOS 13.4 enabled not just <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/03/the-ipad-cursor-is-here-no-wait-required/\">cursor support</a>, but support for trackpad hardware.</p>\n<p>Brydge’s trackpad, in contrast, is still emulating a mouse. It’s playing checkers while Apple and Logitech are playing chess. What’s baffling about this situation is that Brydge makes a product for Windows—the <a href=\"https://www.brydge.com/products/brydge-12-3-microsoft-surface-pro-keyboard\">Surface Pro keyboard</a>—that offers first-class multitouch support. And the trackpad hardware in that product is identical to the hardware in the Brydge Pro+. The only differences are the firmware and the operating system.</p>\n<p>As a fan of Brydge’s approach to iPad keyboards and to Apple’s support for pointing devices in iPadOS 13.4, it’s frustrating to see this situation. Here’s hoping Brydge can get its firmware on track, because the world of iPad accessories is stronger with Brydge in it.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 13 May 2020 23:39:17 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/brydgeproplus-6c.jpg?ssl=1","linkMd5":"c9627a04a15e0900b31b39c8b3d38e3d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn80@2020_5/2020/08/24/18-19-07-772_fd3716099e0c43f2.webp","destWidth":680,"destHeight":680,"sourceBytes":20606,"destBytes":20606,"author":"Jason Snell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/brydgeproplus-6c.jpg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn80@2020_5/2020/08/24/18-19-07-772_fd3716099e0c43f2.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144246},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"6C Podcast: April 24, 2020","link":"http://com.sixcolors.podcast.9694","description":"<p>80% of keyboards are 100% magic.&#8230;</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/subscribe/\">Become a member</a></strong> to listen to our exclusive weekly podcast and get more benefits.</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 24 Apr 2020 17:22:46 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"326698f51320122f3a8d1d06ccd229a7","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jason Snell","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144499},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"Explaining the law that prevents Internet platforms from being sued ↦","link":"http://two.wordpress.test/post/2020/06/explaining_the_law_that_prevents_internet_platforms_from_being_sued/","description":"<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/06/section-230-the-internet-law-politicians-love-to-hate-explained/\">Fantastic explainer by Ars Technica’s Timothy B. Lee</a> about Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which grants immunity to online platforms for content posted on their services:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  It’s hard to imagine sites like Yelp, Reddit, or Facebook existing in their current form without a law like Section 230. Yelp, for example, is regularly threatened by business owners for allegedly defamatory reviews. Section 230 allows Yelp to basically ignore these threats. Without Section 230, Yelp would need a large staff to conduct legal analysis of potentially defamatory reviews–a cost that could have prevented Yelp from getting off the ground 15 years ago.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Section 230 was, of course, in the news recently because of <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/link/2020/05/untangling-the-executive-order-on-social-media/\">the president’s attempt to issue an executive order undoing it</a>. But Democratic candidate Joe Biden has also called to revoke the immunity implication of Section 230, at least in the case of Facebook.</p>\n<p>Perhaps most importantly, though many politicians say that Section 230 requires online platforms to be “politically neutral” that’s actually not the case at all:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  And despite a number of politicians’ claims, Kosseff added, “there’s no mention I can find of a requirement for neutrality.” The authors of the statute “do talk about a need to promote political discourse,” he adds. “But I don’t see anything saying to receive 230 protections you must be neutral.”\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Fundamentally, the law is not well understood and the implications of rolling it back are potentially damaging (even as there are definite needs to tweak and reform parts of it as well). Lee’s rundown should be required reading for anybody looking to understand Section 230, and especially for all those politicians who want to revise it.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/06/section-230-the-internet-law-politicians-love-to-hate-explained/\">Go to the linked site</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/link/2020/06/explaining-the-law-that-prevents-internet-platforms-from-being-sued/\">Read on Six Colors</a>.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 10 Jun 2020 19:59:15 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"6c651a02ce9d625d3c945ba3a0df0232","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Dan Moren","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144222},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"It’s time for new hardware at the center of Apple’s home strategy (Macworld/Jason Snell)","link":"http://two.wordpress.test/post/2020/01/its_time_for_new_hardware_at_the_center_of_apples_home_strategy/","description":"<p>Tech companies are still investing huge amounts of time and energy in smart-home products, as the recent Consumer Electronics Show displayed.

Some faxes are meant for other jurisdictions, and many are missing crucial information needed for his office to investigate cases. Most such faxes in Austin are being sent to a computer, but they still need to be printed and manually entered into public health databases.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Mind-boggling how much of healthcare still relies on the “cutting edge” of 1990s tech. While physicians offices and hospitals have gotten pushed to update to electronic medical records, the <em>Times</em> story points out that public health infrastructure hasn’t been subject to the same initiatives.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  In the early 2010s, the federal government spent billions to encourage doctors to replace fax machines with electronic records. That program, known as the HITECH Act, did not include similar funding for public health departments, to help them automatically digitize faxes and other nonstandard results. Nor did it require hospitals and doctor’s offices to build technology that would automatically send relevant test results to local health officials.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Moreover, our healthcare system is much more decentralized than many other countries, which makes it an increasing challenge to coordinate the response to a public health crisis like we’re in now.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/upshot/coronavirus-response-fax-machines.html?referringSource=articleShare\">Go to the linked site</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/link/2020/07/12166/\">Read on Six Colors</a>.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 19 Jul 2020 13:08:37 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"afcf6a62e0327b5e255dbf6981dc489a","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Dan Moren","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144156},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"Review: Audio-Technica ATR-2100x microphone","link":"http://two.wordpress.test/post/2020/02/review_audio-technica_atr-2100x_microphone/","description":"<figure class=\"pull-right\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/audiotechnica-mics-compare-6c.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"audiotechnica-mics-compare\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>The new ATR-2100x microphone (right) replaces a Mini-USB connector with USB-C.</figcaption></figure><p>For a while now my <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2016/11/a-podcast-studio-for-under-100/\">go-to podcast microphone recommendation</a> has been the Audio-Technica ATR-2100. At around $100 it’s relatively cheap, sounds great, and thanks to its USB port it doesn’t require you to buy a separate USB audio interface. (It’s not just me—<a href=\"https://marco.org/podcasting-microphones#rank\">Marco Arment also really liked it</a>.)</p>\n<p>The ATR-2100 has been discontinued, and replaced with the new <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZPBFVKK/?tag=incomparablepod-20\">Audio-Technica ATR-2100x</a>. After traveling for a week with the ATR-2100, I returned home to discover its successor waiting for me in a box on my desk.</p>\n<p>The good news is that, so far as I can tell, the new microphone sounds just as good as the old one did.</p>\n<p>One of the most important features of a microphone, especially one that you’re going to use in unforgiving spaces (i.e., noisy or echoey places like where most of us live and work and record podcasts), is the ability to suppress room echo and background noise, and the ATR-2100x does that really well.</p>\n<p>Here’s how Marco describes it:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  An amazing value for the money: it sounds great for the price, and pretty decent at any price, as long as you speak up very closely to it….  Compared to other inexpensive USB mics aimed at beginners like the Blue Yeti, the ATR2100x picks up far less room echo and background noise, and is much easier to travel with. But you have to speak up closely to it — if you’re using its desk stand, elevate it up to mouth level (with e.g. a stack of books) if possible.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>This microphone also has a few other features that make it more flexible than other microphones. The big feature of this new version is that it’s got a USB-C port, rather than the previous model’s Mini-USB. In practice, I don’t think this port swap is especially meaningful—you could use the old microphone with a USB-C-to-Mini-USB cable—but we’re entering a world where USB-C cables will be common and Mini-USB cables rare and weird, so this is better.</p>\n<p>Like its predecessor, the ATR-2100x also has a headphone jack, which is vitally important because it gives you immediate feedback of your own voice in your ears while also relaying audio from the device it’s attached to. It’s always better to hear your own voice in your ears as you talk (without any delay) to reinforce good microphone habits like facing toward the microphone when you talk.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, both old and new models also include an XLR connector, meaning they’re compatible with external devices such as USB audio interfaces and portable recorders. And both XLR and USB ports can be used simultaneously, which lets me connect to my iPad for use with Skype while <em>also</em> recording my audio directly via an external XLR recorder. Since iOS won’t let me make a Skype call while also record my local audio, that’s a vital bit of flexibility.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/audiotechnica-mics-bottom-6c.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>The only significant difference is the replacement of Mini USB (left) with USB-C.</figcaption></figure><p>Beyond the USB-C port, there aren’t many other changes to the design of this model. The color scheme is different, the mute switch is slightly different (but just as noisy), and the LED that indicates the microphone is connected via USB is now a part of the same housing as the switch, rather than being separate. (Alas, it doesn’t change colors or turn off when the mute switch is on.) The included small, cheap mic stand has been redesigned—it’s still small and cheap, but it’s functional.</p>\n<p>Overall, this is an exceedingly small upgrade, but that’s just fine—this microphone was already great. Pair it with a cheap windscreen (a must, because you need to be close to it to be picked up properly) and consider adding a shock mount and a better mic stand to create <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2016/11/a-podcast-studio-for-under-100/\">a low-cost podcast studio</a>. Like I said, I recorded four podcasts on the road with one of these microphones last week. You won’t do better for the price.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 27 Feb 2020 00:51:23 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/audiotechnica-mics-compare-6c.jpg?ssl=1","linkMd5":"90c63f2e415a4e41d0c9254e6c2de776","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn28@2020_6/2020/08/24/18-19-06-567_0967f16c490177a7.webp","destWidth":680,"destHeight":827,"sourceBytes":56174,"destBytes":56174,"author":"Jason Snell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/audiotechnica-mics-compare-6c.jpg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn28@2020_6/2020/08/24/18-19-06-567_0967f16c490177a7.webp","https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/audiotechnica-mics-bottom-6c.jpg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn99@2020_5/2020/08/24/18-19-14-113_5b729d3b76367bea.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144617},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"(Podcast) Clockwise #350: A Hunk of Inert Matter","link":"https://sixcolors.com/?p=11199","description":"<p>This week, on the 30-minute podcast that’s tautologically 30 minutes, Dan and Mikah welcome special guests Rosemary Orchard and Rene Ritchie to discuss whether we’d use a Mac Upgrade Program, what we track on our iPhones, what excites (and worries) us about a Mac processor transition, and how we’re dealing with tragedy and normality on social media.</p><p><a href=\"http://relay.fm/clockwise/350\">Go to the podcast page</a>.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 11 Jun 2020 18:06:15 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"a158098938020971020272f08ec3ee02","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Dan Moren","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144221},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"Twitter employee implicated in massive Bitcoin hack ↦","link":"https://sixcolors.com/?p=12039","description":"<p>Writing at Vice’s Motherboard, Joseph Cox has <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/jgxd3d/twitter-insider-access-panel-account-hacks-biden-uber-bezos\">dug into the hack of high profile Twitter accounts yesterday</a>, including Apple’s:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  The accounts were taken over using an internal tool at Twitter, according to the sources, as well as screenshots of the tool obtained by Motherboard.

Sometimes I work to solve a problem using technology not because it’s necessary, but because it’s fun.</p>\n<p>Fact one: I work at my desk, listening to music. I generally don’t like to use headphones because they can make my ears sore after a while, and they cut me off from the sounds of my house and neighborhood. So when I was setting up my home office, I wanted a nice set of speakers, and I realized that I still had my old iPod Hi-Fi sitting around.</p>\n<p>The iPod Hi-Fi, a compact iPod speaker system Apple built to try and outclass the popular  Bose SoundDock has ended up as the butt of many jokes. It was a flop. But you know what? For all its faults, it was a pretty good speaker. I took it with me to family camp up in the mountains for many years. And while I don’t listen to music on an iPod anymore, the iPod Hi-Fi has something that the HomePod lacks: an auxiliary audio-in jack. So my music plays, every day, through an iPod Hi-Fi attached to my iMac Pro via a headphone cable.</p>\n<p>Fact two: The problem I discovered upon hooking my iPod Hi-Fi up to my iMac via the auxiliary input was that when I shut the iMac down at the end of the day, the iPod Hi-Fi emitted an annoying buzzing sound. I also didn’t like the idea of leaving the thing powered in overnight when I wasn’t using it, so I plugged the iPod Hi-Fi into my switching power strip that senses the power draw on a single, master outlet and uses that to switch off a few other outlets. Now when my iMac shut down, my iPod Hi-Fi powered down too. Buzz gone, power draw solved.</p>\n<p>Fact three: For some reason, Apple designed the iPod Hi-Fi’s volume to reset after a power cycle. I can have the iPod Hi-Fi set to the perfect volume for my use during the day, but the next morning it will always be several volume steps too low. This requires me to keep an Apple Remote on my desk and, when I start listening to music, I have to click it four or five times to get it to be an acceptable volume.</p>\n<p>Fact four: Having to click a stupid Apple Remote every day when I want to listen to music is not much of an imposition in the grand scheme of things. And yet… surely, <em>surely</em> there was some way for me to eliminate this need. I was so preoccupied with whether or not I could, I didn’t stop to think if I should.</p>\n<h2>Automating the infrared</h2>\n<p>Here was the plan: Find a device that could be controlled by my Mac and press the volume-up button on my iPod Hi-Fi every morning when I started up the computer. A search for USB-based infrared blasters turned up empty, so I looked for networked ones instead. I settled on the  <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3elTkqC\">Global Caché WF2IR</a>, a little device that connects to your local Wi-Fi network and can emit infrared signals on command.</p>\n<p>This week I took delivery of the WF2IR and discovered that it’s limited to some very specific Wi-Fi variants and frequencies, and is completely incompatible with my Eero Wi-Fi routers. Fortunately, I still have an <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/link/2018/08/airport-express-im-not-dead-quite-yet/\">AirPort Express</a> in a bin, so I pressed it into service and managed to get the WF2IR to connect to the Express.</p>\n<p>While the WF2IR can be controlled via a TCP connection, Global Caché’s setup utilities only run in Windows. Fortunately, a fellow named Martijn Rijnbeek <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/itest/id617202526?mt=12\">has written Mac equivalents</a> for cheap on the Mac App Store. I downloaded several of them, intercepted the Apple Remote’s infrared code, and figured out the proper command to send to the WF2IR to get the volume to increase.</p>\n<p>Fantastic. The next step was to scour the Global Caché website to find the right PDF <a href=\"https://www.globalcache.com/files/01-2020/API-GC-TCP_1.0.pdf\">that detailed how you control the thing remotely</a>. Once I had that, I needed to figure out how to make a TCP connection to a specific port on the WF2IR so I could issue test commands.</p>\n<p>That command is netcat, and after some trial and error I discovered the command I needed to issue was <code>nc -c 192.168.1.75 4998</code> — at which point I was “in” the WF2IR and could send it the command to press volume up on my iPod Hi-Fi.</p>\n<p>Now the next trick. I needed to figure out how to script this entire connection, so that I could create a simple AppleScript app and add it to my login items. But how do you combine using the <code>nc</code> command to connect <em>and</em> entering a command into the remote device into a single line?</p>\n<p>After some Googling, I discovered that the answer was to pipe the unix <code>printf</code> command through netcat, like so:</p>\n<pre><code>printf \"the-commandrn\" | nc -c 192.168.1.75 4998\n</code></pre>\n<p>The WF2IR is very finicky about carriage returns, so I have to send my command with <code>rn</code> and use the <code>-c</code> flag in <code>nc</code> to inform it I’ll be using carriage returns. It worked! I ran an infrared emitter under the grille of the iPod Hi-Fi and down under my desk into the WFIR box.</p>\n<p>My next step was just to embed this script in AppleScript, and throw in a <code>repeat</code> statement and a one-second delay, so that my script presses Volume Up seven times:</p>\n<pre><code>try\n    — Check to see if the WF2IR is responding yet,\n    — because it powers on with the iPod Hi-Fi! \n    do shell script \"printf \"get_NET,0:1\\r\\n\" | nc -c 192.168.1.75 4998\"\n\non error\n    — If there was no response to the previous check, wait a minute\n    delay 60\n\nend try\n\nrepeat with i from 1 to 7\n    —repeat 7 times\n    delay 1\n    do shell script (\"printf \"the-command\\r\\n\" | nc -c 192.168.1.75 4998\")\n\nend repeat\n</code></pre>\n<p>I saved the script as an application, added it to my Login Items, and for the last two days I haven’t had to touch that Apple Remote once.</p>\n<h2>At least dinosaurs didn’t run amok</h2>\n<p>I spent $115 on an WFIR and it’s now consuming power, as is my old AirPort Express! And if the AirPort Express dies I will need to buy a new access point just to keep the WFIR running. This seems dumb and wasteful.</p>\n<p>I should probably return the WFIR and get the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3eryupM\">IP2IR</a>, which is literally the same product but with an Ethernet port. Right? That would be better. I think that would definitely be better.</p>\n<p>So in the end, I have spent a lot of time and a little bit of money to create a button pusher. (Believe it or not, I did look into a “button pusher” that could just tap the capacitive volume button on the top of the iPod Hi-Fi a few times. It seemed less elegant even than this.)</p>\n<p>Was this project necessary? Absolutely not. And yet it was fun to put together. And I can’t emphasize this enough, I don’t have to click the Volume Up button on that little Apple Remote several times every morning. It’s the little things, sometimes, that bring pleasure to life.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 28 May 2020 23:43:28 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ipodhifiir-6c.jpg?ssl=1","linkMd5":"2c1709e2d644f311adf10c47b63c449d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn47@2020_5/2020/08/24/18-19-09-132_aeea8d919b59b7d2.webp","destWidth":1360,"destHeight":1020,"sourceBytes":182672,"destBytes":182672,"author":"Jason Snell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ipodhifiir-6c.jpg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn47@2020_5/2020/08/24/18-19-09-132_aeea8d919b59b7d2.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144239},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"‘Assemble and adjust your Face Shield’ ↦","link":"http://two.wordpress.test/post/2020/04/assemble_and_adjust_your_face_shield/","description":"<p>A <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211028\">most unusual Apple tech note</a>.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/faceshield-6c.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>There’s also <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/105/media/us/support/01587B63-5648-4068-9BE2-C1CE38803CD9/ACD04_v1-HLS_1280x720h.mov\">a helpful video</a> narrated by TTS Alex.</p><p><a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211028\">Go to the linked site</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/link/2020/04/assemble-and-adjust-your-face-shield/\">Read on Six Colors</a>.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 07 Apr 2020 16:38:08 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/faceshield-6c.jpg?ssl=1","linkMd5":"272670f6bcfee7f0c870d9e163f2203a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn32@2020_4/2020/08/24/18-19-08-412_058ee69689c79d90.webp","destWidth":1360,"destHeight":746,"sourceBytes":25060,"destBytes":25060,"author":"Jason Snell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/faceshield-6c.jpg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn32@2020_4/2020/08/24/18-19-08-412_058ee69689c79d90.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144519},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"(Podcast) #291: Restart Your Damn Phone","link":"http://two.wordpress.test/post/2020/05/291_restart_your_damn_phone/","description":"<p>Just a warning: this is now a podcast about British TV shows.</p><p><a href=\"http://reboundcast.com/episode/291\">Go to the podcast page</a>.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 27 May 2020 19:28:00 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"e77efaae2406d993aa118c0748ab1c93","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Dan Moren","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144240},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"iOS 14 and macOS Big Sur showcase Apple’s latest shots at Google (Macworld/Dan Moren)","link":"https://sixcolors.com/?p=12173","description":"<p>Apple’s in a strange position vis-a-vis many of its biggest rivals.

In 2014 I was <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2014/11/ipad-air-2-review/\">frustrated by its limitations</a>, but had started experimenting with <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2014/11/how-apple-can-boost-my-ipad-productivity/\">writing on an iPad with Bluetooth keyboard</a>. The <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2015/11/ipadpro/\">arrival of the iPad Pro in 2015</a> crossed a threshold, and the iPad rapidly replaced all the places where I once used my MacBook Air.</p>\n<p>As much as the Smart Keyboard made it clear that Apple endorsed the idea of writing on an iPad, and <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2016/03/keyboard-for-97-inch-ipad-pro/\">as good as the Smart Keyboard is</a>, it still couldn’t quite match the experience of using a laptop. The Smart Keyboard was less stable when you used it on your lap, and while the membrane keys were surprisingly usable, they still weren’t a match for the real, physical keys you’d find on a laptop.</p>\n<p>A few companies, <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2017/01/brydge-keyboard-129-review-closer-to-ipad-keyboard-perfection/\">most notably Brydge</a>, offered accessories with a more laptop-like experience. When I considered the physical challenges of converting an iPad into a laptop screen—Brydge’s design requires you to slide an iPad into a couple of padded metal clips, and it has to be heavy enough to counterbalance the weight of the iPad—I became more convinced that Apple was never going to bother building anything that would just turn its thin and light tablet into a heavy laptop.</p>\n<p>Less than five years after the iPad Pro and Smart Keyboard appeared on the scene, however, Apple has decided that it’s time for the full laptop experience on iPadOS. The new Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro isn’t just a physical keyboard that adds laptop-style weight and stability, though. It’s also got that trademark Apple fusion of software and hardware, thanks to a multi-touch trackpad and the full cursor support of iPadOS 13.4.</p>\n<p>This is basically my iPad dream, fulfilled. But dreams are amorphous things, and they fall apart if you begin to interrogate them logically. The Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro isn’t a dream, it’s a real product, one that’s sitting in my lap right now. It’s one thing for Apple to decide that it’s time to offer a full laptop experience on the iPad—and an altogether different thing to execute that vision.</p>\n<p>As I scrutinize the Magic Keyboard, it doesn’t fall apart as if it were a dream—it holds together, solidly. This is a product that isn’t for everyone, to be sure… but it’s exactly what I’ve been looking for.</p>\n<h2>Solve for laptop</h2>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/mk-side-ikea-6c.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Perhaps the most surprising thing about the Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro is that it’s <em>not</em> designed like a laptop. Instead, it’s designed to provide a laptop-like experience. When the product was announced, so many of us focused on that clever cantilevered design, in which the iPad floats above the keyboard, magnetically attached to a hinged backplate.</p>\n<p>It’s a clever design, one that pushes the center of gravity of the combined unit forward, making it more stable (and requiring less weight to counterbalance it). But the result isn’t some new, weird floating-screen category of computer. The result is a laptop.</p>\n<p>This is a good thing. You could argue that the design of the modern laptop is the result of four decades of evolution, pushing the PC ever closer toward its ideal form. Most computers are laptops.</p>\n<p>So don’t get too hung up on the fact that the Magic Keyboard has two separate hinges, one at the back of the keyboard plane and one a third of the way up the other plane. In everyday use, you don’t need to think of it that way, because it works as a single mechanism. Like a laptop, you open it up in one motion, and both hinges extend as far as they can and then stop. Same deal with closing the iPad—it’s one motion, as you grab the top of the screen and push down until the whole thing closes. It’s smooth and laptop-like.</p>\n<p>Yes, technically you can pivot the top hinge to reduce the iPad’s angle to perpendicular and, in fact, beyond that into the acute zone. It’s great that there’s some flexibility here, but truth be told, the maximum angle is the best angle. It would actually be nice if it opened a bit wider, but the iPad is already floating slightly above the top row of the keyboard. Any more tilt and the iPad would get in the way.</p>\n<p>For my money, Apple has made the perfect set of trade-offs here. The screen angle, at least on the 12.9-inch model (I didn’t test the 11-inch keyboard), is quite comfortable. The balance on my lap seems almost perfect. And  because of the double-hinge design, the screen is actually much closer to you than a laptop screen would be. This makes it easier to reach up and touch the display, which I found I still do a lot.</p>\n<p>Just as when I used a touchscreen Chromebook, I found that sometimes you just want to reach up with a finger and scroll a webpage or document—and other times, you want to two-finger scroll on the trackpad. One gesture that I’ve found myself doing all the time is holding the bottom corner of the iPad in my hand, with several fingers pressed against its back, and then scrolling by flicking with my thumb.</p>\n<p>When you close the whole thing up, it feels like a laptop. It’s solid and, yes, weighty. But instead of being sheathed in aluminum, like all the MacBooks, the Magic Keyboard is covered in the same rubbery gray material as the Smart Keyboard Folio and Smart Folio.</p>\n<p>But you don’t need to carry it around like a laptop if you don’t want to. This is one of the things about the iPad that <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/offsite/2020/04/the-heavy-truth-about-the-ipad-pros-magic-keyboard/\">makes it so attractive</a>—it’s truly a flexible, modular device that can be used in all sorts of different contexts. Since it’s only affixed to the Magic Keyboard via magnets, it’s easy to just pull the iPad off and leave the rest behind. That three-pound laptop turns into a 1.4-pound tablet. The real magic of this keyboard is in that transformation.</p>\n<h2>Keys to success</h2>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/mk-topdown-keys-6c.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Since <em>keyboard</em> is in the name of the product, it’s probably worth talking about its actual keys. The 12.9-inch model I used to write this review is a full-sized Apple keyboard, a pretty close match to the exact width of the keyboard on my old 11-inch MacBook Air. The travel may be a little less, but overall this feels like a classic Apple laptop keyboard.</p>\n<p>What my MacBook Air had that this one lacks is a row of (fractional-height) function keys, useful for making quick adjustments to brightness and controlling media playback. I can see why Apple left this row off, since the iPad already floats right above the number row. But if Apple’s not going to offer a function row, it needs to come up with another way to give keyboard users quick access to those other functions. It could allow users to redefine a modifier key as a function key, or maybe just let them assign global keyboard shortcuts to a handful of important functions, including brightness and media control.</p>\n<p>But it needs to do something. To adjust the brightness of the backlighting—and yes, this keyboard is delightfully backlit—you need to open the Settings app, tap on General, tap on Keyboard, tap on Hardware Keyboard, and then use a slider to adjust the brightness. That’s ridiculous. (There’s no Escape key, either, but there’s a more-or-less global shortcut for that one—Command-period.)</p>\n<p>The existence of the Magic Keyboard for the 11-inch iPad Pro has made me think about how much I loved my old 11-inch MacBook Air and wonder if perhaps I’d be happier with an 11-inch iPad Pro rather than the 12.9-inch model I currently favor. But I don’t think so.</p>\n<p>The 11-inch model has to narrow several modifier keys in order to fit in the much narrower space of that device. As I wrote earlier, the 12.9-inch iPad is actually narrower than the 11-inch MacBook Air was, though its screen is taller (and of course, it’s heavier when paired with the Magic Keyboard).</p>\n<p>I can’t be sure until I try it, but my gut feeling is that I’d prefer the full-sized keys and the greater screen size of the 12.9-inch model. That said, I am thinking that the 11-inch iPad Pro with Magic Keyboard is going to be a pretty awesome portable writing rig—and it’ll weigh the same as the 11-inch Air, too.</p>\n<h2>The trackpad makes its debut</h2>\n<p>The Magic Keyboard’s accompanying trackpad is small by modern Apple laptop standards, but it gets the job done just fine. Though it physically clicks (rather than sensing pressure and vibrating to fake a click, as Apple’s modern trackpads do), you can click anywhere on the surface. That beats my old MacBook Air, which got harder to click the further up the trackpad you went.</p>\n<p>It’s a full-on multitouch trackpad, too, with support for all the two- and three-fingered gestures that are now a part of iPadOS. Two-finger scrolling is nice, yes, but three-finger swiping between apps is even nicer. The only gesture that has suffered a bit is pinching to zoom, mostly because I’ve gotten used to being able to pinch at a diagonal on the large Magic Trackpad 2 at my desk. This trackpad, which is wide but not tall, requires me to rotate my hand a little and do that pinch in the wider dimension. Or—imagine this—just pick my hand up off the keyboard and pinch on the screen instead.</p>\n<p>I’ve already written about <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/03/the-ipad-cursor-is-here-no-wait-required/\">iPadOS 13.4’s pointing-device support</a>, so suffice it to say that Apple has done a very good job, and navigating apps with a pointing device feels far more natural than you might expect for an operating system that was built with touch as its primary input. Beyond two-finger scrolling and three-finger multitasking, my favorite feature is the addition of a proper text-editing cursor.</p>\n<p>I’ve always been reluctant to do heavy text-editing tasks on the iPad Pro, mostly because editing requires a lot of precision text selection—and my Mac was the best tool for that task. In apps that display the new text-editing cursor, I can move the insertion point and select text just as easily as I can on macOS.</p>\n<h2>A hubless charging option</h2>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/mk-closed-chairarm-6c.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Like the Smart Keyboard, the Magic Keyboard connects to the iPad Pro via the Smart Connector on the back. This makes the keyboard’s connection to the iPad more reliable, since it’s direct and doesn’t require Bluetooth. And it supplies the keyboard with power, so as long as your iPad is working, your keyboard is sure to work too.</p>\n<p>The iPad’s Smart Connector port (in both of its iterations) can also pass power <em>into</em> the iPad. I think maybe the <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2016/05/review-logitech-base/\">Logitech Base</a> was the only product that ever provided external charge capabilities via a Smart Connector, and it was a very slow charger indeed.</p>\n<p>The new Smart Connector introduced on the 2018 iPad Pro models seems to have a much faster charging capability than the previous generation, because the Magic Keyboard comes with a USB-C charging port on its left hinge. Depending on how you use your iPad, it’s either a great addition or an irrelevant one.</p>\n<p>The USB-C port on the Magic Keyboard won’t charge your iPad as quickly as a USB-C fast charging plug will. If you need to charge your iPad quickly, plugging directly into the iPad will generally be preferable. And if you’re not using the USB-C port on the iPad, why not use it?</p>\n<p>If, however, you <em>do</em> use the iPad’s USB-C port to connect accessories—I use it to attach wired headphones so I can edit podcasts with zero latency, or to attach a USB microphone so I can <em>record</em> podcasts, or to attach a USB storage device so I can copy files—then you might find yourself in certain circumstances where you’d like to charge your iPad while you’re also using one of those accessories. What happens if you need to record a podcast on your iPad but you’ll run out of battery if you don’t keep it charged?</p>\n<p>In the past, the only solution to this problem was to carry an external USB hub with you. But the Magic Keyboard’s charging port lets you do both at once, and it means that a lot of iPad Pro travelers can now leave that extra USB hub at home.</p>\n<p>The other use case I can see is someone who tends to leave the Magic Keyboard open on a desk or table, and brings the iPad Pro over to get some work done. You could keep the Magic Keyboard plugged in via the USB-C port and whenever you magnetically attached your iPad Pro to do some work, it would also top up the battery.</p>\n<p>What would be nicer, of course, would be a USB-C port that was also capable of transferring data, so you you turn the Magic Keyboard into a full-fledged docking station. That way, if you attached your iPad Pro, it could automatically attach to networking, an external display, and other devices—plus power. Maybe that’s somewhere Apple can take the Smart Connector in a future generation of iPads. But for now, the USB-C charging port is a nice addition, especially for people who get antsy at the idea that they must unplug from power in order to attach a peripheral to their iPad.</p>\n<h2>One option among many</h2>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/mk-brydge-sidebyside-6c.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>The Magic Keyboard (left) lacks the function keys of the Brydge Pro (right), but it brings the screen closer to your face—and your fingers.</figcaption></figure><p>The iPad Pro is a modular computer system, and you can choose to equip it to serve your needs. The Magic Keyboard gives the iPad Pro the ability to transform into a full-fledged laptop, complete with backlit laptop-style keys and trackpad.</p>\n<p>Some people—and I am definitely in this group—have dreamed about a product like this for a long time. I couldn’t be happier that it exists. I haven’t traveled with a laptop regularly for years now. The Magic Keyboard lets my iPad Pro be a laptop when I need it to be—and the rest of the time, I can pull the iPad out of the Magic Keyboard and use it in tablet form.</p>\n<p>It comes at a price, however. Not a metaphorical price—a real one. $299 for the 11-inch model and $349 for the 12.9-inch. That’s a lot of dough, but if you use your iPad Pro frequently as a laptop (or have been dreaming of doing so), it’s not unreasonable. What makes the high price a bit more palatable is that the Magic Keyboard is compatible with the 2018 models of iPad Pro as well as the 2020 updates, so users of the 2018 model won’t have to make an even more expensive purchase just to have the right to buy a keyboard.</p>\n<p>Still, not everyone needs this product. The Smart Keyboard Folio is a better choice if you want to carry around a iPad with a keyboard, but don’t want it to feel like you’re lugging a laptop. If you only want to <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2018/04/writing-on-my-ipad-at-home/\">work on an iPad at a desk or table</a>, you might be better off buying an inexpensive iPad stand (to get the iPad’s screen at an ergonomic height), a USB or Bluetooth keyboard of your choice, and a Magic Trackpad 2.</p>\n<p>There are also plenty of other iPads out there, many of which support Apple’s original Smart Keyboard, and all of which work with pretty much any Bluetooth or USB keyboard. You can buy a 10.2-inch iPad for $329 and pair it with a $159 Smart Keyboard. Or buy an iPad mini and pair it with a cheap Bluetooth keyboard. There are a lot of options.</p>\n<p>But if you want an iPad that can also be a full-fledged laptop, the Magic Keyboard is the answer. Apple now sells two more laptops, an 11-inch model that starts at $1098 and a 12.9-inch model that starts at $1348. Those are pro laptop prices, but guess what? The iPad Pro is a pro laptop now. If and when you want it to be.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 24 Apr 2020 14:30:00 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/mk-campchair-6c.jpg?ssl=1","linkMd5":"81c2953476da824d2790538a18d3aa56","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn19@2020_4/2020/08/24/18-19-09-022_2bcf6c7cdbbeeac2.webp","destWidth":1360,"destHeight":1020,"sourceBytes":390058,"destBytes":390058,"author":"Jason Snell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/mk-campchair-6c.jpg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn19@2020_4/2020/08/24/18-19-09-022_2bcf6c7cdbbeeac2.webp","https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/mk-side-ikea-6c.jpg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn91@2020_5/2020/08/24/18-19-14-886_88868125a0e06b08.webp","https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/mk-topdown-keys-6c.jpg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn55@2020_6/2020/08/24/18-19-14-421_924ff3ccb8207e60.webp","https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/mk-closed-chairarm-6c.jpg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn79@2020_1/2020/08/24/18-19-16-375_7633f0e535a2f247.webp","https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/mk-brydge-sidebyside-6c.jpg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn92@2020_5/2020/08/24/18-19-14-051_2e68b19207e099ad.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144479},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"Taking a circular saw to a Mac Pro ↦","link":"http://two.wordpress.test/post/2020/04/taking_a_circular_saw_to_a_mac_pro/","description":"<p>Quinn Nelson just posted a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4HPq-tEYWY&#38;feature=emb_title\">great video</a> in which he modifies his Mac Pro in a number of ways. 3-D printed caster adapters, LED lights, a 3-D printed SATA drive case, and then the big one—he uses a circular saw to cut the bottom of the outer shell so that he can lift the case off without unplugging any cables.</p>\n<figure class=\"youtube\"><p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/t4HPq-tEYWY\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n</figure><p>Not only is the video entertaining, you’ll learn something you may not have known about what happens when you lift the case off of a Mac Pro when it’s running.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4HPq-tEYWY&#038;feature=emb_title\">Go to the linked site</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/link/2020/04/taking-a-circular-saw-to-a-mac-pro/\">Read on Six Colors</a>.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 01 Apr 2020 18:16:29 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"8a7b0e5e806ab7ca36bc90065b22b087","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jason Snell","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144578},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"6C Podcast: April 17, 2020","link":"http://com.sixcolors.podcast.9674","description":"<p>Jason buys a book.&#8230;</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/subscribe/\">Become a member</a></strong> to listen to our exclusive weekly podcast and get more benefits.</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 17 Apr 2020 16:47:32 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"ad2222fb3ea41444bfef3944a3cc1d54","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jason Snell","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144491},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"What we could see in iOS 14 (Macworld/Dan Moren)","link":"http://two.wordpress.test/post/2020/02/what_we_could_see_in_ios_14/","description":"<p>February might be the cold doldrums of winter, where important tech news is sparser than sun and green grass, but that doesn’t mean there’s nothing of note going on.

This chart covers the era of 15-inch laptops, from the original Titanium PowerBook G4 in 2001, and also includes the 16-inch MacBook Pro (2019). I chose the last top-of-the-line 15-inch laptop to be released in a given year, and no, I didn’t include any bigger or smaller laptops.</p>\n<p>Witness the rise and fall of Apple laptop ports, which peaked at 11 with the 2003-2005 MacBook Pros and has reached an all-time low the past four years with five:</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/chart-ports3-6c.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"Chart of MacBook Ports\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>In 2001, the Titanium PowerBook G4 had a VGA port <em>and</em> an S-Video port, 2 USB ports, one FireWire port, modem and Ethernet ports, and a power port. The 2002 model added an audio in jack.</p>\n<p>The aluminum PowerBook line appeared in 2003, and with it an upgrade to two FireWire ports. In 2006, the processors shifted to Intel, the name changed to MacBook, and in the most seismic of changes, the built-in modem finally went away. (It was a controversial choice, believe it or not. Apple’s been removing ports and making people angry for a very long time.) The S-Video port also finally vanished.</p>\n<p>The next big change in port configurations was in 2008, when Apple cut back to a single FireWire 800 port, and the primary video port switched from DVI to Mini DisplayPort.</p>\n<p>After a few years of stability, in 2012 the first Retina MacBook Pro appeared, with only seven ports.  Audio in and out were collapsed into a single minijack, and in yet another controversial move at the time, Apple removed the Ethernet jack. FireWire was replaced by Thunderbolt (which could tunnel DisplayPort for video output), but Apple also offered a dedicated HDMI video port.</p>\n<p>That general configuration lasted until 2016, when Apple’s war on ports went into high gear. From the heights of 11 ports in 2003-2005, we come to today’s state of affairs: five ports. No more HDMI, no more dedicated power port. Instead, four USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports and a headphone jack.</p>\n<p>How low can Apple go? It’s already gone lower, of course. The low-end 13-inch MacBook Pro and the MacBook Air only have three ports, and the discontinued 12-inch MacBook only had two. I’d like to declare that the 16-inch MacBook Pro is probably solid at five ports for a while, but after looking at this chart, I’m even more worried about the headphone jack’s chances to survive the next MacBook Pro redesign.</p>\n<p>[<em>Updated to reflect the earlier disappearance of the S-Video port. Also, I didn’t include card slots in this chart because slots aren’t ports!</em>]</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 06 Mar 2020 20:13:00 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/chart-ports3-6c.png?ssl=1","linkMd5":"ba2857b8f7f8f8c6b1153093b9dc8920","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn47@2020_4/2020/08/24/18-19-07-611_afd8699dcadf5268.webp","destWidth":1360,"destHeight":992,"sourceBytes":49336,"destBytes":49336,"author":"Jason Snell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/chart-ports3-6c.png?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn47@2020_4/2020/08/24/18-19-07-611_afd8699dcadf5268.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144606},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"The iPhone SE and iPad Pro don’t have ultra wideband.

When you wonder why there isn’t more new in Notes or why Mail is missing stuff it’s because supporting a multi-year strategy trumps individual teams and that’s a good thing.”</p>\n<p>  …Within hours of Apple announcing that they were moving all Macs to their own silicon within two years, I was on a podcast whining about the lack of a share button in Apple Mail.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>I’ve been thinking about this a lot. There are missing features, and longstanding bugs. And there are some users who are going to be pushed off of the Mac entirely by Apple’s decision to move Macs to Apple-designed processors.</p>\n<p>But if Apple has to choose between its multi-year strategy to get the Mac on the same architecture as its other products, or catering to people who (for example) want to use Boot Camp, we know which one Apple is going to choose.</p>\n<p>This is what separates Apple from Microsoft, or as Sinofsky said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stevesi/status/1275311072874885121\">earlier in his thread</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Many argue a commitment to compatibility and bringing forward customers made Microsoft unique. I agree and believe that. What it does, though, is make it much less interesting/important for customers to move forward with you.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is the nub of it. A lot of Microsoft’s failures come because its corporate culture is always focused on compatibility—and rightly so, since its enormous installed base of users is its single greatest asset.

It doesn’t mean the company is always right, and it doesn’t change how lousy it is to be left on the outside looking in because of a strategic decision. But it is Apple to the core.

On the Mac, I don’t mind typing things, but on the iPhone, having forms automatically filled out for you can be a huge time saver.</p>\n<p>But, as it turns out, there are other benefits too. For example, privacy. As keyboard engineer Zeheng Chen points out, when you have an app where you want to send something to one of your contacts, you might choose to use a contact picker UI instead of granting access to your contacts, in order to minimize the amount of information that the app can see. But a contact picker UI might be slower than autofilling a contact address as you start to type it, and the autofill option <em>still</em> prevents the app from getting any data but what you type into the field. Plus, developers don’t have to create a user interface, since it’s already built-in.</p>\n<p>Starting in macOS Big Sur, AppKit—the native APIs for building Mac apps—will now have access to AutoFill. And third-party password management apps will be available as sources for AutoFill, as they have been on iOS and iPadOS, making those programs even more useful.</p>\n<p>Me, I’m all for less typing! <em>—Dan Moren</em></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10190/\">Create quick interactions with Shortcuts on watchOS</a></strong></p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/shortcuts-complications.jpeg?ssl=1\" alt=\"Shortcuts complications\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>You can launch specific Shortcuts actions right from a complication.</figcaption></figure><p>Apple’s Shortcuts utility started its life as a third-party app called Workflow that offered an Apple Watch app. It’s taken awhile, but Apple Watch support has now arrived in Shortcuts. Not only is there a Shortcuts app on the watch, but you can launch specific shortcuts directly from watch-face complication slots. (To designate a specific shortcut for sync with the Apple Watch, you mark it as such within the Shortcuts app on your iPhone.)</p>\n<p>Depending on how developers implement their Shortcuts support, shortcuts may run specifically on the Apple Watch without ever going back to the iPhone. But to do this, the parent app must have its associated Apple Watch app installed, too. While this is the ideal experience, there’s also the capability for a shortcut on Apple Watch to phone home to the iPhone and run the necessary automation there. It’ll just be a lot slower. <em>—Jason Snell</em></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/10633\">Capture and stream apps on the Mac with ReplayKit</a></strong></p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/wwdc20-replaykit.jpeg?ssl=1\" alt=\"ReplayKit\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>I like a presenter with good taste in microphones.</figcaption></figure><p>Also starting in Big Sur, Mac apps will for the first time get access to ReplayKit, Apple’s API for recording, capturing, and broadcasting content from within your app. So if you’ve got, say, a Mac game, you can automatically build in features to not only do screen recordings, but also to broadcast your gameplay—and even provide an in-app editor or add overlays and other effects.</p>\n<p>ReplayKit has been available on iOS and iPadOS for a couple years, but it’s a great addition to the Mac. Game streaming has become more and more common, and in our current world environment, there are lots of other instances in which being able to record and broadcast your app may be useful, such as during meetings.</p>\n<p>In terms of gaming, Apple has also added support for triggering a screen recording via a button on an external PlayStation or Xbox controller, which is handy for when you want to record something that just happened without having to switch to a different input device. (On their respective game consoles, this functionality is generally accessed via controllers.)</p>\n<p>I’m curious to see what the limits of ReplayKit are on the Mac. I’ve started spending more time streaming video for various types of entertainment, such as the shows we do at <a href=\"https://www.theincomparable.com/tpk/\">Total Party Kill</a> and our occasional Jackbox games at <a href=\"https://www.theincomparable.com\">The Incomparable</a>.

For the quarter, the Company posted a net loss of $8 million, or $.02 per share. These results compare to a net profit of $38 million, or $.11 per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenues for the quarter were $1.47 billion, up 7 percent from the year-ago quarter, and gross margins were 27.6 percent, down from 30.7 percent in the year-ago quarter. International sales accounted for 43 percent of the quarter’s revenues.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>That was 17 years ago. And it was the last time Apple lost money in a fiscal quarter.</p>\n<p>Apple actually lost money in both fiscal 2001 and 2002. Our memory of Apple’s history involves Jobs returning in 1997, the iMac in 1998, and the iPod in 2001, leading the company into a glorious future. The fact is, after a few years of a return to profitability, Apple went in the hole in 2001 and 2002. The iPod began to pick up speed in 2003, and after two years of modest profits, things started growing and then exploded with the release of the iPhone.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/apple-annual-profits-6c.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Here’s another fun note from that 17-year-old press release:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Apple shipped 743 thousand Macintosh® units during the quarter, about even with the year-ago quarter.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Apple generated $1.1 billion in revenue off of those 743,000 Macs. Apple doesn’t release Mac unit sales figures anymore, but on its most recent fiscal quarter, Apple generated $7.2 billion in Mac revenue.

I unabashedly love this computer. While it wasn’t my first Mac, it was the first Mac that was truly <em>mine</em>. Acquired for my sophomore year of college, it was one of the first Macs to have a DVD drive (turning my dorm room into the place we watched movies on a laughably small 17-inch monitor), and it not only spanned the Classic Mac OS and Mac OS X eras, but saw numerous upgrades along the way, including an additional internal hard drive, the addition of a PCI card with four USB 2.0 ports, a RAM upgrade to a then-<em>amazing</em> 512MB, and even an eventual processor bump wherein a 600MHz G4 chip replaced the stock 400MHz G3.</p>\n<p>Basically, it’s been through a lot.</p>\n<h2>Make sure we’re connected</h2>\n<p>So, how to connect to this venerable machine? It has USB ports, FireWire 400 ports, and even an ADB port <em>and</em> a modem<sup id=\"fnref-10845-luxury\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-10845-luxury\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup>, but it predates both FireWire’s Target Disk Mode (even if I had a machine with a FireWire port <em>or</em> the right combination of adapters to connect to it) and built-in wireless networking. I can’t even connect it to a monitor, as it only sports a VGA port, and I don’t have the means to connect that to either my HDTV or the old Apple Cinema Display I have in my office.</p>\n<p>Look, let’s cut to the chase: if all I wanted was to get old data off the machine, the easiest thing by far would be to pull the internal hard drives and pop them in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dmoren/status/1240707308105023489\">a USB adapter</a>. Done and dusted.</p>\n<p>But I have to admit, I was curious: I wanted to see if the machine would boot and, moreover, if I could actually log in to it. I’d previously had good luck getting into my old Core Duo Mac mini by using an Ethernet cable<sup id=\"fnref-10845-crossover\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-10845-crossover\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">2</a></sup> and logging in via <code>ssh</code>.  That took a little doing, but I figured what I’d learned from that exploit ought to prepare me well for this undertaking.</p>\n<p>Not even close.</p>\n<p>Both the G3 and the Mac mini started with a similar problem: I’d configured them to use static IP addresses. Ironically, this was accidentally complicated by the fact that I’d very recently replaced my ancient AirPort Extreme with an Eero base station—and, as it turns out, they use different subnets by default.<sup id=\"fnref-10845-subnets\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-10845-subnets\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">3</a></sup></p>\n<p>My bacon was, fortunately, saved by two lucky breaks. Firstly, Apple’s Bonjour service<sup id=\"fnref-10845-rendezvous\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-10845-rendezvous\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">4</a></sup>, which provides plain-English addresses and makes network discovery easier. Secondly, even though I could not originally get access by <code>ssh</code>ing into the static address (which I did not initially remember), the Bonjour name helpfully sent me to the G3’s IPv6 address, which <em>did</em> work.</p>\n<p>At first, that provided very little traction—scanning the ports with the <code>nmap</code> utility that I installed via <a href=\"https://brew.sh\">homebrew</a>, it seemed as though all the network ports on the G3 were blocked, even though I knew I’d frequently used <code>ssh</code> to log in to the machine remotely back in the day. Attempts to log in via screen sharing and file sharing were likewise fruitless. On a whim, I restarted the machine from the command line, at which point i was able to at least get a response on the <code>ssh</code> port, though still only via the IPv6 address.</p>\n<p>Then I hit the next roadblock: remembering the password of a machine that had not been booted for over a decade.</p>\n<h2>Too many secrets</h2>\n<p>Here’s where my guilty confession comes in. While I’ve mostly transitioned to using strong unique passwords for everything, my Mac login passwords have long been based on a certain predictable (to me) pattern. So while I didn’t remember the exact iteration of the password, I knew enough that in theory I ought to be able to reverse engineer it.</p>\n<p>I recruited friend of the site James Thomson to help and he quickly generated a list of 250 or so possible permutations based on an obfuscated pattern that I gave him. I planned to run those as a brute force attack over <code>ssh</code> using <a href=\"https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/gain-ssh-access-servers-by-brute-forcing-credentials-0194263/\">some commonly available command line tools</a>.<sup id=\"fnref-10845-mrrobot\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-10845-mrrobot\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">5</a></sup></p>\n<p>Alas, that attempt to get my Crash Override on was stymied by the fact that I could still only access the machine via its IPv6 address, which apparently doesn’t play nicely with macOS as far as those brute force tools are concerned. So, instead, I fired up Numbers and set about figuring out the most likely password candidates; I ended up with 48 possibilities.</p>\n<p>I hit the jackpot on number nine.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">When I finally got in, the last login date on this computer was listed as Wednesday, January 23, 2008, or exactly 4444 days ago. ðŸ˜±(Also, my Cowboy Bebop nerdery is on full display with this machine.) <a href=\"https://t.co/A7pt6fWjhB\">pic.twitter.com/A7pt6fWjhB</a></p>\n<p>— Dan Moren (@dmoren) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dmoren/status/1242492935511425025?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 24, 2020</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>Upon login, I was not only greeted with a good old Terminal Message of the Day I’d put in some decades past, but also with the note that the last login had been on January 23, 2008, or—amazingly—exactly 4444 days ago.<sup id=\"fnref-10845-4444\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-10845-4444\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">6</a></sup></p>\n<p>Once logged in via the command line, I figured the world was my oyster.

As Nick Statt <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21203294/amazon-prime-video-ios-in-app-purchases-iphone-ipad-apple-tv-change\">reports for the Verge</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Amazon’s Prime Video iOS and Apple TV apps now let customers make in-app purchases, including renting and buying films and TV shows… Prior to the change, Amazon would not allow you to rent or buy content on the Prime Video app, instead, directing users to a web browser.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>I think Statt is conflating two different Apple policies, however. Up to now, the rule has been that if you sell digital goods within an app, you need to sell it using Apple’s own purchasing engine. And yes, the standard rate for in-app purchases using that system is 30 percent.</p>\n<p>But this doesn’t seem to be that. This is using Amazon’s own purchasing engine, the same one you’d run into if you switched out to Safari and rented or bought a movie there. I entered my Amazon security PIN and was allowed to rent “Jojo Rabbit” directly from Amazon using my linked payment method there, and received an Amazon receipt in email. Apple wasn’t involved in any way.</p>\n<p>I doubt that Amazon just went rogue, so clearly something has happened. Perhaps Amazon has agreed to cut Apple in for a percentage of total sales originating from the app. Or perhaps Apple dropped the whole thing. I don’t know. I look forward to the behind-the-scenes dirt emerging sometime.</p>\n<p>I checked out Amazon’s other digital-media apps, Kindle and <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2015/06/comixology-37-new-app-makes-the-best-of-the-amazonapple-situation/\">Comixology</a>, as well as the Amazon.com app, to see if I could buy digital goods directly from any of them. As of this writing, I couldn’t—but I wouldn’t be surprised if those apps are also about to get a sudden update that allows their users to buy digital goods directly rather than having to exit to a web browser to do so.</p>\n<p><strong>Update</strong>: Benjamin Mayo of 9to5Mac reports that if you don’t have a linked Amazon account, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bzamayo/status/1245450778137034752\">the transaction uses Apple’s in-app purchase system</a>.

It has fed a bunch of overhyped headlines around the web about malware on the Mac growing rapidly. What it really reveals is that the Mac is increasingly a target for annoying adware apps—which isn’t quite the same as malware. Meanwhile, Apple has also been adjusting its policies and adding new features to fight the spread of this stuff.</p>\n<p>Malwarebytes reports:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  …most Mac threats, and certainly the most prevalent ones of 2019, are families of adware and potentially unwanted programs (PUPs). The most common Mac malware family, OSX.Generic. Suspicious, fell well down the list at 30th place in Mac- specific detections, and hundreds of spots down on a cross-platform threat list.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>The key here is to differentiate between adware, PUPs, and malware. The top 29 bad actors tracked by Malwarebytes in 2019 were adware or PUPs, which are annoying and disingenuous but not considered actually harmful. The big new entry in 2019 was called <a href=\"https://forums.malwarebytes.com/topic/164444-removal-instructions-for-taplika-new-tab/\">New Tab</a> and is a browser hijacker.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-4106\"></span></p>\n<p>It’s worth considering the tools Apple has at its disposal to make the Mac safe from questionable software. First, there’s the Mac App Store, which has a rigorous approval process that blocks most or all of the techniques that these sorts of apps use. Occasionally something leaks through, but those mistakes are rare and rapidly corrected. If you’re only downloading software from the Mac App Store, you’re pretty much safe.</p>\n<p>Next is Apple’s relatively new <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2018/06/with-mojave-apple-makes-changes-inside-and-outside-mac-app-store/\">notarization</a> process. Sofware developers now have to pass their apps through an automated analysis on an Apple server, and then Apple cryptographically signs the app. Apps that fail some checks can be rejected, and Apple can remotely kill those apps if they are found to be behaving badly.</p>\n<p>And then there’s Gatekeeper, which scans apps when you launch them and doesn’t let them run unless they pass a bunch of checks. Depending on your Mac’s security settings, Gatekeeper can prevent the launching of software that doesn’t pass muster.</p>\n<p>The Malwarebytes report covers the entirety of calendar year 2019, but in November Apple actually stepped up its efforts to identify problematic software and clarified some of its policies to give it wider latitude to shut off software that doesn’t quite fit the definition of malware. Apple pointed me to <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/support/protecting-users-from-suspicious-software/\">this note to developers</a> that specifies what kinds of software will be considered for removal. There are three kinds:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Deceptive apps</strong> that misrepresent functionality, mimic other software, make misleading claims, or consume resources without user content.</li>\n<li><strong>Difficult to remove apps</strong> that fight to stay on your Mac, want to charge you a fee to remove themselves, or display ads outside the app.</li>\n<li><strong>Apps that degrade security or privacy</strong> and are therefore more classic definitions of malware. This category also includes apps that violate a user’s privacy expectations by transmitting sensitive data elsewhere that is contrary to the stated purpose of the software.</li>\n</ul><p>Now, does this mean that Apple is going to shut down all of those apps that claim to clean your system and keep it running smoothly? Though most Mac experts would suggest that such apps are not really necessary, it’s an arguable point—and Apple appears to be erring on the side of allowing apps in that gray area to exist. At least, so long as they don’t violate other aspects of its policies. (The FDA doesn’t prohibit homeopathic remedies, either.)</p>\n<p>It seems that many of the items in Malwarebytes’ report have gotten the hammer from Apple and are no longer actively circulating. The report’s long list of Mac software is an alert that the Mac is now a much more enticing target for makers of adware and other scam software. It certainly can’t be a coincidence that Apple is stepping up enforcement of its policies at the same time that the number of these sleazy apps is increasing.</p>\n<p>There is also one very interesting observation in the Malwarebytes report that gives me pause, as someone who uses the Mac’s unix underpinnings to drive a lot of automation:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  We expect to see that trend continue in 2020 as Apple tightens the requirements and conditions for checking, code signing, and notarization. Since shell scripts are exempt from these restrictions, we expect to see them used more and more by malware.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>I would imagine that future versions of macOS will make it harder to run arbitrary shell scripts, which is a bummer—but if that’s where the scoundrels are heading, Apple’s security team will have to chase them there. This is why we can’t have nice things.</p>\n<p>As the creators of anti-malware software, Malwarebytes is perfectly positioned to understand these trends, and their report is full of valuable information. At the same time, their business also potentially benefits if Mac users are more fearful about malware. And Malwarebytes’s Mac expert, Thomas Reed, stoked those fears <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/2/12/21134681/mac-pc-virus-malware-malwarebytes\">in an interview with Recode</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  There is a rising tide of Mac threats hitting a population that still believes that ‘Macs don’t get viruses,'” Reed said. “I still frequently encounter people who firmly believe this, and who believe that using any kind of security software is not necessary, or even harmful. This makes macOS a fertile ground for the influx of new threats, whereas it’s common knowledge that Windows PCs need security software.”\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>It’s valid to wonder if the Mac’s reputation for being a safe harbor leads some Mac users to make bad security choices. But “Macs don’t get viruses” is a statement that is still overwhelmingly true. Even if it makes it awfully hard to sell Mac anti-malware software.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 13 Feb 2020 16:11:48 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/malwarebytes2019.jpg?ssl=1","linkMd5":"6734e23d1a96cbf5311b88b54ef524fa","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn67@2020_3/2020/08/24/18-19-10-024_d4d8495c918c4d43.webp","destWidth":1360,"destHeight":888,"sourceBytes":46228,"destBytes":46228,"author":"Jason Snell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/malwarebytes2019.jpg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn67@2020_3/2020/08/24/18-19-10-024_d4d8495c918c4d43.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144629},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"(Sponsor) SoundSource","link":"http://two.wordpress.test/post/2020/03/feed_sponsor_soundsource/","description":"<p>My thanks once again to Rogue Amoeba and <a href=\"https://rogueamoeba.com/sentBy.php?6CSS2\">SoundSource</a> for sponsoring Six Colors this week.

It’s like a little cartoon character, the plucky dot who is up to any challenge, even if it means contorting itself into whatever form is required.</p>\n<p>Consider the animation when it enters and exits an existing button. The circle oozes out into a curved rectangle, like it’s some sort of sticky blob. When it’s over the active area, the whole button tilts as if the blob is pulling it around. Move far enough, though, and the blob breaks back off of the button and returns to its traditional shape as a simple circle.</p>\n<figure class=\"pull-right\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/dot-to-i-beam.gif?ssl=1\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></figure><p>Then there’s the transition from the standard cursor to the text-editing version. On the Mac, this is an instant conversion—one moment you’re seeing an arrow, the next you’re seeing the I-beam text editing cursor.</p>\n<p>In contrast, on iPadOS 13.4 the dot squashes, getting taller and thinner until it transforms into an editing cursor. This is completely unnecessary animation, but it’s delightful, and I’m impressed that Apple went to the trouble to create it.</p>\n<p>The iOS text-editing cursor is a simple, unadorned sliver with curved corners. Just as the circle is much simpler than the traditional macOS arrow, this sliver is all soft and round while the Mac’s I-beam cursor is all sharp edges—not just at top and bottom, but right in the middle, too. You could put an eye out with that thing.</p>\n<p>(Developers <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wooji/status/1242851479955943426\">will be able to add their own custom cursors</a> as well, and I’m looking forward to seeing how that plays out.)</p>\n<p>Finally, I wanted to praise the subtle way that Apple deals with making the cursor visible no matter what it’s hovering over.</p>\n<figure class=\"pull-right\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/dot-reverse.gif?ssl=1\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></figure><p>On the Mac, the arrow cursor is black with a thick white outline, so it’ll be equally visible on dark and light backgrounds. On the iPad, it’s a gray circle—but one that’s intelligent about what colors surround it. When it’s over a white background, it’s dark gray—but move it over a dark area, and it will brighten into a light gray. Move it back over a light background, and it deepens back to dark gray.</p>\n<p>Apple didn’t just copy Mac cursor support and paste it into iPadOS with version 13.4. This is a careful, considered set of additions that rethink what a cursor should look like. And apparently it should look like an adorable round sticky color-changing blob.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 24 Mar 2020 23:30:00 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/hidden-button.gif?ssl=1","linkMd5":"99a5fb3b6a7f78cc5df8a663769f3458","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn96@2020_1/2020/08/24/18-19-09-727_87a7bb52b80517ab.webp","destWidth":194,"destHeight":126,"sourceBytes":140058,"destBytes":65692,"author":"Jason Snell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/hidden-button.gif?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn96@2020_1/2020/08/24/18-19-09-727_87a7bb52b80517ab.webp","https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/dot-to-i-beam.gif?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn84@2020_4/2020/08/24/18-19-17-596_7aefc29876c7a582.webp","https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/dot-reverse.gif?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn44@2020_1/2020/08/24/18-19-14-653_2f5c9ea091ae3906.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144589},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"Quick Tip: Customize your Terminal login with a message of the day","link":"http://two.wordpress.test/post/2020/03/quick_tip_customize_your_terminal_login_with_a_message_of_the_day/","description":"<p>My <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/03/unpacking-hacking-and-cracking-a-powermac-g3/\">adventure resurrecting my Power Mac G3</a> not only brought to light old files, but also some old computing habits, prompting a question from one Twitter user:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I appreciate the subtle Cowboy Bebop reference in that terminal sceeenshot ðŸ˜…</p>\n<p>Is that still a thing in macOS/Unix?

Third-party apps filled the gap, the most impressive of which was <a href=\"https://tidbits.com/1992/08/10/cpu/\">Connectix PowerBook Utilities</a> (CPU). As Adam Engst wrote 28 years ago(!):</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  CPU’s most important features are its power saving features, and these abound. First, you can easily configure the times to spin down the hard drive, rest the processor, dim the backlighting, and put the PowerBook to sleep. Second, you can activate any of these power-saving measures with a hot-key, so I often shut down the hard drive when it wasn’t doing anything because I enjoy working on a silent PowerBook… Finally, Connectix recognized that you use the PowerBook in different places, so you can create sets of settings.\n</p></blockquote>\n<figure class=\"pull-right\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/cpu-computinghistory-6c.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"cpu-computinghistory\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>(<a href=\"http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/48427/Connectix-PowerBook-Utilities/\">Centre for Computing History</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>A lot of these features ended up in Mac OS, as they rightly should have, and CPU faded into oblivion. But I’ve been thinking about CPU a lot this week, after the 9to5Mac report that <a href=\"https://ww.9to5mac.com/2020/01/13/macos-beta-hints-at-future-pro-mode-to-boost-performance-on-portable-macs/\">a “Pro Mode” may be coming to a future version of macOS</a>. It seems to be a new setting that would decrease laptop battery life and increase fan noise in order to perform processor-intensive operations.</p>\n<p>Fair enough. But as <a href=\"https://marco.org/2020/01/13/macos-low-power-mode-redux\">Marco Arment</a> and <a href=\"https://ww.9to5mac.com/2020/01/13/macos-low-power-mode/#\">Chance Miller</a> pointed out last week, this feature seems to have missed the bigger opportunity on the other side of the coin: an iOS-style “Low-Power Mode” that would let MacBook users eke out longer battery life by tweaking settings, including disabling Turbo Boost on processors. A utility, <a href=\"https://www.rugarciap.com/turbo-boost-switcher-for-os-x/\">Turbo Boost Switcher</a> by Rugar Ciap (free; the pro version is $9), does this job—but throws up a warning suggesting that it might not be allowed to work with the next major version of macOS.</p>\n<p>I’m all for the idea of a low-power mode for Macs<sup id=\"fnref-4065-ipad\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-4065-ipad\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup>, and it’s a bit perplexing to see Apple prioritize turning off all battery-saving features and cranking the fans over letting users maximize battery life.</p>\n<p>I do have a wacky idea, though. (You knew I would.) What if Apple used the introduction of Pro Mode to adjust the <em>default</em> performance settings of macOS laptops? Yes, raw benchmark scores would drop, but in exchange Apple could make more expansive battery-life claims. Users who demand the best performance from their pro laptops could enable Pro Mode, which would drain that battery quickly, but in general use the laptops would run cooler and quieter and last longer. What if the way Marco uses his MacBook Pro—with Turbo Bost Switcher turned on—were the default for everyone?</p>\n<p>Of course, a better idea would be to provide users with more granular power-management controls, perhaps even with location-aware presets like Connectix PowerBook Utilities offered in the early 90s. I know that Apple’s tendency is to prevent users from fiddling with their computers’ settings in detail, but let’s be honest—the Energy Saver system preference pane is already an enormous collection of sliders and checkboxes. Adding a few more wouldn’t hurt anyone.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/energy-util-6c.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>It’s not like this isn’t already a complex spot.</figcaption></figure><p>While we’re at it, can we finally add a Low Data Mode to macOS as well? For years I’ve extolled the virtues of <a href=\"https://www.tripmode.ch\">TripMode</a>, an $8 utility that lets you control what Mac apps have access to the Internet if you’re using a slow or metered connection. That’s a feature that should just be built into macOS, though perhaps not with the level of granularity that TripMode offers. (It’s a classic Mac approach to build a new feature with a very simple set of user options, and then allow third parties to offer more complex interfaces on top of that same feature for the users who really care—so the introduction of a Low Data Mode need not be the end of powerful apps like TripMode.)</p>\n<p>Offering macOS apps better control over data usage would also perhaps open the door for cellular-equipped Mac laptops a bit wider. I’ve been using a cellular iPad Pro for the last few years, and I would never go back. The convenience of not having to tether to a phone or worry about the quality of the local Wi-Fi is worth the extra cost, and it’s a shame that MacBook users don’t have the chance to make that choice.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr><ol><li id=\"fn-4065-ipad\">\nI’d like one for iPads, too. <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fnref-4065-ipad\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/21a9.png\" alt=\"↩\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></a>\n</li>\n</ol></div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 17 Jan 2020 10:57:00 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/cpu-computinghistory-6c.jpg?ssl=1","linkMd5":"1a2d55ff42e140783ce391fc1cf7c16e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn96@2020_3/2020/08/24/18-19-06-586_c57ab0519683c89c.webp","destWidth":680,"destHeight":1012,"sourceBytes":88446,"destBytes":88446,"author":"Jason Snell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/cpu-computinghistory-6c.jpg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn96@2020_3/2020/08/24/18-19-06-586_c57ab0519683c89c.webp","https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/energy-util-6c.jpg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn67@2020_2/2020/08/24/18-19-13-750_fdcf6a73dcd27124.webp","https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/21a9.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn51@2020_2/2020/08/24/18-19-11-215_25686225908fe44d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144652},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"Fun With Charts: Time for a change?","link":"http://two.wordpress.test/post/2020/05/fun_with_charts_time_for_a_change/","description":"<p>For this week’s chart<sup id=\"fnref-10963-technically\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-10963-technically\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup>, I thought I’d illustrate how long Apple has historically stuck with different processor architectures. As you probably know, there are lots of reports that in the next year, Apple will begin to roll out Macs powered by its own ARM processors rather than those made by Intel. (Dan and I actually discussed it in depth on this week’s Six Colors podcast, which is available to all <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/subscribe/\">Six Colors subscribers</a>.)</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/marchoftime-version-5-6c.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>This wouldn’t be the Mac’s first processor transition. It’s already been through two, and I’ve been privileged to witness them both. The Motorola 68000 era lasted for the Mac’s first 12 years (non-PowerPC PowerBooks… lingered). In 1994, the PowerPC transition began, and Apple shipped Macs with PowerPC processors for 12 years.</p>\n<p>At 14 years and counting, the Intel era is the longest in the Mac’s history. The transition was also the fastest—Apple really cleared out the PowerPC Macs in a hurry and replaced them with Intel models.</p>\n<p>While it’s theoretically possible that Apple could swap every Mac model to ARM processors in 2021, it seems unlikely. You’ll probably be able to buy a new Mac running Intel chips into 2022, and possibly for many years after that.

We originally set out distributing it on local bulletin boards as a self-contained app generated by a program called <a href=\"http://www.mac.org/utilities/docmaker/\">DOCMaker</a>, but as the popularity of the web rose, we eventually transitioned there.</p>\n<p>For many years, that was the most experience I had with self-publishing, until a couple weeks ago, when I decided to embark upon a new experiment: <a href=\"https://dmoren.com/short-stories\">putting out ebook versions of a couple short stories</a> in the same Galactic Cold War universe as <a href=\"https://dmoren.com/writing/\">my three novels</a>.</p>\n<p>One of the things about being a traditionally published author is that your publisher takes care of the actual production of a book: you hand over a Word doc, they turn it into something that people will actually end up reading. As a result, this experiment meant that I needed to learn some new skills, and find some tools to help me along the way.</p>\n<h2>Duck and cover</h2>\n<p>Visual art has never been one of my strengths—there’s a reason I deal in words, friend. But whoever said that you shouldn’t judge a book by its cover has never dealt with the reality of sales: one of my former agents was convinced that the only things that really sell books are the first line and the cover.</p>\n<p>So, if I was going to put out an ebook, it needed to have a good cover: not just some sort of slapped-on placeholder with the title and my name on it. Something eye-catching that also linked it into the visual identity of my series. The suggestion—from that same friend, Jason, who now has a sideline in creating independent tabletop RPGs—was to take advantage of some stock art.</p>\n<p>When we think of stock art, we probably think of things like cartoonish clip art or <a href=\"https://www.thehairpin.com/2011/01/women-laughing-alone-with-salad/\">ridiculous photos of women eating salad</a>. But that, folks, is your parents’ stock art: <a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/\">Shutterstock</a>, the vendor I went to, has a huge catalog of beautiful pieces of art by incredibly talented photographers and illustrators. So I bought an affordable 5-pack of licenses for $50, and picked out a couple of images that I thought evoked the feelings of the stories.</p>\n<p>Armed with illustrations far beyond my ability, I turned to my trusty image editor, Flying Meat’s <a href=\"https://flyingmeat.com/acorn/\">Acorn</a> to help transform them into book covers. While I’ve dabbled in Photoshop, I’ve never been particularly good at it—it’s simply too complex for most of the things I need to do. But I’ve been using Acorn for years<sup id=\"fnref-10929-gus\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-10929-gus\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">2</a></sup>, ever since my early days at the MacUser blog, though mainly for trivial tasks like cropping and resizing. This was a step above.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/selfpub-acorn-6c.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"Acorn\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>Acorn’s powerful Path Text feature lets you easily create text that follows a shape.</figcaption></figure><p>Mainly I wanted to spend some time crafting title and byline text that looked like the covers of my books and, after taking a very time-consuming approach for my first several attempts, I figured there must be an easier way to design styled text.</p>\n<p>That led me to Acorn’s impressive Path Text feature, which lets you simply draw a shape and have the text follow its edge. (Basic stuff for some, I’m sure, but for me it was an Archimedes-in-the-bathtub moment.) I pulled accent colors from the images to make the text pop, and then created some duplicate text for the shadow effect and voila! (Okay, that makes it sound quick, but it took me a few days and repeated stabs until I got something that looked right.)</p>\n<p>Despite my years of usage, I came away with a new appreciation for Acorn: for a $30 app, it is an incredibly powerful piece of software, and it puts out a great-looking book cover.</p>\n<h2>Book ’em, me-o</h2>\n<p>Of course, the cover is literally just the beginning. It’s what lies within that is the reason for this whole endeavor.</p>\n<p>The good news is that I’m no stranger to generating ebooks: when I send drafts to my beta readers, it’s generally in the ebook format of their choice.</p>\n<p>There are a few options in this arena. If you’re looking to make ebooks on the cheap, Apple’s own free <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/pages/\">Pages</a> can not only generate ePub files, but publish directly to Apple Books. On the other end of the spectrum, the $200 <a href=\"https://vellum.pub\">Vellum</a> lets you design and tweak to your heart’s content, and includes a handy preview mode.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/selfpub-scrivener-6c.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"Scrivener\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>Scrivener’s novel template works well for creating an ebook.</figcaption></figure><p>At $50, Literature and Latte’s <a href=\"https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview\">Scrivener</a> falls in between the two. It’s not strictly for making ebooks—that’s merely a feature of the app, which I use for the whole process of writing the books themselves, but Scrivener’s robust export tools mean that I can generate everything from a DOC file to an ePub. Previously, it used to even make Kindle books with the help of a command line tool from Amazon, but that tool has been deprecated, as I discovered during my foray into production.</p>\n<p>I ended up using Scrivener’s built-in novel template, pasting in the text from the original documents in which I’d written it, and then customizing the various front/after matter sections, such as the “Also By” page, the about the author page, and the afterword that I wrote for each of the short stories. That template worked well, and required only minimal massaging in order to adapt it to a shorter form work.</p>\n<p>Good as Scrivener is, it took me several attempts to get everything formatted the way I wanted, which does illustrate one downside of the process: every time you make a change, no matter how minor, you have to export the file, open it in a reader app like Books, and then eventually, when you discover that, say, the indentation is off, delete it from Books and restart the whole process. Vellum’s fancy preview mode would certainly be a big help there.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/selfpub-kindlepreviewer-6c.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"Kindle Previewer\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>Amazon’s Kindle Previewer lets you see how your book would look on one of the company’s e-readers, as well as convert formats.</figcaption></figure><p>I mentioned that Amazon’s command-line tool had been deprecated—it’s been replaced by a new app, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&#38;docId=1000765261\">Kindle Previewer</a>, that has some advantages over the old version. For one, rather than simply converting to Amazon’s MOBI (or newer KPF) format, it lets you open a file  (ePub, DOC, HTML, and more), and see how it would look on a Kindle. Think of it a bit like Xcode’s iOS simulator, but for Kindles. It’s handy, seeing as how the Kindle is a bit of black box and you want to make sure your file looks as good as it possible can without having to sideload it to a Kindle to check every single time.</p>\n<p>And just to check and make sure that the ePubs I generated were correct in every way, I ran them through <a href=\"https://github.com/w3c/epubcheck/\">epubcheck</a>, a free tool that validates the file structure. By default it’s a command line tool, though there are <a href=\"https://github.com/w3c/epubcheck/wiki/GUI\">several free GUI versions available as well</a>. I used the free <a href=\"https://www.pagina.gmbh/produkte/epub-checker/\">pagina EPUB-Checker</a>, which assured me that Scrivener’s ebook files were up to snuff.</p>\n<h2>The whole store-y</h2>\n<p>Ah, those blissful days of ignorance before I had to navigate self-publishing platforms. Turns out: there are a lot of them. I settled on using five of the most popular ebook platforms: Amazon, Apple Books, Barnes &#38; Noble, Kobo, and Google Play Books.</p>\n<p>The first problem is that submitting to each of these platforms individually is a pain. There are sites that aggregate much of this, perhaps most notably <a href=\"https://www.smashwords.com\">Smashwords</a>, but there  are some limitations to its approach. For one, it distributes the same ebook file to all of the platforms, so you’re out of luck if you want any differences between versions of your books—for example, store-specific links (i.e. you want the Apple Books version of your ebook to include links to Apple Books versions of <em>other</em> books). More to the point, Smashwords doesn’t include Amazon, and there’s no denying just how big Amazon is. (In <a href=\"https://dmoren.com/2020/04/17/how-are-those-free-ebooks-doing/\">my stats</a> for the first couple weeks of availability, it accounted for almost half of downloads.)</p>\n<p>So I ended up submitting directly to each site, which it had its upsides and downsides. One good point, to take away for the future: all of the stores support uploading ePubs, mostly because that’s the format that all but Amazon use to distribute books. Amazon will convert from ePub to its own proprietary format, but I used the aforementioned Kindle Previewer to do the conversion beforehand, to make sure everything looked right.</p>\n<p>Each platform has its idiosyncrasies, such as release dates. Some, such as Kobo, let you actually schedule the date your title will show up in the system. In most others, you can set the “on sale” date, but the books will show up in the system as soon as they propagate, which—in my case—let the cat out of the bag a bit early, as people stumbled across them.</p>\n<p>Amazon is the only one that doesn’t allow you to make your ebook free by default: it has to go for at least 99 cents in the U.S., and a commensurate price in other countries. However, you can submit price-matching requests with links from other platforms; the problem there is you have to do it separately for each individual country in which the book is available, which is a real pain.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/selfpub-itunesproducer-6c.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"iTunes Producer\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>Uploading books to the Apple Bookstore requires using the iTunes Producer app.</figcaption></figure><p>And while Apple lets you manage your titles via a web-based version of iTunes Connect (similar to the system it uses for apps), it took me a while to figure out that actually <em>uploading</em> the book files themselves requires use of Apple’s <a href=\"https://itunespartner.apple.com/books/tools\">iTunes Producer</a> app or, as mentioned previously, Pages.</p>\n<p>Each platform also differs in terms of the stats they provide, with Amazon, Kobo, and Apple being the best of the batch. Barnes &#38; Noble, for some reason, delays its ebook sales numbers by two days, which is perplexing since one would assume it must have real time information about the transfer of bits <em>somewhere</em>. Google requires you to download a spreadsheet in order to see your downloads, which is just bizarre from a company so dedicated to analytics.</p>\n<p>In addition to all of those stores, of course, I also made the files available <a href=\"https://dmoren.com/short-stories\">on my blog</a><sup id=\"fnref-10929-statsupdate\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-10929-statsupdate\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">3</a></sup>, though it wasn’t until a day or so after I put them up that I realized I had no way to track how many downloads were happening there.

First up, hoo boy, am I glad I have a publisher to handle all of this. It is a <em>lot</em> of work, and most thankless back-breaking detail-oriented work, at that. I’ve got a whole new appreciation for both the professionals who do that job for publishers as well as authors who self-publish their work.</p>\n<p>Secondly—and perhaps even more importantly—I’ve learned that I <em>can</em> do this. It requires moving out of my comfort zone in terms of skills, and finding some new tools, but generally I found that if I forged ahead, I could usually figure out what I was trying to accomplish, albeit with a few missteps here and there. Who knows if I’ll self-publish any of my work in the future—but at least I know I have the option, and with a little hard work and attention to details, the end result can come out looking pretty great.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Updated on 5/1/2020</strong> to add a paragraph about epubcheck validation tools.</em></p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr><ol><li id=\"fn-10929-norelation\">\nNo relation. <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fnref-10929-norelation\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/21a9.png\" alt=\"↩\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-10929-gus\">\nIn the interests of disclosure, Acorn developer Gus Mueller is a friend whom I’ve also known for years.

It’s a free Mac utility that lets you put more or less anything you want in your menu bar. I keep finding more uses for it—at this point I’ve got four separate BitBar items in my menu bar.</p>\n<p>At its simplest, BitBar is an app that runs plug-ins that display information in your menu bar. (It’s named because it was initially built to display Bitcoin prices.) There’s a whole collection of plug-ins at <a href=\"http://getbitbar.com\">getbitbar.com</a>, so if you’re not comfortable writing your own, you might find exactly what you want. It’s also easy to modify existing plugins to do what you want—all a BitBar plugin is, is a script that runs, gets data, and then returns a value that is displayed in the menu bar.</p>\n<p>Last week a friend of mine upgraded to Catalina and, in the process, lost an old Mac utility he used to display the currently playing track in iTunes/Apple Music. I suggested he look at BitBar, which has a <a href=\"https://github.com/matryer/bitbar-plugins/blob/master/Music/music.10s.sh\">plugin that does just that</a>.</p>\n<p>It turns out that while it worked, BitBar’s plugin didn’t do exactly what he wanted. Most notably, he wanted the current track to be displayed in the format <code>Song Title - Album (Year) - Artist</code>. Since this particular plugin was a shell script, I was able to open it in BBEdit and quickly <a href=\"https://pastebin.com/UfBX9H4k\">customize it</a> to meet his needs.</p>\n<p>For example, the existing music plug-in didn’t display the year, but I was able to include a little bit of inline AppleScript within the shell script that did the trick:</p>\n<pre><code>year=$(osascript -e'\nset theYear to \"0\"\ntell application \"Music\"\n    try\n        set theYear to (year of current track as string)\n    on error errText\n        \"\"\n    end try\nend tell\nif theYear = \"0\" then\n    return \"\"\nelse\n    return (\"(\" &#38; theYear &#38; \")\")\nend if\n');\n</code></pre>\n<p>I also ripped out a bunch of features that my friend didn’t really want, like play/pause/next/previous controls and a bunch of metadata in the dropdown menu. (Yes, BitBar will let you not just create custom text in the menu bar, but in the items that display when you click on the menu bar item.)</p>\n<p>Last week Dan Moren updated a plug-in that I wrote a while back that looks at the live-stream servers of our various podcast networks and displays the current number of listeners in the menu bar. (He re-wrote the thing in PHP, since that’s a language he’s comfortable with.)</p>\n<p>I’ve also got the current temperature from my weather station in my menu bar thanks to BitBar. Since I was more comfortable writing in AppleScript than in a shell script, my weather “plugin” is a single line – <code>osascript ~/weatherscript.scpt</code> – that runs a small AppleScript script that queries my weather station and returns the current temperature data, which BitBar displays.</p>\n<p>Finally, I use a tiny plugin that pings my Linode server and reports back the total ping time, which is useful in determining at a glance if I’m really having network issues or if it’s just my imagination.</p>\n<p>If you’re comfortable in literally any scripting language that can execute on your Mac, you can build BitBar plugins to display anything you can think of in your menu bar.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 19 Aug 2020 19:17:41 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/bitbar-menubar.jpeg?ssl=1","linkMd5":"93a9fa365f0a2dba6e161cc2699a120f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn3@2020_2/2020/08/24/18-19-08-801_7a0d26b02ac4f692.webp","destWidth":1360,"destHeight":48,"sourceBytes":18191,"destBytes":11836,"author":"Jason Snell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/bitbar-menubar.jpeg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn3@2020_2/2020/08/24/18-19-08-801_7a0d26b02ac4f692.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144111},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"(Podcast) The Rebound #297: Eat It, Spielberg","link":"https://sixcolors.com/?p=11850","description":"<p>This is a great time for sitting at home and watching things so let’s talk about what’s on the telly.

Marco said it was like being next door to a fun party, but you’re by yourself and nothing’s happening.</p>\n<p>Now, it’s not true that <em>nothing</em> is happening on the Mac. In fact, the last few years have shown that Apple has re-committed itself to the Mac after a few years where it seems to have taken its eye off the ball. Just this week, the MacBook Air got an update that makes it <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/03/2020-macbook-air-review/\">unequivocally the best Mac for most people</a>.</p>\n<p>But I get what Marco’s talking about. The truth is, the iPad is still a platform that’s under construction. Nineteen years ago this week, Mac OS X 10.0 was released. The first decade of OS X was a busy time, as Apple tweaked the interface, added back missing features from the classic Mac OS, and pushed forward in a bunch of new directions. But over time, the changes got smaller—and late in the decade, the iPhone appeared and changed Apple’s priorities dramatically.&#8230;</p> <p>This story is for Six Colors members only. <strong><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/subscribe/\">Become a member</a></strong> to get access to exclusive stories, podcasts, and community..</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 31 Mar 2020 15:55:56 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"1f64fc83fa4bbb004856fd291d920c5b","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jason Snell","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144579},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"Service Station: Headspace (Member Post)","link":"https://sixcolors.com/?p=12704","description":"<p>It’s kind of tough out there right now, so if you’ve been finding it challenging to get through the days and weeks with some semblance of normalcy, you’re not alone.

One tool I’ve started using that’s actually been pretty helpful in this regard is the meditation app and service <a href=\"https://www.headspace.com\">Headspace</a>.</p>\n<p>Meditation isn’t something that I ever thought I would be into, but I’ve found that doing even a tiny bit has been useful in dealing with what’s going on.

(The Breathe app, for example, shows you your heart rate after you finish your breathing session.) Honestly, I only ever set it for 1 or 2 minutes max, but even that little bit made a difference.&#8230;</p> <p>This story is for Six Colors members only. <strong><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/subscribe/\">Become a member</a></strong> to get access to exclusive stories, podcasts, and community..</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 15:34:52 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"a36f399d7d1b343dc2322d3a972600a8","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Dan Moren","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144126},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"The Pioneers of Shareware ↦","link":"http://two.wordpress.test/post/2020/05/the_pioneers_of_shareware/","description":"<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/_geraint/status/1256245407719530496\">Via Geraint Preston</a>, here’s a <a href=\"https://www.filfre.net/2020/04/the-shareware-scene-part-1-the-pioneers/\">remarkably detailed history</a> of the early days of the Freeware/Shareware movement in the 1980s written by Jimmy Maher.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Throughout his life, Fluegelman had a special relationship with San Francisco’s Golden Gate Bridge. “I think it’s a power point,” he said once only semi-facetiously. “I have more inspirations driving across the Golden Gate Bridge…” One day shortly after finishing his program, he was driving across while thinking back to the pledge drive he had seen the night before on the local PBS television station.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Andrew Fluegelman went on to work at <em>PC World</em> and, most notably in my opinion, was the founding editor of <em>Macworld</em>.  There are a few nice details in the article about Fluegelman’s enthusiasm for the original Macintosh:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  The <em>PC World</em> issue with the landmark review of PC-File was still on newsstands when Andrew Fluegelman had his next life-changing encounter with a computer: he was one of a select few invited to Apple for an early unveiling of the new Macintosh. He was so smitten by this whole new way of operating a computer that he immediately began lobbying for a companion magazine to <em>PC World</em>, to be named, naturally enough, <em>Macworld</em>. Its first issue appeared in time to greet the first Macintosh buyers early in 1984. Fluegelman held down the editor-in-chief job there even as he continued to fill the same role at <em>PC World</em>.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>He committed suicide at the Golden Gate Bridge in July of 1985 at the age of 41. Macworld honored him in its masthead for years thereafter.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.filfre.net/2020/04/the-shareware-scene-part-1-the-pioneers/\">Go to the linked site</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/link/2020/05/the-pioneers-of-shareware/\">Read on Six Colors</a>.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 01 May 2020 17:36:32 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"066c56d776deb21a22bae9f455588027","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jason Snell","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144273},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"The Hackett File: After five years, Apple has restored MacBook clarity (Member Post)","link":"https://sixcolors.com/?p=11736","description":"<figure><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/mt.sixcolors.com/images/content/2020/Apple_new-macbook-air-wallpaper-screen_03182020-6c.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"iPad with trackpad\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></figure><p>Five years is a long time, especially in consumer electronics.

Then in the 2000s, that number dropped to about one a week.

But after, most of Apple’s modern devices have offered a new option: the High-Efficiency Image Format or HEIF.<sup id=\"fnref-10893-heic\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-10893-heic\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">2</a></sup> HEIF’s advantages are clear: they take up about half the space of a commensurate quality JPEG and they support animation, like a GIF, but at better quality and smaller file sizes.<sup id=\"fnref-10893-hevc\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-10893-hevc\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">3</a></sup></p>\n<p>However, HEIF is not as widely supported as JPEG, which has been around forever and is the de facto image format. In fact, iOS often automatically converts the pictures to JPEG if you upload them to some websites, including social media platforms.</p>\n<p>But if you, as I occasionally do, AirDrop these photos to the Mac, they come across as HEIF files rather than JPEGs.<sup id=\"fnref-10893-edited\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-10893-edited\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">4</a></sup> And trying to upload them to websites or share them with people may thus lead to problems.</p>\n<p>To solve this issue, I whipped up the smallest Automator workflow ever to let me easily convert these files to JPEGs. Follow the below steps to recreate it, or, if you’d rather, just <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/convert.zip\">download the version I made</a>.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/automator-converttojpg-6c.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"Convert to JPEG workflow\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>Probably the simplest Automator workflow ever.</figcaption></figure><p>Fire up Automator and create a new Quick Action workflow. At the top, choose “image files” from the “Workflow receives current” drop-down menu, and “Finder.app” for the application. Then, in the search box above the actions section, find the “Change Type of Images” action and drag it into the main workspace. (Automator will offer you the option to add an action retaining the original HEIF images—that’s up to you, but I chose “Don’t Add” because the originals are usually still on my phone.)</p>\n<p>In the Change Type of Images dropdown, choose JPEG from the dropdown menu. Save the workflow and give the Quick Action a name like “Convert to JPEG”.</p>\n<figure class=\"pull-right\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Finder-quickaction-convert2-6c.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"Quick Action menu\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Now, in the Finder, whenever you have an HEIF file (or any image file) you can right click on it and go to Quick Actions, then choose the new “Convert to JPEG” action you made, and, voilÃ ! A JPG version of the same file will appear near instantaneously. (You can also click the Quick Action button in the preview pane, if you have that displayed.) You can then go ahead and upload that image wherever you’d like.</p>\n<p>You can, of course, avoid this by switching your iOS device’s default to shooting in traditional JPEG instead, by going to Settings &#62; Camera &#62; Formats and choosing “Most Compatible”, but be aware that it means you will be taking up more space. Apple also doesn’t offer granular options for changing formats for still photos vs. video—it’s an all or none proposition.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr><ol><li id=\"fn-10893-membership\">\nOne of the many perks of being a <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/subscribe/\">Six Colors subscriber</a>! <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fnref-10893-membership\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/21a9.png\" alt=\"↩\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-10893-heic\">\nApple has also at times referred to this format as HEIC, and confusingly, the suffix used by those files on the Mac is .heic.

In fact, Zoom is using its own definition of the term, one that lets Zoom itself access unencrypted video and audio from meetings.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>So, there’s a bit to unpack here. First, what Zoom is doing is using TLS (Transport Layer Security), the same protocol used to secure HTTPS web connections—i.e., the secure connection you make when, say, you shop at an online store and see that little padlock in your browser’s location bar.</p>\n<p>However, end-to-end encryption—which Zoom claims to offer—is a different beast. What it means is that if I’m talking to you, our conversation is encrypted from my device all the way to your device, with no server or party in between able to decrypt it. (Your and my devices have to be able to decrypt our conversation, else we could not converse.) FaceTime and iMessage<sup id=\"fnref-10858-backups\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-10858-backups\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup> are both end-to-end encrypted, meaning even Apple can’t read our conversations, as are messaging apps like Signal and WhatsApp.</p>\n<p>End-to-end encryption for multiparty video chats is hard, as cryptographer Matthew Green tells The Intercept, but it’s certainly not impossible. And, frankly, you don’t get a pass because something is hard. Zoom claiming to offer end-to-end encryption while not doing so is simply dishonest and irresponsible marketing.</p>\n<p>And in case you think I’m being too harsh, here is—in my opinion—the money quote from The Intercept’s article:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  “When we use the phrase ‘End to End’ in our other literature, it is in reference to the connection being encrypted from Zoom end point to Zoom end point,” the Zoom spokesperson wrote, apparently referring to Zoom servers as “end points” even though they sit between Zoom clients. “The content is not decrypted as it transfers across the Zoom cloud” through the networking between these machines.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>You can’t just make words mean whatever you want. “End-to-end encryption” has a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption\">specific definition</a>, and trying to massage it simply because it’s <em>inconvenient</em> is a real problem.</p>\n<p>If you apply to a grad school and say “I had a 4.0 GPA”, but upon further investigation they discover that you had only a 3.0, and your answer is “Well, I got a 4.0 GPA this one semester, and my understanding of GPA is that you just pick the best score you got,” then the response is going to be <a href=\"https://149426355.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/not-how-the-force-works.gif\">“<em>That’s not how it works.</em>“</a></p>\n<p>If a bank says they offer secure storage for your valuables, and then it turns out they transport them in an armored car but then dump them in an unlocked closet, you would understandably feel that they had not been honest with you.</p>\n<p>What Zoom is offering is, at best, “end-to-middle-to-¯_(ãƒ„)_/¯-to-middle-to-end” encryption.</p>\n<p>In and of itself, this situation is raising a lot of questions, but what’s worse is that it’s part of a clear pattern with Zoom. Just this past week, the company’s iOS app was discovered to be sending information to Facebook without disclosing that in its privacy policy.<sup id=\"fnref-10858-gruber\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-10858-gruber\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">2</a></sup> Others have pointed out that Its macOS installer also seems <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realmrpippy/status/1244741950562918400\">to have some shady behavior</a>. And, of course, last year the company was found to be <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2019/07/zoom/\">installing a secret local web server to bypass an Apple security restriction</a>.</p>\n<p>The old Ian Fleming adage is “Once is happenstance. Twice is coincidence. The third time it’s enemy action.” I’m not saying that Zoom is deliberately acting maliciously here; rather, all of this points to a corner-cutting culture that evokes a quote from a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Malcolm_(character)\">different Ian</a>: Zoom is so preoccupied with whatever or not it <em>can</em> do something, that it doesn’t stop to think if it <em>should</em>.</p>\n<p>And that’s dangerous, especially as our current world predicament means Zoom’s popularity has skyrocketed. It’s become the de facto communication method for companies, educational institutions, and even just average folks who want to chat with their family and friends,<sup id=\"fnref-10858-podcasters\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-10858-podcasters\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">3</a></sup> none of whom may be fully aware what the implications of them joining a simple video call may be.</p>\n<p>Look, I’m a Zoom user, and it’s proved to be <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/03/how-to-stream-games-with-your-friends-and-other-things-too/\">a useful tool</a> and a solid product. But that doesn’t excuse the way the company has repeatedly behaved. The good news is that with all this increased usage comes increased scrutiny, which will hopefully encourage Zoom to mend its ways. But doing so is either going to require investment to make Zoom live up to its marketing, or the company to dial back on its claims and admit that it’s not delivering on what it promises. Unfortunately, spending money and issuing apologies are two things companies hate to do.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr><ol><li id=\"fn-10858-backups\">\nThe loophole for iMessage comes not in the conversation itself, but in backing up your device—which contains a copy of your conversations—to Apple’s servers. <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fnref-10858-backups\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/21a9.png\" alt=\"↩\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-10858-gruber\">\nJohn Gruber has <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2020/03/regarding_zoom\">a great write-up of the implications of that over at Daring Fireball</a>. <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fnref-10858-gruber\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/21a9.png\" alt=\"↩\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-10858-podcasters\">\nNot to mention podcasters! <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fnref-10858-podcasters\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/21a9.png\" alt=\"↩\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></a>\n</li>\n</ol></div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 31 Mar 2020 14:18:46 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/21a9.png","linkMd5":"38f719d3ec594bc28f3c4c1663ed287c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn51@2020_2/2020/08/24/18-19-11-215_25686225908fe44d.webp","destWidth":72,"destHeight":72,"sourceBytes":462,"destBytes":1318,"author":"Dan Moren","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/21a9.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn51@2020_2/2020/08/24/18-19-11-215_25686225908fe44d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144580},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"Zoom buys Keybase to shore up security ↦","link":"http://two.wordpress.test/post/2020/05/zoom_buys_keybase_to_shore_up_security/","description":"<p>Zoom CEO Eric Yuan, <a href=\"https://blog.zoom.us/wordpress/2020/05/07/zoom-acquires-keybase-and-announces-goal-of-developing-the-most-broadly-used-enterprise-end-to-end-encryption-offering/\">writing on the company’s blog</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Zoom will offer an end-to-end encrypted meeting mode to all paid accounts.

This is a complete transcript of that call.</p>\n<h2>Tim Cook’s opening statement</h2>\n<p>Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I hope you’re staying safe and well. Today, Apple reports 58.3 billion dollars in revenue, an all-time record for Services and a quarterly record for Wearables, Home and Accessories. It was also a quarterly revenue record for Apple retail, powered by phenomenal growth in our online store. Amid the most challenging global environment in which we’ve ever operated our business, we’re proud to say that Apple grew during the quarter.</p>\n<p>But before we got more deeply into the numbers, I want to speak just for a bit on COVID-19. This is something Apple has been contending with since January. And I think that how we have responded, what we have been inspired to do, tells an important story about Apple’s great durability as a business and the enduring importance of our products and our customers’ lives. It also speaks to Apple’s unmatched capacity to be creative, to think always in terms of the long term, and to forge ahead when others may feel an instinct to pull back.</p>\n<p>Before COVID-19, was on the horizon, we anticipated that Q2 was going to be a prolific and energetic period for Apple. And when the pandemic did strike, our teams not only succeeded in growing the business, in introducing powerful new products, and in meeting our customers’ needs, but they also rose to the occasion in terms of meeting our broader obligations to the communities in which we live and work.</p>\n<p>Let’s look quickly across the business. At the same time that they were leaving no stone unturned to get our latest generation of devices manufactured and into our customers’ hands, our worldwide network of supply chain partners, logistics and operations folks and every part of the company we’re also sourcing more than 30 million masks for frontline medical workers, ensuring they are donated to places of greatest need in every region around the world.</p>\n<p>While our product teams were preparing to launch a new iPad Pro, Magic Keyboard, MacBook Air, and the new iPhone SE—all of which have been very well received by reviewers and consumers alike—they were also working with our suppliers to design, test, manufacture and distribute more than 7.5 billion face shields. And we continue to ship more than one million of these every week to the doctors, nurses and medical personnel on the front lines.</p>\n<p>In a quarter where our Services teams achieved strong growth—which Luca will dig into in a minute, and which speaks to the real durability of our services strategy—these teams were also putting COVID-19 front and center. As Apple News reached 125 million monthly active users, we elevated trusted information from reliable sources through a special COVID-19 vertical. We let customers skip payments without incurring interest on Apple Card for March and April in light of financial hardship for many families. We worked with everyone from Oprah to Lady Gaga to inform, entertain and give back through Apple TV. And services like FaceTime and Messages set new all-time records for daily volume during this quarter, as users relied on their devices to stay connected in a new reality.</p>\n<p>In software, at the same time that our teams worked with great creativity and excitement as we prepare to deliver our first-ever all online Worldwide Developers Conference later this quarter, they also worked with the same creativity and speed to put together our COVID-19 symptom checking Web site and app, in partnership with the CDC. As of today, the app has been installed nearly two million times and the web tool has received over 3 million unique visits. And just this month, to accelerate contact tracing, we are launching a joint effort with Google to enable the use of Bluetooth technology to help governments and health agencies reduce the spread of the virus, with user privacy and security central to the design.</p>\n<p>We’ve paired these programmatic efforts with a broader strategy to give back where it’s needed most. We’ve made major corporate donations to response efforts around the world to support Global Citizen, as well as a new fund for Americans experiencing food insecurity as a result of the crisis. When you tally these things up and consider our ongoing 2-to-1 match for employee donations, Apple’s contributions to the global response are significant, diverse, and a great source of pride for the whole team.</p>\n<p>We’re also doing what we can to help our employees, their families and by extension, their communities, stay safe and well by modifying our operations where appropriate. This extends, of course, to our retail employees. They are Apple’s face to our customers and an instrumental part of our business, and we’re compensating them normally despite store closures. During a quarter where circumstances evolve by the hour, we have been gratified by the resilience and adaptability of our global supply chain. While we felt some temporary supply constraints in February, our operations team, suppliers, and manufacturing partners have been safely returning to work and production was back at typical levels toward the end of March.</p>\n<p>At this time of social distance, of shuttered schools and gathering places, of delayed plans and new ways of socializing, we have seen significant evidence that our products have taken a renewed importance for our customers. Teachers and students around the world are relying on our technology to teach, learn and stay connected with each other. We are in the process of deploying major orders of iPads to school systems working to keep learning going strong at a distance, including tens of thousands in Ontario, Canada; Glasgow, Scotland; and Puerto Rico; 100,000 to the city of Los Angeles; And 350,000 to New York City, our largest educational iPad deployment ever.</p>\n<p>Since early March, we’ve seen unprecedented demand for our pro apps from students enthusiast and creative professionals. These folks are keeping us all entertained and inspired as we stay at home, and to help them do it, we made Final Cut Pro X and Logic Pro X available for free for 90 days for everyone. And the reaction has been overwhelming, driving software downloads and usage to record levels.</p>\n<p>And doctors and medical professionals are making even greater use of Apple Watch and other health features to communicate with patients and to treat them safely from a distance when necessary. With new FDA guidance on noninvasive remote patient monitoring, for example, the ECG app on Apple Watch is increasingly being used to facilitate remote ECG measurements and recordings for telemedicine usage, reducing patient and health care provider contact and exposure. Many hospitals, such as Geisinger Health System, NYU Langone Health, and Stanford Health Care are using apps on iPad and iPhone to support communication and video conferences between hospitalized patients and their care teams. This enables the care teams to keep a close watch on patients without entering isolation rooms, which helps to minimize exposure and reduces some of the need for personal protective equipment.</p>\n<p>Now, when you step back and tally all this up, when you consider all the ways COVID-19 has touched Apple, our customers and the way we work, this may not have been the quarter it could have been absent this pandemic, but I don’t think I can recall a quarter where I’d been prouder of what we do or how we do it.</p>\n<p>As I said at the outset, we achieve revenue of 58.3 billion and underneath that was product revenue of 45 billion. The performance of our product business had three very different phases during the March quarter. Based on Apple’s performance during the first five weeks of the quarter, we were confident we were headed toward a record second quarter at the very high end of our expectations. In the next five weeks of the quarter, as COVID-19 started impacting China, iPhone supply was temporarily effected, as well as demand for our products within China. This caused us to withdraw our revenue guidance in February. At that point, demand for our products outside of China was still strong, and in line with our expectations. During the last three weeks of the quarter, as the virus spread globally and social distancing measures were put in place worldwide, including the closure of all our retail stores outside of Greater China on March 13th and many channel partner points of sales around the world, we saw downward pressure on demand, particularly for iPhone and wearables.</p>\n<p>Given the lack of visibility and certainty in the near-term, we will not be issuing guidance for the coming quarter. Over the long term, though, we have a high degree of confidence in the enduring strength of our business. Our global supply chain is profoundly durable and resilient. We have shown the consistent ability to meet and manage temporary supply challenges like those caused by COVID-19. We have continued to deliver innovative new products across multiple categories that appeal to a broad cross-section of customers, including the all new iPhone SE, which achieved unmatched technological capacity at an incredible value. Our teams worldwide have tackled the complexities of this moment with unmatched creativity, good humor and dedication to our customers. For a company whose business is innovation, there are real upsides in periodically having to figure out how to do just about everything in a brand new way.</p>\n<p>Our long-running investment in our Services strategy is succeeding. This business is growing and is a reflection of our enduring, large, and growing installed base. We expect to meet our long standing goal of doubling our fiscal 2016 services revenue in 2020. We have always run Apple for the long term. We entered this period with unmatched financial strength, a robust cash position and our best product pipeline ever. Major investments, including our five-year commitment to contribute $350 billion to the economy here in the United States, are moving forward full speed ahead. It’s in these moments that we set ourselves apart. We’ve always managed through difficult moments by doubling down and investing in the next generation of innovation. And that’s our strategy today.</p>\n<p>And so while we can’t say for sure how many chapters are in this book, we can have confidence that the ending will be a good one. Apple will continue to do everything we can do to help the global response and to keep our customers learning, creating, sharing and connecting so that life can remain as normal as it can during this challenging time.</p>\n<p>With that, I’ll hand things off to Luca.</p>\n<h2>Luca Maestri’s opening statement</h2>\n<p>Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. It has been a very different quarter than we were expecting when we last talked to you at the end of January, but we could not be more proud of our Apple teams around the world, our role in supporting local communities and our partners throughout the value chain, and how resilient our business and financial performance has been during these challenging times.</p>\n<p>The revenue for the quarter was 58.3 billion, up one percent from a year ago, despite the extreme circumstances from the impact of COVID-19 and a headwind of 100 basis points from foreign exchange. Products revenue was 45 billion, down three percent. After a very strong January, our performance was impacted, particularly during the last three weeks of the quarter, when lockdowns and point-of-sale closures increased due to COVID-19 spreading around the world and affected our product sales. However, on a demand basis, our performance was stronger than our reported results, as we reduced iPhone channel inventory more than we did a year ago. Importantly, our installed base of active devices reached an all-time-high in all of our geographic segments and all major product categories.</p>\n<p>Services revenue followed a different trend, with very strong year-over-year growth of 17 percent. We set a new all-time revenue record of 13.3 billion, with all-time records in many of our Services categories and in most countries we track. I’ll provide more details on this later.</p>\n<p>Company gross margin was 38.4 percent, flat sequentially, with cost savings and mix shift towards Services offset by the seasonal loss of leverage. Products gross margin was 30.3 percent, decreasing 380 basis points sequentially due to loss of leverage and unfavorable mix. This drop was more pronounced than under normal circumstances due to the COVID-19 impact I mentioned earlier. Services gross margin was 65.4 percent, up 100 basis points sequentially driven by favorable mix. Our reported tax rate for the quarter was 14.4 percent. This was lower than our 16.5 percent guidance, due to one-time discrete items. Net income was eleven point two billion, and earnings per share were $2.55, up 4 percent. Operating cash flow was very strong at 13.3 billion, an improvement of 2.2 billion over a year ago.</p>\n<p>Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue of 29 billion declined 7 percent year over year as both iPhone supply and demand were affected by the impact of COVID-19 at some point during the quarter. On the supply side, we suffered from some temporary supply shortages during February, but we’ve been extremely pleased with the resilience and adaptability of our global supply chain, as well as its ability to get people back to work safely when circumstances allow. Our operations team and manufacturing partners put forth an extraordinary effort to restore production quickly, and we exited the quarter in a good supply position for most of our product lines. On the demand side, after a very strong first five weeks, we saw the impact of COVID-19 effect demand in China for the next five weeks and then more broadly around the world for the last three weeks of the quarter, while lockdowns and point of sale closures became more widespread in many countries.</p>\n<p>While we did see a slight elongation in our replacement cycle towards the end of the quarter, which we attribute to the widespread point of sale closures, our active installed base of iPhones has reached an all time high. This speaks to the quality of our products and strength of our ecosystem. In fact, in the U.S., the latest survey of consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 99 percent. For iPhone 11, 11 Pro, and 11 Pro Max combined.</p>\n<p>Turning to services, we set an all-time revenue record of 13.3 billion. We had strong performance across the board, with all-time revenue records in the App Store, Apple Music, Video, Cloud Services and our App Store search ad business. And we also set a March quarter record for AppleCare. Our new services, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, and Apple Card continue to add users, content, and features while contributing to overall services growth. As Tim mentioned, we are well on our way to accomplishing our goal of doubling our fiscal 16 services revenue during 2020.</p>\n<p>App Store revenue grew by strong double digits, thanks to robust customer demand for both in-app purchases and subscriptions. Our third-party subscription business grew across multiple categories, and increase over 30 percent year over year, reaching a new all-time high. Our first-party subscription services also continue to perform very well. Apple Music and cloud services both set all-time revenue records, and AppleCare set a March quarter record. Paid subscriptions for all three of these services were up strong double digits. Customer engagement in our ecosystem continues to grow strongly, and a number of both transacting and paid accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all-time high during the March quarter. In particular, the number of paid accounts increased double digits in all of our geographic segments. We now have over 515 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, up 125 million from a year ago. On a sequential basis, paid subscriptions grew by over 35 million. This is the highest sequential growth we have ever experienced. With this momentum, we are confident we will reach our increased target of 600 million paid subscriptions before the end of calendar 2020.</p>\n<p>Wearables, Home and Accessories established a new March quarter record with revenue of 6.3 billion, up 23 percent year over year, with strong double-digit performance across all five geographic segments. Our Wearables business is now the size of a Fortune 140 company and we’re very excited by the many opportunities in front of us for this product category. For example, Apple Watch continues to extend its reach, as over 75 percent of the customers  purchasing Apple Watch around the world during the quarter were new to the product.</p>\n<p>Next, I’d like to talk about Mac and iPad. My revenue was 5.4 billion. iPad revenue was 4.4 billion. Towards the end of the quarter, we launched a brand new iPad Pro that includes a first-in-class LiDAR scanner with some really exciting augmented reality applications, and MacBook Air with significantly improved performance at a lower price. We’re very pleased with a strong customer interest for both products. Importantly, around half of the customers purchasing Macs and iPads around the world during the quarter were new to that product, and the active installed base for both Mac and iPad reached a new all-time high. And the most recent surveys of consumers from 451 Research measured customer satisfaction at 95 percent for iPad and 96 percent for Mac.</p>\n<p>In the enterprise market, businesses everywhere have been making the transition to working remotely. We’ve created content to assist our customers in this transition, including an on-demand video learning series focused on topics like remote deployments of iPads and Macs and security. We’ve also realigned our own retail business and enterprise teams to provide timely and relevant support to customers as they navigate new work environments. Some of our largest customers offering Mac to employees such as IBM and SAP have been able to pivot quickly to allow employees to easily set up and secure their devices from home, benefiting from Apple Business Manager and zero-touch deployment.</p>\n<p>And we’ve seen countless examples of new projects and remote deployments implemented in just a few hours. Pelaton, for instance, worked with our New York teams to deploy an entire fleet of Macs overnight so their team could work remotely. In essential sectors such as grocery and financial services, we’ve seen organizations adopt our technology to better serve their customers safely. Leading grocers around the world like Trader Joe’s, Woolworths, Lawsons, Sainsbury’s, Lidl and Carrefour offer Apple Pay so customers can use contactless payments. And as store shift to become fulfillment centers for online orders, organizations are leveraging apps for remote shoppers and food delivery to reduce foot traffic. In banking, where safety and security is a top priority, one way to protect company and client information is by providing corporate iOS devices to employees who use mobile phones daily as part of their jobs. As an example, Bank of America is purchasing tens of thousands of additional iOS devices for their workforce.</p>\n<p>Let me now turn to our cash position. First, I want to note that liquidity has not been an issue for us during these highly unusual financial market conditions. We have an extraordinarily strong balance sheet, very deep access to capital markets, and unmatched free cash flow generation. We ended the quarter with 193 billion in cash, plus marketable securities, total debt of 110 billion, and as a result, net cash was $83 billion at the end of the quarter. We returned $22 billion to shareholders during the March quarter, including $18.5 billion through open market repurchases of 64.7 million Apple shares and $3.4 billion in dividends and equivalents.</p>\n<p>Finally, as we move ahead into the June quarter, I’d like to provide some color on what we are seeing, which includes the types of forward-looking information referred to at the beginning of the call. As Tim mentioned, given the lack of visibility and certainty in the near term, we will not be issuing guidance for the coming quarter. However, based on what we have seen in April and how we think things might play out, I would like to provide some additional insight on headwinds and tailwinds we’re facing.</p>\n<p>From a foreign exchange standpoint, the U.S. dollar has appreciated recently against most currencies around the world, and as a result we expect our revenue to be negatively impacted by more than 1.5 billion dollars on a year-over-year basis. Our global supply chain is back up and running. We are in a typical supply position, including our usual ramp associated with new products recently launched. These newly launched products, iPad Pro, MacBook Air, and iPhone SE, have all received outstanding customer response, even during these extreme circumstances.</p>\n<p>On iPhone and wearables, we expect a year over year revenue performance to worsen in the June quarter relative to the March quarter. On iPod and Mac, we expect the year over year revenue performance to improve in the June quarter. On services, we are seeing two distinct trends. First, customers are actively engaging with our ecosystem and digital services and we believe the very strong recent performance in the App Store, video, music and cloud services will continue throughout the June quarter. Second, due to the overall reduced level of economic activity due to the lockdowns around the world, services like AppleCare and advertising have been impacted. AppleCare is comprised of our product repair business and the warranty agreements with our customers, both of which have been obviously affected by store closures and reduced level of customer traffic. Advertising, which is comprised of third party agreements, our App Store search ads, and Apple News ads, has been impacted by overall economic weakness and uncertainty on when businesses will reopen.</p>\n<p>For gross margin, sequential headwinds include foreign exchange, the mix within products, and the seasonal loss of leverage on our product business. Foreign exchange will have a 70 basis points impact sequentially and 130 basis points impact year over year. Regarding product mix, keep in mind the commentary we provided at the revenue level. Sequential tailwinds include cost savings and a mix shift towards Services. With regard to capital allocation, our approach remains unchanged. We continue to invest confidently in our future, while also returning value to our shareholders. We are in the midst of developing our most exciting pipeline of products and services ever, while contributing over 350 billion dollars to the U.S. economy and expanding our footprint in many cities around the country over a five year period. We also continue to believe that there is great value in our stock and we are maintaining our target of reaching a net cash neutral position over time. As a testament to the confidence we have in our business today and into the future, our board has authorized 50 billion dollars for share repurchases in addition to the over 40-billion authorization remaining under the current share repurchase plan. Our board has also authorized a six percent increase in our quarterly dividend and today declared a cash dividend of 82 cents per share of common stock payable on May 14, 2020 to shareholders of record as of May 11th, 2020.</p>\n<p>Finally, and most importantly, we are managing Apple for the long term. As we’ve always done during uncertain times, historically we have continued to invest in the business, and this remains our philosophy. We will continue to stay focused on what we do best, investing in our product and service pipeline, managing the business wisely and taking care of our teams, and believe we will come out from this stronger. With that, let’s open the call to questions.</p>\n<h2>Analyst Q&#38;A</h2>\n<p><strong>Shannon Cross, Cross Research</strong>: Tim, you talked about seeing some improvement in the second half of April. So I was wondering if you could just talk maybe a bit more on a segmented geographic basis, what you’re seeing and in the various regions that you’re selling in and what you’re hearing from your customers.</p>\n<p><strong>Tim Cook</strong>: Sure, Shannon. I’ll start with China. If you look at what happened in China, we were having a really good January. The lockdown started there toward the end of January, as you know. February, we saw a steep decline in demand. We closed our stores in February. As the lockdown completed in mid-February, toward the second half of February, we began to open stores. We we opened them on a staggered basis that took about 30 days until mid March. And from a demand point of view, we saw an improvement in March over February. And if you look at kind of where we are today, we’ve seen further improvement in April as compared to March. And so that’s China.</p>\n<p>You look at the rest of the world, we were doing great in January, the first five weeks of the quarter, and we do believe that we were headed toward sort of the top end of our expectations that we had talked to you about on the last call. The next five weeks were spent reacting and getting the supply chain back up in full force, and working through the sharp decline in China that already talked about. The real thing for the rest of the world happened in March, when the shelter in place orders went in and the work from home began. For those two, three weeks period at the end of the quarter, we saw a sharp decline in demand. If you now step out until April and look at that, early April started like the end of March. But in the second half of April, we’ve seen an uptick really across the board. It’s not it’s not just related to a certain geo or a certain product. We think by looking at it, a part of it is due to just our new products, a part of it is due to the stimulus programs taking effect in April, and then a part of it is probably the consumer behavior of knowing this is going to go on for a little while longer and getting some devices and so forth lined up to work at home more. In particular, for as I think Luca shared, we believe that iPad and Mac are going to improve on a year over year basis during this quarter. And that’s customers that are either taking online education or working remotely. And so complex answer to your question, but that’s what we’re seeing.</p>\n<p><strong>Shannon Cross, Cross Research</strong>: Thank you. That was that was helpful. Luca, unless I missed it, you talked about various puts and takes in the quarter but didn’t really discuss operating expenses. I know you mentioned some cost savings on the COGS line. I’m curious how you’re thinking about your spending and OpEx, given some of the macro challenges that you may be facing. Thank you.</p>\n<p><strong>Luca Maestri</strong>: As we said, we manage the company for the long term, right. So we know that the core of the business, the core of the company is innovation and product and services development. So we will continue to invest in our pipeline. We’re very excited about what we have in store, and so we will continue to invest there. Obviously, we are aware of the environment and so we will manage the SG&#38;A portion of the company tightly. We are making new investments in the new services that we launched recently. As you know, we purchased the baseband activities from Intel, and obviously we want to develop that technology because we consider it a core technology for us. And so we will try to balance the need to continue to invest during difficult circumstances. And the fact that we like to manage the business wisely.</p>\n<p><strong>Wamsi Mohan, Bank of America</strong>: Tim, I think I speak for everyone on the call that we’re all very appreciative of Apple’s contribution during this pandemic. We all appreciate it.</p>\n<p><strong>Tim Cook</strong>: Thank you very much for that.</p>\n<p><strong>Wamsi Mohan, Bank of America</strong>: No, it’s been great. Tim, in past downturns, we have not really seen Apple pull back from investing. And you as a company have largely maintained the product introduction cadence. But given these are unprecedented times, and there are a lot of challenges associated with product development during a time when you have a global footprint for such activities and aren’t able to really do all things in person, how should we think about the product development and introduction cadence as we go over the next several quarters?</p>\n<p><strong>Tim Cook</strong>: Well, we’re continuing to operate. And so, as you can tell, along with everything else going on, we were able to launch and and ship the iPhone SE, the iPad Pro with the Magic Keyboard, and the MacBook Air. And so business continues and new products are our lifeblood. And so we we’re continuing to work, everybody is getting used to the work at home. In some areas of the company, people may be even more productive, in some other areas they’re not as productive, and so it’s it’s mixed, depending upon what the roles are. But as you can tell, from what we did this quarter, despite the environment, we have our head down and are working because we know that our customers want the products that we’ve got. They’re even more important in these times.</p>\n<p><strong>Wamsi Mohan, Bank of America</strong>: As a follow up, I know you’re doing a lot with both the Apple Card and financing plan for iPhones to get your products in the hands of customers. But I was wondering, would you consider using the strength of your balance sheet maybe a little differently structured, maybe deferred payments or things like that. Or do you think that there could be other steps like bundling that you will consider versus what you already currently do?</p>\n<p><strong>Tim Cook</strong>: Well, as you know, we launched the payment plan earlier on Apple Card for iPhone. We’re working on doing that for other products as well. And you’ll see something on that shortly. So we’re very focused on the affordability point. The trade-in programs also are fairly wide across the board and and act as both something great for the environment, also something great from a way to get that entry price down. In terms of deferred payments, nothing to nothing to announce today, but as you know, having access to the card, at least in the United States, gives us more degrees of freedom. That is not using our balance sheet, but we play a key role in deciding what kind of programs go with the card.</p>\n<p><strong>Katy Huberty, Morgan Stanley</strong>: Tim, I want to start on a longer term question. Where do you see structural changes on the back of this health crisis that might present opportunities for new revenue streams at Apple? And I’m particularly thinking about your past comments on health and augmented reality, but I’m sure there’s even more areas of inspiration and creativity coming out of the company.</p>\n<p><strong>Tim Cook</strong>: I think there are things from, just a great reminder of how important our products are for remote work, and it’s pretty clear to me that where things will get a lot closer to to normal than they are today, obviously, I think many people are finding that they can learn remotely. And so I suspect that trend will accelerate some. I think that’s probably also true about working remotely in some areas and in some jobs. And so I think we have significant solutions and products for all of those groups. On the health area, I gave some examples in my opening comments about the ECG being used on the Watch. You can bet that we’re looking at other areas in this. We were already doing that because we view that that area was a huge opportunity for the company and a way for us to help a lot of people. And so you will see us continue on that. I wouldn’t say that the health door opened wider, I would say it was already opened fairly wide.</p>\n<p><strong>Katy Huberty, Morgan Stanley</strong>: And then as a follow up, the 50 billion share repurchase authorization is impressive in absolute terms, but it is a bit lower than the last couple of years. So just any, you know, any context around the thought process of landing on 50 billion. And then related to that, you have one of the strongest balance sheets in the world, does the current environment change your thinking at all around M&#38;A opportunities?</p>\n<p><strong>Luca Maestri</strong>: Well, let me let me answer that. Katy. First of all, on the on the buyback, as I said, in general, our approach to capital allocation has remained the same for the last several years and it’s not changing now. Keep in mind here we’re talking about just the authorization, right. And when you look at our actual results at the end of every quarter, you see how much we actually do in terms of share repurchases. The $50 billion is in addition to over $40 billion that is still remaining from the past authorization that we’ve received from our board. So the total available or outstanding in terms of authorization is over 90. And as you look at our run rate during the last several years, you know that is a very adequate amount. And as you know, we will provide an additional update a year from now. So, nothing really has changed there. And nothing has changed on our approach for M&#38;A. We’ve been quite active over the last several years. We purchase companies on a very regular basis. We’re always looking for ways to accelerate our product roadmaps or fill gaps in our portfolio, both on the hardware side, on the softer side, on the service aside. So we will continue to do that. And so also on the M&#38;A front, nothing has changed.</p>\n<p><strong>Amit Daryanani, Evercore</strong>: On the channel inventory, I was hoping if you could talk about how the channel inventory looked like in the March quarter, because it sounds like it may be below the historical ranges. And then the discussion you had for June quarter performance of iPhones, what are you embedding from a channel-building back inventory levels are not in that expectation.</p>\n<p><strong>Tim Cook</strong>: Amit, it’s Tim. If you look at the iPhone channel inventory during Q2, the reduction of it was more than the reduction from the previous year. It’s not unusual that we reduce in Q2. In fact, if you look back, generally speaking in the first half of the calendar year, we reduce channel inventories. During the second half of the calendar year, we generally raise channel inventories. That’s a seasonal thing. And sitting here today, I believe that will happen this year as well. So hopefully that answers your question. And by the way, we ended in a comfortable position. So you could conclude from that that we were with within a target range.</p>\n<p><strong>Amit Daryanani, Evercore</strong>: That’s really helpful. Tim, I was hoping you could maybe talk a little bit about, how do you think about Apple’s manufacturing strategy and perhaps a need for some diversity, especially given everything the company and everyone’s gone through over the last 12 months. How do you think about that? And do you feel comfortable that the supply chain and the manufacturing base is well situated today to launch the traditional phone products that they’re used to getting from Apple?</p>\n<p><strong>Tim Cook</strong>: As you know, our supply chain is global. And so our products are truly made everywhere. And I would focus on that, versus focus on one element of the manufacturing process, which tends to get more visibility, which is the final assembly. We have some final assembly in the United States. We have final assembly in China as well. I think you’d have to conclude, or at least I conclude, that if you look at the shock to the supply chain that took place this quarter, for it to come back up so quickly really demonstrates that it’s durable and resilient. And so I feel good about where we are. That said, we’re always looking at tweaks and it’s just not something we talk about because we view it as confidential and competitive information. And so as we get out of this totally, we will look to see what we learned and what we should change.</p>\n<p><strong>Jeriel Ong, Deutsche Bank</strong>: So I want to focus the question on services. The segment was solid in the quarter despite overall macro weakness. I can kind of see the logic behind it being strong despite product weakness overall. As you kind of look at the rest of the year, do you think that sustains or at some point do macro impacts worldwide impact the services line?</p>\n<p><strong>Luca Maestri</strong>: Let me take this one. We typically don’t give a lot of specifics about the about our categories, but I’ve said, as we look into the June quarter, we see two distinct trends in our services business overall. Our ecosystem is very strong. Our customers are very engaged. We are continuing to grow double digits the number of transacting accounts and paid accounts. And so we expect our digital services to continue at the same level of performance that we have seen during the March quarter. And that includes the App Store, of course, our video business, our music business, cloud services. So we expect all these businesses to continue to grow very strongly. Given the overall economic environment and level of demand right now, there are two businesses that we believe are going to be impacted during the June quarter. One of them is AppleCare. AppleCare is essentially comprised of our product repair business and the warranty agreements that we signed with our customers when they purchase our devices. Both these businesses have been affected, obviously, by the store closures and not only our retail stores, but also our partners’ points of sale. And obviously the reduced level of customer traffic because of the social distancing measures. And we do expect AppleCare to be affected during the during the June quarter. The other business, which we think is going to be impacted by the overall economic weakness and the uncertainty on when businesses will reopen is advertising, which is the sum of our advertising business on the App Store, on Apple News, and the third-party agreements that we have on the advertising front. So these are two things that during the June quarter will create a headwind for for the services business.</p>\n<p><strong>Jeriel Ong, Deutsche Bank</strong>: Got it. Appreciate that. My second question is about the overall purchasing decisions consumers are making. So far through April, have you seen an increase, perhaps downticks across your product line? So, for example, somebody might have, you know, a shift maybe to the lower end of the storage mix of certain products. And do you expect that going forward, as you know, unemployments uptick and macro impacts kind of layer on through the rest of 2020?</p>\n<p><strong>Tim Cook</strong>: I haven’t seen what you’re what you’re asking, no. I have seen a strong customer response to iPhone SE, which is our most affordable iPhone, but it appears that those customers are primarily coming from wanting a smaller form factor with the latest technology, or coming over from Android. And so those are the two principle kind of segments versus somebody buying down, as you’re talking about it. We’ve also seen, we launched the iPad Pro in the midst of all of this, and the reception there has also been incredibly good. And that’s obviously our top of the line iPad. And so I’m not seeing what you’re what you’re alluding to, at least at this point.</p>\n<p><strong>Samik Chatterjee, JP Morgan</strong>: If I can just start with a question on kind of what you’re seeing in China. You mentioned the pick up in activity, but is that driven by more kind of footfall in the stores or what are you seeing relative to online activity and how much of this recovery is being driven online? Any thoughts on that?</p>\n<p><strong>Tim Cook</strong>: Yeah, what we saw in China for the full quarter, and I’ll speak about mainland China, because I think that’s the source of your question. We saw strong results in iPad and in Wearables. And in Services. And if you look up underneath the full quarter, we saw a strong January and then a significantly reduced demand in February as the shelter-in-place orders and the lockdowns went into effect in China, and the stores closed. And then in March, as stores reopened, the recovery began, and then we’ve seen further recovery in April. Where that goes, we will see, but that’s that’s kind of what we’ve seen so far there. To your question about store traffic. Store traffic is obviously up from where it was in February, but it is not back to where it was pre the lockdown. There has been, however, more move to online. And as I had mentioned earlier in my remarks, it’s pretty phenomenal, actually. Retail had a quarterly record for us during the quarter, and that’s despite stores being closed for the for the three-week period around the world ex China, and then China was closed prior to that three weeks. And that’s partly because the online store had such a phenomenal quarter, and that included in China, but it was also other regions as well. So there is definitely a move, and whether that’s a permanent shift, I would hesitate to go that far, because I think people like to be out and about. They just know that now is not the time to to do that.</p>\n<p><strong>Samik Chatterjee, JP Morgan</strong>: And if I can just follow up on your previous comment about the strong demand you’re seeing for iPhone SE, just given the price point, I’m wondering if you’re expecting any change in terms of the geographic mix of where the demand comes from relative to typically what you see for other iPhones in the line up, just given before price point?</p>\n<p><strong>Tim Cook</strong>: I think it plays in every geo, but I would expect to see it doing it even better in areas where the median incomes are less. And so we’ll see how that plays out in. And I expect some fair number of people switching over to iOS. It’s an unbelievable offer. It’s, if you will, the engine of our top phones in a very affordable package. And it’s faster than the fastest Android phones. And so it’s an exceptional value.</p>\n<p><strong>Chris Caso, Raymond James</strong>: I wanted to follow up with the other question on iPhone SE and the decision to bring it back and where it sits within the total iPhone strategy. And I guess, coupled with the fact that iPhone 11, you made the decision to bring that out at a lower price point. What does that tell us with respect to your approach to iPhone pricing and flexibility? Is this helping to add users and kind of bring people into the ecosystem? And if so, what does that imply for gross margins?</p>\n<p><strong>Tim Cook</strong>: Chris, we’ve always been about delivering the the best product at a good price, and that fundamental strategy has not changed at all. As you know, we did have an SE for a while. It’s great to to bring it back. It was a beloved product. And so I wouldn’t read anything into that other than we want to give people the best deal that we can while making the best product.</p>\n<p><strong>Chris Caso, Raymond James</strong>: OK. As a follow up, on commodity pricing. I think you have expected to see some commodity price declines through the March quarter.

(The company will reveal the specifics of its holiday quarter on January 28.) <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2016/04/a-reassuring-line-about-apples-approach-to-services/\">Four years ago</a>, aware that the days of rapid iPhone growth were over, Apple began to talk up its Services category. Three years ago, the company <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/31/tim-cook-on-apple-earnings-call-double-services-revenue-by-2020.html\">set itself a goal</a> — doubling its service revenue by 2020.</p>\n<p>The rise of the Apple Watch and AirPods as successful products has led to Apple drawing attention to another category that didn’t previously get a lot of love. It was once the junk drawer of Apple financial categories, sporting the catchy label “Other Products,” until the company re-named it “Wearables, Home, and Accessories.” There are a lot of products in that category, but it’s clear that most of the growth is being driven by watches and wireless earbuds at this point.</p>\n<p>Here’s a chart to put the growth in these two categories in perspective:</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/chart-annual-wearables-services-6c.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"Chart of services and wearable revenue\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><br></figure><p>In 2016 Apple generated $26 billion in services revenue, and in 2019 that grew to $46 billion. That means it only needs to show modest growth in 2020 to hit that target of doubling revenue—it shouldn’t be a problem, especially if you consider the track record of growth in Services, as shown in this chart:</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/chart-yoy-services-6c.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Going back to fiscal 2015 you can’t find a single quarter in which Services didn’t grow by a double-digit percentage over the year-ago quarter. Services growth has been constant for half a decade. What’s even more notable for Apple is that this isn’t seasonal revenue. That makes sense, because services are generally not one-time purchases—they’re subscriptions that are ongoing, which means that money tends to get spread over the year rather than appearing in a single quarter.</p>\n<p>That’s in contrast to a lot of Apple’s individual product sales, which are much more seasonal. It’s likely that Apple’s results announcement on January 28 will reveal Apple’s biggest sales quarter in its history—because a whole lot of people buy Apple products during the holiday season.</p>\n<p>The Other/Wearables category hasn’t shown steady growth for as long as Services, probably because of choppy waters in the first couple of years of Apple Watch sales. (The Apple Watch went on sale in the spring of 2015 and the category got a huge injection of revenue, but couldn’t live up to those numbers in a 2016 sophomore slump.)</p>\n<p>However, as much as we talk about Apple’s Services line as a bright spot in its business, the Wearables category has really been something to behold for the last few years. Eight straight quarters of 30% or larger growth year-over-year, and growth shot up to right around 50% in the two most recent quarters.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/chart-yoy-wearables-6c.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Sometimes it’s also useful to place Apple’s different product categories in the context of the overall Apple business. Apple exited the 2010s with six times the annual revenue that it entered them with. Overall growth like that can make it hard to see how any individual category fits into the bigger picture, so let me chart Services and Wearables <em>together</em> as a percentage of Apple’s overall revenue:</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/services-wearables-100-2tone-6c.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>This chart is quarter-by-quarter, so you can see the seasonality that’s a part of Apple’s overall business. Still, you can see how the massive growth of these two categories has affected the overall revenue mix at Apple.</p>\n<p>It’s not quite as visually impressive as the other charts, I know. But back in the middle of fiscal 2015 these two categories amounted for 16 percent of Apple’s total business. In Apple’s most recent quarter, they were 30 percent of revenue.</p>\n<p>So when you read about Tim Cook emphasizing Services and Wearables to financial analysts or in a quick interview on CNBC come January 28—this is why. In less than half a decade, Services and Wearables have gone from afterthoughts to a third of Apple’s business.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 09 Jan 2020 12:55:01 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/chart-annual-wearables-services-6c.png?ssl=1","linkMd5":"db56494f86dcb901b94b46588775c96c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn67@2020_1/2020/08/24/18-19-08-660_a9dc7d42e5715d98.webp","destWidth":1360,"destHeight":865,"sourceBytes":33504,"destBytes":33504,"author":"Jason Snell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/chart-annual-wearables-services-6c.png?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn67@2020_1/2020/08/24/18-19-08-660_a9dc7d42e5715d98.webp","https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/chart-yoy-services-6c.png?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn87@2020_6/2020/08/24/18-19-17-231_f0a8ce0d1082bb0a.webp","https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/chart-yoy-wearables-6c.png?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn75@2020_5/2020/08/24/18-19-16-246_635837937cbe8803.webp","https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/services-wearables-100-2tone-6c.png?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn95@2020_4/2020/08/24/18-19-12-167_a3b6e7a144beed9f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144655},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"Federico Viticci on the iPadOS 14 Public Beta ↦","link":"https://sixcolors.com/?p=11941","description":"<p>As you might expect, this is <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/stories/two-weeks-with-ipados-14-redefining-the-modern-ipad-experience/\">a great high-level overview</a> of the themes of iPadOS 14 from Federico Viticci:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Even more than last year, I believe that “inspired by the Mac” is the lens through which iPadOS 14 is best examined.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Agreed completely.

For the last five and a half years, it’s been my full-time workspace. But after five years working full-time in a space originally conceived of as a temporary refuge, I decided it was time to revisit and rebuild based on everything I’ve learned over the past years.</p>\n<p>At the center of the whole thing was my desk.

It was adequate, but I decided I really wanted something bigger and better. I bought a 60-inch-wide <a href=\"https://www.upliftdesk.com/uplift-v2-reclaimed-wood-standing-desk/\">Uplift V2</a> and spent extra to get a desktop made of reclaimed fir. It’s gorgeous.

For the last couple of years, I’ve been taking a few minutes before trips to download movies and TV shows to my iPad to watch while I’m traveling. Recently, most streaming services have finally added the ability to download files for when you’re somewhere without a good connection, whether it’s an airplane or a cabin in the woods. With a Plex Pass subscription, I can do that with any of the files on my server—so I don’t need to subscribe to Hulu to take the entirety of Buffy the Vampire Slayer with me when I travel.&#8230;</p> <p>This story is for Six Colors members only. <strong><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/subscribe/\">Become a member</a></strong> to get access to exclusive stories, podcasts, and community..</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Sat, 30 May 2020 16:40:09 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"https://i2.wp.com/mt.sixcolors.com/images/content/2020/maxheadroom-6c.jpg?ssl=1","linkMd5":"719ec9a98dce653eeb021a4c6391d3df","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn58@2020_1/2020/08/24/18-19-06-661_0a65d725f9e7200a.webp","destWidth":1360,"destHeight":1019,"sourceBytes":34564,"destBytes":34564,"author":"Jason Snell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i2.wp.com/mt.sixcolors.com/images/content/2020/maxheadroom-6c.jpg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn58@2020_1/2020/08/24/18-19-06-661_0a65d725f9e7200a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144232},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"3 products that need extra attention from Apple in 2020 (Macworld/Dan Moren)","link":"http://two.wordpress.test/post/2020/01/3_products_that_need_extra_attention_from_apple_in_2020/","description":"<p>When you tell someone that Apple <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3518448/apple-cracks-90b-in-a-single-quarter-for-the-first-time-as-the-iphone-returns-to-glory.html\">made $90 billion in its most recent quarter</a>, it might sound like the kind of ridiculous number that you throw out there to emphasize a huge, unthinkable quantity—but no, the company literally generated <em>ninety billion dollars</em> in revenue.</p>\n<p>It was a banner quarter for the iPhone, Wearables, and Services, all areas that Apple spent a lot of time on in 2019.

The makers of most of the world’s smartphones <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/04/apple-and-google-partner-on-covid-19-contact-tracing-technology/\">are going to work together</a> to build technology that will allow public health organizations to do “contact tracing,” the ability to track the interactions of people diagnosed with the novel coronavirus. Contact tracing has to be a major part of tracking virus hotspots once shelter-in-place conditions conclude.</p>\n<p>The joint press release says:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Apple and Google will be launching a comprehensive solution that includes application programming interfaces (APIs) and operating system-level technology to assist in enabling contact tracing. Given the urgent need, the plan is to implement this solution in two steps while maintaining strong protections around user privacy.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Smartphone technology allows us to have the best contact tracing ever imagined, because all of our phones are capable of tracking all of our movements—and thereby showing who has come into contact with people who turned out to be infected.

There’s nothing new in this laptop’s keyboard compared to that 16-inch MacBook Pro, or the 2020 revision of the MacBook Air. It’s the same keyboard, with 65 physical keys with scissor switches and decent travel. There’s a physical escape key and four arrow keys in the classic “inverted T” shape. It’s good. It’s the end, at long last, of a disastrous product decision.</p>\n<p>Beyond the new keyboard, these are very modest revisions to the existing 13-inch MacBook Pro designs. The 13-inch model has not gotten the revamp that the 15-inch model did when it transformed into a 16-inch laptop last fall. Perhaps that will happen in the future, but this particular revision is all about adding that keyboard and doing some basic upgrades and tweaks.</p>\n<p>And it will probably sell well to a lot of people who prefer smaller laptops and have desperately been waiting for a revision of the 13-inch MacBook Pro without that butterfly keyboard. Yes, this is the one you’ve been waiting for.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/13pro-stack.jpg?ssl=1\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>Apple’s 13-inch laptops seen edge on (top to bottom): iPad Pro with Magic Keyboard, MacBook Air, 13-inch MacBook Pro.</figcaption></figure><h2>Two models in one</h2>\n<p>Since 2016, there have really been two different laptops living under the name “13-inch MacBook Pro.” There’s a lower-end model with two Thunderbolt 3 ports (on the left side), and a higher-end model with four ports (two on either side). Originally the lower-end model didn’t have a Touch Bar, but Apple added it to the low-end model last year.</p>\n<p>There’s a big difference between the two models, one that’s been heightened with this set of updates. The low-end laptops start at $1299 and are powered by 8th-generation Intel processors. The high-end models start at $1799 and have received a boost to 10th-generation “Ice Lake” Intel processors. The low-end models are closer in base price to the $999 MacBook Air than to the high-end 13-inch MacBook Pro.</p>\n<p>Apple furnished me with a high-end model for my review, so I can’t speak to the performance of the low-end models, though I’d imagine they’re not particularly different than last year’s version. They’ll be faster than the 2020 MacBook Air, certainly, especially in multi-processor performance, owing to the four processor cores versus the two on the base configuration of the MacBook Air. (There’s also a quad-core version of the Air available… for the same $1299 price tag as the base 13-inch MacBook Pro.)</p>\n<p>Clearly Apple feels that there is room in its product line between the MacBook Air and the high-end 13-inch MacBook Pro, and for the last four years this lower-end model has served that purpose. It feels wrong, though, like it’s the vestige of an old laptop strategy that hasn’t quite faded away.</p>\n<p>In any event, if you’re shopping for a new Apple laptop and you’re wary of the $1799 starting price of the high-end 13-inch MacBook Pro, you should consider the MacBook Air as well as the low-end Pro. They’re more alike than you might imagine, the Air is lighter and cheaper, and if you have no use for the Touch Bar, all the better.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/13pro-2-by.jpg?ssl=1\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>The lower-end 13-inch MacBook Pro and the MacBook Air—too close for comfort?</figcaption></figure><p>There’s not a lot of news on the low-end model beyond the keyboard upgrade. Apple has boosted the base storage to 256GB, and held the price the same. Well done.</p>\n<h2>New processors on the high end</h2>\n<p>The high-end model has more going on. As on the low end, Apple has doubled the base storage capacity—it’s now 512GB—without changing the price. But the big story is the processor.</p>\n<p>The high-end models use 10th generation Intel processors. These chips run at lower clock speeds than the previous generation, but are faster and more efficient due to the shrink of the process size to 10 nanometers. Integrated graphics performance is boosted in this generation, RAM speeds are faster, and the memory capacity has been doubled—16GB is standard and you can now configure the four-port 13-inch MacBook Pro with up to 32GB of RAM.</p>\n<p>In my tests the new high-end model was definitely faster than last year’s high-end model, across the board. Though Apple claims that graphics performance should receive an extra boost in this upgrade (when compared to last year’s model), the Geekbench 5 scores only showed improvement in line with the general CPU performance. This may be an artifact of Geekbench itself; as I don’t have the previous model to test in graphics-intensive apps like Final Cut Pro X or games, I can’t speak to that.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/macbook-pro-13-2020-review-chart-a-6c.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><br></figure><p>(There’s also the not-inconsequential fact that the high-end 13-inch MacBook Pro can now drive Apple’s fancy Pro Display XDR at full resolution. I didn’t test this, because I am not fancy enough to own one of those displays.)</p>\n<p>This isn’t an enormous upgrade over last year’s model, but it’s a measurable one. (And, of course, the keyboard is the spec most likely to draw upgrades from owners of more recent models.) And if you’ve been holding on to a 2015 MacBook Pro waiting to upgrade, you’re in for a very nice boost.</p>\n<h2>Where do we go from here?</h2>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/13pro-3-by.jpg?ssl=1\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>Apple’s 13-inch laptops.</figcaption></figure><p>Keyboard aside, this is a strange update, if only because it holds back some of the improvements that Apple introduced to the 16-inch MacBook Pro last year. It sure would be swell if this 13-inch model became a 14-inch model with smaller bezels and an upgraded audio system—but alas, that is not this update.</p>\n<p>As someone who doesn’t have any Touch Bar laptops in my house, every time I review a MacBook Pro I am reminded of its wasted potential. Very little has changed in the Touch Bar software since it was introduced. There’s still no way for users to customize it beyond some very basic choices, and there’s no third party access to the Control Strip. Apps that embrace the Touch Bar can create a rich set of controls, but beyond that, things get rough. (I was appalled to see that one of my favorite apps, BBEdit, still has only perfunctory Touch Bar support.)</p>\n<p>Apple can make the Touch Bar better by opening it up. Give third-party apps more control over not only their own space, but access to the Control Strip. Let users assign their own Quick Actions and scripts. A little would go a long way here—but it’s been more than three years and it’s as limited as the day it was released. (Yes, <a href=\"https://folivora.ai\">BetterTouchTool</a> will let you customize the Touch Bar—but it’s a hack, and it shouldn’t need to be.)</p>\n<p>Whenever Apple makes its next move with the 13-inch MacBook Pro, I hope it’ll also reconsider its confusing decision to sell two entirely different laptops under the same name. The original low-end 13-inch MacBook Pro was intended to be a replacement for the MacBook Air, but it never managed to do it, probably because it was overpriced. Apple finally learned its lesson and released the Retina MacBook Air—but this low-end MacBook Pro remains. It’s appreciably worse than the high-end model in many dimensions, and the gap is only increasing. Perhaps if an equivalent upgrade to the 16-inch MacBook Pro is on the horizon for this class of laptop, it would be time to retire the two-port MacBook Pro for good.</p>\n<p>But let’s leave all that aside. The most important feature of these new laptops, by a country mile, is the keyboard. There are legions of MacBook Pro users who have been hanging on, desperate to upgrade but not wanting to buy a laptop with a butterfly keyboard. For some of them, the 16-inch MacBook Pro was just too much—in size, in price, or both.</p>\n<p>All of those people who were hanging on can finally let go. There’s a 13-inch Mac laptop, with a good keyboard, waiting for you. Actually, there are now three of them. One’s the MacBook Air, and the other two are the new 13-inch MacBook Pro.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 07 May 2020 12:30:00 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/13pro-keyboard.jpg?ssl=1","linkMd5":"312587f37b7159d3a5a8e6b5d1c83d3e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn9@2020_4/2020/08/24/18-19-06-484_4618c8fe3549e325.webp","destWidth":1360,"destHeight":1020,"sourceBytes":134172,"destBytes":134172,"author":"Jason Snell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/13pro-keyboard.jpg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn9@2020_4/2020/08/24/18-19-06-484_4618c8fe3549e325.webp","https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/13pro-stack.jpg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn91@2020_2/2020/08/24/18-19-17-263_7ceadba51ea0e1d8.webp","https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/13pro-2-by.jpg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn31@2020_1/2020/08/24/18-19-15-846_e8ff35f48a6f272b.webp","https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/macbook-pro-13-2020-review-chart-a-6c.png?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn99@2020_4/2020/08/24/18-19-12-135_0797a0b3d7c10a92.webp","https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/13pro-3-by.jpg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn84@2020_2/2020/08/24/18-19-16-578_f1747893941c6519.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144253},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"Does one script page equal one minute? ↦","link":"http://two.wordpress.test/post/2020/03/does_one_script_page_equal_one_minute/","description":"<p>Writer (and <a href=\"https://quoteunquoteapps.com\">tech nerd</a>) <a href=\"https://johnaugust.com/about\">John August</a> challenged Stephen Follows to dig through the data and see if the classic entertainment-industry guideline that one page of screenplay equals one minute of runtime in a film was actually true.

As someone who makes an effort to fill the rings on my Apple Watch, I appreciate the focus.</p>\n<p>In the past few years I’ve also bought a few sensors that collect health data and then sync it back to Apple’s HealthKit database. And this is where I’ve run into trouble, because for sensors that I use when I’m sleeping or getting up in the morning, I tend to have my iPad nearby—and my iPhone is charging in another room.</p>\n<p>It’s frustrating, because Apple offers the Health and Activity apps on the iPhone, but not on the iPad or the Mac. I’d love to check my blood pressure data on my Mac or view the location of a previous day’s hike on my iPad, but those features are unavailable. It also means that if I want to sync to those connected health devices, I need to bring my iPhone around, since it’s the device that’s capable of consuming all this data.</p>\n<p>For a company with such a deep focus on health, restricting this data to one device (okay, two if you count Apple Watch) seems like a big mistake. We all use our Apple devices in different ways. I realize that as someone who uses a Mac and iPad more often than an iPhone, I’m a bit of an outlier. And I am apparently unusual in not sleeping with my iPhone on my nightstand. But why should the iPad be walled off from viewing, editing, sharing, and syncing health data?</p>\n<p>So I’m adding this item onto my WWDC Wish List: Apple should provide health data, securely synced across devices via iCloud, across iPhone, Watch, iPad, and Mac. (Mac Catalyst should be a help here—but that will require getting the Health and Activity apps to run on the iPad first.) It’s been six years since the introduction of HealthKit. Time to get the job done.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 08 Jun 2020 22:23:14 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/federighi-healthkit-1.jpg?ssl=1","linkMd5":"acab0d9632816e513f75d42766a23063","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn55@2020_4/2020/08/24/18-19-09-223_34b9c8e559881fab.webp","destWidth":1360,"destHeight":858,"sourceBytes":26864,"destBytes":26864,"author":"Jason Snell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/federighi-healthkit-1.jpg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn55@2020_4/2020/08/24/18-19-09-223_34b9c8e559881fab.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144224},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"The Talk Show: ‘Chain of precision’ ↦","link":"http://two.wordpress.test/post/2020/03/the_talk_show_chain_of_precision/","description":"<p>Another conversation to <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/03/18/the-talk-show-279\">add to your pandemic listening</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Jason Snell returns to the show.

Not only will there be annoying bugs, but many of your favorite App Store apps will not have been tested on the new software, let alone updated to take advantage of any new features. Running iOS betas can be fun, but it can also be frustrating, so only give it a try if you are willing to trade some stability and serenity for the sweet taste of running this fall’s iPhone OS this summer.</p>\n<p>And there are so many tastes to be had in iOS 14, which is a surprisingly expansive update. There’s a huge overhaul to the home screen and a few other areas that change how the iPhone looks in some fundamental ways. And of course, there are a host of app and feature updates, too. Here’s a guide to some of the biggest features to look for when you’re considering an update.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-11921\"></span></p>\n<h2>Invasion of the Home Screen Widgets</h2>\n<figure class=\"pull-right\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ios-14-add-widgets.jpeg?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>Even among Apple’s stock widgets there are many to choose from.</figcaption></figure><p>By far the biggest change in iOS 14 is to the home screen, which has largely followed the same concept since the original iPhone release in 2007. For the first time, Apple is letting you break out of the grid of app icons—and make app icons disappear altogether if you don’t need them in your face.</p>\n<p>Apple previously let apps create Widgets that lived off in the Today view, which you could make visible by swiping left to right on the first page of the home screen. While those Widgets are still compatible with iOS 14, Apple’s set them aside and designed an entirely new Widget mechanism for this new operating system, and these Widgets have some interesting new properties. (They’re also gorgeous—it’s like looking at little Apple Watch interfaces.)</p>\n<p>For the first time, Widgets can live out on the home screen among your apps.<sup id=\"fnref-11921-ipad\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-11921-ipad\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup> The Widgets come in three sizes: small (the size of four app icons — two icons high by two icons wide), medium (a full row, four icons wide by two icons high), and large (four icons wide by four icons high).</p>\n<p>Apple, of course, supplies a bunch of Widgets with iOS 14. Even without third-party apps in the mix, there’s a lot there, including a gorgeous set of weather Widgets and ones from Maps, Photos, Music, Podcasts, and more.</p>\n<p>If you don’t like the idea of using Widgets to get information (and quick access to more!) out into your home screen, you don’t have to use them. But if you <em>do</em> embrace the Widget lifestyle, you have the opportunity to pretty radically change how you use your home screen. Mixing Widget data with apps, or even using entire pages for Widgets, really changes the feeling of that screen.</p>\n<p>Apple has also done a great job in further increasing the information density of the home screen by allowing you to stack Widgets of like sizes. It works a little like making an app folder—you drag a Widget on top of another one and they join into a Widget Stack. Widget Stacks show a single Widget at a time, but if you swipe up or down, you’ll see the next or previous Widget. I’ve added a couple instances of the Weather Widget, set to different locations, into a stack, so I can flip between my local weather and the weather in Arizona where my mother lives, so I can remind myself this summer about just how grateful I am to live in the Bay Area.</p>\n<p>You can even opt for a Stack to use Smart Rotate, which will change which item in your Stack is visible based on Siri’s guess about the most important information in all of the Widgets. There’s also a Smart Stack, which selects widgets for you based on the apps you use the most, and it can also be set to Smart Rotate, of course.</p>\n<p>I’m really enthusiastic about the potential for Widgets in iOS 14. It’s past time for the home screen to go beyond just being an application launching system—and Apple’s implementation seems like a great way to put more data at our fingertips. (And if you prefer your Widgets out of sight, you can still place Widgets in the Today view to the left of the first page of the home screen.)</p>\n<h2>Silence in the App Library</h2>\n<figure class=\"pull-right\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/app-library-14pb.jpeg?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Speaking of app launching, there are a couple other features of the iOS 14 home screen that could dramatically change the iPhone experience if you choose to use them. You can now hide pages of your home screen entirely, so if you have pages and pages of apps (or folders of apps) you never use, you don’t need to see them anymore. The apps are still there—in fact, the <em>pages</em> are still there, they’re just hidden from your view. You can bring them back anytime.</p>\n<p>Even though those app pages aren’t there, you can still launch those apps, either via search (swipe down on any home screen page to bring up the search interface, which has been expanded with data from inside more apps) or swipe all the way past the last visible page to see the new App Library page. The App Library is a collection of ways to browse or find apps, from a search box to some Siri suggestions to a bunch of collections of other apps.</p>\n<p>I like the idea of the App Library, but it does feel a bit redundant. Its top two features, the search box and Siri Suggestions, are also available by swiping down and getting to that Search screen. Yes, the two screens are different—the swipe down brings up the keyboard so you can quickly type a search query (and it searches everything, not just apps), while in App Library you have to tap on the search box to enter text (or just scroll through an excellent alphabetized list of all installed apps)—but they’re not <em>that</em> different.</p>\n<p>As much as I like the look of the App Library, I question how much I’ll use it, since I can still swipe down and search for apps from the Search window. It feels like these two features could stand to be redesigned so that there’s less overlap between them.</p>\n<h2>Get out of my way</h2>\n<figure class=\"pull-right\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/14pb-floater.jpeg?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>When the phone rings, it doesn’t take over your screen.</figcaption></figure><p>Another feature that’s existed since the original conception of the iPhone is getting brushed away in iOS 14: interfaces that completely take over the screen when you don’t want or need them to. The obvious example of this is the Phone app, which covers everything you’re doing when you make a call—or when someone calls you! The idea of an app completely taking over your screen when someone else does something without your consent else seems bananas, right? And yet the legacy of the iPhone as a telephone has meant that the phone interface has gotten special override powers for ages.</p>\n<p>No more, though! In iOS 14, when your phone rings you get a sort of mega-notification that slides in from the top of the screen.</p>\n<p>Similarly, Siri queries no longer take over your screen. When you trigger Siri, a floating icon appears at the bottom of the screen. Answers are displayed in a floating window that you can dismiss. It’s so much better.</p>\n<p>A couple of features from the iPad are now making their way to the iPhone in iOS 14, too. Picture in picture, which lets you keep playing video while in other apps, is now supported on the iPhone—and it’s about time. And you can now minimize a FaceTime call and look at another app without the person you’re talking to seeing a “call suspended” screen. I use both of these features all the time on my iPad. Given how iPhone screens are large and getting larger all the time, these big-screen features should be welcome additions on the iPhone screen, too.</p>\n<h2>App improvements</h2>\n<p>As always, iOS updates are also an opportunity for Apple to update the stock apps that ride along with the operating system. And iOS 14 has a large number of upgrades on that front.</p>\n<h3>Messages gets more conversant</h3>\n<figure class=\"pull-right\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/messages-14pb.jpeg?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>You can now pin conversations and give them custom images.</figcaption></figure><p>I am a member of many group conversations in Messages, and many of them feel unmanageable. Or it might be more accurate to say, I feel powerless to manage them because the conversation tools in Messages pale in comparison to what I’m provided in other messaging apps I use.</p>\n<p>Apple seems aware of the issue, because that’s where most Messages improvements are concentrated. You can now pin conversations to the top of the screen, so you can keep your BFFs closer, and can attach a unique icon to a conversation.</p>\n<p>You can now <em>mention</em> people (think of at-mentions on Twitter, Slack, or similar services)—and you can set your notification settings to ping you only when you’re mentioned. Previously, I found myself stuck between getting notified on every single post from a group chat, which is something I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy, or never getting notified at all and missing important stuff. With this new approach—as long as your co-conspirators are on iOS 14 and use the feature—you can suppress most notifications from the chat, but they can get your attention if you’re needed. I like it.</p>\n<figure class=\"pull-right\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/14pb-inline-replies.jpeg?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>Inline replies are good.</figcaption></figure><p>You can also now reply directly to specific messages in a chat, creating a reply chain. (To reply, just tap and hold on a message you’d like to reply to, and then choose Reply from the pop-up menu.) This is a feature that can be effective in adding context to conversations and allow multiple conversations to happen simultaneously, all of which is good. But it really will rely on everyone getting on the latest versions of iOS, iPadOS, and macOS in order for it to work clearly. People not on the new versions won’t see the reply context, but will just see a stand-alone message. Still, it’s a good addition.</p>\n<p>There’s more work for Apple to do on Messages, of course. A few years using Slack heavily have convinced me that while Apple’s Tapback feature (which lets you quickly reply to a message with a symbol) is great, it’s too limited. I want to be able to use Tapback with any emoji, and for the Tapback interface to be populated with my favorite or most recent emojis. But instead, I’m limited to the same old six gray tapback images. Maybe next year.</p>\n<h3>Maps goes green</h3>\n<figure class=\"pull-right\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/iospb14-maps.jpeg?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Apple Maps is getting an upgrade across Apple’s platforms later this year, but I suspect iOS is where we use Maps most frequently. This year Apple is focusing on some greener features, looking beyond the car to provide more detailed cycling directions, which include not only different routing but climbing data and the ability to avoid hills and busy roads.</p>\n<p>This is a great addition, though it’s a shame that it’s only rolling out in a small collection of cities to start. I’m sure Apple will be cranking away to add this functionality everywhere.</p>\n<p>Apple is also adding electric vehicle routing to Maps. While EV’s drive on the same roads as other cars, they have some different needs in terms of range planning and charging. Maps in iOS 14 will build in charging stops along your route, which sounds great—but for it all to work, you’ll need to be using a “supported vehicle.” I’m unclear whether this means Apple will require car apps to be updated to share information on charging and battery status with Maps, or if this is using some direct communication with cars, but as the owner of an older EV I’m assuming this feature won’t be available to me, which is kind of a bummer<sup id=\"fnref-11921-leaf\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-11921-leaf\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">2</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>One of my very favorite new features of Maps is Refine Location, which uses machine learning and your phone’s camera to pinpoint your location in clogged urban areas where GPS signals become unreliable. (I once stood still in the middle of San Francisco and watched my Maps dot glide unpredictably around about a five-block radius.) Refine Location works by looking at the buildings across the street from you and matching them to Apple’s database of street photos until it figures out where you are. That’s both brilliant and bananas, but I love it.</p>\n<h3>And many, many more</h3>\n<figure class=\"pull-right\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/14pb-search.jpeg?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>Search now answers Siri-like questions.</figcaption></figure><p>I can’t go into all the app improvements in great detail, but there are many more. A new Translate app lets you quickly translate either with writing or typing, promising an easier experience when you’re trying to express yourself who doesn’t understand you. And it supports offline translation, in case you’re in a far-off country without a data plan. (I’m still wishing for a Word Lens-style feature where I can point my camera at a label in a grocery store and have it translated for me on the fly, and the ability to auto-translate Messages conversations. Maybe next year.)</p>\n<p>Siri and Search have both been bosted with support for new data types and deeper searches. It seems like the Search field has been upgraded with extra Siri integration, so you can just type general queries that you might previously have spoken out loud.</p>\n<p>The Camera app has been upgraded to reduce the time it takes to take your first shot, as well as the time between successive shots. Night mode has also been upgraded with more feedback from the device’s gyroscope to keep your aim steady. And the Photos app has added some improved filtering effects and support for captions (previously available only on macOS).</p>\n<p>There’s a lot more. Around every corner as I explored the beta, I found more tweaks to apps I use a lot, like Weather (which has added Dark Sky-style precipitation charts) and Reminders (you can assign reminders to people sharing your list).</p>\n<h2>Wait till next year</h2>\n<p>In addition to all the features that you’ll get when you update to iOS 14—whether it’s this summer or when the final version is released in the fall—Apple is also laying the groundwork for some features that might change the world… eventually.</p>\n<p>A new <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/06/wwdc-2020-wednesday-session-impressions/\">Car Key feature</a> will let you unlock future cars with your phone. The new <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/06/apples-new-app-clips-tiny-apps-you-run-with-a-tap/\">App Clips feature</a> promises a future where you’ll be able to tap or scan a code and instantly load a miniature app to order food or pay for parking. And the new Find My Network feature extends the ability of the Find My app, previously limited to your Apple devices, to find other objects made by other companies—once they make those objects to match Apple’s specifications.</p>\n<p>All cool stuff, but nothing you’ll probably encounter if you choose to install the Public Beta. Check back in 2021 or 2022.</p>\n<h2>Obligatory beta warning</h2>\n<p>iOS 14 is an exciting new chapter in the life of the iPhone, and one that will be immediately noticeable upon upgrading, thanks to all the improvements to the home screen. I don’t blame you for wanting to jump in on the <a href=\"https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/\">Public Beta</a>.</p>\n<p>It’s okay. If Apple didn’t want you to use this software, they wouldn’t offer it. But be sure you know what you’re getting into. There will be bugs. Your iPhone might be a lot less reliable.

It also does not include typical office environments or retail or grocery stores where large numbers of people are present, but where it is unusual for them to be within arm’s length of one another.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>The Steve Jobs Theater’s capacity is about 1,000 people, so I suppose Apple <em>could</em> host an event with a smaller number of people and not run afoul of the authorities. But if you’ve ever been to one of Apple’s events at Apple Park, you’ll know that the company is mobilizing hundreds of employees to handle logistics, greet guests, brief press, run the technical aspects of the event… it’s a huge production.</p>\n<p>Given the current state of affairs, I don’t think this announcement would’ve mattered to Apple, because I can’t see the company even attempting to pull off a big public events in an era where we’d probably be better off <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/coronavirus-cancel-everything/607675/\">cancelling everything</a>.</p>\n<p>If Apple’s supply chain is strong enough to ship new products for the company to sell, perhaps the company will invite a few select members of the media somewhere for individual product briefings.

Yep, that’s it.</figcaption></figure><p>During WWDC in San Francisco some year, John Siracusa walked into my office at Macworld and needed to look at something on my computer. I remember him being appalled by how messy my Mac’s desktop was. There were dozens of files scattered all over the desktop.</p>\n<p>I remember telling him that, like many Mac users, my Desktop was also my inbox, littered with stuff I was working on or needed to deal with in the near future. And that was true. But when I was reminded of this exchange a few weeks ago, I realized that I’ve changed my tune completely in the last year. As I write this, there are three items on my desktop.</p>\n<p>Here’s what I did to go from Desktop Oscar to Desktop Felix<sup id=\"fnref-10854-odd\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-10854-odd\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n<p><strong>Embrace cloud syncing.</strong> When I started using cloud services to make my files available across devices, that drove a lot of files off of my Desktop. I made this move <em>before</em> Apple so generously added Desktop and Documents folder syncing to iCloud, which would probably have kept me cluttering my Desktop. But Dropbox only works in its own special folder, so I started saving the stories I was working on in Dropbox rather than on my desktop.</p>\n<p>When I started to get frustrated with how messy my Dropbox folder was, I created a special folder within Dropbox called Stories, to contain all the stories I was working on. And I used <a href=\"https://www.stclairsoft.com/DefaultFolderX/\">Default Folder X</a> to make it the default folder for opening or saving files when I’m using BBEdit. When I got frustrated by the number of files in that folder, I used <a href=\"https://www.noodlesoft.com\">Hazel</a> to create a rule that moves stories into an “archive” folder after a few weeks.</p>\n<p>I will also admit that when I see a random file floating on my Desktop that I don’t need, I tend to just chuck it into Dropbox, getting it out of my face while making it accessible anywhere should I need it. Yes, this is the digital equivalent of cleaning your room by pushing all the junk under your bed, but what can I say? Nobody looks under the bed.</p>\n<p>I also used to save all my screenshots—and I take a lot of them in my line of work—to my Desktop. <em>I know!</em> Now I save them to a Dropbox folder called Screenshots, giving me access to them across all my devices and getting them out of my way. (I’ve also got a Hazel action that deletes them after a few months of inactivity.)</p>\n<p><strong>Get a file server.</strong> I’ve been using a Mac mini as a server for years, but it’s only in the last ten years that I’ve really embraced it as a file repository. If I’ve got a podcast project that doesn’t need my immediate attention, it gets copied to my server, into a “Works in Progress” folder, where it sits until I need to retrieve it—getting it off my Desktop.</p>\n<figure class=\"pull-right\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/sidebar-finder-sorry-john-6c.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"sidebar-finder-sorry-john\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>Favorite folders live in the Finder Sidebar.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Use the Sidebar and the Dock.</strong> When I created my Stories folder, I added it to the Sidebar in Finder windows for quick access. (Somewhere, John Siracusa is probably angry at me again for using the Sidebar, but I do.) I’ve also got numerous other folders in my Sidebar that I would otherwise have as aliases on my Desktop or, in the old days, in a DragThing dock.</p>\n<p>I also have a few other items that I’ve dragged into my Dock: An alias to my server for instant screen sharing, my Downloads folder and my Dropbox folder.</p>\n<p><strong>Keep my Desktop organized.</strong> A big change for me that finally put me on the path of good Desktop organization was turning on sorting on the Desktop. My Desktop is sorted by name, meaning that items appear one at a time, starting in the upper right corner of my screen and moving down from there. This means that items can’t overlap, and eliminates another set of clutter.</p>\n<p>I’m not using the Desktop Stacks feature Apple <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2018/09/mojave/\">introduced in macOS Mojave</a>. That’s partly because Apple’s organizational principles for those Stacks just don’t work right with the kinds of files that I tend to have on my Desktop, and partly because it’s really an attempt to make a Desktop with dozens of files look cleaner—and I no longer have dozens of files on my Desktop.</p>\n<p><strong>Get templates off my Desktop.</strong> One of the reasons I created my <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2018/09/bad-applescript-load-the-template-gun/\">Template Gun AppleScript</a> was because I kept all the <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2017/09/quick-tip-zip-files-as-templates/\">Zip archives I use as templates</a> for my various podcast projects on my Desktop. Instead, I moved them to a Podcast Templates folder in Dropbox and wrote a script that automatically unzips a copy of one and places it on the Desktop.</p>\n<p>Because, and I can’t emphasize this enough, I <em>still</em> leave active project files on my Desktop. There are sometimes 10 or 15 files on my Desktop. But they’re always sorted into an orderly list, and they don’t stay out there very long.</p>\n<p>It may not be perfect, but I feel like I’m headed in the right direction.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr><ol><li id=\"fn-10854-odd\">\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Odd_Couple_(play)\">That’s a reference.</a> <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fnref-10854-odd\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/21a9.png\" alt=\"↩\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></a>\n</li>\n</ol></div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 27 Mar 2020 18:52:32 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/finder-ordering-6c.jpg?ssl=1","linkMd5":"1315e6feaf76db1fba8932227641468e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn13@2020_2/2020/08/24/18-19-06-631_00c94459cbcd5e30.webp","destWidth":1360,"destHeight":815,"sourceBytes":52370,"destBytes":52370,"author":"Jason Snell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/finder-ordering-6c.jpg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn13@2020_2/2020/08/24/18-19-06-631_00c94459cbcd5e30.webp","https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/sidebar-finder-sorry-john-6c.jpg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn82@2020_5/2020/08/24/18-19-14-628_d53cb0a07a549b7e.webp","https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/21a9.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn51@2020_2/2020/08/24/18-19-11-215_25686225908fe44d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144629},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"(Podcast) #282: A Stack of Old Laptops","link":"http://two.wordpress.test/post/2020/03/282_a_stack_of_old_laptops/","description":"<p>This week, on the irreverent tech podcast that’s always a little bit behind, there’s a new iPad in town and it’s going to have a crazy new keyboard.

It is a remake of Escape Velocity: Override (1998), by the same scenario designer. It is planned to be released for Mac, Windows PC and Linux systems, with a target release date in the middle of 2021. We are seeking your backing to meet that target and release a game of the highest quality possible!\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>The Escape Velocity series, published by Ambrosia Software, was long one of my favorite games on the Mac, a combination of space combat, interstellar trading, and exploration that you could easily sink hours into. And, as mentioned, one of the driving forces behind the remaster is Peter Cartwright, the scenario designer for Escape Velocity: Override, though original Escape Velocity author Matt Burch does not have any involvement with the project.<sup id=\"fnref-10916-escapevelocity\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-10916-escapevelocity\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>In this age of iOS and Mac games, Escape Velocity seems like the kind of property that would flourish, and I’m glad to see there may be some life left in the franchise.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr><ol><li id=\"fn-10916-escapevelocity\">\nThat appears to be the reason behind the remaster’s name change to “Cosmic Frontier.” <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fnref-10916-escapevelocity\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/21a9.png\" alt=\"↩\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></a>\n</li>\n</ol></div><p><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cosmicfrontier/cosmic-frontier-override\">Go to the linked site</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/link/2020/04/crowdfunding-campaign-attempts-to-revive-escape-velocity-override/\">Read on Six Colors</a>.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 27 Apr 2020 18:30:40 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/21a9.png","linkMd5":"1a442caeec947bbd2301086adaea5a64","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn51@2020_2/2020/08/24/18-19-11-215_25686225908fe44d.webp","destWidth":72,"destHeight":72,"sourceBytes":462,"destBytes":1318,"author":"Dan Moren","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/21a9.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn51@2020_2/2020/08/24/18-19-11-215_25686225908fe44d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144273},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"Bloomberg: Apple to announce Mac ARM transition at WWDC ↦","link":"http://two.wordpress.test/post/2020/06/bloomberg_apple_to_announce_mac_arm_transition_at_wwdc/","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-09/apple-plans-to-announce-move-to-its-own-mac-chips-at-wwdc\">Mark Gurman at Bloomberg says that the ARM transition is imminent</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Apple Inc. is preparing to announce a shift to its own main processors in Mac computers, replacing chips from Intel Corp., as early as this month at its annual developer conference, according to people familiar with the plans.</p>\n<p>  The company is holding WWDC the week of June 22. Unveiling the initiative, codenamed Kalamata, at the event would give outside developers time to adjust before new Macs roll out in 2021, the people said. Since the hardware transition is still months away, the timing of the announcement could change, they added, while asking not to be identified discussing private plans.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>We have, of course, been expecting this move for some time now, but it certainly seems as though the evidence is mounting for an announcement at WWDC.</p>\n<p>Gurman’s report contains a few interesting tidbits, such as the fact that the hardware transition is still months off, suggesting that developers will be given a healthy heads up to adapt their software before new products start to arrive.</p>\n<p>It also lends credence to the idea of the iPad Pro as a stealth ARM Mac development kit, since those developers will presumably need to test their software on <em>something</em>.<sup id=\"fnref-10997-ipadpro\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-10997-ipadpro\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>Gurman also says that Apple’s internal tests show significant performance gains in graphics performance and AI-based apps, and suggests that power efficiency should be better as well. That raises an interesting question, to my mind: is there any place where Apple’s chips <em>don’t</em> measure up to Intel’s? Price? Non-graphics compute performance? Or is it all upside?</p>\n<p>This is likely to be the biggest shift in the Mac since the Intel transition, although given Apple’s penchant for keeping underlying technical shifts seamless, it may go largely unnoticed by many users. With just under two weeks until WWDC, looks like we’ll find out sooner rather than later.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr><ol><li id=\"fn-10997-ipadpro\">\nMy guess is that, if Apple did take this approach, it would be limited to the 2018 and 2020 iPad Pro models, since they have support for the Magic Keyboard and a USB-C port. <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fnref-10997-ipadpro\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/21a9.png\" alt=\"↩\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></a>\n</li>\n</ol></div><p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-09/apple-plans-to-announce-move-to-its-own-mac-chips-at-wwdc\">Go to the linked site</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/link/2020/06/bloomberg-apple-to-announce-mac-arm-transition-at-wwdc/\">Read on Six Colors</a>.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 09 Jun 2020 13:17:17 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/21a9.png","linkMd5":"bca1765aad7ce1852300afa59e943a44","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn51@2020_2/2020/08/24/18-19-11-215_25686225908fe44d.webp","destWidth":72,"destHeight":72,"sourceBytes":462,"destBytes":1318,"author":"Dan Moren","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/21a9.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn51@2020_2/2020/08/24/18-19-11-215_25686225908fe44d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144224},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"6C Podcast: May 1, 2020","link":"http://com.sixcolors.podcast.9719","description":"<p>“It came to me then that every plan is a tiny prayer to father time.”&#8230;</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/subscribe/\">Become a member</a></strong> to listen to our exclusive weekly podcast and get more benefits.</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 01 May 2020 17:07:34 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"933217df622b50e5f99e56f1127bbe95","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jason Snell","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144260},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"(Sponsor) Feed sponsor: Previs Pro","link":"http://two.wordpress.test/post/2020/02/sponsor_previs_pro/","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.previspro.com/#sixcolors\">Previs Pro</a> is a brand-new iOS app for storyboarding film and video created by a multiple Apple Design Award winning team.</p>\n<p>If you make films or create videos, you already know the importance of using storyboards to design that perfect shot.

Cheaper Apple products are hits (Macworld/Jason Snell)","link":"http://two.wordpress.test/post/2020/02/surprise_cheaper_apple_products_are_hits/","description":"<p>Gauging consumer demand for a product can be hard, even for a company as successful as Apple. Sometimes a product is a breakout hit, there are production slowdowns at the factory, or both, and the company just can’t make ’em fast enough. But there are other times when it’s just a failure of imagination, a miscalculation in the appeal of one’s own product that leads a company to just not make enough products to fulfill the surprising demand.</p>\n<p>It doesn’t happen often to Apple, but every time it does, it’s an interesting data point. A few years back, Apple underestimated the appeal of the small, low-cost iPhone SE—and didn’t make enough to fulfill demand. And during the 2019 holidays, Apple didn’t make enough of the two-year-old Apple Watch Series 3, of all things.</p>\n<p>Both of these products suggest something a little broader and more interesting about Apple’s approach: First, that Tim Cook’s strategy of selling older products at discounted prices really does seem to work. And second, that inside Apple there’s still some resistance to the idea that old cheap products can still be big sellers.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3519428/surprise-cheaper-apple-products-are-hits.html\">Continue reading on Macworld</a>.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 05 Feb 2020 07:30:52 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"a5aa423d02686d70a727bb59f26b0f80","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jason Snell","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144635},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"John Siracusa (re)wrote an app ↦","link":"http://two.wordpress.test/post/2020/01/john_siracusa_wrote_an_app/","description":"<figure><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/front-center-6c.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>John Siracusa has needs.

I’ve finally gotten a shipping version of the Brydge Pro+, and have been able to use it with a 2020 iPad Pro running iPadOS 13.4, which includes Apple’s new trackpad support.</p>\n<p>When the product was announced, I <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/01/brydge-pro/\">pointed out that iPad trackpad support</a> just wasn’t strong enough to make the Brydge Pro+ a good option for most people. Not only did Apple’s Assistive Touch accessibility feature offer a cursor that was really just an awkward virtual finger, but the MacBook-like construction of the Brydge keyboard deck just emphasized all the ways that the product couldn’t supply a smooth, MacBook-like pointing experience.</p>\n<p>The good news is that iPadOS 13.4 means that Assistive Touch is no longer necessary to <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/03/the-ipad-cursor-is-here-no-wait-required/\">drive an iPad with a cursor</a>. Attach a Magic Trackpad 2 to an iPad and you will get an experience that really is very close to what you’d get on a MacBook. And Apple’s forthcoming Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro will bring that to a portable design that challenges the need for a product like the Brydge Pro+.</p>\n<p>Still, I figured that the Brydge Pro+ would find an ecological niche to fill. It’s going to be $100 or $120 cheaper than the Magic Keyboard, and will probably offer a more traditional laptop feel than Apple’s cantilevered design.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, none of that matters if Brydge doesn’t get the trackpad right on the Pro+, and I’m sorry to report that it hasn’t. The trackpad on the Pro+ isn’t remotely close to Apple’s trackpads in class. Sometimes I move my finger across the trackpad and the cursor appears, but doesn’t move. Other times it moves, hesitates, and then moves some more. Two-finger scrolling is similarly unpleasant. The result is an imprecise, jerky experience. It’s no good. And there’s no support for navigating between apps via three-finger gestures, either.</p>\n<p>I’ve been using the Brydge Pro+ to write this article, and I find myself actively avoiding using the trackpad, because every time I try it, I just end up frustrated.</p>\n<p>I would have been disappointed by the feel of the Brydge Pro+ trackpad regardless, but now that I’ve seen Apple’s Magic Trackpad 2 working flawlessly with iPadOS 13.4, it’s an even starker difference.</p>\n<p>I feel for Brydge, which clearly engineered this product for a pre-iPadOS 13.4 world, but it’s been left behind. Perhaps if the company can find a way to update the trackpad firmware to function better, the product can be salvaged. But right now I can’t recommend the Brydge Pro+ to anyone.</p>\n<p>If you don’t need cursor support, the regular <a href=\"https://www.brydge.com/products/brydge-pro-keyboard-for-ipad-pro\">Brydge Pro</a> will provide you with a laptop-style typing feel that’s excellent. If you <em>do</em> want a laptop-like experience with a trackpad on an iPad Pro, I’d recommend waiting for the Magic Keyboard to ship in May. (And if you’re using an iPad on a table or desk, use a Magic Trackpad 2.)</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 08 Apr 2020 18:03:56 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/brydgeproplus-6c.jpg?ssl=1","linkMd5":"c2835d117df06a02a72db97a6e978556","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn80@2020_5/2020/08/24/18-19-07-772_fd3716099e0c43f2.webp","destWidth":680,"destHeight":680,"sourceBytes":20606,"destBytes":20606,"author":"Jason Snell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/brydgeproplus-6c.jpg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn80@2020_5/2020/08/24/18-19-07-772_fd3716099e0c43f2.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144509},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"(Sponsor) PowerPhotos","link":"http://two.wordpress.test/post/2020/04/powerphotos_6/","description":"<p>My thanks to Fat Cat Software’s <a href=\"http://www.fatcatsoftware.com/powerphotos\">PowerPhotos</a> for once again sponsoring Six Colors this week.</p>\n<p>PowerPhotos is the ultimate toolbox for working with Apple’s Photos app for Mac.

Could they be some sort of puzzle to decode? Some people have speculated they aren’t even real, but rather AR objects. The conspiracy theories abound!</p>\n<p>Ahem. Anyway, here are a few interesting tidbits from a few of the talks I watched on Wednesday.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/10670\">Meet Face ID and Touch ID for the web</a></strong></p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/wwdc20-faceid-touchid-web.jpeg?ssl=1\" alt=\"Meet Face ID and Touch ID for the web\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>As usual, Apple has taken things a step further for privacy’s sake.</figcaption></figure><p>We’ve all gotten used to logging in to apps on our iPhones, iPads, and—in some cases—Macs using Touch ID and Face ID. So much so that when we visit a website and it asks us for our password, it feels extremely 20th century.</p>\n<p>Well, good news: Apple is rolling out a way for websites to offer authentication via Face ID or Touch ID. What shouldn’t be a surprise is that on the user end the experience is almost identical to logging in to an app. Once a website offers Face ID/Touch ID as an option, you simply agree to use it, authenticate with the biometrics to prove your identity, and the next time you log in, you won’t have to enter your password.</p>\n<p>For website providers, implementing this only requires a fairly small amount of JavaScript. It seems plausible that we’ll see more and more sites rolling this out the not too distant future, which, even if it doesn’t outright kill the password (which you still need even in this case), may help hasten its demise.</p>\n<p>An interesting tidbit I gleaned from this presentation: as part of the process, Apple has created its own attestation service. This optional feature provides an extra step of security in which the device maker can be queried to confirm details about the device requesting authentication. Such a process might be used by higher-security institutions like banks, which could be required to enforce multi-factor verification. So, for example, a site can check with Apple that the iPhone being used for Face ID authentication is really an iPhone and it actually supports Face ID authentication.</p>\n<p>In traditional Apple fashion, the company has layered more privacy on top of this service. As WebKit Engineer Jiewen Tan points out, an attestation service could just provide the same certificate every time it’s queried, thus providing an opportunity for cross-site tracking by comparing those certificates. So, instead, Apple issues unique certificates every time, thus anonymizing the device.</p>\n<p>Also, one final good tip I was glad to see from this presentation: Apple’s not advising sites to use Face ID and Touch ID as the <em>only</em> method for authentication, given that if you lose your device, you may be out of luck. So the password is probably here to stay for a bit longer.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/10662\">What’s New in Wallet and Apple Pay</a></strong></p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/wwdc20-applepay.jpeg?ssl=1\" alt=\"Apple Pay\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>Contact information is now standardized, hopefully leading to fewer errors.</figcaption></figure><p>Apple Pay has obviously become a big part of our lives, and especially in this day and age, contactless payments have become even more popular.</p>\n<p>While Apple Pay enhancements weren’t something really touched upon in the keynote, there is at least one very significant improvement this year: the ability to use Apple Pay in both Catalyst apps <em>and</em> native Mac apps.</p>\n<p>It actually kind of surprised me to see this brought up, because I hadn’t really thought about Mac apps not having Apple Pay. Heck, I’ve done Apple Pay transactions on my Mac—but they were all via Safari. Going forward, however, any app that’s on the Mac will be able to integrate Apple Pay payments. (That makes sense especially given that upcoming Apple Silicon Macs will run iOS and iPadOS apps, which themselves will be able to take Apple Pay.)</p>\n<p>There are a few other improvements coming as well. To anyone who has ever been frustrated by having an Apple Pay transaction fail because of an error in your address or phone number, Apple will now impose standardized formatting of contact information, and will validate the data  <em>prior</em> to the transaction.</p>\n<p>Finally, in order to provide a better onboarding experience for people adding cards, the Wallet app will now support an extension for issuer apps. So, if you have your bank’s app installed, the option to add your card can appear directly in Wallet.</p>\n<p>Oh, and perhaps most excitingly, developers can now alter the corner radius of the Apple Pay button, all the way from rectangles to a pill-like shape. Let’s hear it for button configuration!</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/10618\">Tap into Game Center: Dashboard, Access Point, and Profile</a> and <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/10619\">Tap into Game Center: Tap into Game Center: Leaderboards, Achievements, and Multiplayer<br></a></strong></p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/wwdc20-gamecenter.jpeg?ssl=1\" alt=\"Game Center\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>I really want to be a lighthouse keeper now.</figcaption></figure><p>I would not have guessed that Game Center would see a substantial overhaul in the upcoming platform updates, but I’m delighted to see that it’s getting a lot of attention.</p>\n<p>Chief among the updates, Apple’s rolling out a new Dashboard feature that feels much more like what you might see on a game console. It collects a variety of information into one location, including your profile, your friends, your achievements, and your leaderboards.</p>\n<p>To access the dashboard there’s a new, appropriately named Access Point that can games can integrate, which shows up as a little picture of your Game Center avatar on the menu screen of a game. (It can also optionally show other highlights, like your achievements or current leaderboard status.)</p>\n<p>A big part of this Game Center update is pervasiveness. You can now access your profile in a variety of places, including in-game and even in the App Store, instead of having to dig into a dedicated app or the system-level Settings.</p>\n<p>There are also new UIs for real-time and turn-based multiplayer that app developers can integrate, or roll their own, which not only let you add friends to games but nearby players as well.</p>\n<p>Apple’s also beefed up offerings like achievements, which can now show your progress towards attaining the goal, and leaderboards, which can be configured to be recurring, resetting after a specific time period or when a particular score is reached.</p>\n<p>Players also have more control over the visibility of their profiles, whether they’re available to everyone, just friends, or just private. And the App Store now shows you what games your friends are playing as suggestions, as well as letting you directly access their player profiles from the store.</p>\n<p>Mostly, though, I just want to play the “The Coast”, the demo game the presenters were using. I don’t know if it’s real, but a game about being a lighthouse keeper trying to safely see cargo ships through a treacherous body of water? Sign me up.</p>\n<p>All in all, these updates to Game Center seem like a great comeback for a feature that seemed to have been left for dead a few years back.

Will the hardware follow?</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"https://www.relay.fm/upgrade/304\">This week on Upgrade</a>, Myke Hurley and I had some fun envisioning what features Apple might have been waiting to add to Macs until the switch to Apple-designed processors.</p>\n<p>When the Intel transition happened, Apple was extremely restrained. The first Intel Macs were more or less the existing PowerPC Macs, but with Intel processors inside. The message was clear: <em>Steady as she goes, no need to be concerned, these Macs are the same ones you loved, but with a different kind of chip inside.</em></p>\n<p>I suppose Apple could play that game again with this transition, but I don’t think it will. Part of it is my guess that Apple’s been champing at the bit to roll all sorts of iOS features into the Mac for years, but has been limited by Intel’s architecture. What the Mac has gotten is the stuff that was enabled by <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3245764/the-t2-chip-makes-the-imac-pro-the-start-of-a-mac-revolution.html\">the T2 chip</a>—biometric ID, better camera control, secure storage, and security features. But there are plenty of features that haven’t come over from the iPhone and iPad, and now might be the time.</p>\n<p>Then there’s macOS Big Sur. If Apple intended to send a message that this fall is all part of a simple, orderly transition that won’t affect users and will keep the Mac we all know and love chugging away, it would release a boring OS update with some new features and some bug fixes. Big Sur is the opposite. It’s a new interface design, and on Macs with Apple silicon, it will be paired with the ability to run unmodified iPad and iPhone apps.</p>\n<p>Take a look at Big Sur’s rounded corners, spaced-out menus, and expanded Control Center and tell me that there isn’t going to be some dramatic new Apple hardware to go with this dramatic new operating-system release. I can’t see it. Big Sur is the start of a new Mac era, and the hardware designed to run on it will be new and exciting and different, at least a little bit.</p>\n<p>Myke and I ended up coming up with nine features that Apple could bring over from iPhone and iPad to next-generation Macs. Here they are, in a rough order of most likely to least likely of appearing on a Mac in 2020:</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-11690\"></span></p>\n<p><strong>Rounded screen corners.</strong> The original Mac display had rounded corners. The iPad Pro screen has rounded corners. The iPhone screen has rounded corners. Every single interface element in macOS Big Sur has rounded corners. Gee, do you think that the next wave of Macs will have rounded corners?</p>\n<p><strong>Touchscreens.</strong> Apple has steadfastly refused to make Mac with touchscreens, but times have changed. macOS Big Sur’s interface has been influenced by iPadOS, and maybe all the changes are is an attempt to create more of a family resemblance, but it sure <em>feels</em> like Apple is making an interface that’s a little more navigable via touch. But the clincher here, to me, is the arrival of iPad and iPhone apps on the Mac. Yes, you can drive those apps via keyboard and mouse—especially iPad apps that have been optimized for it—but they were designed for touch. No, the Mac is not likely to ever be a touch-first device, and it shouldn’t be. But just as the iPad accepts keyboards and trackpads and the Apple Pencil as secondary input methods, the Mac can handle touch.</p>\n<p><strong>Face ID.</strong> I don’t know why Apple doesn’t have Face ID on Macs already, but it’s long past time. Windows Hello has allowed users to log in with their faces for ages now. Apple’s already built a face-authentication system for iOS, and it’s time to bring it to the Mac—especially to the iMac, which can’t take advantage of Touch ID. Along the way I’d assume we’d also get a better webcam in the iMac, which I can heartily endorse.</p>\n<p><strong>No more tapers, and super thin.</strong> Myke thinks that Mac industrial design is going to take its cue from the iPad Pro and go flat, and thin, without a lot of the tapered edges we see today. I can see it, at least on some products, if not all of them.</p>\n<p><strong>Apple Pencil.</strong> If you’re going to add touch, why not add Apple Pencil? It all comes down to ergonomics. Apple Pencil support on the Mac only makes sense if Apple is going to change up the ergonomics of the Mac. But that’s something Apple absolutely could do.</p>\n<p><strong>New desktop ergonomics.</strong>  Microsoft’s Surface Studio got our attention a few years ago because it’s a take on how you’d make an iMac that could be lowered to a more ergonomic position for touch and pen input. Apple’s best iMac design was a floating display attached to a base by an adjustable arm. After seeing the clever way Apple designed the iPad Pro Magic Keyboard, is there any doubt that this company could build an iMac that would work great in traditional keyboard and mouse mode, but also could lower down like a drafting table to allow touch and pencil input? I’d love to see that iMac.</p>\n<p><strong>New laptop ergonomics.</strong>  For years, there have been PC laptops that let you get the keyboard out of the way in order to focus on touch or pen ergonomics. So why not a convertible or two-in-one MacBook? Such a Mac is never going to be an iPad, because on the iPad touch comes first and keyboard and pointer come second. On a convertible MacBook, keyboard and pointer would come first and touch would come second. It doesn’t mean there isn’t a market for a product like that.</p>\n<p><strong>ProMotion.</strong> The iPad Pro has benefited from a display with a 120Hz refresh rate for a few years now, and it’s spectacular. While making scrolling smoother might seem like a minor feature, in practice it really makes the entire interface sing. The Mac could similarly benefit from a high refresh rate, especially if the Apple Pencil is involved.</p>\n<p><strong>Cellular modem.</strong> It’s frustrating that you’ve never been able to configure a Mac laptop with a cellular modem, given that you’ve been able to do it on the iPad from the very start. I wouldn’t buy an iPad without a cellular modem at this point, in fact. Still, part of the story here is that macOS isn’t as good as it should be at being able to change its networking behavior based on what kind of connection it’s on. I expect cellular Mac laptops to finally happen—someday. But not until Apple’s making its own 5G modems, which won’t be this fall.</p>\n<p>The chances that all of these things happen in 2020, or even in 2021, are almost zero. But I really do think that we’re going to see Apple import a bunch of features from its other products that have been waiting in the wings for just this moment. The next couple of years promise to dramatically change the Mac in all sorts of ways. With macOS Big Sur we’ve gotten some clues about how the software is changing. It’s hard to imagine the hardware won’t be doing the same.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 03 Jul 2020 23:49:38 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/apple_macos-bigsur_moreapps-1.jpeg?ssl=1","linkMd5":"dc132ca6f4f55517a7186bd9891827f2","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn92@2020_3/2020/08/24/18-19-09-448_f230165654213ff7.webp","destWidth":1360,"destHeight":816,"sourceBytes":213858,"destBytes":96298,"author":"Jason Snell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/apple_macos-bigsur_moreapps-1.jpeg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn92@2020_3/2020/08/24/18-19-09-448_f230165654213ff7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144173},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"Apple, Microsoft spar over cloud gaming against antitrust backdrop ↦","link":"https://sixcolors.com/?p=12663","description":"<p>Pursuant to <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/link/2020/08/microsoft-ends-cloud-streaming-beta-for-ios-preps-android-only-launch/\">the announcement earlier this week that Microsoft would not be bringing its xCloud game streaming service to iOS</a>, the two companies have exchanged fire over where the blame lies. First, Apple lashed out, providing a statement to several outlets, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357771/apple-cloud-gaming-microsoft-xcloud-google-stadia-ios-app-store-guidelines-violations\">including The Verge</a>, confirming that xCloud violates the App Store guidelines:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  The App Store was created to be a safe and trusted place for customers to discover and download apps, and a great business opportunity for all developers. Before they go on our store, all apps are reviewed against the same set of guidelines that are intended to protect customers and provide a fair and level playing field to developers.</p>\n<p>  Our customers enjoy great apps and games from millions of developers, and gaming services can absolutely launch on the App Store as long as they follow the same set of guidelines applicable to all developers, including submitting games individually for review, and appearing in charts and search. In addition to the App Store, developers can choose to reach all iPhone and iPad users over the web through Safari and other browsers on the App Store.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>There’s a lot to unpack there, but let’s just start by noting that the requirement to vet all individual games is, let me be frank, a load of hooey. Apple doesn’t review all the titles available on Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, or any of the myriad of streaming services that have apps on the App Store. Nor does it check every book title available on the Kindle, Nook, or Kobo apps. But we’ll get back to that in a moment.</p>\n<p>Microsoft didn’t take long to shoot back, issuing its own statement to several publications, including Gizmodo:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  “Our testing period for the Project xCloud preview app for iOS has expired. Unfortunately, we do not have a path to bring our vision of cloud gaming with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate to gamers on iOS via the Apple App Store. Apple stands alone as the only general purpose platform to deny consumers from cloud gaming and game subscription services like Xbox Game Pass. And it consistently treats gaming apps differently, applying more lenient rules to non-gaming apps even when they include interactive content. All games available in the Xbox Game Pass catalog are rated for content by independent industry ratings bodies such as the ESRB and regional equivalents. We are committed to finding a path to bring cloud gaming with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate to the iOS platform. We believe that the customer should be at the heart of the gaming experience and gamers tell us they want to play, connect and share anywhere, no matter where they are. We agree.”\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>So, Microsoft has a number of good points here. First, that all of its games are already reviewed and issued content ratings by the ESRB, an industry organization that’s essentially the MPAA for games. Second, that Apple does seem to treat gaming apps differently from other streaming apps, as I noted above.</p>\n<p>This isn’t the first time recently that Microsoft—and I get it, it’s rich, <em>Microsoft</em>—has attacked Apple because of anticompetitive behavior. Ahead of the antitrust hearings in Washington last week, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-us-congress-apple-app-store-fees-104527483.html\">Microsoft had already expressed concern about Apple’s position with the App Store</a>. It’s entirely possible Microsoft knew this particular fight was brewing, but it also seems as though Redmond had already run afoul of App Store restrictions with other products, like Office.</p>\n<p>All of this boils down to things not looking great for Apple and the App Store. Cupertino has doubled down on its defenses, with Tim Cook insisting that it treats everybody the same, but the best you can say for that is that it’s an Obi-Wan Kenobi-style equivocation about it being true from a certain point of view.</p>\n<p>As Apple has become the most valuable company in the world, it’s increasingly clear that its biggest threat is itself. Throw out whatever cliché axiom you prefer—power corrupts, or the road to hell being paved with good intentions—but Apple certainly seems to increasingly have become one of those entities that will go to any lengths to protect its people, even if that means verging into the authoritarian.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Update:</strong> I no sooner hit publish on this piece than I saw <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/07/facebook-criticizes-apples-app-store-policies/\">this story</a> about Apple forcing the Facebook Gaming app to launch with no games in it, due to App Store rules. Certainly provides more ammunition for Microsoft’s argument that Apple treats games differently. Moreover, this seems to look even more transparently bad from a competitive standpoint, as Apple Arcade clearly benefits from these moves.</em></p><p><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357771/apple-cloud-gaming-microsoft-xcloud-google-stadia-ios-app-store-guidelines-violations\">Go to the linked site</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/link/2020/08/apple-microsoft-spar-over-cloud-gaming-against-antitrust-backdrop/\">Read on Six Colors</a>.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 07 Aug 2020 13:25:06 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"a5636585633443e4f12d6e19bade5ae6","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Dan Moren","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144127},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"WWDC 2020 Thursday: Giving a few pointers","link":"https://sixcolors.com/?p=11574","description":"<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/good-and-bad-pointers.jpeg?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>The arrow covers the icon you’re thinking of clicking; the iPad’s pointer slides behind the icon, so it’s clear what you’re selecting. </figcaption></figure><p>If you’ve ever wanted a longform explanation of how Apple built pointer support into iPadOS, and the challenges involved in re-inventing the pointer interface for a device that’s primarily touch oriented, <strong><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10640/\">Design for the iPadOS pointer</a></strong> is the session for you.</p>\n<p>The Mac’s arrow pointer was designed for pixel-level precision, but of course in most contexts iPad software was designed for fingertip-level precision—in other words, a lot less of it. This is why the iPad’s default pointer is a fingertip-sized circle, because that’s the level of precision that most apps expect.</p>\n<p>However, in some contexts, pixel-perfect precision can be just what is required. So the iPadOS designers focused on a pointer with “adaptive precision,” that could switch contexts (and shapes) to become more precise when necessary. The obvious example is in text editing, where the iPad’s beam cursor is extremely precise horizontally (to allow you to select exactly the characters you want, or place that insertion point right in the middle of a word), while being quite imprecise vertically (it snaps to each line of text). In a calendar app, the pointer can adapt again, snapping in 15-minute increments to indicate that by default, the app assumes calendar events don’t begin at odd times.</p>\n<p>Precision is also the reason that iPad pointers morph into shapes when they’re selecting individual buttons<sup id=\"fnref-11574-behind\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-11574-behind\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup>. This way, it’s crystal clear which button you’ve currently got selected. If you were using a more precise pointer, you might find yourself right between buttons and not know what would happen if you clicked. The iPad’s approach eliminates this as a possibility.</p>\n<p>As you move the pointer, the system is making some guesses about what target you’re trying to reach. The Magnetism feature analyzes the direction in which you pushed the cursor and finds a nearby interface element that you were most likely targeting, and snaps the cursor to it. It’s a subtle thing that makes the system intuit what the user’s intent was, even if their finger swipe across the trackpad wouldn’t normally be quite enough to get there.</p>\n<p>The session also picked up on a theme I’ve seen repeated several times this week regarding the iPad. We talk a lot about how the iPad can be used with touch, or an Apple Pencil, or a keyboard, or a pointing device. But this week we’ve been reminded, again and again, that you can also mix and match these input methods, and developers should remember that. Hold down a modifier key and tap with the Apple Pencil or your finger, and the right thing should happen.</p>\n<p>After watching the session, I have to be honest: I fully expect Apple to bring an adapted version of the iPad’s approach to pointers to macOS in a future release. Now is not the time, because there is a level of precision assumed by most macOS apps that is way beyond what’s assumed by most iPad apps. But the Mac would absolutely benefit by a more adaptive pointing system than the one it’s currently got, which (let’s be honest) is largely unchanged since 1984. Maybe next year?</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr><ol><li id=\"fn-11574-behind\">\nThe translucent shape is located <em>behind</em> the button icon, preventing the icon’s color from being distorted by a pointer overlay.

Apple financial charts, product-testing charts, and any other data-visualization I could come up with—all of it had to be generated by me, not from someone on my staff or using a template created by a talented designer.</p>\n<p>It’s made me appreciate charts, and the strengths and weaknesses of the charting engine inside Numbers. (I never use Numbers as a spreadsheet, but it’s my charting tool of choice, mostly because its charts are just… nicer.) This year I’ve been trying to make a chart every week, and I’ve mostly succeeded. I think there was only one week all year where there hasn’t been at least one chart posted to this site.</p>\n<p>Making charts by hand is labor intensive. But it gets easier if you can make the chart one time and just update the data as new numbers flow in. If that sounds like a job for user automation, you’re singing my tune—and I’m happy to report that the new app <a href=\"https://chartyios.app\">Charty</a> is built to add charting capabilities to the iOS Shortcuts app.</p>\n<p>I got to spend a little bit of time with Charty in advance of its release this week, and while bending my mind around a new set of Shortcuts actions takes a little bit of time, I eventually got the hang of it. I got the idea into my head to build a Shortcut that uses data from my weather station to chart the last week’s high and low temperatures. After a back and forth on Twitter with Charty’s developer, Rodrigo AraÃºjo, I <a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/48933c8af68e40feb8db249e57b355a2\">managed to get it done</a>:</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/charty-temps.jpg?ssl=1\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>It was a warm week.</figcaption></figure><p>(Honestly, the trickiest part of the job was generating a data file on my weather station that the shortcut could consume and use as a data source.)</p>\n<p>Charty comes with a bunch of example shortcuts that visualize health data, math functions, and more. It’s a free app, but to really use it you’ll want to unlock all the premium features with a one-time in-app purchase. (It’s $2.99 now, rising to $4.99 after this month.)</p>\n<p>I’m impressed with where Charty is starting, but as someone who has spelunked every corner of the chart formatting settings in Numbers, there’s plenty of room for more to be added. My basic temperature chart is missing labels on the bars for the temperatures, for example. I’d like to be able to apply custom fonts and sizes for labels, too. And exporting charts out of the app should be a bit more straightforward.</p>\n<p>More broadly, I wish Shortcuts was better at parsing remote data sources. This isn’t Charty’s fault, but on my Mac I can pretty easily grep through the source of a web page and pull out all the data I need. Using Shortcuts to attempt the same task made me want to pull my hair out.</p>\n<p>Still, I’m looking forward to adding <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1494386093?at=10lMbH\">Charty</a> to my set of iOS automation tools.

That year, the company announced iMessage apps and sticker packs.</p>\n<p>The first was a wide-ranging vision of what the iMessages app could become through the power of third-party applications being able to do their thing right inline with a text conversation. No longer would a user have to jump out to another app to schedule a meeting or order food or even play a game — they could do it all without leaving their conversation.&#8230;</p> <p>This story is for Six Colors members only. <strong><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/subscribe/\">Become a member</a></strong> to get access to exclusive stories, podcasts, and community..</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 05 Aug 2020 16:00:21 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pinghero.jpeg?ssl=1","linkMd5":"bc94bf84a28dea0c8f7be3a6f7ea7b6c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn88@2020_2/2020/08/24/18-19-08-830_bca27c526adac5cb.webp","destWidth":1360,"destHeight":814,"sourceBytes":82288,"destBytes":18094,"author":"Stephen Hackett","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pinghero.jpeg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn88@2020_2/2020/08/24/18-19-08-830_bca27c526adac5cb.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144167},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"(Podcast) Clockwise #357: Not Yet and Also Never","link":"https://sixcolors.com/?p=12412","description":"<p>This week on the 30-minute tech show that’s live with no audience, Dan and Mikah are joined by special guests Heather Kelly and James Thomson to discuss streaming services’ Watch Together features, how concerned we are about Big Tech personally, what we buy from online ads, and the riskiest tech in our homes, privacy wise.</p><p><a href=\"http://relay.fm/clockwise/357\">Go to the podcast page</a>.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 17:08:08 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"816902a3f34318cf681c3e48b7d0ba47","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Dan Moren","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144589},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"6C Podcast: July 3, 2020","link":"https://sixcolors.com/?p=11686","description":"<p>The long, slow side into summer betas.

(I picture the “Template Gun” as more of a hot-dog or t-shirt cannon.)</p>\n<p>The premise is that I keep a folder full of zip archives containing the Logic Pro projects and asset files for all of my podcasts. Template Gun launches, providing me a list of all my current templates, and when I pick one it’s automatically unzipped on my Desktop, ready to go to work.</p>\n<p>If you regularly find yourself building project folders (of any kind!) from scratch in the Finder, I highly recommend the concept of making yourself a zip archive you can use as a ready-made template. And if you’re got multiple templates to choose from, something like my Template Gun script sure beats leaving them all on your Desktop or fishing them out of a folder.</p>\n<p>But one of my favorite features of Template Gun is that, after it unzips the template, it does some helpful renaming of the resulting folder and files in order go get it ready for my use. Back in 2018, I wrote about how Template Gun was taking the current date, subtracting it from the launch date of my podcasts, and then using that to give my podcast files the proper episode number.</p>\n<p>This seemed logical to me at the time, but now it seems ridiculous. For two reasons:</p>\n<ul><li>Sometimes I do two podcasts in a week; sometimes I skip weeks. It’s been 493 weeks since I launched <a href=\"https://www.theincomparable.com\">The Incomparable</a>, but this weekend I’m posting episode 500. Using week offsets means you have to edit the script every time you don’t release one single episode per week.\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The part of my brain that conceives of automating tasks on my Mac is, apparently, still mired in 1995—an era where connectivity to the Internet could not be assumed. When I build Shortcuts on iOS, I constantly avail myself of web services. My scripts on the Mac are meant to be run without any network around. It’s 2020. This is stupid.</p>\n</li>\n</ul><p>Which brings me to my revelation: If there’s an Internet-based source that can tell me the current episode number of my podcast, I can just look it up there and increment by one, creating the template for the next episode. Every podcast has an RSS feed. We can do this.</p>\n<pre><code>set theFeed to (do shell script \"curl https://www.relay.fm/upgrade/feed\")\n</code></pre>\n<p>Once again, <code>do shell script</code> is the MVP of scripting on macOS, because it lets me hand off commands to helpful unix tools like <code>curl</code>, which goes and fetches the entire contents of any URL.</p>\n<pre><code>set theFeed to (characters 1 thru 2000 of theFeed) as string\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then I parse the first 2000 characters of the feed — that’s all I need, and podcast RSS feeds are big.</p>\n<pre><code>set theEpisode to item 2 of (getmatch(theFeed, \"&#60;title&#62;Upgrade ([0-9]+)\"))\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now I’m using Michael Klement’s <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/applescript-grep.txt\">helpful <code>getmatch</code> subroutine</a> to do a regular-expression search<sup id=\"fnref-4095-grep\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-4095-grep\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup> to grab the first episode number to appear in the feed.</p>\n<pre><code>set theEpisode to ((theEpisode as integer) + 1)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Increment the integer by one, and we’ve got our new episode number.</p>\n<p>The CMS we’ve built for The Incomparable generates a semicolon-delimited stats file for every podcast, so for my Incomparable podcasts I have to parse slightly differently:</p>\n<pre><code>set theResult to (do shell script \"curl https://www.theincomparable.com/vulcanhello/stats.txt\")\nset theStart to (characters 1 thru 6 of theResult) as string\nset theEpisode to (characters 1 thru ((offset of \";\" in theStart) - 1) of theStart) as string\nset episodeCount to ((theEpisode as integer) + 1)\n</code></pre>\n<p>And for podcasts that don’t have episode numbers, I fall back on dates:</p>\n<pre><code>if mychoice contains \"Six Colors\" then\nset todaysDay to day of (current date) as string\nset theMonth to month of (current date) as string\nset theYear to (year of (current date)) as string\nset theNewName to (\"sixcolors-\" &#38; theMonth &#38; \"-\" &#38; todaysDay &#38; \"-\" &#38; theYear)\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    set name of file (theDesktop &#38; \"Six Colors:sixcolors.logicx\") to (theNewName &#38; \".logicx\")\n    set name of folder (theDesktop &#38; \"Six Colors\") to theNewName\nend tell\nend if\n</code></pre>\n<p>It’s a nice touch that reduces the amount of work I need to do to prep my workspace and begin the real work at hand.

(Though Microsoft had announced the service would support the iPhone and iPad, earlier betas had only worked on Android.) I’ve spent a little bit of time with it over the past couple weeks, and though it’s not without its flaws, I’ve come away impressed at what Microsoft has put together, even in this early stage.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/xcloud-home.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"Project xCloud\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>The interface for Project xCloud is straightforward, and spartan.</figcaption></figure><p>The idea behind Project xCloud is simple: use an app on your smartphone or tablet to stream console games.

These are obviously good showcase titles for Microsoft, given that the newest game on there, <em>Halo 4</em>, is from 2012, so they aren’t as graphically intensive as games being released in 2020. But they’re not without their own inherent challenges: <em>Halo</em> is a very twitch-oriented first-person shooter series, meaning that running into problems with latency can significantly affect gameplay—especially in multiplayer.</p>\n<p>I’ve spent most of my time in the single-player campaign of the original <em>Halo</em>‘s 2011 remaster, since it’s a game I’ve played only a little, and I’ve been mostly impressed with the performance. Though there is definitely some lag at times (especially with sound effects, weirdly), I haven’t felt that it impacted my enjoyment of the game—or, perhaps I’m more forgiving, given the title’s age.</p>\n<p>I did try a little bit of <em>Halo 3</em> multiplayer, something that I spent a lot of time with in its heyday, and I acquitted myself reasonably. Though I definitely experienced some lag here and there, I didn’t feel like it hurt me more significantly than my rustiness at the game, though I did find myself cranking up the look sensitivity to make the controls feel more responsive.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/xcloud-halo1.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"Halo: Reach\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p>&#60;</p>\n<p>figcaption&#62;Graphics in games like <em>Halo: Reach</em> are passable, but not up to console standards.</p></figure><p>Graphics are a mixed bag: playing on my 10.5-inch iPad Pro, they were sometimes crystal clear, and other times—especially in outdoor scenes on <em>Halo</em>‘s eponymous ring—somewhat muddy and pixelated. Scenes that seemed less graphically demanding, such as driving through underground tunnels, were far clearer. It’s possible to chalk up some of this to my Internet connection or router, though my speed tests regularly register 100 Mbps downstream, which is far in excess of the 10Mbps connection Microsoft says is required. (I did occasionally get a notification saying my connection was weak.) Project xCloud does support cellular networks as well, but I’m not sure I’m willing to put my data plan through that as yet.</p>\n<p>Speaking of usage, Project xCloud will definitely chew through your battery—but that’s no surprise, given the demands on graphics and CPU, display, and both the Internet and Bluetooth connections. Your mileage may, of course, vary, but don’t expect this to be an all-day gaming affair—or, at least, bring a charger.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/xcloud-halo-3.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"Halo: Combat Evolved\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>The remastered version of the original *Halo* looks good, but isn’t without its glitches.</figcaption></figure><p>There’s also the challenge of playing on a much smaller screen than usual, which raises questions of viewing angles and reading onscreen text. My first attempt at playing games was with my iPhone 11 Pro and I quickly understood why Microsoft recommends <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/powera-moga-mobile-gaming-clip-for-xbox/8rtf503l2pl9\">a clip for attaching your phone to your controller</a>. Even propped up in a stand at the correct angle, getting close enough to the screen to see details like the HUD was a (often literal) pain.</p>\n<p>I fared better on my 10.5-inch iPad Pro, though even there I still had trouble at times arranging it at the right height. But using the Smart Keyboard in its “stand” arrangement wasn’t too bad for playing at my desk.</p>\n<p>Using the Xbox controller was perhaps the best part of the experience, since it required no adaptation on my part whatsoever (other than making sure <em>Halo</em> was using my preferred control scheme). Supposedly xCloud will allow developers to roll out custom touch controls for games, though on something like an FPS, it’s really hard to match the precision of a controller, as many iOS game developers have discovered over the years.</p>\n<p>That said, I did run into some issues with the controller where buttons didn’t react immediately and then sometimes “caught up,” resulting in double shots, or in some cases, turning an automatic weapon into a semi-automatic. In the original <em>Halo</em> in particular, the zoom functionality of the sniper rifle, which has both a 2x and 10x level was <em>especially</em> unreliable, requiring me to mash the button several times to get to the higher zoom.</p>\n<p>Out of curiosity, I did at one point try to mirror my iPad’s display to my Apple TV to see if I could use it as though it were a console, but the graphics and sound stuttered unplayably. (Again, it’s quite possibly that my setup may be part of the problem there.) I’ll be interested to see if Microsoft will consider porting the app to the Apple TV, or if that would hew too close to its Xbox business.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/xcloud-halo2.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"Halo: Reach\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></figure><p>I’m not sure if I want to play an entire console game via a streaming setup, but depending on how xCloud pricing and availability work out—things that Microsoft hasn’t discussed yet—it could be an attractive option for those who don’t want to invest in yet another console. And, as an Xbox owner, the ability to pick up and play where I left off on my console while I’m on the go—one of the major selling points of the Nintendo Switch—has a lot of appeal.</p>\n<p>And, obviously, Microsoft’s not alone in this streaming market: Google has already launched its own offering, Stadia, though initial reviews have not been unequivocally positive. It’ll be interesting to see how these two competitors build out their services in terms of not only the quality of streaming offered, but also the game libraries. Given Microsoft’s existing status in the game market, it may have to worry more about cutting into sales of its hardware—though I imagine that whatever is offered in Project xCloud will not come close to what will be available on its next-generation Xbox Series X console, due later this year. Then again, for those of us who want to catch up on a whole generation of games that we may have missed, streaming older titles may be just fine.</p>\n<p>But for a service that is only in beta so far, Project xCloud feels remarkably solid, if still in need of improvement. It’ll be interesting to see how that progresses throughout the beta process and into the final product.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr><ol><li id=\"fn-11032-timetravel\">\nAlso, he’d probably be wondering what the hell happened to all his hair? <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fnref-11032-timetravel\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/21a9.png\" alt=\"↩\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-11032-dualshock\">\nSupposedly Sony’s Dual Shock controller will be supported in the future as well. <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fnref-11032-dualshock\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/21a9.png\" alt=\"↩\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-11032-consolestreaming\">\nConfusingly, Microsoft also has a beta of a Console Streaming program that lets you stream games you own directly from your Xbox to a mobile device.

It’s the latest chapter in a decades-long flirtation between Apple and the machines that dwell in the server closet. Even though the Mac Pro is rack-mountable, Apple can’t quite see it as a server—<a href=\"https://twitter.com/brianstucki/status/1217136324219568128\">you can’t buy it without a mouse and keyboard</a>. Instead, the company seems content to let individual users and dedicated third parties like MacStadium do the work of taking Mac workstations and treating them like they belong in a server rack.</p>\n<p>This is a subject that’s close to my heart. I’ve only had my name on a single printed book and it was called “<a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/providing-internet-services-via-the-mac-os/oclc/34243972\">Providing Internet Services via the Mac OS</a>,” and told you everything you needed to know to turn a Mac running Classic Mac OS into a server. (Yes, that was a thing that we did back then.) From the mid-90s through the early 2000s, I had a series of Macs running classic Mac OS in my closet that acted as web, email, FTP, and database servers. Here’s to the crazy ones, I guess.</p>\n<p>Apple has always been a consumer hardware company through and through, not a company that makes servers or speaks to an audience of IT people and network managers. But that hasn’t stopped it from trying. In the ’90s, Apple would rebadge Power Macs as Apple Workgroup Servers, bundling them with extra hardware and software.</p>\n<figure class=\"pull-right\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shiner.jpeg?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>Shiner. (Not a Mac.)</figcaption></figure><p>I started covering Apple in the mid-90s, and let me tell you, that particular version of Apple was extremely weird, as epitomized by the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsVAdrdkyoA\">Apple Network Server</a>, code-named Shiner.</p>\n<p>Shiner was not a Mac. Shiner was a PowerPC-based server that cost between $11,000 and $15,000, and ran IBM’s version of UNIX known as AIX—which you needed to buy separately, for an additional $1,600. It was delayed several times, as its competitive advantage over PCs running Novell NetWare continued to dissipate. Robert Hess of MacWEEK wrote in 1995 that Apple had “missed its window of opportunity.” Reviews were positive, but tempered with a skepticism (later proven right) that Apple would actually commit to making a line of Unix-based servers.</p>\n<p>Like most mid-90s Apple products, Shiner was killed off in 1997 as Apple was gripped by its near-death experience. “I look at that as a dream when Apple was in a coma,” Steve Jobs later said, while insisting that what would come next would be entirely different.</p>\n<p>In fact,  the arrival of Jobs actually planted the seed of Apple’s next attempt to fit in a server rack: NextStep, the operating system that would evolve into Mac OS X, was based on Unix. The door was open for a Mac to be a real live Unix-based server and it took Apple almost no time to build its own server hardware.</p>\n<p>It was OS X. On a server. It was Xserve. Pronounced like the letter, not the roman numeral. No, I don’t know why. Apple did stuff like that back in 2002.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/06-xserve_front.jpeg?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The Steve Jobs and Jony Ive era of Apple was a design heyday when Apple created many interesting, clever, and influential products. The Xserve was… not that. It was most definitely the sign of a design team trying to figure out how to add some flair and creativity to a place—the server rack—that did not care one bit about either of those.</p>\n<figure class=\"pull-right\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/08-xserve_rack.jpeg?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>Xserve was designed to live in the server rack.</figcaption></figure><p>Sized specifically for server racks, it was what’s called a 1U server, meaning it was a single unit high—so 1.75 inches thick, to go with the dimensions of a 19-inch equipment rack. Those dimensions are unusually large for a Mac: 18 inches wide and 28 inches deep. This was not a pizza box. This was an extra-extra-large, party-size pizza box.</p>\n<p>Apple has frequently struggled between its instinct to create beautiful designs and designs that make its products more functional. Some of Apple’s worst design missteps have come because looks were prioritized over usability. (Feel free to think of your favorite example now. I’m imagining a round Mac Pro and an ultra-thin keyboard with no key travel.)</p>\n<p>Xserve, then, was a real design challenge. How do you take pride in creating something for a server rack, the most utilitarian of environments? I’m not here to tell you Xserve was pretty, because it wasn’t. But it’s clear Apple’s designers struggled mightily to give it a little extra something.</p>\n<p>The pretty stuff was on the front—fitting, since that’s really the only part you could see. There were shiny buttons, a FireWire 400 port, a slimline CD-ROM drive, and four hot-swappable hard drive modules. Press the front of a module and once the drive dismounted, a light appeared, indicating it was safe to remove the disk.</p>\n<p>The back side featured a standard array of ports for the time, room for ports from three expansion cards, and the notably weird PC-standard DB-9 serial port. The idea was that you could connect to the Xserve and gain command-line access via serial, even if it wasn’t on your network. It’s a choice that makes sense for a server, but it’s pretty wacky for a Mac.</p>\n<p>There was so much room inside that Xserve case that Apple designed it with two fans. The idea was that if one fan became less capable, the other fan would adjust to compensate—and if you needed to swap a fan out, you could do so without shutting the computer down.</p>\n<p>Those fans are another of the Xserve’s unusual qualities: This is undoubtedly, indisputably the loudest Mac ever made. If people thought they could tuck these in a server rack in their quiet studio space, they were wrong… those fans <em>howled</em>.

This was a 3U high 14-disk hard drive array with a design to match the Xserve.</p>\n<p>The early 2000s were an era when Apple was so excited by the prospect of Mac OS X’s Unix underpinnings that it designed a rack-mountable Mac server and a 14-disk RAID system. “We have a lot to learn, but I think we’re going to learn fast, and learn by working with some great customers,” Jobs said on the day of the Xserve’s unveiling. But by the end of the decade it was clear that this was an area best served by other companies—not Apple.</p>\n<p>Over the decades, Apple’s instinct for identifying the core of its business has been good, but there have been exceptions at the fringes. It created Aperture thinking it would take on Adobe for the high-end photography market… and then thought better of it.</p>\n<p>Xserve is a similar example. The company saw a niche market where it could make something cooler and better and more cutting edge. But every other strategic decision Apple made during that era was in the service of its core business of making personal computers. Xserve survived eight years, including the transition to Intel, but it could not have been a hard decision for Apple to discontinue it and steer people who needed Mac servers to the Mac Pro and Mac mini.</p>\n<p>Mac servers never died. They’re still all over the place, operated by people who are more comfortable with macOS than the alternatives. I’ve had a Mac mini running as a server in my house since the first one arrived on the scene. And yes, that rack-mountable Mac Pro is now available.</p>\n<p>But the Xserve will always stand alone. It was the only Mac made specifically for that equipment rack. I’d ask for us to take a moment of silence to remember it, but you wouldn’t be able to hear yourself think over the fan noise.</p>\n<figure class=\"youtube\"><p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WSS4fWf0cDU\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n</figure><p>I’ll be back next week with number 17.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 16:00:12 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shiner.jpeg?ssl=1","linkMd5":"8f70e4311223f4879466151341fd5770","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn63@2020_3/2020/08/24/18-19-10-135_fcb1c29a9694851a.webp","destWidth":680,"destHeight":731,"sourceBytes":135895,"destBytes":54308,"author":"Jason Snell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/shiner.jpeg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn63@2020_3/2020/08/24/18-19-10-135_fcb1c29a9694851a.webp","https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/06-xserve_front.jpeg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn23@2020_4/2020/08/24/18-19-17-528_6d24dcf56b7c666b.jpg","https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/08-xserve_rack.jpeg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn20@2020_1/2020/08/24/18-19-12-254_f1400cd894c6126b.jpg","https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/02-xserveraid_3q.jpeg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn86@2020_1/2020/08/24/18-19-12-348_fddb257f29b37868.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144138},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"Time for Apple to reevaluate how the App Store does business (Macworld/Dan Moren)","link":"https://sixcolors.com/?p=12536","description":"<p>If there’s a segment of Apple’s business that seems to fly in the face of the company’s philosophy—not just in terms of making a product that is substandard or lackluster—but in terms of actually being at odds with the way it otherwise does business, you couldn’t put forth a more prominent example than the App Store.</p>\n<p>The discussion, always at a constant simmer in the Apple community, bubbled up once again last week even as Apple CEO Tim Cook was grilled by lawmakers over antitrust concerns.

Are we surprised? Not really, I suppose, though it’s interesting to remember that last year’s holiday quarter was actually <em>smaller</em> than the previous year’s, which set the record. 2019 is now the champ, with $91.8 billion in revenue. Yikes.</p>\n<p>Anyway, here are a few quick observations about this quarter’s Best Quarter Ever.</p>\n<h2>The iPhone 11 is the core iPhone</h2>\n<p>If you were wondering about Apple’s strategy to make the successor to the iPhone XR the “real” iPhone 11, and rebranding the iPhone X successors as pro models, wonder no more. According to Apple, the iPhone 11 outsold the iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max every single week of the holiday quarter.</p>\n<p>That said, I’d assume that the two pro models put together outsold the iPhone 11. But it’s clear that the iPhone 11 has been a success, and it’s only right.</p>\n<p>Also, let’s give a clap to the iPhone, which returned to year-over-year revenue growth for the first time in a year. Apple says that its trade-in programs have worked wonders, including in China. and also suggests that the (U.S. only) Apple Card installment plan also has helped contribute to iPhone sales.</p>\n<p>The iPhone is never going to be the growth engine it was during the middle of the last decade, but it’s still an enormous contributor of revenue and profit to Apple, and I suspect its sales will ebb and flow as new models come and go. There are worse things for a company to have than a boring product that just keeps dumping $146 billion a year into the coffers.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/financials-2020-1-2-1.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"iPhone revenue chart\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></figure><h2>Wearables are big—and interesting</h2>\n<p>Apple’s wearables business is clearly successful and growing rapidly, as expressed in the Wearable/Home/Accessories category’s rapid growth. It was $10 billion in revenue for that category this quarter, up 37 percent from the year-ago quarter and marking 12 straight quarters of 20+% growth.</p>\n<p>Apple provided a few fun tidbits in its description of what’s going on inside the Wearable/Home/Accessories bundle. Apple Watch set a new revenue record, though Apple won’t say what that record is. Perhaps more interesting even than that, the company claimed that 75 percent of Apple Watch purchases were from people who were new to the product.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/financials-2020-1-3-1.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"Wearables revenue chart\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><p>On the <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/01/this-is-tim-apple-q1-2020-results-transcript/\">phone call with analysts and executives</a> Tuesday, Mike Olson of Piper Sandler<sup id=\"fnref-4079-sandler\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-4079-sandler\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup> asked Cook about how many of those watch buyers were really new to Apple overall. Cook’s response was that “it’s more likely that the iPhone comes first,” which is probably true—first you get an iPhone, then you branch out into the Watch. (Keep in mind, you can’t really use an Apple Watch <em>without</em> an iPhone.) And there are so many iPhone users out there that Apple could keep adding 75 percent new Watch owners every quarter for quite a while without running out of potential sales targets.</p>\n<p>But Cook did say, “There’s no doubt in my mind that there’s some people that came into the ecosystem for the Watch,” and I can see that point too. With Apple having the pre-eminent smartwatch out there, Apple probably benefits from a surprising halo effect: Someone who might not care whether their phone is iPhone or Android might buy an iPhone just because they want to get an Apple Watch.</p>\n<p>Apple Watch sales aren’t all about the Series 5, either. Cook said that Apple couldn’t make enough of the $199/$299 Apple Watch Series 3. That’s a fascinating tidbit, because it suggests that—like the iPhone SE before it—Apple underestimated the amount of demand that its customers might have for a lower-priced, entry-level product. At $199, the Apple Watch Series 3 is priced similarly to a bunch of other fitness trackers—and it seems to have found some traction there.</p>\n<p>Then there’s the AirPods and AirPods Pro, which also achieved record revenues. According to Cook, Apple couldn’t make enough AirPods Pro to meet demand—and that’s still the case, and the company doesn’t know when it will be able to. That’s the sign of a hit product (or enormous production problems, but I’ll guess the former).</p>\n<h2>The arrow points up</h2>\n<p>If you’re not an investor or Wall Street analyst you might have missed perhaps the most important news Apple broke on Tuesday. It’s not about the 2019 calendar holiday quarter, it’s about the second fiscal quarter of 2020, the one we’re living in right now. Every quarter, Apple supplies guidance about how it thinks it will perform in the next quarter. On Tuesday it said it would generate between $63 and $67 billion, a wide spread that it said was due in part to some uncertainty about what will happen with the spread of the Coronavirus in Wuhan, China.</p>\n<p>That’s great news for Wall Street. Not only did Apple beat its own guidance for this quarter, but it’s now projecting another quarter of year-over-year growth. The fiscal second quarter of 2019 was a $58 billion quarter, so Apple’s predicting growth of between 8 and 16 percent. Until this latest quarter, Apple’s year-over-year revenue growth had been pretty static for a year, measuring between a 5 percent drop and a 2 percent rise. This guidance suggests that Apple will follow up this quarter’s 9% growth with a figure that’s similar, with quite a bit of possible upside.</p>\n<p>It’s a good sign that Apple is confident about the direction its business is going in.</p>\n<h2>What’s up with the Mac and the iPad?</h2>\n<p>Mac and iPad sales were down. The Mac was down 3% and the iPad was down 11%. A little scary, but Apple put a positive spin on it, mostly saying that this quarter was a “tough compare” to the year-ago quarter, because the product mix was very different.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/financials-2020-1-1-4.png?ssl=1\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></figure><figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/financials-2020-1-1-1.png?ssl=1\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></figure><p>“Both products had a difficult year-over-year comparison due to the launches of MacBook Air, Mac Mini, and iPad Pro during the December quarter a year ago,” Maestri said. And he’s got a point. There was no major iPad release this year during that period, and that definitely made this year’s holiday quarter pale in comparison to last year’s.</p>\n<p>I do think it’s interesting that Apple pointed to the “tough compare” argument for the Mac, though. A new 16-inch MacBook Pro presumably had some impact on sales, though the Mac Pro wouldn’t have—not only did it ship at the very end of the quarter, but it’s not the kind of high-volume product that has a heavy impact on the bottom line. There was a lot of pent-up demand for the MacBook Pro, sure, but a lot of people are probably waiting and hoping for a revision to the smaller MacBook Pro model, and there was an <em>enormous</em> amount of pent-up demand for the MacBook Air last year.</p>\n<p>We’ll see whether the Mac and the iPad can turn it around when we check back in on Apple’s financial results in three months. Set your calendar alarms for April 28.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr><ol><li id=\"fn-4079-sandler\">\nOh no, did Adam Sandler kill Mr. Jaffray and steal his power? <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fnref-4079-sandler\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/21a9.png\" alt=\"↩\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></a>\n</li>\n</ol></div></figure>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 28 Jan 2020 19:10:06 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/financials-2020-1-2-1.png?ssl=1","linkMd5":"58f281c72e3fd656308ac62556b3dfc5","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn35@2020_4/2020/08/24/18-19-09-227_08cbd3a00a998937.webp","destWidth":1360,"destHeight":833,"sourceBytes":35138,"destBytes":35138,"author":"Jason Snell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/financials-2020-1-2-1.png?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn35@2020_4/2020/08/24/18-19-09-227_08cbd3a00a998937.webp","https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/financials-2020-1-3-1.png?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn71@2020_3/2020/08/24/18-19-12-175_53d28ecd8bf5dd8d.webp","https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/financials-2020-1-1-4.png?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn55@2020_5/2020/08/24/18-19-13-231_453d0f27db4bbae6.webp","https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/financials-2020-1-1-1.png?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn27@2020_2/2020/08/24/18-19-15-780_96b93c61b96ec7f5.webp","https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/21a9.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn51@2020_2/2020/08/24/18-19-11-215_25686225908fe44d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144648},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"In 2020, Apple is poised to push HomeKit forward (Macworld/Dan Moren)","link":"http://two.wordpress.test/post/2020/01/in_2020_apple_is_poised_to_push_homekit_forward/","description":"<p>Technology has made its way into every nook and cranny of our lives over the past decade, and there’s no reason to think that trend’s about to stop now.

Sticking around that long—27 years—has given me a deeper perspective on its history. I remember the Mac before OS X, before the iMac, before PowerPC, even before System 7. We go way back.</p>\n<p>With this year marking the turn of decades (in some particularly disastrous ways, as it turns out), I decided to construct a list of the 20 most notable Macs in history. Over the next 20 weeks, I’ll post essays, podcasts, and videos about each of them, counting down to number one.</p>\n<p>Now, note my choice of words there: <em>notable</em>. I’m not saying these are my favorite Macs—a bunch of them I only knew in passing and never used myself. I’m not saying these are the best Macs ever—a difficult thing to measure, since (with a few obvious exceptions) the best Macs made are the most recent ones, otherwise we’d all still be using G3 iMacs.</p>\n<p>My ranking system is, to be blunt, arbitrary. I tried to make a list of notable Macs that I felt reflected Mac history over the last 36 years. I wanted to choose Macs that were popular, revolutionary, weird, or had an interesting story to tell. If I have learned anything from Joe Posnanski’s brilliant <a href=\"https://theathletic.com/tag/the-baseball-100/\">Baseball 100 project</a>, one of the most popular things about this series will be arguments about my terrible rankings and my unforgivable omissions.</p>\n<p>To this, I can only say: My rankings may be terrible, and my omissions unforgivable, but they’re mine. Play along, make your own list, post it to the Internet, and see if everyone agrees.</p>\n<p>Or as Posnanski put it, “The point of this for me is not the ranking but the stories.”</p>\n<p>To take this walk down memory lane, I’ve read through many back issues of Macworld, MacUser, and MacWEEK, picked up a few books, and talked to some of my distinguished Mac journalism colleagues. I appreciate their contributions to the project.</p>\n<p>Beyond the arguments about list-making, I hope the results of this project will expose some Mac history that deserves to be brought back into the light while entertaining along the way.</p>\n<p>In addition to my <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/20macs\">weekly essays here at Six Colors</a>, there will be an <a href=\"https://relay.fm/20macs\">accompanying podcast</a> at Relay FM, and a video series (made in collaboration with Stephen Hackett) on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZzXBTOSdtmOz9_VMYffr4g\">the 512 Pixels YouTube channel</a>.</p>\n<p>Let’s get started.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 03 Aug 2020 15:50:36 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/20macstitle.png?ssl=1","linkMd5":"4ab8707c1802d333b6d59121107f52e1","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn87@2020_1/2020/08/24/18-19-09-405_182461b8798cc0e1.webp","destWidth":680,"destHeight":213,"sourceBytes":19980,"destBytes":19980,"author":"Jason Snell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/20macstitle.png?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn87@2020_1/2020/08/24/18-19-09-405_182461b8798cc0e1.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144141},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"Star Wars: Squadrons preps for launch ↦","link":"https://sixcolors.com/?p=11338","description":"<p>I’ve been beating the drum for a Star Wars dogfighting game in the style of the classic <em>X-Wing</em> and <em>TIE Fighter</em> games for as long as I can remember, and it looks like it may have finally paid off.</p>\n<figure class=\"youtube\"><p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/w0eRkhR1z6A\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n</figure><p>EA on Monday took the wraps off its upcoming game, <em>Star Wars: Squadrons</em>, with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0eRkhR1z6A&#38;feature=youtu.be\">a cinematic trailer</a>.

As defined by the standards of the 90s and early 2000s, these were <em>real</em> computers—boxes you could open up and swap hard drives, install RAM, stick in expansion cards, maybe even upgrade the processor itself. Time and trends and Apple’s own predilections have led us to a world, two decades later, where the only Mac that fits these criteria starts at $6,000, but back then the desktop tower was <em>the</em> Mac. The one that mattered.<sup id=\"fnref-12429-garbage\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-12429-garbage\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">3</a></sup></p>\n<p>In the summer of 2003, Apple introduced an entirely new Mac tower, one that traded the cute colorful plastic of the Power Mac G3 and the more subdued gray and silver plastic of the Power Mac G4 for a more serious industrial design, clad in aluminum. In the early 2000s, colorful computers were for consumers and monochrome computers were for <em>serious</em> computer users.<sup id=\"fnref-12429-gray\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-12429-gray\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">4</a></sup></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://everymac.com/systems/apple/powermac_g5/specs/powermac_g5_1.8.html\">Power Mac G5</a> design represented the high-end Mac tower for a decade, keeping its distinctive look outside while adapting and changing on the inside. It survived the Intel transition. The G5 design, with a front panel punched so full of holes that it was 65 percent aluminum and 35 percent air, was so logical for a computer packed full of hot, high-powered components that after a six year hiatus, Apple brought back a Mac Pro that is deeply inspired by the design of the original. Like its predecessor, the 2019 Mac Pro also looks like nothing more than a giant box grater.</p>\n<h2>An executive briefing</h2>\n<figure class=\"pull-right\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/mt.sixcolors.com/images/content/2020/power-mac-g5-cover-6c.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"power-mac-g5-cover\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The Power Mac G5 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwsn27J_tlo\">was announced at WWDC in 2003</a> as “the world’s fastest personal computer.” Steve Jobs pointed out it was also the first 64-bit processor in a desktop computer, proudly trumpeting Apple’s partnership with IBM to create the G5 processor, which was replacing the Motorola-built PowerPC G4 at the top of Apple’s product line.</p>\n<p>Apple was proud of the hardware design, so proud that I managed to score a hands-on briefing where I could walk through the design decisions with Apple execs for a cover story in Macworld. Macworld Expo in New York was coming up, so the only time we could meet was on the afternoon of July 3, the day before the long Independence Day weekend.</p>\n<p>My wife and our one-year-old daughter and I were driving down to L.A. for the weekend, so we ended up stopping at Infinite Loop on the way south. A very nice Apple P.R. person (I wish I could remember who she was!) took them to the Company Store while I went into the executive briefing center. My daughter ended up with a new Apple onesie out of the deal.</p>\n<p>The briefing was one for the books. Greg Jozwiak—who still frequently takes to the stage at Apple events—represented product marketing and Jon Rubinstein, Apple’s SVP of hardware engineering was there for the engineering side. For an hour, we stood around an opened-up G5 and walked through every little corner of that tower, as they told story after story about why particular design decisions had been made.</p>\n<p>Today, that would be a podcast interview, and maybe a YouTube video. Back then, it generated three pages of photos showing both sides of the G5 motherboard, the inside of the case, and the front and back of the computer’s exterior, complete with quotes from both of them. It was an unusual way to do that story, right down to my insistence that we quote them at length and refer to them by their nicknames, Joz and Ruby.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/mt.sixcolors.com/images/content/2020/power-mac-g5-spread-6c.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>With 17 years of hindsight, the thing that sticks out the most about the G5’s design is just how obsessed it was about moving air around. Consider the two pro Macs that bracket this design: the previous tower, the final Power Mac G4, was nicknamed the “wind tunnel” because of its loud, aggressive fan noise. The 2013 Mac Pro, on the other hand, famously failed because it couldn’t keep its components cool enough, leading Apple into a “<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2017/04/the_mac_pro_lives\">thermal corner</a>” from which it couldn’t escape.</p>\n<p>The G5 was all about moving air around intelligently and quietly. In the WWDC keynote, Steve Jobs boasts about how it’s got nine fans, but you won’t hear them because they’re all individually computer controlled. If you took off the metal door on the outside of the G5, you’d be prompted by a clear plastic <em>second</em> door, this one there to keep the entire thermal container sealed. The power supply, processors, PCI cards, and storage bay were all separate air zones, moving from front to back.</p>\n<p>Over the years, the airflow design on the inside changed as components changed, but the premise remained the same: Keep moving air through this thing so it can keep doing its job. It’s something the 2019 Mac Pro does, too. It’s a lesson learned from the Power Mac G5.</p>\n<h2>Bunny suits and betrayal</h2>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/mt.sixcolors.com/images/content/2020/DSC01932-6c.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>Photo by Stephen Hackett.</figcaption></figure><p>Don’t make Steve Jobs look like a fool. You will regret it.</p>\n<p>Given the <a href=\"https://mt.sixcolors.com/images/content/2020/steve-jobs-ibm-2-6c.jpg\">history between Jobs and IBM</a>, it’s quite a thing to consider just how much praise Jobs and Apple lavished on IBM during the launch of the Power Mac G5.</p>\n<p>The truth is, when Jobs returned to Apple he found the company in a vulnerable position when it came to Mac processors. The PowerPC chip architecture used in every Mac was a constant sore spot. It’s not quite fair to say Macs were always slower than comparable PCs running Intel processors, but they frequently were—and even when they weren’t, they often lagged behind in sheer clock speed. Try explaining to someone that a 1.5GHz Motorola G4 processor is actually faster than a 1.7 GHz Intel processor—either they won’t believe you because one number is larger than the other, or their eyes will just glaze over in boredom. (It happened on stage at Macworld Expo New York once. True story.)</p>\n<p>Here’s what I wrote back in 2003:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Anyone who’s paid attention to the competitive world of desktop computers has noticed that as PC chip makers Intel and AMD have accelerated their chips to incredibly high clock speeds, the G4 has lagged behind. Lately, even Apple seemed to stop protesting that the gap was purely mathematical and not real.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Apple ended up hitching the future of Mac chip development to IBM, its other PowerPC alliance partner. IBM had been focusing on high-end workstation processors, and that seemed like a good fit for the Power Mac line, at least. Then Apple went to work doing its marketing thing, with that IBM relationship at the center. Steve Jobs held up a polished silicon wafer and showed photos of the IBM factory in Fishkill, New York, where the G5 was being made.</p>\n<p>If anyone remembers Macworld Expo New York 2003, it’s as the last hurrah of the show in New York before it crept back to Boston to die. Jobs didn’t even appear, but there was still an Apple “opening feature presentation” (presented by Greg Joswiak) and a hefty Apple presence. I remember it differently, mostly because I was part of a group of journalists who took a field trip upstate to Fishkill to see the IBM factory. We put on white bunny suits and wandered through a series of clean rooms where robots created IBM’s cutting-edge processors, including the G5.</p>\n<p>What a world! I’d written about Apple for a decade, only to suddenly find myself in an IBM factory. It wasn’t quite Microsoft HQ, but it still felt like being in the belly of the beast. But this was a new world. IBM and its chip-making prowess was now the savior of the Mac. A big, beautiful G5 future was ahead.</p>\n<p>So, about that…</p>\n<p>In hindsight, it’s clear that Steve Jobs placed a trust in IBM that it simply didn’t merit. I have to believe Jobs thought IBM could deliver 3GHz G5 chips within 12 months. (The G5’s fastest chip at launch was a dual 2GHz model—meanwhile, Intel was already selling 3GHz chips.) It was “a guarantee the likes of which Apple had never before offered,” as I wrote back then. Jobs seemed confident, IBM seemed confident, and they sold that confidence.</p>\n<p>Apple shipped Macs with G5 processors for three years. There was <em>never</em> a 3GHz G5 chip. While there eventually was a G5 iMac, there was <em>never</em> a G5 laptop. The architecture wasn’t ever conducive to being used on mobile devices. Steve Jobs accepted an IBM projection, made a promise, hyped its relationship with IBM…and got burned.</p>\n<p>Here’s what happened next: Apple revved up a secret project to ensure that Mac OS X could compile for Intel processors. Less than two years after members of the media frolicked in bunny suits in Fishkill, Apple announced that it was dumping the PowerPC entirely and moving to Intel.  A couple of years later, Apple finally reached 3GHz with a Mac tower and it was a Mac Pro powered by an Intel Xeon processor.</p>\n<p>Also in the background, Apple had begun talking to other chip design companies about alternatives to the G5, desperately trying to find a new chip to power its laptops. One of those companies was P.A. Semi, which Apple ended up buying outright in 2008. P.A. Semi’s engineering team became Apple’s chipmaking team.</p>\n<p>This is perhaps the ultimate lesson of the entire G5 affair: Steve Jobs, and through him Apple’s larger corporate culture, was reminded that if you are reliant on a partner for a crucial portion of your business, you can’t truly control that business. Making the G5 was a side hustle of a side hustle of a company in transformation—it just wasn’t that important to IBM, but it was vitally important for Apple.</p>\n<p>Jobs and Apple learned their lesson. The acquisition of P.A. Semi led to the A series of processors that run the iPhone and iPad. They are widely considered to be superior to the processors used by Apple’s competition. And now Apple has picked up stakes once again and plans to make Macs powered by new versions of those processors.</p>\n<p>You could argue that the Power Mac G5 has IBM’s failure inscribed in its very name. But I prefer to consider the aluminum cheese-grater design as a classic that bridged the gap between IBM and Intel. It was a design too good to throw away, and after a brief blip, it’s still with us today—albeit in a modernized form with more stainless steel and weirder holes.</p>\n<figure class=\"youtube\"><p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/P_y9Fi3uGu4\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n</figure><p>I’ll be back next week with number 19.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr><ol><li id=\"fn-12429-imac\">\nBut that’s another article. <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fnref-12429-imac\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/21a9.png\" alt=\"↩\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-12429-work\">\nApple kept iterating on the iMac, and with every turn of the wheel it got better.

It’s unfair in a lot of ways, because every dollar you spend on a device does not go to the processor. Buying an iPad or iPhone won’t get you a keyboard or pointing device. Buying a MacBook Air or 13-inch MacBook Pro will get you a trackpad and keyboard, but not a <em>good</em> keyboard.</p>\n<p>Still, it can be informative.

In a preview story on the Athletic (subscription required), reporter Daniel Kaplan <a href=\"https://theathletic.com/1568723/2020/01/29/roger-goodells-annual-super-bowl-address-takes-place-as-nfl-pushes-hard-for-a-new-labor-deal-now/\">mentioned Apple prominently</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  The NFL under terms of its agreement with its existing media partners cannot currently negotiate with other firms. But it is no secret Goodell and Apple CEO Tim Cook talk. One subject they surely broached is Sunday Ticket. DirectTV has two more years left to carry the out-of-market package and then is widely expected to walk because of shifting priorities at parent AT&#38;T. The NFL has long been under pressure to open Sunday Ticket to more platforms than just satellite, and streaming it through Apple TV would solve that concern.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>For those who don’t know, NFL Sunday Ticket is a subscription offering that allows football fans in the U.S. to watch all live games that are being shown outside their local market. It’s been exclusive to satellite-TV provider DirecTV for decades, and has probably driven millions of people to sign up for DirecTV. (Me included!)</p>\n<p>While it feels less likely to me that a streaming service would bid for part of the core live TV package that currently is split between CBS, Fox, NBC, and ESPN/ABC, Sunday Ticket seems like the perfect vehicle for a streaming service to use to drive subscribers.</p>\n<p>The question is, who? Apple is a candidate, sure. But Amazon has experimented with sports programming, most notably with a package of Premier League soccer matches in the UK. And it’s a perfect fit for Disney’s ESPN+ streaming service, though Disney’s already paying the NFL a lot of money for Monday Night Football.</p>\n<p>Of course, the NFL could just sell Sunday Ticket on its own, and make a lot of money! But there’s more money to be made selling the service to someone who is willing to lose money on the deal in order to build something bigger. Apple is definitely one of the companies who fits that description.</p><p><a href=\"https://theathletic.com/1568723/2020/01/29/roger-goodells-annual-super-bowl-address-takes-place-as-nfl-pushes-hard-for-a-new-labor-deal-now/\">Go to the linked site</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/link/2020/01/does-apple-tv-have-sports-in-its-future/\">Read on Six Colors</a>.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 29 Jan 2020 15:40:11 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"99be05864cfb73e880d9037e087c43b0","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jason Snell","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144646},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"Wish List: More transparent iMessage contacts","link":"http://two.wordpress.test/post/2020/03/wish_list_more_transparent_imessage_contacts/","description":"<figure class=\"pull-right\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ios-contact-card-6c.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"ios-contact-card\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>That little ‘Recent’ tag is the only way to see which contact method you’re messaging with.</figcaption></figure><p>It was somewhere between the video of Elizabeth Warren’s dog stealing a burrito and a tweet about cheese that my wife broke it to me: “Btw, this is my work phone…”</p>\n<p>Whoops.</p>\n<p>My wife carries two iPhones, her personal one and one issued by her work, and she’s hardly alone in that situation. Naturally, I have both her personal phone and her work phone number in her contact card, and occasionally I have needed to text her on her work phone. But since she’s a government employee, I try to keep those texts to a minimum.</p>\n<p>The problem is Apple doesn’t make it easy to distinguish between those cases, especially on iOS. In creating a “seamless” messaging experience, Apple has buried deep the only way to establish which contact method you’re using (which could also be an email address). You have to tap the header in Messages, tap the Info button, tap their name, and then see which phone number or address is listed as “Recent.”</p>\n<p>This is a pain. On the Mac, you can usually check by clicking the contact name at the top and seeing which method is selected in the drop down menu, and Messages will generally at least notify you when your conversation has switched contact methods, but iOS lacks these niceties. (This is also why you sometimes end up with multiple conversations with the same person, since they may be initiated via different contact methods.)</p>\n<p>Changing the contact method on iOS is just as annoying: you need to open a new message, then make sure to choose the right number or email address from the dropdown menu. Again, on the Mac, you can usually just choose a different contact destination from the drop down menu when you click the contact’s name. (In my case, for some bizarre reason, neither of these cases showed me her personal cell phone number, instead showing only her email addresses and, on iOS, all the other group chats that she was a part of. To fix it on my iPad, I had to go into her contact record and tap Message, then select her personal phone.)</p>\n<p>All of this should be easier. I’d love the ability to select a contact number or email as the default iMessage address, and to be alerted if, for some reason, I’ve addressed a message to another address. (The way in Mail, you can configure it to alert you when you’re sending a message outside of a certain domain by highlighting the address in red.)</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/macos-imessage-switch-6c.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"macOS Messages\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>On the Mac, Messages will at least tell you when the contact method changes.</figcaption></figure><p>It would also be great if Messages on iOS provided the same level of transparency as it does on the Mac, telling me if my wife is now texting me from her work phone because her personal phone is out of battery, for example.

From the 1950s through the 1990s, the telecom company used a series of relay stations across the U.S. to transmit telephone calls, military communications, and even TV shows:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  The stations were connected via line-of-sight horn antennas which transmitted (or received) microwave signals. A call placed in one part of the country would be passed on to the next relay station, then passed on to the next, and so on until it reached the station nearest its destination.

They were prompted with 12 different Apple-related subjects, and asked to rate them on a scale from 1 to 5 and optionally provide text commentary per category. I received 65 replies, with the average results as shown below:</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/reportcard-grades-2020-6c.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></figure><p>Since I used largely the same survey as in previous years, I was able to track the change in my panel’s consensus opinion on all but one question compared to previous years. The net changes between 2018 and 2019 surveys is displayed below:</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/reportcard-changes-2020-6c.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></figure><p>Read on for category-by-category grades, trends, and commentary from the panelists.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-4084\"></span></p>\n<h2>The Mac</h2>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/19reportcardtrend-mac-6c.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Grade: B</strong> (average score: 3.6, median score 4, last year: B-)</p>\n<p>The Mac’s score rose over last year, and you’d think that our panel would have given Apple credit for introducing the 16-inch MacBook Pro with a scissor-switch keyboard. But its praise for that move was coupled with a whole lot of reservation and a sense that the job’s far from done.</p>\n<p>Charles Perry said, “Apple really rescued their 2019 with the release of the new 16-inch MacBook Pro.” David Sparks said, “I’m so happy to see a new more reliable keyboard making its way into the line with the new MacBook Pro.”</p>\n<p>Carolina Milanesi said, “They should have sorted [the keyboard] out faster and also should have been more transparent about the issue.” Christina Warren said, “This [keyboard] is a black mark Apple will not be able to easily overcome.” John Siracusa said, “We can no longer take the longterm reliability of Apple’s laptop hardware for granted.”</p>\n<p>Shahid Kamal Ahmad said, “My happiness at Apple appearing to listen to its customers was tempered by a feeling that all they’d done was lifted their boots from our faces.” John Moltz said, “You shouldn’t get much credit simply for fixing your long-term mistakes.” Andrew Laurence said, “It took far too long to fix the polarizing disaster of the butterfly keyboard.”</p>\n<p>Dr. Drang said, “It was a painful detour. I was a decidedly Mac-first person but could not bring myself to buy a new Mac laptop and began testing iPads as my most-used computer.”</p>\n<p>John Gruber said, “None of the other MacBooks have that keyboard… if you buy a MacBook Air today — the best-selling, most-popular MacBook — you are not getting a good keyboard.”</p>\n<p>After promising it in 2017, Apple shipped its all-new Mac Pro late in 2019, and some members of the panel gave the company credit for that, while others felt that it was a misfire.</p>\n<p>John Siracusa said, “The Mac Pro is a bright spot in Apple’s 2019: a long-expected party for high-end Mac users. Apple has listened to its customers that can always use more power and expandability—and are willing to pay for it.” Adam Engst said, “The Mac Pro’s industrial design is another example of how Apple can listen to its customers when it wants to.”</p>\n<p>Paul Kafasis said, “I know I’m not alone in wishing that Apple would bring back a Power Mac style desktop, with higher end components and expandability, but a more reasonable price in the $2500-$5000 range…. neglecting the ‘middle class’ is at the very least a missed opportunity.”</p>\n<p>Then there was macOS Catalina and other technologies rolled out at Apple’s 2019 developer conference, which were met with a lot of skepticism.</p>\n<p>Marco Arment said, “The hardware is much better than the software.” Rob Griffiths said, “I think the new hardware has been really good… Catalina, on the other hand, is a mess.”</p>\n<p>Charles Arthur said, “Catalina and Catalyst are really uninspiring.” Steven Troughton-Smith said, “Apple fumbled the start of their next major platform transition with Catalyst and SwiftUI with a poorly documented, barely-ready rushed debut for both technologies.” Stephen Hackett said, “Apple needs to be clearer about what it thinks the future of Mac applications should be. Mac Catalyst and SwiftUI feel like they were on separate, parallel and secret paths within the company, just to end up crossing the line into the public at the same time at WWDC 2019.”</p>\n<p>Glenn Fleishman said, “Catalina was a disastrous release.” John Siracusa said, “Apple has not done a good job communicating the benefits of Catalina, an update that… comes with more pitfalls than the average macOS update.” Joe Kissell said, “Catalina was, and continues to be, a real downer in terms of missing features, bugs, and overall quality.” Andrew Laurence said, “For the first time in my career, this IT professional warns users away from the new macOS, and took action to prevent users from installing it.”</p>\n<p>Catalina’s modified approach to security specifically came under fire.</p>\n<p>Stephen Hackett said, “I can’t help but worry about Apple’s on-going tightening of the screws when it comes to macOS and the apps that run atop my OS of choice.” Benjamin Mayo said, “Catalina’s privacy features were not fully designed and make for a pretty terrible first boot experience on updating to the new OS.”</p>\n<p>John Gruber said, “Catalina clearly bends too far in the direction of security. By design, it’s just too inconvenient… why in the world is the desktop treated as some sort of sensitive location?… There should be a single switch for expert users to toggle to effectively say ‘I trust all of the software on my Mac.’… I don’t know a single expert Mac user who is not seriously annoyed by the heavy-handed security design of Catalina… I genuinely fear for the future of the Mac as a platform for serious computer users…. Not one thing about Mac software got better in 2019 and everything that did change made it worse.”</p>\n<h2>The iPhone</h2>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/19reportcardtrend-iphone-6c.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Grade: A-</strong> (average score: 4.0, median score 4, last year: B+)</p>\n<p>It’s good to be the king, and Apple’s iPhone 11 hardware kept it riding high.</p>\n<p>Rich Mogull said, “The new models are home runs.” Dave Hamilton said, “Deep Fusion and Night Mode are truly fantastic, almost overlooked, features.” Federico Viticci said, ” the iPhone 11 Pro camera has made me fall in love with taking pictures on my iPhone all over again.” Shahid Kamal Ahmad said, “The latest model does everything with the swagger of a Bentley GT.”</p>\n<p>Marco Arment said, “iPhone hardware has never been better…. The iPhone 11 camera system isn’t just a great phone camera — it’s a great camera, period.” John Gruber said, “I love all the iPhone 11 models. I’ve been an avid hobbyist photographer for 20 years and I happily shoot over 95 percent of my photos using my iPhone.” Shawn Blanc said, “I think that they are making the right choices about what to incorporate and what to focus on: Battery life! Cameras!”</p>\n<p>Carolina Milanesi said, “The strongest portfolio yet… I particularly liked iPhone 11 being their mass market option, aimed at younger users as well as more price-conscious ones.” Casey Liss said, “I cannot overstate how impressed I am by this camera.” John Siracusa said, “The iPhone is always good, but these are <em>great</em>.”</p>\n<p>Now the bad news: iOS 13’s difficult roll-out took some the shine off of the iPhone.</p>\n<p>Glenn Fleishman called iOS 13 “a minor disaster.” Dan Provost called it “shockingly buggy.” Paul Kafasis cited an “incredibly sloppy, bug-filled roll-out.” Benjamin Mayo called it “a big fumble.” Dr. Drang called it “an embarrassment.” Sean Heber said, “I don’t think I’ve ever had to reboot my phone as often as I have this year.”</p>\n<p>Stephen Hackett said, “I’m not sure what lessons Apple needs to learn over the release, but I hope that we won’t see another cycle like this one.” Casey Liss said, “As an engineer, this smells a lot like marketing and/or management not listening to the rank-and-file engineers asking to take a breath.”</p>\n<p>Charles Arthur said, “The software has been an utter goatf—. Quite how Apple went from the stability of iOS 12 to the mess of iOS 13 should be a business study, if only someone would tell us about how it happened.”</p>\n<p>(There’s much more on iOS 13 in the Software Reliability section, below.)</p>\n<p>Finally, several panelists mentioned the idea that Apple needs to add a smaller phone to its portfolio. Philip Michaels said, “If Apple comes out with an iPhone SE successor in the next year, all will be well.” Adam Engst said, “Maybe we need to start mocking Apple’s designers as being incapable of designing a top-notch iPhone in an iPhone SE form factor.” And Paul Kafasis complained about “the continued lack of a smaller-sized top-of-the-line phones.”</p>\n<h2>The iPad</h2>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/19reportcardtrend-ipad-6c.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Grade: B+</strong> (average score: 3.9, median score 4, last year: A-)</p>\n<p>The panelists were big fans of the spread of Apple’s iPad hardware offerings, but (as with the iPhone) that enthusiasm was tainted by issues with iPad software.</p>\n<p>Josh Centers said, “The base-model iPad is a fantastic value, especially now that it supports both the Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard.” Kirk McElhearn said, “The iPad has a full range of options for everyone.”  Shahid Kamal Ahmad said, “I was pleasantly surprised by the iPad mini 5… It’s light, fast, smooth and always available.”</p>\n<p>Devindra Hardawar said, “The new iPad is a tremendous deal, it’s getting to a point where every gadget geek should own one.” Adam C. Engst said, “The iPad was the one place where Apple has managed to introduce hardware that offers entirely reasonable specs and keep the price low.”</p>\n<p>But John Siracusa wanted more: “I’m ready for an OLED screen,” he said.</p>\n<p>In 2019 Apple decided to call the variant of iOS running on the iPad “iPadOS,” which received praise from some panelists.</p>\n<p>Casey Liss said, “iPadOS is definitely a step in the right direction.” David Sparks said, “We just need Apple to keep the gas down on iPadOS improvements.” Federico Viticci said, “Time will tell whether having a separate iPadOS will pay off for iPad aficionados craving annual updates to the tablet’s OS.” Lory Gil said, “iPadOS made 2019 the year of the iPad.”</p>\n<p>Steve Troughton-Smith said, “It was so good to finally see some big ticket items that had been missing — like multiple windows, external storage support, a download manager, contextual menus, and even mouse support.”</p>\n<p>But there were a lot of tough words for the current state of the iPad software experience.</p>\n<p>Dr. Drang said, “Despite years of urging from iPad users, Apple still doesn’t seem to understand how much we want to do ‘real computer things’ on this device.”</p>\n<p>Lex Friedman said, “iPadOS still feels hacked together.” Michael E. Cohen said, “The new multi-tasking iPadOS features are welcome but seem clumsily implemented.” Dan Moren said, “The more I use it, the more I find the spots that really don’t work for me, chief among them the lackluster multitasking support.”</p>\n<p>Benjamin Mayo said, “My expectations for iPadOS were high… and I don’t think Apple quite met the hype. I fear it will be another two years before we see more changes in this department.” Alex Cox said, “The iPad hardware continues to blow me away, but the software is still disappointing.”</p>\n<p>Aleen Simms said, “Swipe gestures on iPadOS are still baffling to me. They’re undiscoverable and not intuitive.” John Moltz said, “Multitasking is still a mess.” Marco Arment said, “Multitasking remains unintuitive.”</p>\n<p>John Gruber said, “To say that I’m not a fan of iPadOS is an understatement… Getting the split-screen and Slide Over stuff to work is utterly unintuitive… It’s madness. I’m glad Apple started branding iOS and iPadOS separately. One of them is very cohesive, the other is incoherent.”</p>\n<p>Federico Viticci said, “There’s still plenty left to address – from refinements to multiwindow and the Files app to bigger questions that are looming large over the iPad’s role in Apple’s ecosystem. Will the iPad continue to be ‘just a tablet’ with an optional keyboard in its second decade? Will we see Apple move toward a more hybrid approach with features inspired by and modeled after laptops? Something else entirely?”</p>\n<p>Carolina Milanesi said, “I think the new iPad Pro models are held back by how basic the keyboard is compared to the Surface keyboard.”</p>\n<h2>Apple Watch / Wearables</h2>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/19reportcardtrend-watch-6c.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Apple Watch: <strong>Grade: A-</strong> (average score: 4.1, median score 4, last year: A)</p>\n<p>Wearables: <strong>Grade: A+</strong> (average score: 4.6, median score 5)</p>\n<p>(Since I like to maintain continuity between years, I continued to ask the panelists to rate the Apple Watch. But since Apple now tends to talk about Wearables as a category—including both Apple Watch and AirPods—I’ve decided to <em>also</em> ask about Wearables. This will allow me to compare the panelists’ views on wearables beginning with next year’s survey.)</p>\n<p>Panelists were almost entirely positive about Apple’s performance in this category.</p>\n<p>Charles Arthur said, “In wearables, Apple has really got everything working just right: it’s really firing on all cylinders, with the timing just right and the updates nicely chosen.” Federico Viticci said, “Apple has only cemented its role as the leader in the wearable revolution.”</p>\n<p>AirPods came in for almost universal praise. John Siracusa said, “AirPods are now officially a phenomenon.” Josh Centers said,  “I think it’s impressive that Apple is selling out of $250 wireless earbuds.” Dan Moren said “AirPods Pro is… the closest for me that a recent Apple product has come to capturing that indefinable ‘magic.'” Steven Aquino said, “AirPods Pro are without a doubt my favorite Apple product of the year.” Peter Cohen called them “lightning in a bottle.” Jim Dalrymple said they were “the best thing to come out of Apple in a while.” Marco Arment called them “fantastic, with a better fit for many people (like me) who AirPods didn’t fit.”</p>\n<p>Gabe Weatherhead said, “AirPods Pro is a device that redefines my expectations.” CGP Grey called them “a masterful product that, with its transparency mode, made me feel like I had the first taste of augmented reality from an unexpected place.”</p>\n<p>Christina Warren said, “AirPods Pro are an incredible upgrade in almost every single way and are a great example of quintessential Apple refinement…. Apple is at its best with its wearables.” John Gruber said they were his “favorite headphones ever.”</p>\n<p>But Rich Mogull offered a bit of warning with his praise: “I upgraded to the Pros and they are exceptional…. The only downside is the limited battery lifespan and replacement options. This is a long-term problem for Apple.”</p>\n<p>The Apple Watch also was widely praised, as you might expect.</p>\n<p>Lex Friedman said, “I love the Apple Watch Series 5 so much. My favorite feature is the time. It tells me the time, all the time.” Paul Kafasis said, “I’m not sure what more to ask for when it comes to the Watch hardware.” Dan Provost said, “The significance of the always-on display cannot be overstated.”</p>\n<p>Stephen Hackett said, “The always-on display on the Series 5 has brought me back. It fundamentally changed the way I think about the Apple Watch, for the better.” Charles Arthur said, “The new watch is terrific… The Watch has reached a solid plateau where it’s hard to figure out what else is needed.” Benjamin Mayo said, “Always-on is essentially playing the Joker. That feature alone was enough to make the Series 5 a solid product.” John Siracusa said, “The always-on Apple Watch screen is the next big leap for the product.”</p>\n<p>Carolina Milanesi said, “Apple owns the smartwatch category… Apple Watch is no accessory.”</p>\n<p>Zac Hall said, “Also important: Apple Watch Series 3 remained in the lineup from $199, matching the price of less impressive Fitbits.”</p>\n<p>Still, there were a few issues.</p>\n<p>Casey Liss said, “As the owner of a 40mm Series 5, I can say that the battery life is… lacking.”  Marco Arment said, “watchOS continues to be fine, but not great.”</p>\n<p>CGP Grey said, “Let’s not even talk about watch faces: five years on and nothing really actionable is being done with all the health data it has.”</p>\n<p>And Steve Troughton-Smith said, “Apple made it clear that SwiftUI is the only future of watchOS apps, so the developer platform is dead to me.”</p>\n<h2>Apple TV</h2>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/19reportcardtrend-appletv-6c.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Grade: D+</strong> (average score: 2.7, median score 3, last year: D+)</p>\n<p>For my money, there’s no sadder grade than the D+. The Apple TV has been living in D+ land for a couple of years, and our panelists found very little to get excited about.</p>\n<p>Sean Heber said, “I feel like Apple TV is just coasting.” Brett Terpstra said, “Most of the software updates seemed like lateral moves.” Lory Gil said, “It’s still a hobby to Apple, even though it’s much more important to me.” Adam Engst said, “Talk about an ignored technology.”</p>\n<p>Steve Troughton-Smith said, “This year was the first time the TV app was brought to my country, in preparation for Apple TV+, but what a horrendous user experience it is. The TV app on tvOS, now the default homescreen, feels like a minefield.” Gabe Weatherhead said, “I watch all TV through an Apple TV and I hate it. It’s my most used terrible device.”</p>\n<p>Marco Arment said, “The TV app changed, but is still an unintuitive, buggy mess designed like a magazine instead of usable software, fitting in nicely with the rest of tvOS.” Rich Mogull said, “The Apple TV app itself really needs a usability overhaul.”</p>\n<p>Zac Hall said, “tvOS’s long-requested multi-user feature might as well not have shipped.”</p>\n<p>Carolina Milanesi said, “It feels like people forgot about Apple TV as a hardware play and it’s really more about an Apple TV experience through different devices and apps on TV sets.” Casey Liss said, “I’m wondering what place the AppleTV has in my in-home device lineup…. So much of what the AppleTV does, my new TV can do natively.”</p>\n<p>Benjamin Mayo said, “Apple TV hardware is too expensive for what it offers in 2019… The tvOS experience is better than competing streaming sticks, but nothing is worth a 4-5x price premium.” Christina Warren said, “The competition has not just caught up to Apple, it has surpassed it.”</p>\n<p>A couple panelists thought Apple TV’s user experience brought to mind a different company with a decidedly different set of priorities. Josh Centers said, “The Apple TV app feels like something Amazon would have shipped, catering to the needs and tastes of Apple instead of the user.” Rob Griffiths said, “More and more, they feel like Amazon devices, as they’re interested in getting you to sign up for their services.”</p>\n<p>Finally, CGP Grey said, “The jellyfish screensavers are a living nightmare.”</p>\n<h2>Services</h2>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/19reportcardtrend-services-6c.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Grade: B</strong> (average score: 3.7, median score 4, last year: C+)</p>\n<p>2019 really was the year of Services, with Apple launching many new ones. Peter Cohen said, “It’s hard to imagine a more impactful year for Apple Services than 2019.”</p>\n<p>Despite a pretty uniform dislike of Apple News+, the panel dramatically raised the Services grade. Full credit to Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade, I suppose, as well as a general feeling that iCloud is far more stable than it used to be.</p>\n<p>Carolina Milanesi said, “the weakest link in the services portfolio is News+.” Glenn Fleishman called it “a damp squib.” Josh Centers called it “a dud in every possible way.” Allison Sheridan called it “bit of a yawn.”</p>\n<p>Rob Griffiths said, “Apple News+ took the best magazine app reader out there and just destroyed it.” Benjamin Mayo said, “The News+ UI is still cack-handed… the News+ content offering is uninspiring.” Zac Hall said, “Apple News+ needs a major year-two upgrade. Despite tons of minor improvements, it’s just not a good deal for anyone.”</p>\n<p>Apple TV+ reactions were mixed. Paul Kafasis said the “foray into original content is needless.” Devindra Hardawar said, “Apple TV+ is off to a rough start, but it’s nice to see that Apple is actually committed to original content.” Philip Michaels said, “I wouldn’t watch any of these Apple TV Plus shows if the actors came to my house and acted them out in my kitchen.”</p>\n<p>Steve Troughton-Smith said, “I’m all for Apple’s push into better services, and have really enjoyed Apple TV+’s launch lineup.” John Siracusa said, “Apple TV+ is the surprise of the year. It’s flagship shows are all good, with definite moments of greatness.” Benjamin Mayo said, “I think Apple TV+ had the strongest content debut that anyone could reasonably hope for.” John Gruber said, “They mostly nailed it…. the [one free year] promotion is just what the doctor ordered for a new service with a very limited library of content.”</p>\n<p>James Thomson said, “Apple Arcade is an aggressively-priced service with significantly more good games on it than I have time to play.” Benjamin Mayo said, “Apple Arcade is the opposite of News+, strong content with a solid 1.0 interface.” Josh Centers said, “Apple Arcade is probably the best of Apple’s new services, and the price is good, but the selection is still pretty limited.” Federico Viticci said, “Now they need to keep up the pace and show us why we should continue to pay for new games each month.”</p>\n<p>Apple Card got a couple of somewhat positive mentions. Dan Moren said, “Apple Card has been…fine. Not as revolutionary as could have been hoped, but also about what was expected.” John Gruber said, “I’m still wary of Apple entering the credit card business, period, but I use my Apple Card for all Apple Pay purchases.”</p>\n<p>And the panel is still complaining about a “feature” of iCloud that has been around longer than this survey: the free 5GB of iCloud storage per Apple ID. Charles Arthur said, “We’re approaching an entire DECADE where [5GB] has been the base amount, and it’s ludicrous.” Casey Liss said, “iCloud storage tiers and pricing are still insulting.” Roman Loyola said, “C’mon Apple, you can do better than a free 5GB.”</p>\n<p>Joe Kissell said, “iCloud’s free tier is still limited to a ridiculous 5GB of storage, and iCloud Drive folder sharing—something I could really use—has been delayed twice.” Michael Tsai said, “iCloud Drive did not deliver the promised new features.”</p>\n<p>But at least there’s this: Dr. Drang said, “iCloud Drive has become as reliable as Dropbox, so I will not be resubscribing to Dropbox.”</p>\n<h2>HomeKit/Home</h2>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/19reportcardtrend-homekit-6c.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Grade: C-</strong> (average score: 2.8, median score 3, last year: C-)</p>\n<p>A C-minus grade is better than a D-plus, I suppose, but it reflects the panel’s overall lack of enthusiasm for Apple’s overall smart-home efforts.</p>\n<p>Steven Troughton-Smith said, “Apple’s Home efforts seem to be coasting.” Charles Arthur said, “HomeKit seems like an utter backwater.” Rich Mogull said, “HomeKit is still… meh.”</p>\n<p>Shawn Blanc said, “Apple is so far behind in this category — it’s very frustrating.” John Gruber said, “If you haven’t even really looked into it yet, I’d say you’re not missing much.” Allison Sheridan said, “I want to love HomeKit, I truly do.  But in my mind it’s not only not progressing, it’s slipping.”</p>\n<p>Carolina Milanesi said, “I am still amazed how much Apple is struggling to develop Siri into a platform and in 2019 it felt like they have given up all together ”</p>\n<p>Marco Arment said, “The Home app is still an over-designed, form-over-function, unintuitive mess.” Gabe Weatherhead said, “I’m still baffled by the Home app.” Federico Viticci said, “The Home app continues to be affected by an awful design that makes it way more difficult than it should be to quickly manage your accessories and see the status of your home at a glance.”</p>\n<p>Stephen Hackett said, “HomeKit continues to move at a glacial pace… I tried HomeKit Secure Video, and it’s nowhere near ready.”</p>\n<p>However, Josh Centers cited Apple’s move to build a new smart-home standard with Google and Amazon as a positive: “These developments are promising for the entire field, and I’m cautiously optimistic.”</p>\n<h2>Hardware Reliability</h2>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/19reportcardtrend-hardware-6c.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Grade: B+</strong> (average score: 3.9, median score 4, last year: B+)</p>\n<p>Apple generally continues to get good marks for hardware reliability, though that butterfly keyboard…</p>\n<p>Dan Provost said, “Continue to be overall best in class. Point deducted for continuing to sell butterfly keyboards.” Christina Warren said, “The keyboard decisions for the MacBook Pro will continue to haunt Apple for many years to come.”</p>\n<p>Steven Troughton-Smith said, “With the Mac keyboard issues addressed properly, I hope things are going to trend up.” John Siracusa said, “Sorry, Apple, but the butterfly keyboard reigned for 2019 (and continues to be sold today).”</p>\n<p>Stephen Hackett said, “2020 better be the end of the butterfly keyboard.”  Casey Liss said, “Butterfly keyboards excepted, things seem to be pretty good.”</p>\n<p>James Thomson said, “The slow death of the butterfly keyboard should mean by 2021 we won’t be talking about keyboard problems any more.”  Alex Cox said, “There are still going to be butterflies flying around for far too long.” Andrew Laurence said, “The butterfly keyboard drags this entire category.”</p>\n<h2>Software quality</h2>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/19reportcardtrend-software-6c.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Grade: D+</strong> (average score: 2.7, median score 3, last year: B-)</p>\n<p>This category took an ugly swing — just as it did between 2016 and 2017. Is this what is meant by a tick-tock development cycle? One year you anger anyone, the next year you make amends. In any event, the iOS 13 and macOS Catalina release cycles… were not appreciated by the panel. If this survey measures general sentiment, the general sentiment is that Apple needs to turn around its flailing software process in 2020.</p>\n<p>CGP Grey said, “It’s been a brutally buggy year.” Sean Heber said, “It’s bad across the board.” Rene Ritchie said, “iOS 12 should be the new normal.” Andrew Laurence called it “the roughest year for new releases in quite a while.”</p>\n<p>Lory Gil said, “This year shows an example of how its better to ship late and ship right than to ship on time with the risk of a poor user experience.” John Siracusa said, “The iOS 13 launch was the roughest in recent memory, and Catalina has not been smooth either. Apple needs to regroup on software quality.” Michael Tsai said, “Catalina is the worst macOS release I can remember… Catalyst has not delivered on its promise of either quality or quantity of apps.”</p>\n<p>Paul Kafasis said, “Ooof – the fall of 2019 was a very, very rough year for Apple’s software. I truly wish they’d slow down the pace of their OS updates.” James Thomson said, “Something failed significantly in Apple’s software engineering process this year, and I hope lessons have been learned.”</p>\n<p>Casey Liss said, “Without question, Apple is having trouble walking and chewing gum at the same time… So much of Apple seems to be defined by marketing rather than by engineering. If I were on the engineering team, I’d want to pump the brakes, and do so with all my might.”</p>\n<p>Dr. Drang said, “I keep thinking Apple has overlearned the lesson of ‘The Mythical Man-Month’ and refuses to hire enough programmers to keep up with the demands of its enormous software base. From the outside, it looks as if the Apple software team just keeps running from fire to fire, an understaffed group barely able to take a breath between crises.”</p>\n<p>Steve Troughton-Smith said, “This was a rough year as a developer trying to build things on Apple’s platforms… Every year, half-working features are layered on top of half-working foundations. Apple seems to be trying to do more than ever before, but it’s just not hitting the mark in so many areas.”</p>\n<h2>Developer relations</h2>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/19reportcardtrend-developer-6c.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Grade: B-</strong> (average score: 3.4, median score 3, last year: B-)</p>\n<p>Apple’s relationship with its app developers was rocky the year this survey launched. It’s improved in the years since, but there are still plenty of issues to work out.</p>\n<p>Steve Troughton-Smith said, “I would welcome stricter regulations from governing bodies, as there have been far too many instances where Apple has killed/rejected apps, or categories of apps, for entirely selfish or emotional reasons, or acquired app developers then integrating their apps into the OS with features and APIs that third party developers aren’t allowed access and thus can never compete with…. I think Apple is overreaching way beyond its remit.”</p>\n<p>Casey Liss said, “Apple’s documentation is insultingly bad and/or non-existent. If Apple wants third party developers like myself to embrace new technologies, the answer can’t be ‘watch a WWDC video then get out a divining rod and hope for the best.’ They need to provide documentation for all of these new APIs. No excuses.”</p>\n<p>Paul Kafasis said, “Notarization [of macOS apps] has thus far worked better than I might have expected…. So long as Apple uses a very, very light touch with this, it can be a win for users and developers. Nevertheless, I live in fear of a capricious use of this to kill something legitimate that Apple simply dislikes.”</p>\n<h2>Environmental/Social/Societal impact</h2>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/19reportcardtrend-social-6c.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Grade: C+</strong> (average score: 3.3, median score 3, last year: B-)</p>\n<p>This is a weird category, in that what it’s really about has changed a lot over four surveys. Back in 2015, the category was mostly about the working conditions in Apple’s Chinese factories. It’s also been about Apple’s privacy stance, its support for green power, and the recyclability of its products. This year, it seems to have become (at least in part) about Donald Trump’s appearance alongside Tim Cook at a Texas plant that assembles the Mac Pro, and about Apple removing an app from the App Store that was being used by Hong Kong protesters—along with more broad concerns about Apple’s choice to accept the rulings of authoritarian regimes in China and Russia.</p>\n<p>It’s interesting to note that Apple’s score in this category has declined every single year the survey has been taken. This category can be an empty vessel into which the panelists can pour their sentiment about whether Apple is living up to its own lofty ideals as a corporation. It’s always fascinating to see what bubbles to the surface every year.</p>\n<p>Casey Liss said, “I was disgusted by Tim Cook’s recent dog and pony show with Trump. The amount of kowtowing that was done is incongruous with Apple’s and Tim’s stance on social and environmental issues.”<br>\nCarolina Milanesi said, “I really expect more from Tim Cook than letting himself be manipulated into an election campaign photo moment.”</p>\n<p>Stephen Hackett said, “I think Tim Cook’s proximity to the Trump Administration is hurtful to many at Apple and in the wider community. The White House is at odds with so many of the values Cook talks about and uses to shape Apple’s impact in the world.” Alex Cox said, “Tim Apple needs to stop humoring Donald Trump.”</p>\n<p>Philip Michaels said, “I hope Tim Cook likes being featured in Donald Trump re-election ads, because footage of him standing next to Trump in an Apple factory heaping praise on the economy is going to get replayed roughly a billion times between now and November. Cozying up to an authoritarian just so you could get some tariff exceptions washes out the positives you hope to gain by using recycled materials in your hardware.”</p>\n<p>John Gruber said, “It’s an absolute disgrace that Apple allowed Donald Trump to use the Mac Pro assembly plant in Austin as the backdrop for an event to promote his re-election. Trump is a liar, a crook, and his administration has proven to be a menace to everything Apple stands for: LGBT and racial equality, the environment, and privacy as a human right.”</p>\n<p>Marco Arment said, “Apple’s core environmental and political ideologies remain better than most corporations, but cooperation with the Chinese government and the Trump propaganda campaign has tarnished their reputation.” Christina Warren said, “I was personally disappointed by Apple’s decisions to bow to China a few times this year, especially in regards to the Hong Kong protests.”</p>\n<p>James Thomson said, “Apple’s reliance on authoritarian and corrupt governments has led to a number of highly questionable choices. Their continued focus on user privacy should still be commended.”</p>\n<p>Glenn Fleishman said, “Apple was moving strongly forward on privacy, human rights, and democracy, and then it appears to be giving China everything it wants even as China builds a total surveillance state at a level people in the NSA and FBI only dream of. I’d like Apple in 2020 to figure out a plan for China, even if it means exiting the entire market. Tim Cook should not be able to sleep at night while empowering a totalitarian state as it perfects permanent, total citizen control.”</p>\n<p>John Moltz said, “it was sickening to see the company attempt to continue to project its independent, customer-focused image using quotes from Martin Luther King, Jr. and a homepage marking the fall of the Berlin Wall while it removed an app that helped people in Hong Kong continue their protests in the face of a crackdown on their human rights.”</p>\n<p>Rich Mogull said, “Their position on China in particular is undermining their own support for human rights. This is something that can’t be ignored anymore…. But when you focus on human rights as a core value that should mean human rights <em>everywhere</em>. This is where Apple’s business needs are in conflict with their social stances.”</p>\n<p>Steve Troughton-Smith said, “Apple is struggling to navigate the global political landscape whilst doing the right thing… That shouldn’t take away from all the good they have done for accessibility, green energy and recycling — but it is something that rubbed me up the wrong way this year”</p>\n<p>Josh Centers said, “If Apple really cared about the environment, you could replace the battery in the AirPods.”</p>\n<p>Our panel also had thoughts about Apple’s embrace of accessibility and continued attempts to improve its diversity and inclusion.</p>\n<p>Steven Aquino said, “In terms of accessibility, Apple continues to push forward, both product-wise and in general advocacy. The introduction of ‘See’ is at the forefront of this—it is very much representative of the company’s institutional love for accessibility and the disabled community. Whatever one thinks of the show’s entertainment value, there can be no denying how revolutionary ‘See’ is in terms of disability representation in Hollywood. It is a very big deal.”</p>\n<p>Carolina Milanesi said, “I think accessibility remains a strong point for Apple. Diversity and inclusion is another area where I would like to see more rapid progress, especially in senior roles.” Aleen Simms said, “Apple is, as always, stellar at accessibility. Voice Control, introduced with iOS 13, enables people with disabilities to do more than ever before. I’m still not impressed with their diversity and inclusion statistics.”</p>\n<p>Jean MacDonald said, “I’m glad to see Apple promoting its second year of Entrepreneur Camp for companies with women founders, CEOs, and lead developers.”</p>\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n<p>I didn’t vote in the survey.

Prodded by <a href=\"https://512pixels.net\">Stephen Hackett</a>, who is apparently now the official Six Colors Chart Muse, I’ve decided to use Rob’s data to take a look at how often Apple updates macOS.</p>\n<p>In terms of total updates released during the lifespan of a major version, Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger and macOS 10.13 High Sierra share the crown with 12. However, High Sierra was only the “current” version of macOS for 385 days, while Tiger reigned for nearly three years. That means that Tiger actually was the version of macOS with the longest time between updates, at an average of one update for every 88 days of release.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/chart-macos-updates-rob-6c.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><br></figure><p>Of course, the vagaries of software release schedules and the appearance of urgent bug-fix releases can skew the numbers. But it is interesting to see that after several years at a pace of a system update every two months, the past three releases of macOS have seen updates on an average of one per month.</p>\n<p>Not that the updates come out smoothly, on a monthly cadence. Since Apple shifted to a fall release schedule in 2013 with Mavericks, October has seen by far the most releases, with ten. But over two decades of development, the updates tend to be fairly evenly spread out—with a peak in September and October.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rob-doublechart-6c.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>We know that macOS 10.15.4 is currently in beta testing, so Catalina seems to have at least one release left in it—though if Apple keeps up its current pace, we’ll see a half-dozen Catalina updates between now and the release of macOS 10.16.

One tidbit that I hadn’t heard elsewhere: Giannandrea actually drove the development of the handwriting features in iPadOS 14:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  “When I joined Apple, I was already an iPad user, and I loved the Pencil,” Giannandrea (who goes by “J.G.” to colleagues) told me. “So, I would track down the software teams and I would say, ‘Okay, where’s the machine learning team that’s working on handwriting?’ And I couldn’t find it.” It turned out the team he was looking for didn’t exist—a surprise, he said, given that machine learning is one of the best tools available for the feature today.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>There’s a lot packed in here, from Apple’s feelings about on-device processing of data to the company’s view on privacy, to even the threats—or lack thereof—of machine learning and AI. Well worth a read, as this technology becomes more and more essential to Apple devices. And, as the interview points out, with Macs about to make the jump to Apple silicon, expect even more powerful machine learning-based features in macOS going forward.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/08/apple-explains-how-it-uses-machine-learning-across-ios-and-soon-macos/\">Go to the linked site</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/link/2020/08/apples-ai-chief-on-the-critical-nature-of-machine-learning-in-the-companys-products/\">Read on Six Colors</a>.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 06 Aug 2020 13:38:48 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"e64710c409e002c3f66024b0ead5bbb3","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Dan Moren","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144128},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"Microsoft ends cloud streaming beta for iOS, preps Android-only launch ↦","link":"https://sixcolors.com/?p=12634","description":"<p>The Verge’s Tom Warren reports on the latest casualty of Apple’s App Store policies, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/15/18627110/steam-link-app-ios-apple-tv-released\">Microsoft’s forthcoming cloud gaming system</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  “Our Project xCloud preview TestFlight period has ended on iOS and we are focused on delivering cloud gaming as part of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate to Android customers beginning September 15,” says a Microsoft spokesperson in a statement to The Verge. “It’s our ambition to scale cloud gaming through Xbox Game Pass available on all devices.”\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is disappointing, to say the least. I <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/02/project_xcloud_preview_impressions_more_than_playable_less_than_perfect/\">took a look at the xCloud preview back in February</a> and found it passable, if not amazing, but I was hopeful that its continued development would see it becoming a more refined product.</p>\n<p>That seems not to be, at least in the short term. The Verge’s piece cites a number of App Store rules that may be standing in the way of xCloud’s launch on iOS and iPadOS, including the onerous restrictions on in-app purchase and limits on “remote desktop clients.”</p>\n<p>It’s worth noting that Microsoft also has a console streaming option that’s distinct from xCloud; instead of streaming games from the cloud, users can stream titles from the Xbox in their house to their mobile device. But unlike the cloud gaming system, that option never even made it to a beta test for iOS/iPadOS devices (though there are third-party options that do seem to allow it).</p>\n<p>Steam Link, Valve’s app for streaming games from PC to mobile devices, did end up available on iOS and tvOS after <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/15/18627110/steam-link-app-ios-apple-tv-released\">a year-long process</a>, so on the one hand this doesn’t bode well for Microsoft or Xbox owners—but, on the other hand, one hopes that perhaps Apple may have learned something from that process.</p>\n<p>Game streaming’s not going anywhere, and this only adds to the mounting pressure on the App Store, for which Apple most recently found itself brought before congress to answer questions about anticompetitive behavior.

Thanks for joining the call today.</p>\n<p>Before we began, I join the many millions across this country in mourning and memorializing, Congressman John Lewis, who was laid to rest earlier today. We’ve lost a hero who walked among us, a leader in the truest sense, who urged this country to aim higher and be better until the very end. I was humbled and fortunate to know him. And as an Alabama native, his example inspires me still. It now falls to every American to be a living memorial to John Lewis and to carry forward the work and the mission that defined his life.</p>\n<p>Throughout the call. I’ll speak in greater detail about Apple support for equity and justice, topics of great urgency on a number of fronts. But first I want to pull the lens back to consider the quarter in full.</p>\n<p>In an uncertain environment, Apple saw a quarter of historic results, demonstrating the important role our products play in our customers’ lives. We set a June quarter record with revenue of $59.7 billion, up 11% from a year ago. Both products and services set June quarter records and grew double digits, and revenue grew in each of our geographic segments, reflecting the broad base of this success.</p>\n<p>As always, and especially in times of real adversity, what makes us proud as a company is not merely what we did, but how we did it. As millions march for justice in big cities and small towns alike, we committed a hundred million dollars to launch Apple’s racial equity and justice initiative, as well as new and renewed internal efforts to foster diversity and inclusion at all levels of the company.</p>\n<p>As COVID-19 continues to represent great risks for individuals and great uncertainty for our communities, care and adaptability are defining how we conduct our work, wherever we work. In some places that has met responsibly reopening our operations and retail stores with enhanced health and safety precautions. In others, where the virus has re-emerged, it’s meant taking the challenging but necessary step of reclosing stores.</p>\n<p>I’ll touch on these topics more in a little bit, but first I want to offer some more context on the quarter’s results. Due to the uncertain and ongoing impacts of COVID-19, we did not provide our typical guidance when we reported our results last quarter, but we did provide some color on how we expected the June quarter to play out. I’d like to contextualize our results in terms of that color, across each of our product categories.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-12512\"></span></p>\n<p>Beginning with iPhone: Phone revenue grew 2% this quarter. In April, we expected year over year performance to worsen, but we saw better than expected demand in May and June. We attribute this increase in demand to several interactive causes, including a strong iPhone SE launch, continued economic stimulus, and potentially some benefit from shelter in place restrictions lifting around the world.</p>\n<p>We expected iPad and Mac growth to accelerate, and we saw very strong double digit growth for these devices this quarter. This remarkable performance came in spite of supply constraints on both products. We’re working hard to get more iPads and Macs into customers’ hands as quickly as possible, recognizing how integral they have become to working and learning from home, providing entertainment, and staying connected with loved ones.</p>\n<p>Wearables growth decelerated as we expected, but still grew by strong double digits and set a revenue record for a non holiday quarter. Building on powerful new features built into watchOS 7 and AirPods Pro announced this quarter, we are very excited about the many opportunities in front of us for this product category.</p>\n<p>These strong results help drive our install base of active devices to new all time records across each of our product categories. Reflecting the deep integration of hardware, software and services, Services generated a June quarter record of $13.2 billion, up 15% year over year. As we mentioned during our last call, there were two distinct trends we were seeing, and they played out as we thought. First, results for advertising and AppleCare were impacted by the reduced level of economic activity and store closures to a degree that was in line with our expectations. Second, we had strong performance in our digital services with all-time revenue records in the App Store, Apple Music, video, and cloud services, as well as elevated engagement on iMessage, Siri, and FaceTime. Customers are loving new offerings across Apple services like Apple News Today, our new daily audio briefing, and “Greyhound,” our new summer blockbuster starring Tom Hanks. In fact, Apple TV, plus just hit a history making 95 awards nominations and 25 wins and accolades. Based on these results and our performance over the last four quarters, we are proud to announce that we have achieved our goal of doubling our fiscal 2016 Services revenue six months ahead of schedule.</p>\n<p>We’re conscious of the fact that these results stand in stark relief during a time of real economic adversity for businesses large and small, and certainly for families. We do not have a zero-sum approach to prosperity, and especially in times like this, we’re focused on growing the pie, making sure our success isn’t just our success and that everything we make, build, or do is geared toward creating opportunities for others.</p>\n<p>The App Store is a great example. This quarter, a new study by independent economists at the Analysis Group found that the App Store facilitated more than half a trillion in commerce globally in 2019 alone. Especially in a time of COVID-19, you can measure economic resilience in the ways in which the app store supports remote ordering for restaurants, digital commerce for small businesses, and an enduring entrepreneurial opportunity for creators and visionaries.</p>\n<p>Keeping learning vibrant and impactful in the time of COVID-19 is a priority everyone shares. Earlier this month, we announced significant enhancements to the Develop In Swift and Everyone Can Code curricula, and we launched a new professional learning course available exclusively to educators. And just two weeks ago, our community education initiative added 10 more historically black college and university regional coding centers to our roster, bringing the total to 24 locations nationwide, 12 of which are HBCU’s, and 21 of which serve majority Black and Brown student populations.</p>\n<p>In Apple’s backyard, we announced that we’re allocating $400 million of our multi-year $2.5 billion affordable housing commitment to new housing construction, home buyer assistance programs, and support for those at greatest risk of experiencing homelessness across Silicon Valley.</p>\n<p>Apple’s results this quarter are only possible due to our people, and their ongoing ingenuity, flexibility, resilience, and determination during these ever-changing times. I want to thank our Apple care and retail teams, who have paired exceptional service during a time of intense demand, with great adaptability during a quarter where stores have reopened in some places and reclosed and others. A dedicated team of specialists and experts has shouldered the task of caring for the wellbeing of our teams and communities store by store, location by location, with evidence driven granularity and agility that is unrivaled anywhere.</p>\n<p>Innovation from adversity certainly defined this year’s Worldwide Developer’s Conference as well. This is an event where traditionally Apple’s worldwide community of developers gathers together to share, celebrate, and do big things together. Though we could not be together in person, Apple set a new standard for what online events can achieve with our celebrated all-virtual event. The results here speak for themselves: more than 22 million viewers tuned in across all of Apple’s streams. For our developers, we distributed more than 72 hours of video content. That’s three full days of video. The week saw more than 200 direct-to-video engineering and design sessions, and about 4,500 person-to-person appointments with developers across 227 virtual labs. And of course that’s even before you get to this year’s announcements, from iOS 14, which boasts a radical redesign to the home screen, powerful updates to Messages, streamlined and effortless App Clips and even greater privacy, transparency and controls, to major updates to Apple Pencil, Siri, and calling in iPadOS 14, to much anticipated sleep tracking, new fitness and wellness features and unprecedented customization and watchOS 7, to the new macOS Big Sur, boasting the biggest redesign upgrade to MacOS since OS X.</p>\n<p>No less important for Apple’s innovation roadmap is our transition to Apple Silicon for the Mac. This two-year effort will achieve both unprecedented performance for the Mac and a common architecture across all Apple products.</p>\n<p>Looking forward, we are profoundly optimistic about Apple’s future, and we recognize that with this success comes a real responsibility to lead with our values, because those values help make that success possible in the first place. We are just as proud of our announcement this month that Apple will be fully carbon neutral by 2030 across our entire supply chain, and including the energy use of every device we make, as we are of any hardware innovation—because they spring from the same instinct, to leave the world better than we found it. We’re committed to standing with those marching for their lives and dignity through our new hundred million dollar commitment to Apple’s racial equity and justice initiative. And we’re deepening our diversity and inclusion efforts internally, because our future as a business is inextricably linked with the future of our communities.</p>\n<p>There are times when things seem to move slowly. When needed progress, economic or social, seems bogged down. When the instinct to turn away from the horizon and hold on to what you’ve got feels inescapable. And then there are times like this, when people of goodwill step forward, when progress unmoors itself, when the insistence of hope forces something new. This is an immensely challenging moment. COVID-19 is still devastating many places and we have work left to do to care for the health and wellbeing of the communities in which all of us live and work. But no community of people, whether a company or a country, can afford to miss this call when it comes. At Apple, we never have, and we don’t intend to start now.</p>\n<p>With that. I’ll hand things off to Luca.</p>\n<p><strong>Luca Maestri</strong>: Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone.</p>\n<p>Our June quarter was a Testament to Apple’s ability to innovate and execute during challenging times. Our results speak to the resilience of our business and the relevance of our products and services in our customers’ lives.</p>\n<p>Total revenue was 59.7 billion, a new June quarter record, up 11% from a year ago, despite a 300 basis point headwind from foreign exchange. Our performance was strong across our entire portfolio as we grew revenue in each of our product categories and set June quarter records for Mac, for wearables and for services. Similarly, our results were very strong all around the world, with growth in all geographic segments and new June quarter records in the Americas, in Europe, in Japan, and rest of Asia Pacific.</p>\n<p>Products revenue was 46.5 billion, up 10%, and a June quarter record. iPhone returned to growth. And we saw very strong, double digit growth from iPad, Mac, and Wearables. Lockdowns and point of sale closures were widespread during April and impacted our performance, but we saw demand for all products improved significantly in May and June. As a result of our strong performance and the unmatched loyalty of our customers, our installed base of active devices reach an all time high in all of our geographic segments in all major product categories.</p>\n<p>Our services continued to grow strongly, up 15% year over year, and reached a June quarter record of 13.2 billion. We set all time records in many services categories, and June quarter records in each geographic segment. I’ll cover this in more detail later.</p>\n<p>Company gross margin was 38%. This was down 40 basis points sequentially, due to unfavorable FX of 90 basis points and a different mix of products, partially offset by cost savings and services mix. Products gross margin was 29.7%, decreasing 60 basis points sequentially, due to FX and a different mix partially offset by cost savings. Services gross margin was 67.2%, up 180 basis points sequentially mainly due to mix. Net income was 11.3 billion, and earnings per share were $2.58, up 18% and a June quarter record. Operating cash flow was also a June quarter record, at 16.3 billion, an improvement of 4.6 billion over a year ago.</p>\n<p>Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue grew 2% to 26.4 billion, with customer demand improving as the quarter progressed. COVID-19 was most impactful during the first three weeks of April, when lockdowns and point of sale closures became more widespread in many countries. We saw marked improvement around the world in May and June, which we attribute to an improved level of customer demand, helped by the very successful launch of iPhone SE and economic stimulus packages. Our active installed base of iPhones again reached an all time high as a result of the loyalty of our customer base and strength of our ecosystem. In fact, in the U.S., the latest survey of consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 98% for iPhone 11, 11 pro and 11 Pro Max combined.</p>\n<p>Turning into services. As I said, we had a June quarter record of 13.4 billion of revenue. We had all-time record performance and strong double-digit growth in the App Store, Apple Music, video, and cloud services. Our new services, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News Plus, and Apple Card are also contributing to overall services growth, and continue to add users, content and features. At the same time, customer engagement in our ecosystem continues to grow at a fast pace. The number of both transacting and paid accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all-time high during the June quarter, with paid accounts increasing double digits in each of our geographic segments. In aggregate, paid subscriptions grew more than 35 million sequentially, and we now have over 550 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, up 130 million from a year ago. With this momentum, we remain confident to reach our increased target of 600 million paid subscriptions before the end of calendar 2020.</p>\n<p>Wearables, Home and Accessories established a new June quarter record with revenue of 6.5 billion, up 17% year over year. Our Wearables business is now the size of a Fortune 140 company, and we set June quarter records in the majority of markets we track. Importantly, Apple Watch continues to extend its reach, with over 75% of the customers purchasing Apple Watch during the quarter new to the product.</p>\n<p>Next I’d like to talk about the impressive performance of Mac. Revenue was 7.1 billion, up 22% over last year and a June quarter record. We grew double digits in each geographic segment, and set all-time revenue records in Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific, as well as June quarter records in the Americas and Europe. Customer response to our new MacBook Air and MacBook Pro launches has been extremely strong.</p>\n<p>iPad performance was equally impressive, with revenue of 6.6 billion,  up 31%, and our highest June quarter revenue in eight years. Demand was strong around the world, with double digit growth in each of our geographic segments, including a June quarter record in Greater China. The launch of our new iPad Pro has been received incredibly well in every region of the world.</p>\n<p>Both Mac and iPad are extremely relevant products in the new working and learning environments, and the most recent surveys of consumers from 451 Research measured customer satisfaction at 96% for Mac and 97% for iPad. Around half of the customers purchasing Mac and iPad during the quarter were new to that product. And as a result, the active installed base for both products reached a new all time high.</p>\n<p>Our retail business had record June quarter revenue, thanks to the performance of our online store. We set records in all geographic segments and grew across all major product categories. In June, we launched Apple Card monthly installments for more products in our U S stores, allowing customers to pay for their devices over time with 0% interest. We’re very pleased with the level of customer interest this new offering has generated.</p>\n<p>In the enterprise market, we continue to see companies leverage Apple products and offerings to successfully navigate their businesses through COVID-19. In healthcare, we’re seeing rapid acceleration of tele-health to support a more flexible model of patient care. Many hospitals, such as UVA Health, Rush University Medical Center, and UC San Diego Health, are using apps on iPad and iPhone to help triage, monitor, and care for patients who are at home. This helps free up hospital capacity to support patients who need inpatient care while enabling continued care for patients who do not require in-person visits.</p>\n<p>Since many call center employees are currently working remotely, Apple Business Chat has proven an invaluable tool for staying connected with customers. This quarter, HSBC deployed Apple Business Chat in its US and UK connect centers. Apple Business Chat provides a flexible and secure channel for digital banking assistance through a native Apple experience, improving the efficiency and experience for both customers and agents. We are seeing similar adoption by hundreds of other organizations.</p>\n<p>Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with almost $194 billion in cash plus marketable securities. We issued $8.5 billion of new term debt, retired $7.4 billion of term debt, and increased short term borrowing facilities by $1.1 billion during the quarter, leaving us with total debt of $113 billion. As a result, net cash was 81 billion at the end of the quarter, and we continue on our path to reaching a net cash neutral position over time. We returned over 21 billion to shareholders during the June quarter, including 3.7 billion in dividends and equivalents and 10 billion through open market repurchases of 31.3 million Apple shares. We also began a 6 billion accelerated share repurchase program in May, resulting in the initial delivery and retirement of 15.2 million shares. And finally, we retired an additional 4.8 million shares in the final settlement of our 15th ASR.</p>\n<p>As we move ahead into the September quarter, I’d like to provide some color on what we’re seeing, which includes the types of forward looking information referred to at the beginning of the call. Similar to last quarter, given the uncertainty around the world in the near term, we will not be issuing revenue and margin guidance for the coming quarter. However, we will provide some additional insight on our expectations for the September quarter for our product categories.</p>\n<p>On iPhone, we expect to see recent performance continue for our current product lineup, including the strong customer response for iPhone SE. In addition, as you know, last year we started selling new iPhone in late September. This year, we project supply to be available a few weeks later. We expect the rest of our products categories to have strong year over year performance. For services, we expect the September quarter to have the same trends that we observed during the June quarter, except for AppleCare, where during the September quarter a year ago, we expanded our distribution significantly. As a consequence, we expect a difficult comp for AppleCare also considering the COVID related point of sale closures this year.</p>\n<p>For gross margin, keep in mind that we will have a different mix than in prior years, as I just explained. For OPEX, we expect to be between 9.8 and 9.9 billion. We expect the tax rate to be about 16 and a half percent, and OI&#38;E to be 50 million. Also today our board of directors has declared a cash dividend of 82 cents per share of common stock payable on August 13, 2020, to shareholders of record as of August 10, 2020. And finally, today we’re announcing a four for one split of Apple common stock to make our stock more accessible to a broader base of investors. Each shareholder of record at the close of business on August 24, 2020, will receive three additional shares for every outstanding share held on the record date, and trading will begin on a split-adjusted basis on August 31st, 2020.</p>\n<p>With that, that’s open the call to questions.</p>\n<p><strong>Katie Huberty, Morgan Stanley</strong>: Thank you. Good afternoon. Tim, in light of the economic adversity that you talked about in the prepared remarks, can you just walk us through how Apple’s leveraging finance and trade-in programs to make technology more affordable and accessible during this period, while also addressing the opportunity to recycle and reuse products, and maybe also extend that to how these programs might expand over time.</p>\n<p><strong>Tim</strong>: Yeah, as, Luca mentioned, in June, we actually rolled out to the overwhelming balance of our other products, the ability to do interest free financing in our stores, with payments. And that’s in addition to trade in, which has becoming more common trend now, which I think is terrific because it is great for the environment and it acts as a subsidy if you will, against the price of the new phone. And so when you compound these two things with the financing and the trade in, it makes the product super affordable. And we’re really happy with what we’re seeing in that regard.</p>\n<p><strong>Katie Huberty, Morgan Stanley</strong>: And then as a follow up, just specifically to iPhone, the category returned to growth. As you pointed out, the install base is larger today. Our math would suggest that replacement cycles in some cases are elongated. And then you have the affordability element that you just discussed. Does all of that combined to build confidence that we’re entering a longer period of iPhone revenue growth, after what’s been six quarters of decline?</p>\n<p><strong>Tim</strong>: We were very pleased with how we did on iPhone. It was better than we thought, largely because as we pointed out in the prepared remarks, May and June were much better. If you look at iPhone in totality, the things that get me very optimistic is the size of the active install base, the fact that if you look in the major geographies like the U.S. we had the top two selling smartphones in the UK, we had three of the top four. In Australia, we had five of the top six, in Japan we had the top four, urban China, iPhone 11 was the top selling smartphone in the country. And so these are some very different geographies with very different competitive situations and we’re doing fairly well. The iPhone SE, it’s also clear that from the early data we’re seeing a higher switcher number than we did in the previous year, which we feel very good about. And it also seemed to appeal to some people that were holding onto the device a little longer because they wanted a smaller form factor phone. And so the combination of the smaller form factor and an incredibly affordable price made the iPhone SE very popular. iPhone 11 is still the most popular smartphone, but iPhone SE definitely helped our results. And, as Luca said in his outlook, we do see, that continuing into this quarter currently.</p>\n<p><strong>Krish Sankar, Cowen and Company</strong>: When you look at the services business and in terms of your TV content production, have the movement restrictions impacted the content production efforts.</p>\n<p><strong>Tim</strong>: Production has been effected for AppleTV+, as I think it has for most people. We are working to get restarted. I don’t have the precise date yet when we will get restarted, but there will be some impact, because we shut down in the March timeframe and are yet to really restart in a significant way, particularly for those that are shot in the LA area, given the current status of the virus.</p>\n<p><strong>Krish Sankar, Cowen and Company</strong>: Well, Four years ago you made a big prediction that Services is going to be $60 billion by 2020. I wanted to see if you have any update to the prediction four years down the road.</p>\n<p><strong>Tim</strong>: We’re not updating today. We feel good. We want to take the moment and feel good about achieving the doubling six months early. And we do have still hanging out there, as you know, the subscription number that we’re shooting for later in the year, at 600 million. So we do have that objective out there.</p>\n<p><strong>Krish Sankar, Cowen and Company</strong>:  For Luca, with a strong from Mac, do you think the back to school season pulled in by a quarter, or do you expect the momentum to still continue?</p>\n<p><strong>Luca</strong>: As I said when I was talking about providing some commentary for the September quarter, we expect all the non iPhone product categories to have a very strong year over year performance. So we definitely, the back to school season is clearly this one and we’re very excited, not only for the Mac, but also for the iPad. We’ve got a fantastic lineup of products, and we know that these products are incredibly relevant, especially, given the current circumstances. So we expect the performance that we’ve seen for Mac in the June quarter to continue.</p>\n<p><strong>Shannon Cross</strong>: Tim, can you talk a bit about what you’re seeing in China? I know the revenue was up 2% and I think Luca talked about record iPad, but, just curious as to, given their 5G is a bit ahead how you’re seeing the market play out.</p>\n<p><strong>Tim</strong>: Yeah, Shannon, we did see growth in greater China for the quarter of 2%. Currency effected China a bit more than in other places. It effected 400 basis points. And so in constant currency, we would have grown at six. As I had mentioned before, the iPhone 11 has been our best selling phone and has been number one in Urban China. And so we’re, we’re very, very proud of that. iPad was helped in the June quarter there by the work from home and distance learning as it was in other geographies. And the Mac also grew strong double digit during the quarter, and services set a new June quarter record there. We also continue to see extremely high new customer rates on Mac and iPad there. To give you a perspective, about three out of four customers that are buying the Mac are new in China and about two out of three that are buying the iPad are new. And so these are numbers that we’re super proud of.</p>\n<p><strong>Shannon Cross</strong>:  Great. Can you talk a little bit more about the decision to bring Mac silicon in house and the benefits that you expect to see, or you’ve seen, from vertical integration of acquisitions like the Intel modem business?</p>\n<p><strong>Tim</strong>:  Yeah. I mean, what we’ll wind up with is a common architecture across all of our products, which, gives us some interesting things that we can do in products, that it sort of unleashes another round of innovation. And so I don’t want to say a lot about it other than we’re extremely excited about it. It’s something that we’ve worked on quite a while to get to this point. And we’re looking forward to shipping the first Mac with Apple Silicon later in the year.</p>\n<p><strong>Amit Daryanani, Evercore</strong>: Tim, if I think about the strength you’ve seen with iPhones right now, do you have a sense in terms of, where is this trend coming from? Is it more replacement cycles getting shorter, or are we just getting new customers into the iOS ecosystem, because these growth rates seem fairly impressive in the context of a pandemic and the upcoming refresh cycle that we have?</p>\n<p><strong>Tim</strong>:  Amit, I think it’s a combination of a strong launch with iPhone SE, and probably some pickup because of the economic stimulus that hit different countries at different points in time. And probably some of the reopening that took place across the quarter, particularly in may and June, as stores started to reopen. And so it’s a combination of all of those. And as you know, we’ve been having a strong cycle with the iPhone 11 and the 11 Pro. And so when you combine a strong cycle plus an iPhone SE launch, plus the reopening of the stores, et cetera, I think there were a lot of things that were going in the right direction there.</p>\n<p><strong>Amit Daryanani, Evercore</strong>: Perfect. That’s helpful. And then Luca, if I could just follow up with you, I’d love to get your perspective on how do we think about the overall 38% gross margins? What do you think are the levers to improve this as you go forward? Not really September quarter, but over the next one or two years. And in that context, do you see a point where the product gross margins start to stabilize, because they have been trending somewhat lower for the last couple of quarters now?</p>\n<p><strong>Luca</strong>: Yeah. Well, let me start with what we seen during the June quarter. We were at 38%, we were down slightly sequentially, but up the same amount on a year over year basis. And really the big negative impact that we’ve felt for several quarters now has been the strength of the U.S. Dollar. So the foreign exchange impact on a sequential basis was 90 basis points, on a year over year basis was 130 basis points. So obviously that is something to keep in mind. And then the other aspect, I think it’s always important to keep in mind, Amit, is that we sell many different products, they have different margin profiles, and so sometimes a different mix can have an impact on the aggregate level of products gross margins, and we’ve been very pleased to see the performance of Mac, iPad and Wearables. But you know, obviously it’s a different mix.</p>\n<p>Going forward. The variables are always the same. Foreign exchange will continue to play an impact. The mix of products that we’re going to be selling will have an impact as well. The commodities market has been relatively benign, and we’ll see how that plays out over time. As you know, now for several years, we’ve been managing gross margin, I would say fairly well, in spite of some difficult situations, like the one with the strength of the dollar, and we plan to continue to make good trade off decisions between revenue and units and margins.</p>\n<p><strong>Kyle McNealy, Jefferies</strong>: Our team in Asia recently, we did some survey work on smartphones in China. It showed that there’s still a high proportion of the installed base that’s on 6, 7, 8 devices. I know you’ve talked about the trade-in programs and promotions that you’ve been doing there. I wonder if you can tell us whether there’s anything else that You’re doing to get these customers into your latest technology? What might those customers be looking for? And how should we think about when an upgrade cycle might come on more strongly there in China?</p>\n<p><strong>Tim</strong>: Customers upgrade at a different pace. And I don’t have in front of me, the exact installed base data from China, but much like in other geographies, the upgrades have extended some. It extended some during the the depths, if you will, of the pandemic in China and the rest of the world, and probably to some degree is happening still at this point. The key things that we can do is keep innovating, deliver a product that people can’t imagine going through life without, and obviously keep rolling out these programs that make the front end purchase be much less. And this is things like the financing and the trade in programs that you mentioned. And I, I do feel like those are going quite good in a number of geographies.</p>\n<p><strong>Kyle McNealy, Jefferies</strong>:  Congrats again on the strong iPad and Mac results, that’s really impressive. I guess the obvious question is, should we ever think about how much of that might be pulled forward and what might it do to future upgrades in the next two years? Anything else you can share on how you think about growth from here or whether there’s a hangover period, maybe after the back of school season or holiday season, that would be helpful.</p>\n<p><strong>Tim</strong>: The installed base is growing and the new customer numbers that Luca went over in the aggregate are still very high, in the close to 50% kind of range. And so that to me bodes well for the future. There’s clearly, as we had indicated, there’s some amount of work from home and remote learning that do effect the results of Mac and iPad positively. They probably effect wearables and iPhone the other direction. But on Mac and iPad, these are productivity tools that people are using to stay engaged with their work or stay engaged with their schoolwork. And we believe we’re going to have a strong back to school season. Sitting here today, it certainly looks like that.</p>\n<p><strong>Ben Bollin, Cleveland Research</strong>: Tim, I was hoping you could share a little bit about where you think channel inventory is. You talked about the tightness you saw exiting the June quarter for Mac and iPad. Interested where you think inventory is across the major product categories.</p>\n<p><strong>Tim</strong>: You know, we’ve gotten away from talking about channel inventories, but to give you a perspective, sitting here looking at it, on iPhone the inventory is slightly less than it was a year ago. And I’m saying that at a quarter end point, so at the end of Q3, and obviously, iPad and Mac are constrained. And so both of those are less than they were in the year ago quarter.</p>\n<p><strong>Ben Bollin, Cleveland Research</strong>: Luca, I’m interested, any color you could share about the impact COVID had on OpEx in the quarter? You know, work from home stipends, less travel, other employee support costs, and also how the company is thinking about the longer term opportunity as employees working remotely maybe more permanently, and any consideration in how that can influence future OpEx.</p>\n<p><strong>Luca</strong>: The OPEX front, there have been obviously certain things that have been effected in terms of cost reductions. Obviously travel is a perfect example. You know, the number of meetings that we have internally, some of those costs have been reduced. We’ve also invested heavily in initiatives, for example, we’re really trying to help during a very difficult circumstance. For example, we have had a program where we match our employee donations. We made donations directly as a company around the world to many institutions and governments. On a net basis, I would say probably the costs have outweighed the savings, both during the March and the June quarter. But we think it’s absolutely the right thing to do. From an employee perspective, what we’ve said so far is that here in the United States, the majority of our population will continue to work from home until the end of the year. And then we’ll see.</p>\n<p>I mean, we’ve taken an approach that, you know, we try to understand how the virus is evolving over time. We’ve taken a very cautious approach both with our corporate facilities and with our retail stores. I think what you’ve seen with retail stores is that we have re-reopened in a number of geographies around the world. We reopened here in the United States. We’ve had to re-close some of the stores here in the United States, as the number of cases has gone up, and we will continue to track how the virus is doing. And hopefully at some point we’re going to get to a point where there is a vaccine or there is a cure. And so we’ll make those decisions as we get more information.</p>\n<p><strong>Jeriel Ong, Deutsche Bank</strong>: I’d like to focus on the gross margin expansion within the Services line. All time record for the quarter. I’m just curious whether you think that will sustain. I understand within Services is a pretty wide range of gross margins by business. And I’m wondering if that should continue to improve.</p>\n<p><strong>Luca</strong>: As you’ve seen, obviously we’ve had a sequential expansion in gross margin for services. And that was driven primarily by mix. As you said, we have a very broad portfolio. And depending on which one of the services does better will have an impact on services gross margins. We like the services business because it’s a recurring type of revenue. And the margins are accretive to company margin. We did over 67% this quarter. But we want to offer very competitive services across the board, and I think I’m going to make the same comments that I’ve made on products. What matters to us is to be successful with everything that we do and provide great products and services to our customers. So the relative success of our products and services in the marketplace will drive to a certain extent what our margins are. The margins are a byproduct of our success in the marketplace.</p>\n<p><strong>Jeriel Ong, Deutsche Bank</strong>: I want to ask a question on the Wearables segment. It seems to me that you’re categorizing the wearables business as maybe being a little bit impacted from pandemic, similar to the iPhone. And it’s the first time that Wearables hasn’t materially upsided in at least a while in recent memory. I guess the drivers of wearables being predominantly Watch and AirPods, what are your thoughts going forward on whether there’s a little bit of pent up demand perhaps that might resume as we get back to a more normalized environment?</p>\n<p><strong>Tim</strong>: I think on the Watch in particular is, like the iPhone, more effected by store closures, because some people want to try on the Watch and see what it looks like, look at different band choices, and those sorts of things. And so I think as stores closed, it puts more pressure on that. We did come out sort of the way we told you last quarter we were going to come out from the color that we gave you. So we knew things would decelerate because of the closures. So we wound up being very pleased with how we did. But the store closures definitely effect the wearables and the iPhone.</p>\n<p><strong>Jim Suva, Citigroup</strong>: I have two questions. Tim, the coronavirus, your company has done a fantastic job at overcoming all the hurdles. So congratulations to you. As you look forward, say to the Christmas holiday shopping season, and given the economic challenges around the world, coronavirus, and your product launche and things like that. Can you give any commentary, maybe how this Christmas you’re looking forward to seeing maybe some past cycles of Christmas of a lineup, because it just seems like it’s a little bit different, but Apple is really showing a lot more strength coming into this Christmas than maybe some of the past years. And then for Luca, I think you made a quick comment, you mentioned something about a few weeks later, was that for like iPhone, iPhone chips or product launches, or maybe expound upon that? I know things are more difficult, but I didn’t quite catch the commentary that was in your prepared comments about a few weeks late that’s just a quick little blunt.</p>\n<p><strong>Tim</strong>: Yeah. We take it one quarter at a time. And so we’ll give you a color on the December quarter in October. Generally speaking, I think we need to see a vaccine or a therapeutic or both, and, you know, there’s some optimism around that in that particular timeframe. And so we’ll see, I don’t have any information that isn’t publicly available there. But I think that would boost consumer confidence quite a bit if it began to happen. And I think that any kind of consumer style company would benefit from that.</p>\n<p><strong>Luca</strong>: And Jim, on the iPhone, I said in my remarks that a year ago, we launched the new iPhone in late September. So Iit was referring to new product. And I said that this year, the supply of the new product will be a few weeks later than that.</p>\n<p><strong>Wamsi Mohan, Bank of America</strong>: I was wondering if you can maybe comment on the penetration of Apple Card users in the iOS installed base, and have you seen any change in the buying behavior of Apple Card users in terms of accelerating spend on more Apple products and services?</p>\n<p><strong>Tim</strong>: We saw changes in consumer spending, as the shutdowns occurred and as store closures occurred, we could see that across the card. It effected the categories that you would guess the most like travel and entertainment, et cetera. But overall, if you sort of pull the lens out on the Apple Card, we’re very happy with the number of people that have an Apple Card. We believe based on what we’ve heard, that it’s the fastest rollout in the history of credit cards. And so we feel very good about that.</p>\n<p><strong>Wamsi Mohan, Bank of America</strong>: And as a followup, now that Apple has Apple silicon for Macs, would you ever consider monetizing this as a merchant silicon vendor, or is this going to be forever for Apple use?</p>\n<p><strong>Tim</strong>: Well, I don’t want to make a forever comment, but we’re a product company and we love making the whole thing because we can own the user experience in that way, and with a goal of delighting the user. And that’s the reason that we’re doing the Apple silicon, is because we can envision some products that we can achieve with Apple silicon that we couldn’t achieve otherwise. And so that’s how we look at it.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 21:32:08 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/tim-sept9-victory-bleed.jpg?resize=1024%2C610&ssl=1","linkMd5":"11a438750f252b67194b71318081384d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn68@2020_4/2020/08/24/18-19-07-836_9a579966b7f1703d.webp","destWidth":1024,"destHeight":610,"sourceBytes":21426,"destBytes":21426,"author":"Jason Snell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/tim-sept9-victory-bleed.jpg?resize=1024%2C610&ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn68@2020_4/2020/08/24/18-19-07-836_9a579966b7f1703d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144612},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"Going digital draws Gary Larson back to ‘The Far Side’ ↦","link":"https://sixcolors.com/?p=11786","description":"<p>Legendary cartoonist Gary Larson is back, and it’s all due to <a href=\"https://www.thefarside.com/new-stuff\">digital drawing tools and a clogged pen</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Despite my retirement, I still had intermittent connections to cartooning, including my wife’s and my personal Christmas card.

Is it Command-Control-P-R or Command-Option-P-R that zaps the PRAM? Is that still even a thing? Is it Command-S for Recovery Mode—or wait, that’s Single User Mode, it’s Command-R for Recovery mode, Command-T for Target Disk Mode, Option to choose a startup disk.</p>\n<p>With the advent of Macs running Apple-designed processors, things will get a whole lot simpler. As described Wednesday in the WWDC session <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10686/\">Explore the New System Architecture of Apple Silicon Macs</a>, these new Macs will only require you to remember a single button: Power. (On laptops, that’ll be the Touch ID button. On desktops, presumably it’s the physical power button.)</p>\n<p>Holding down that button at startup will bring up an entirely new macOS Recovery options screen. From here you’ll be able to fix a broken Mac boot drive, alter security settings, share your Mac’s disk with another computer, choose a startup disk, and pretty much everything else you used to have to remember keyboard shortcuts to do.</p>\n<p>Now that Apple is holding all the cards, the company has built a new boot process, based on iOS’s existing secure boot process, but modified to support those features that Mac users expect, such as different macOS boot drives, multiple versions of the operating system, and macOS Recovery itself.</p>\n<p>On these new Macs, Target Disk Mode will be retired in favor of Mac Sharing Mode. Rather than turning your Mac into a disk, the new Mac Sharing Mode will turn your Mac into an SMB file server. As with most of the features of Mac Recovery, you’ll need to authenticate yourself before turning on Mac Sharing Mode.</p>\n<p>These Macs will also have a little more granularity when it comes to boot security. Each startup volume can be set to a different security mode, either full security (which is the default) or reduced security. This means that external disks will be able to be booted from without downgrading security.</p>\n<p>In reduced security mode, you can boot any supported version of macOS, even if Apple’s no longer signing it. And if an app or accessory you rely on uses a third-party kernel extension to enable functionality, you’ll need to use this mode.</p>\n<p>For a while now, Macs have been able to recover from disasters by booting to the hidden System Recovery partition. When even that partition is gone, Intel Macs fall back to Internet Recovery.

The company will likely release the accessory alongside the next version of the iPad Pro expected later this year, the person added.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Ever since <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/offsite/2020/02/why-is-apple-rolling-out-new-os-features-in-february/\">iOS betas added new keyboard features</a> last month, it has seemed clear that Apple has been readying a new keyboard accessory for the iPad. It’s not clear exactly what form that product will take. This report suggests it might be an even more radical change from the existing Smart Keyboard design that’s more or less survived intact since the fall of 2015.</p>\n<p>I’m excited. For a long time I’ve been an <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/offsite/2020/01/why-the-ipad-needs-to-embrace-mice-and-trackpads/\">advocate for iPad keyboards and pointing devices</a>, and this potential product would offer a way for Apple to differentiate the iPad Pro from its increasingly capable lower-end iPads.</p>\n<p>But I’ve got a lot of questions, too.</p>\n<p><strong>Is this replacing the Smart Keyboard, or priced above it?</strong> Let’s assume that this new keyboard accessory will only work on the new iPad Pro models that are rumored to be announced in late March. Would Apple continue to offer the current Smart Keyboard for those models, and offer this as a higher-priced, higher-functionality option? It all depends on the specs of this product. If it’s more expensive, thicker, and heavier, it will be a turn-off for some users who like the current Smart Keyboard. Then again, it would be very Apple-like to offer only a single style of keyboard.</p>\n<p><strong>What does it mean to have included pointer support?</strong> The Information’s report says “built-in trackpad,” which would imply a keyboard that’s pushed forward with a trackpad underneath in a wrist-rest area. The problem is that the current iPad keyboard doesn’t have a wrist-rest area at all. This would require a pretty dramatic re-think of the Smart Keyboard, in order to create space for a trackpad to live. (More on the geometry issues below.) In the past, Apple has filed for patents for touch sensors sitting atop a keyboard. I can imagine a keyboard that would work like a trackpad when you put two fingers down and moved them around, as you do today on the iPad’s software keyboard. (I’ve got no idea if that technology exists, but it’s a fun idea.)</p>\n<p><strong>What does a trackpad do to iPad geometry?</strong> If you’ve got a larger Smart Keyboard with keys and a trackpad, how does the Smart Keyboard fold? Microsoft’s Surface tablets feature keyboard covers that are the exact size of their device’s corresponding screen—providing plenty of room for a trackpad. But there’s no laptop-style hinge on those covers, which forced Microsoft to build a kickstand flap into the back of the Surface. Kickstands are bad. They add complexity to the hardware design, are more awkward to set up, and feel terrible if you try to use them in your lap. What are Apple’s alternatives? Adding a hinge (a la the Brydge keyboards) requires weight for balance, which makes the keyboard quite heavy. Up to now, Apple has gotten away with clever folding systems that keep the iPad upright. I hope it’s got another one up its sleeve.</p>\n<p><strong>What kind of keyboard is it?</strong> I know this isn’t exactly about the trackpad, but as long as I’m mentioning weight issues, it’s worth pondering whether Apple will stick with the fabric-based design of the Smart Keyboard (which I quite like!), or if it will change to something that feels a bit more like a traditional laptop keyboard with individual keys.</p>\n<p><strong>Is this trackpad for Assistive Touch?</strong> The current way to drive a cursor via an external pointing device is by turning on Assistive Touch within Accessibility settings. The Assistive Touch cursor is a virtual finger that works, but <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/01/brydge-pro/\">feels severely lacking compared to Mac pointers</a>. Unless Apple’s been hiding a major iPadOS update that makes cursor support vastly better, it’s hard to imagine Apple trying to sell people on an accessory that requires turning on an accessibility feature that’s not really up to its own standards.</p>\n<p><strong>What if the trackpad controlled the text cursor?</strong> There <em>is</em> another cursor embedded in iOS, and it’s been there for a few years now—the I-Beam cursor used for text editing. Maybe this accessory’s trackpad will be sold (at least initially) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bzamayo/status/1233158879665672196\">as a text-editing utility</a>. My great complaint about Assistive Touch is that it <em>doesn’t</em> drive that text-editing cursor, which would be a massive productivity boost for me as someone who writes an awful lot on iPad. What if Apple sold the new accessory as a trackpad to aid in text editing, with Assistive Touch continuing to be off by default? That might work.</p>\n<p><strong>What about iPadOS 14?</strong> If an iPad Pro with a pointing-device accessory ships this spring, it opens an awful lot of possibilities for iPadOS 14 this summer and fall. I have a hard time believing that Apple would sell a pointing device for iPad and not make a major effort to improve the user experience in iPadOS 14—and replace Assistive Touch with a more expansive feature that’s on by default when a pointing device is connected. (That would benefit users of Bluetooth-based trackpads and mice, too.)</p>\n<p><strong>Will there be multitouch gestures?</strong> When I tried the Brydge iPad keyboard with trackpad, the feature I missed the most were all the gestures I’ve internalized on my Magic Trackpad. Using an iPad would be improved if you could optionally scroll documents with two fingers, swipe sideways with three fingers to switch apps, or even invoke multitasking or return to the home screen via a four-finger swipe. The more Magic Trackpad features Apple can bring to the iPad, the better.</p>\n<p><strong>Will people complain about how the iPad isn’t a laptop and doesn’t need a trackpad, or a keyboard, or a stylus?</strong> I’m just kidding. There will always be people who will complain when the subject of iPad keyboards and pointing devices comes up. Apple’s original Keyboard Dock for iPad in 2010 didn’t stop them. The arrival of the Smart Keyboard and Apple Pencil in 2015 didn’t stop them. Why should 2020 be any different?</p>\n<p>That said, I think most of us would agree that the iPad is, at its core, a tablet device—and that using a keyboard or pointing device or stylus should be an additional option, not a requirement. I can’t see Apple changing that, ever.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 28 Feb 2020 00:11:35 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/brydgeproplus-white.jpg?ssl=1","linkMd5":"ee96c7402c82bedf66390c11a8036837","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn15@2020_1/2020/08/24/18-19-09-689_de197b06d100a4e9.webp","destWidth":1360,"destHeight":1238,"sourceBytes":56712,"destBytes":56712,"author":"Jason Snell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/brydgeproplus-white.jpg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn15@2020_1/2020/08/24/18-19-09-689_de197b06d100a4e9.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144616},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"Bloomberg: Apple ARM transition aiming for 2021 ↦","link":"http://two.wordpress.test/post/2020/04/bloomberg_apple_arm_transition_aiming_for_2021/","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-23/apple-aims-to-sell-macs-with-its-own-chips-starting-in-2021\">Lengthy report from Mark Gurman, Debby Wu, and Ian King at Bloomberg</a> about the timeline for Macs with Apple-designed chips:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  The Cupertino, California-based technology giant is working on three of its own Mac processors, known as systems-on-a-chip, based on the A14 processor in the next iPhone. The first of these will be much faster than the processors in the iPhone and iPad, the people said.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>So, no surprises here in that we’ve been talking about an ARM transition for a couple years now. What is new is that we’re getting to the point where specifics are being bandied about: that these new processors will be based on the A14, that they’ll use a 5nm production technique, and that they’ll feature a combination of eight high-performance cores and “at least” four energy-efficient cores. Bloomberg even reports on the project’s codename, “Kalamata.”</p>\n<p>This all sounds good, and bodes well for future Mac performance and, hopefully, power efficiency. But it’s not without its challenges, the most significant of which right now is probably the current world environment: as the story points out, the situation with employees working from home and disruptions to the supply chain could push this back further.</p>\n<p>Again, if the company is planning such a transition for next year, it will want to give developers some lead time to figure this out.

It turns out that the WWDC time warp even happens when all of us are at our homes. Anyway, I watched a bunch more WWDC sessions today, and here are some observations from today’s binge. (Side note: Did Apple provide hairstylists for all of their presenters? Lucky ducks.)</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10205/\">Design With iOS Pickers, Menus and Actions</a></strong></p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/pickers-menus-wwdc20.jpeg?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>The old look (left) makes way for the newer, more compact menu (right).</figcaption></figure><p>In iOS and iPadOS 14, Apple is rethinking some of its previous design decisions—and in doing so, it’s introducing interface elements that might seem a bit more familiar to Mac users. This is, at least in part, because a lot of those decisions were made when iPhones were really small—and they’re not anymore.</p>\n<p>So Apple’s rolling out drop-down menus that appear next to where you tapped to bring them up (often a round button with three ellipsis dots inside), rather than sliding up a modal list at the bottom of the screen. That way, your finger doesn’t have to move as far to finish the thought and complete an action. These menus behave very much like Mac menus do: if you tap and hold, and slide your finger, then lifting your finger will select an item. If you tap and lift your finger, the menu remains open until you tap on an item within the menu. Tapping outside of the menu dismisses it. The menu items themselves are also a lot more compact than the old slide-up options were, and feature not just text, but icons.</p>\n<p>These menus can also be used to ask the user for more specific information. For example, the plus icon in Photos means to add something, obviously—but if you tap on it, you’ll be asked specifically <em>what</em> you want to add, in the form of a menu. When you tap to add an image in notes, a menu appears so you can choose exactly what kind of image you want to add. They can also be used for navigation: In Safari, tapping and hold the back button will reveal a list of previously browsed pages, and in iOS 14 this uses the new menu design.</p>\n<p>One of Apple’s big goals is to reduce the density of elements on the visible part of the app interface by hiding those items—generally actions that must be offered but aren’t important enough to be displayed prominently—in a menu hidden behind one of those white three-dot more buttons.</p>\n<p>Speaking of design decisions that haven’t worn that well, you won’t have the iOS spinning date and time picker to kick around anymore—or at least not nearly as much as you have up until now. The wheels have been replaced by new pickers that display a calendar with a month worth of dates. Tap to select a different month or year, and yes, the wheels will reappear—until you choose the new month and year, at which point the month view will return. Entering a time doesn’t require you to spin your wheels at all—you just type it in.</p>\n<p>Finally, rejoice at the sight of the first unified color picker for iOS. You can choose a few different color-picking methods, sample images right from elsewhere on your device’s screen, and save colors to a palette that is consistent across all apps on your device.</p>\n<p>Of course, iOS apps will need to be updated to take advantages of these new features. Users should expect to see them begin to appear when iOS 14 ships this fall.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10686/\">Explore the New System Architecture of Apple Silicon Macs</a></strong></p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/apple-silicon-cores.jpeg?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>Apple silicon: Fast-truck (performance) cores and slow-truck (efficiency) cores.</figcaption></figure><p>I covered a lot of this interesting session about what Macs will look like when they’re running Apple-designed processors <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/06/macs-with-apple-silicon-will-get-new-refined-boot-and-recovery-mode/\">in an earlier piece</a>, but the session was so jam-packed that I focused on the new boot system and left the rest of it on the cutting room floor.</p>\n<p>Among the additional benefits of switching to an Apple-designed System on a Chip (SoC) is a unified memory architecture, shared across the CPU and the GPU. This means that graphics resources can be shared without any overhead—there’s no need to copy anything across the PCIe bus, because the CPU and GPU are pulling from the same memory. The SoC also picks up a bunch of other features that have been around on iPad and iPhone for a while, but will be new to the Mac: dedicated video encoding and decoding<sup id=\"fnref-11563-xeon\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-11563-xeon\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup>, and support for fast machine-learning via the Neural Engine.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest changes in the new Mac architecture, though, is asymmetric multiprocessing, or AMP. Mac software developers will need to set a “quality of service” property for the work that they’re dispatching to the processors, suggesting how that work should be prioritized. Does it need to be done as fast as possible, or is it okay to slow it down and keep things power efficient? Modern Apple-designed processors have separate performance-focused and efficiency-focused cores, so different cores will be better for different jobs.</p>\n<p>The session provided a bit more detail about how Rosetta, the technology that translates code meant for Intel processors into instructions that Apple’s processors will understand, works. When you download an Intel-only app from the Mac App Store or install it using Apple’s Installer utility, Rosetta will automatically be triggered and will do the work up front of translating the app’s code. If the app gets on your system by a different means, the translation happens when you first launch the app—which means it’ll launch slowly the first time.  (Also, operating-system updates can affect Rosetta, so Rosetta’s translations will be refreshed when the operating system is updated.)</p>\n<p>And just as Macs with T2 processors have all had always-on encryption of their disks, so too will Macs with Apple-designed processors. But there is one added security bonus: secure hibernation. When one of these Macs goes into a deep sleep, all the contents of memory—not just disk—are protected.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10652/\">Meet the New Photos Picker</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10641/\">Handle the Limited Photos Library in Your App</a></strong></p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photos-library.jpeg?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>The Radar mascot, Anika the Aardvark, makes a cameo.</figcaption></figure><p>Some apps are nosy. We all know it. No matter what App Store rules exist, no matter how many scandals emerge from apps abusing user data, there are still places where your personal information can leak out and an unscrupulous app can do something with it without us knowing.</p>\n<p>Apple knows it, too, and it keeps tightening the screws where it can. This year it’s making a big move when it comes to access to your photo library. The new Photos Picker interface is meant to be used by most apps who need you to pick a photo or three from your library for use within the app. It runs in an entire separate process, and the app requesting can’t see anything about your photo library. While you’re in the photo picker, you can select multiple photos and even search your library. When you’ve selected what you want, then <em>those</em> items are passed to the app—and nothing more. A sneaky app can’t even take a screen shot of the contents of that picker and use that later. Sneaky.</p>\n<p>If an app really does need access to the photo library, there’s a new set of permissions for that. Apple’s introducing a new “limited mode.” When an app asks a user for permission to read the photo library, you can choose full access or a limited mode—where you pick the photos you want to share, and that’s it. Those photos are all the app can see, until you go to the security settings and make a change.</p>\n<p>Or as the presenter in one of these sessions put it to developers, “Consider if your app even needs library access.” The fact is, most apps don’t. The new photos picker is functional enough to do the job—and keep an app from being able to snoop on every single item in your library.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10006/\">Introducing Car Keys</a></strong></p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/carkey.jpeg?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>Just a small example of the delicate, invisible dance that makes Car Key work.</figcaption></figure><p>It’s only a matter of time before our phones replace car keys. Given the pace in automotive innovation and the rate at which I replace my cars, it will probably be a while for me—but I’ll be happy when it finally happens.</p>\n<p>With its announcement of Car Keys, Apple is now on the path—that leads to a parking lot where you can unlock your car with an iPhone. This WWDC session was directed at auto manufacturers, but I found it pretty interesting in terms of some details of how Car Key works.</p>\n<p>First off, it’s meant to be a radio-technology-agnostic technology. The first cars to use this tech, as announced, will use the same NFC technology you find in Apple Pay. This requires you to get very close to the reader—essentially, you’ll need to tap your phone on the door to open it. The NFC implementation actually requires two separate NFC readers—one to unlock the door, and one to start the car. The car will only start when a phone containing CarKey is laying on the NFC reader in the dash.</p>\n<p>Things get more interesting with the second wave of Car Key tech, which uses <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2019/09/the-u1-chip-in-the-iphone-11-is-the-beginning-of-an-ultra-wideband-revolution/\">Ultra Wideband</a> and the U1 chip introduced in the iPhone 11. Ultra Wideband will be the best possible solution for using your phone as a car key, because its precise positioning capability and solid range will allow you to use it with your iPhone in a bag or pocket. The current Car Connectivity Consortium standard, version 2.0, covers NFC—which is why it’ll be first. But version 3.0 is on the horizon, and it’s the one that brings in the extra flexibility of Ultra Wideband.</p>\n<p>Behind the scenes, CarKey works through a complex series of cryptographic transactions that authenticate your ownership of the car, allow the iPhone to securely pair with your car, and then allow you as the owner to distribute keys to other people. The initial setup requires Internet connectivity to the back-end systems of the car dealer and to Apple, but once a key is set up on your phone, no connectivity is required and Apple has no awareness of how you use your key—it’s all stored in the iPhone’s Secure Element, locked up tight. (And it works even if your phone runs out of battery, because it works with the trace amount of power left in the battery in Power Reserve mode.)</p>\n<p>To share a key with a friend, you use Messages to send them a pass. From the perspective of the people making the key exchange, it’s a simple transaction. Behind the scenes, however, the two phones are doing a careful cryptographic dance that ends up with the friend’s phone having both a key and an “attestation”—basically a signed document that indicates the owner of the car vouches for them as a valid user of the car. If you lose your phone and put it in “lost mode”, the keys are suspended temporarily, and you can revoke a key from your iPhone or from the car’s own interface.</p>\n<p>Depending on the implementation by the car maker, keys can potentially be limited. For example, you could let your kids drive the car, but not exceed a certain speed. But that’s all on a per-car basis, and many cars probably won’t provide that level of granularity.</p>\n<p>Car Keys are stored in the Wallet app, and since they’re part of Apple’s enhanced contactless protocol (the same one used on some transit systems), you don’t need to authenticate to use them. Tap, and it works. (This also means that while your automaker may want you to download their app, it won’t actually be necessary for Car Key—all the important data is in Wallet.)</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10171/\">What’s New in watchOS Design</a></strong></p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/watch-design.jpeg?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>Tap on this button (which feels awfully nostalgic, for some reason) on the Apple Watch to see more options.</figcaption></figure><p>This is turning into the cycle of sweeping out old design notions that Apple’s now regretting. For Apple Watch, it’s the entire concept of Force Touch—pressing down <em>hard</em> on the watch in order to generate a contextual menu. Apple has decided that it’s too hidden a gesture to be of much use—and presumably also engineered the next Apple Watch to eliminate the feature in order to save space, just as it did with the iPhone 11 series.</p>\n<p>So it’s out with Force Touch and in with more hierarchical navigation elements at the top of the screen, buttons at the top and bottom of menus, and swipe actions (where you swipe on an element to reveal a delete button, for example)—common on the iPhone and iPad, less so up until now on the Apple Watch.  You’ll also see more floating buttons, indicating that you can tap to see more options.</p>\n<p>It seems like after five years, Apple is ready to throw a bunch of Apple Watch interface assumptions in the bin and double down on the ones that actually work.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr><ol><li id=\"fn-11563-xeon\">\nI believe the iMac Pro and Mac Pro are already using this feature via their Apple-designed T2 chips, because Intel’s Xeon chips lack some built-in video encode/decode features. <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fnref-11563-xeon\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/21a9.png\" alt=\"↩\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></a>\n</li>\n</ol></div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 25 Jun 2020 04:44:55 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/pickers-menus-wwdc20.jpeg?ssl=1","linkMd5":"df69e4f76f4a57cd8dd6167f98d0df1d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn71@2020_4/2020/08/24/18-19-09-266_00f7839346959d6c.webp","destWidth":1360,"destHeight":775,"sourceBytes":91157,"destBytes":36352,"author":"Jason Snell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/pickers-menus-wwdc20.jpeg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn71@2020_4/2020/08/24/18-19-09-266_00f7839346959d6c.webp","https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/apple-silicon-cores.jpeg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn47@2020_4/2020/08/24/18-19-16-048_39f496f9a36f8033.webp","https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photos-library.jpeg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn75@2020_2/2020/08/24/18-19-15-644_b168e66296cd95cd.webp","https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/carkey.jpeg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn43@2020_1/2020/08/24/18-19-17-278_2b1626759882c9e2.webp","https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/watch-design.jpeg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn43@2020_5/2020/08/24/18-19-17-675_d1fb7af54e9237e3.webp","https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/21a9.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn51@2020_2/2020/08/24/18-19-11-215_25686225908fe44d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144203},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"(Podcast) #333: Throwing the Spaghetti at the Consumer","link":"http://two.wordpress.test/post/2020/02/333_throwing_the_spaghetti_at_the_consumer/","description":"<p>This week on the 30 minute tech show that’s like a wizard, Dan and Mikah are joined by special guests Brianna Wu and Shahid Kamal Ahmad to discuss Samsung’s latest flip phone, security tips for elections and ordinary people, high refresh rate phones, and the challenge online learning brings to traditional universities.</p><p><a href=\"http://relay.fm/clockwise/333\">Go to the podcast page</a>.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 12 Feb 2020 10:23:14 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"a79cb4690268ac3e97c0397c0e34dbef","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Dan Moren","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144630},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"6C Podcast: July 31, 2020","link":"https://sixcolors.com/?p=12530","description":"<p>Reading the tea leaves from Apple’s financial results.

That’s what Apple’s new App Clips feature, introduced this week and expected to ship with iOS 14, is supposed to solve. A couple of summers ago, I spent five minutes trying to download, install, and configure a parking app while standing on a sidewalk in Salt Lake City. It was frustrating. Apple’s vision is that, someday soon, I’ll be able to tap my iPhone on top of that parking meter and be on my way.</p>\n<p>So in our great App Clip future, I’ll be standing in front of a parking meter, or sitting at a table in a restaurant, or standing outside a cafe, and there will be something for my phone to scan, whether it’s a QR code to photograph or an NFC sticker to tap or a fancy, circular new App Clip Code designed by Apple that’s both a QR code and an NFC sticker.</p>\n<p>The act of scanning that code or tapping that NFC tag results in my iPhone opening a URL which refers it to a specific item in the App Store—a miniature app built out of a tiny part of a larger app, called an App Clip. For developers, there’s no magic to this—they have to make a smaller version of their app that’s designed for a very simple, straightforward interaction. Imagine a Starbucks app that can only place an order, or a parking app that’s only designed to let you pay at your current location.</p>\n<p>When I scan that App Clip enabled item, a card (which developers build inside the App Store Connect website) slides up on my iPhone screen, showing me that there’s an App Clip available. An App Clip can’t exist on its own—it’s the child of a parent app that’s in the App Store. (If you have already installed the parent app, your iPhone won’t load the App Clip at all—it will just open the parent app. And if you install the parent app, it removes the App Clip and takes over its data.) Tap Open (or Play or View, depending on the App Clip) and the mini-app opens.</p>\n<p>The point of App Clips is to be fast and easy. They install on the fly, and they’re less than 10MB in size, so they should install quickly. And this is where a couple other Apple technologies, Apple Pay and Sign In With Apple, can make a big difference. If you still need to laboriously enter in a credit card and generate and validate a new account, it’ll still take forever. But if the parking meter I’m standing in front of supports Apple Pay, and lets me create a new account with one tap via Sign In With Apple, I can load the App Clip, log in, and pay for parking in a matter of seconds. That’s the dream, anyway.</p>\n<p>App Clips seem like they’re best when they’re as specific as possible. A chain of restaurants could make an App Clip that knows which specific restaurant you’re near, and automatically select it. A cafe could place an App Clip Code on each tabletop, and the App Clip would know what table to deliver the order to. And food-ordering apps can create custom-branded App Clips for individual restaurants, so that instead of going to your local ice-cream shop and seeing a generic Yelp App Clip, you’d see a Woody’s Yogurt Barn App Clip with a “powered by Yelp” subtitle.</p>\n<p>Beyond using App Clips when you’re at a location, Apple says that App Clips can be attached to physical location data, allowing them to appear in Apple Maps. This would allow someone to tap an item in Maps, open an App Clip, and place an order for pick-up. App Clips can also show up automatically via Siri Suggestions, so if you’re outside your local Starbucks and it’s your usual afternoon hot cocoa hour, an App Clip may present itself entirely based on context.</p>\n<p>Beyond the physical world, Apple hopes that App Clips will drive people out of webpages and into apps. One example given in a WWDC session this week is of an online store that offers an App Clip as a part of a Smart App Banner in Safari. You’d visit the site, tap on the resulting App Clip, and be transferred immediately from browsing via the web to via the App Clip. Obviously Apple is motivated to get you out of the browser and into an App, but it might also be the right move for businesses and users alike.</p>\n<p>So will it work? Apple has laid the groundwork, but it’s up to app developers and businesses to take advantage of it. Google introduced something similar for Android a few years ago, and the world remained unmoved. Then again, sometimes Apple’s enthusiastic presence is all it takes for a category to take off. Even if it does, though, it might take a while. Still, the next time I’m in an unfamiliar city trying to figure out how to pay for parking, I’ll be grateful if I can take care of it quickly with just an App Clip.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 25 Jun 2020 02:10:26 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/app-clip-quick-code.jpg?ssl=1","linkMd5":"3af6d91a6ab4ab719391c5554ba9bbbe","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn55@2020_5/2020/08/24/18-19-07-663_773503c19af27e1e.webp","destWidth":1360,"destHeight":760,"sourceBytes":36896,"destBytes":36896,"author":"Jason Snell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/app-clip-quick-code.jpg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn55@2020_5/2020/08/24/18-19-07-663_773503c19af27e1e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144203},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"For once, the Mac and iPad lead Apple’s record financial results (Macworld/Jason Snell)","link":"https://sixcolors.com/?p=12526","description":"<p>One of these quarters, Apple’s going to announce financial results that don’t result in some sort of record.

The premise was: “Let’s engineer a Mac that’s like the one on your desk, but put it in a single package with screen, keyboard, pointing device, and battery.” My first laptop was a PowerBook 160 and it did everything my old Mac SE did (and much, much more).</p>\n<p>The PowerBook Duo was different. It wasn’t trying to be the Mac on your desk. <span id=\"more-12646\"></span> Introduced in 1992,<sup id=\"fnref-12646-160\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-12646-160\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup> it was the MacBook Air or one-port MacBook of its time—all compromise in a quest to be as thin and light as possible. If you wanted the absolutely smallest, lightest Mac laptop you could find, you got a PowerBook Duo and dealt with the weirdness.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/hackett-duo-air-buddies.jpeg?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>Separated at birth? The PowerBook Duo was the MacBook Air of its day, prioritizing thinness and lightness over “required” features.</figcaption></figure><p>How small and how light? By today’s standards <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2897715/the-new-macbook-is-cool-but-the-powerbook-duo-was-cooler.html\">the PowerBook Duo was laughably large</a>, but 1992 was a different time. My first PowerBook weighed seven pounds; the first PowerBook Duo weighed four. It  was also 1.4 inches thick—more than an inch thinner than my PowerBook.</p>\n<p>But it wasn’t a complete Mac. It had a shrunken-down keyboard and trackball, and only a single standard port. (Sound familiar, MacBook fans?) There was no support for floppy drives, external hard drives or monitors. For all of that stuff, you needed to connect it to a docking station.</p>\n<p>Today we don’t flinch at the idea of a computer without a built-in floppy drive, but back in the mid-90s, floppies were the currency of the realm. <em>Even six years later,</em> people screamed bloody murder when the original iMac was released lacking a floppy drive. The Duo? Nope. (If you needed access to floppies, you’d need to buy an external disk drive.)</p>\n<p>It also didn’t have a headphone jack! This one seems completely bananas now—I can’t imagine working on a laptop out in public without plugging in headphones. But back then, we didn’t really play music on our computers—this was the Walkman era—so Apple got away with shaving that port off.</p>\n<p>The only standard port on the Duo, hiding behind a little door that you could rotate and turn into a foot to help angle the keyboard perfectly for carpal tunnel syndrome<sup id=\"fnref-12646-rsi\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-12646-rsi\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">2</a></sup>, was a single Mac serial port. That wasn’t nothing, because you could use it to connect to a modem (if you didn’t pay for the optional internal modem) or a printer or even a very slow local-area network via LocalTalk. But, that was it.</p>\n<p>And this is where the PowerBook Duo got…interesting. It remains the only Mac to be built with an Apple docking station in mind. Apple sold two of them, and third-party vendors filled in the gaps with all sorts of other contraptions, all connected via the Duo’s most important (and most nonstandard) port, the 156-pin <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor_Direct_Slot\">Processor Direct Slot</a>.</p>\n<p>When I say “Mac docking station,” you probably can imagine what I’m talking about. When I was a full-time PowerBook and MacBook user, I used a bunch of third-party ones—you’d connect your monitor, speakers, hard drive, and other stuff to a plastic frame and then slide your laptop into it to make the connections and hopefully not ruin the ports on the back or sides.</p>\n<p>And yes, the Duo had those kinds of docks. It was the original Dongletown. Apple’s <a href=\"https://everymac.com/systems/apple/powerbook_duo/specs/mac_powerbook_duo_minidock.html\">Duo MiniDock</a> clipped on the back and added a modem jack, audio-in and audio-out plugs, a SCSI port, two serial ports, video out, ADB for keyboards and mice, a floppy-disk port, and an AC adapter. (If that seemed like too much, there was also a Duo Floppy Adapter, that added a floppy-disk port <em>and</em> an ADB port.)</p>\n<p>But docking stations like that are kind of boring. What you wanted to do, if you were John Sculley-era Apple, was to create a big, bold docking station that could transform that tiny PowerBook Duo into a full-fledged desktop Mac. You wanted to create the <a href=\"https://everymac.com/systems/apple/powerbook_duo/specs/mac_powerbook_duodock.html\">Duo Dock</a>, the accessory that makes the PowerBook Duo more significant than it would be if it were just Apple’s first attempt to make a tiny laptop.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/hackett-duodock.jpeg?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>The Duo Dock (with Duo inside). The two-tone color scheme matched PowerBook and monitor alike.</figcaption></figure><p>Here’s what MacUser’s Russell Ito wrote in his launch story:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Let’s get one thing clear: This thing looks weird. We’re not talking technology or functionality, mind you, just aesthetics. From its two-tone finish (platinum on top, granite on the bottom—according to Apple, the top will match your monitor, and the bottom, your PowerBook), to its partially melted-looking lid, to its strange cylindrical feet sticking out the sides, this is easily the most visually “unusual” computer Apple has produced since the Lisa.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>I prefer to think of the Duo Dock as a front-loading VCR that takes laptops instead of videocassettes<sup id=\"fnref-12646-vcr\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-12646-vcr\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">3</a></sup>. Because that’s how it worked. You closed your Duo and inserted it into the tray of the Duo Dock, which would eventually click into place and pull itself snugly closed. In a decade when Apple never skimped on custom intercapped names for their products, the system that locked the Duo in place in the Duo Dock was called PowerLatch.</p>\n<p>The Duo Dock packed in all the parts of a desktop Mac that weren’t present on the Duo. There was a floppy drive (not just a connector, like on the MiniDock), a hard-drive bay for a single 3.5-inch half-height drive, two NuBus slots—that’s right, you could install add-on cards that the computer could use when it was docked—space for additional video RAM (to drive larger monitors), and even a slot for a floating-point unit (FPU) chip. This was a dock that could actually expand your computer’s central processor and make it faster.</p>\n<figure class=\"pull-right\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/powerlatch-duo.gif?ssl=1\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>Patented PowerLatch<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"™\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> technology.</figcaption></figure><p>That level of integration came at a cost: You basically needed to shut down your laptop to eject it from the Dock. If you pressed the eject button on the Dock—yes, there was an eject button—it would tell the Duo to shut down, and you’d be prompted to save your files. Once the laptop was off, the ejection process would start. (When you inserted a Duo in the Dock, it would automatically reconnect you to your file servers, which was nice.)</p>\n<p>Still, the idea of the Duo Dock was kind of brilliant. I frequently hear the hosts of <a href=\"http://atp.fm/\">one of my favorite podcasts</a> debate the merits of going full-time with a laptop versus having a separate laptop and desktop. The Duo tried to provide the best of both worlds, with a light laptop that could inherit the traits of a desktop Mac when it was sucked into its little plastic house.</p>\n<p>The lifespan of the entire PowerBook Duo product line from introduction to discontinuation was less than five years. But it lives on in reruns of NewsRadio, Seinfeld, and quintessential mid-90s films like “The Net” (which was shot at Macworld Expo San Francisco) and “Hackers.”</p>\n<p>This time period coincides with my first few years working at MacUser magazine. I had never seen a Duo in the wild before I started to work at MacUser, and even there, they were rare. In an era that stands among the worst in Apple’s history, the full-featured PowerBook was a hit, but not the Duo. It lived off in its own parallel universe, a niche within a niche.</p>\n<p>The Duo line was discontinued in early 1997, before Steve Jobs got the chance to kill it himself. Though <a href=\"https://512pixels.net/2011/09/modern-docking-station/\">you could make the argument</a> that Apple’s <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/162442/2011/09/apples_thunderbolt_display_a_compelling_device_for_2011_macbook_air.html?lsrc=top_1\">Thunderbolt Display</a> was a MacBook docking station disguised as a display, we never really saw the Duo Dock’s like again.</p>\n<figure class=\"youtube\"><p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xOtcCfM0vpI\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n</figure><p>I’ll be back next week with number 18.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr><ol><li id=\"fn-12646-160\">\nThe same year as my PowerBook 160!

Apple has been moving away from the iTunes U concept for some time, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2017/08/21/itunes-u-collections-to-apple-podcasts-september/\">moving iTunes U content to Apple Podcasts back in 2017</a>, and now deprecating the education-focused app in favor of its Classroom and Schoolwork apps, and more:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Classroom turns your iPad into a powerful teaching assistant, helping teachers guide students through a lesson, see their progress, and keep them on track. Schoolwork helps teachers save time and maximize each student’s potential by making it easy for teachers to share class materials, get students to a specific activity in an app, collaborate with students, and view student progress.</p>\n<p>  In addition to Classroom and Schoolwork, Apple also introduced Apple School Manager to enable IT Administrators to easily manage iPads, Macs, Apple TV, Apple IDs, books, and apps, while ensuring data is kept secure and private. Apps such as Pages, Numbers, Keynote, GarageBand, iMovie, Clips, and Swift Playgrounds have education-specific features that are used regularly by teachers and students.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>In other words, Apple has other education options available, and educational experiences that rely on iTunes U will last through the next academic year. Apple recommends that publishers of public content migrate to podcasts and ebooks—Apple Podcasts and Apple Books, of course—if they want to continue to communicate their educational material to the wider world.</p><p><a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/itunesu/welcome/web\">Go to the linked site</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/link/2020/06/apple-will-discontinue-itunes-u-next-year/\">Read on Six Colors</a>.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 10 Jun 2020 17:45:59 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"dd3ae604b8ff87b9b52d6357f1b2d3d4","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jason Snell","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144222},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"Why AnyList isn’t supporting Sign in with Apple ↦","link":"https://sixcolors.com/?p=11650","description":"<p>AnyList, a popular app and service for creating and sharing lists of all kinds, won’t be supporting Sign in with Apple, and <a href=\"https://blog.anylist.com/2020/06/sign-in-with-apple/\">a blog post by co-founder Jeff Hunter explains why</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Another sign of Sign in with Apple’s immaturity is the sad state of the documentation for it. Good documentation is critical to facilitating developer adoption of any service. Since Apple is expecting developers to adopt this service by June 30th, it seems reasonable to expect decent documentation. Sadly, like most of Apple’s recent developer documentation, it’s sorely lacking. For example, Apple vaguely states that you can implement Sign in with Apple on Android, but there is no direct documentation on how to do it.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>So, there’s a lot going on here. I think, for the most part, AnyList’s concerns are well-founded for their particular offering. There are a number of things that the app needs to do that aren’t supported well by Sign in with Apple—for example, the ability to share lists with another user. Or cross-platform support with Android.</p>\n<p>Other concerns are perhaps more overblown, such as the recent, now patched, security flaw in the system. It’s not that such a vulnerability isn’t serious, but extrapolating a huge fundamental flaw in the program is perhaps overstating the matter.</p>\n<p>Certainly, not every app should be required to use Sign in with Apple. My wife and I use AnyList to share our shopping list, and I have no compunction about having created an account with their service.<sup id=\"fnref-11650-bigco\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-11650-bigco\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup> But mandating Sign in with Apple in cases where apps already support a different sign-in service seems not unreasonable.</p>\n<p>I think it’s fair for AnyList to say Sign in with Apple simply isn’t the right solution for its product. As part of compliance with the new rule, AnyList will be removing Facebook, the only other third-party sign in option they offer, which Hunter points out had lots of its own problems, including poor privacy protections.</p>\n<p>The deadline for the new rule takes effect today, so it’ll be interesting to see how many apps implement Sign in with Apple, and how many follow AnyList’s example.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr><ol><li id=\"fn-11650-bigco\">\nThat said, if they got bought by Facebook, Amazon, or some other big company, I would probably reconsider. <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fnref-11650-bigco\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/21a9.png\" alt=\"↩\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></a>\n</li>\n</ol></div><p><a href=\"https://blog.anylist.com/2020/06/sign-in-with-apple/\">Go to the linked site</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/link/2020/06/why-anylist-isnt-supporting-sign-in-with-apple/\">Read on Six Colors</a>.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 30 Jun 2020 12:59:35 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/21a9.png","linkMd5":"57a1d91bcce662a82726171ffa92b751","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn51@2020_2/2020/08/24/18-19-11-215_25686225908fe44d.webp","destWidth":72,"destHeight":72,"sourceBytes":462,"destBytes":1318,"author":"Dan Moren","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/21a9.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn51@2020_2/2020/08/24/18-19-11-215_25686225908fe44d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144198},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"The Back Page: Two Hands and a Map (Member Post)","link":"https://sixcolors.com/?p=11771","description":"<p>We’re pleased to announce that, as of the end of January 2020, we’ve completed the full rollout of our redesigned Maps in the United States.

You’d think you could just throw machine learning at it, but noooooo.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most impressive of Maps’s new features is Look Around, which debuted in iOS 13. This <em>never before seen</em> capability allows you to virtually stand in a location and, yes, <em>look around</em>. You know what this means? It means you never have to leave the house ever again.

In their simplest form, of course, they load web pages. But there’s hidden complexity beneath the humble URL. As many people who build web pages already know, they can carry enormous amounts of data from place to place, all by tacking on extra stuff in the query portion at the end of the URL—that’s the stuff that follows the question mark symbol.</p>\n<p>So, for example, <code>https://my.example/?name=Jason</code> contacts a web server and passes across the field <em>name</em> containing the name <em>Jason</em>. Of course, most URL queries are far more complicated—and they don’t always use web servers. URL, after all, stands for Uniform Resource Locator, and they can refer to apps, too. In fact, most inter-application communication on iOS takes place via the humble URL.</p>\n<p>I’ve configured 1Writer, my primary text editor on iOS, to run a Shortcut via this URL: <code>shortcuts://run-shortcut?name=Post%20to%20Six%20Colors%202020&#38;input={[text]}</code>. Shortcuts is registered as the handler for any URLs starting with <em>shortcuts</em>, and Shortcuts accepts requests to run a Shortcut at <em>run-shortcut</em>, with the name of the shortcut in the <em>name</em> field. In this case, I’m running a shortcut called “Post to Six Colors 2020” (the symbol %20 is how you encode the space character in URL format).&#8230;</p> <p>This story is for Six Colors members only. <strong><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/subscribe/\">Become a member</a></strong> to get access to exclusive stories, podcasts, and community..</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 01 Jul 2020 16:00:06 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/get-contents-of-url.png?ssl=1","linkMd5":"f74c1ea85f4fb9a75bad7223f82ce734","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn63@2020_2/2020/08/24/18-19-06-492_82aeaf63e9a37993.webp","destWidth":1360,"destHeight":667,"sourceBytes":18786,"destBytes":18786,"author":"Jason Snell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/get-contents-of-url.png?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn63@2020_2/2020/08/24/18-19-06-492_82aeaf63e9a37993.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144190},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"The Hackett File: Changing the Virtual Channel (Member Post)","link":"https://sixcolors.com/?p=11762","description":"<figure><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/mt.sixcolors.com/images/content/2020/For_All_Mankind_Unit_Photo_11002-6c.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"For All Mankind\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/></figure><p>I watched and enjoyed both <em>The Morning Show</em> and <em>For All Mankind.</em> In fact, I’m excited to see where the shows go in their second season this year.</p>\n<p>…and I haven’t looked at Apple TV+ since.</p>\n<p>My wife and I are going to start the second season of <em>Jack Ryan</em> sometime soon, so the Amazon Prime app will see the light of day for a little while, and if something pops up on Netflix, we’ll then spend time there.</p>\n<p>I hadn’t thought about this phenomenon until Jason and Myke answered a question about it <a href=\"https://www.relay.fm/upgrade/282\">on Upgrade #282,</a> but I definitely hop around from service to service as we find things to watch on them.</p>\n<p>We’re aren’t even cord-cutters — we have never paid for cable — but this is all starting to feel like cable.

It contains the entire show from the free feed—but with two exceptions.</p>\n<p>First, the ad reads are completely removed. (Fans of podcast ads will still hear the sponsors thanked at the beginning and end, and find sponsorship links in the show notes.)</p>\n<p>Second, we’re adding an additional segment just for members every week. Last week we did preparation for our WWDC Keynote Draft, and this week we did some analysis of our draft picks. We also dropped in a hilarious moment cut out of the regular show, where Myke was interrupted in the middle of a segment by fulfilling a years-long dream in the least impressive way possible.</p>\n<p>With the changing dynamics in the podcast world, Relay is emphasizing listener support as a counterbalance to the uncertainty of podcast advertising. If you’re a Relay FM member who is specifically supporting Upgrade, you’ll gain access to the Upgrade+ feed as well a feed containing all of Relay’s “crossover content,” including two monthly members-only podcasts and a set of annual membership specials from across the network.</p>\n<p>(And yes, if you’re already supporting Upgrade, you already have access to all of this, including Upgrade+! Just go to Relay FM and log in, and you’ll be able to get to a special page that contains special podcast feed links. Just replace the regular Upgrade feed with Upgrade+, and things should proceed from there.)</p>\n<p>If you’d like to sign up and support Upgrade, you can support for <a href=\"https://relayfm.memberful.com/checkout?plan=9676\">$5 a month</a> or <a href=\"https://relayfm.memberful.com/checkout?plan=9678\">$50 a year</a>.<sup id=\"fnref-11404-plan\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-11404-plan\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>Upgrade is the highlight of my week and I think we’ve built a pretty great podcast over the past five-plus years and 300 episodes. The next couple of episodes should be among the biggest of the year. If you love the podcast and want to support us, we’re happy to give you a little more.</p>\n<p>And if supporting Upgrade doesn’t make sense for you, that’s fine too—we’re committed to the free, ad-supported feed and it won’t be going anywhere.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr><ol><li id=\"fn-11404-plan\">\nIf you’re already a Relay FM member but don’t yet support Upgrade, you can add Upgrade and then cancel your old plan. <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fnref-11404-plan\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/21a9.png\" alt=\"↩\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></a>\n</li>\n</ol></div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 19 Jun 2020 21:56:58 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/upgradepluslogo.png?ssl=1","linkMd5":"8284e93bdfafaad61e91d394a7fe9ed2","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn60@2020_3/2020/08/24/18-19-07-742_478f14de8c208a61.webp","destWidth":720,"destHeight":720,"sourceBytes":251793,"destBytes":74126,"author":"Jason Snell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/upgradepluslogo.png?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn60@2020_3/2020/08/24/18-19-07-742_478f14de8c208a61.webp","https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/21a9.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn51@2020_2/2020/08/24/18-19-11-215_25686225908fe44d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144216},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"Command Performance: Off-Filter (Member Post)","link":"https://sixcolors.com/?p=11767","description":"<figure class=\"pull-right\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/mt.sixcolors.com/images/content/2020/mail-filter.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>As our first installment in this new series, in which we talk about a single command in a single app that we love, let me tell you about my love of the Filter button in Mail.</p>\n<p>Look, filtering email isn’t anything new: many of us have probably been doing it for years in Gmail, Apple Mail, Outlook, Eudora, and so on.

To date, rival browsers like Google Chrome and Firefox and mail apps like Gmail and Microsoft Outlook have lacked the status of Apple’s products. For instance, if a user clicks a web link sent to them on an iPhone, it will automatically open in Safari. Similarly, if a user taps an email address — say, from a text message or a website — they’ll be sent to the Apple Mail app with no option to switch to another email program.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Power users especially have been clamoring for just such a move for many years. Third-party apps have definitely suffered from not being available as the default, as they are on macOS, for exactly the kind of reasons that Gurman describes above. Even for those who use Chrome or Gmail, there are gaps in the system that still find you shunted to Safari or Mail.</p>\n<p>It’s notable in particular that email and web browsing are singled out here, since there are other categories—calendars and contacts, for example—where default app options could also be valuable. The report also suggests that third-party music apps may be available as the default via Siri on iOS and on the HomePod, which could also help bolster those features for Apple while simultaneously giving a leg up to those competing music services. Spotify, of course, <a href=\"https://newsroom.spotify.com/2019-03-13/consumers-and-innovators-win-on-a-level-playing-field/\">famously complained about this treatment</a> while launching a lawsuit that is still pending, though it seems to have been more of a negotiation tactic than anything, since the music service is mentioned prominently in Gurman’s report.</p>\n<p>Personally, I’m <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3291618/apple-dont-default-on-default-apps.html\">all in favor of opening up default apps</a>. While it does add complexity to iOS, it’s something that most users can continue to safely ignore—and, let’s be honest, they will—while giving more options to the minority who would use it. It would help Apple sidestep some of these pesky legal challenges, and consumers would benefit from greater competition in those arenas.

Yes, it’s full of new features and enhancements, but at the same time, a few of the most prominent features of its sibling iOS are nowhere to be found here.</p>\n<p>Apple is always balancing its priorities, and some years one device or another might get more attention. This year seems to be an off-one for the iPad, but even if it doesn’t get all the bells and whistles as the iPhone, but it’s still got more than a few significant changes. Let’s take a look at a few of the biggest updates.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-11889\"></span></p>\n<h2>Putting you and I in UI</h2>\n<p>Perhaps the most visible changes in iPadOS 14 are to the system interface, which now puts a priority on efficient use of space. For example, there’s a more compact UI for Siri (which now appears as a little glowing icon in the bottom right corner of the screen, rather than taking over the entire display) or smaller notifications for incoming calls, whether they be via the phone, FaceTime, or third-party VoIP clients (you can switch back to the old full-screen option in Settings &#62; FaceTime &#62; Incoming Calls).</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ipados14-facetime.jpg?resize=1360%2C348&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"FaceTime notifications\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>The iPad does get the same compact banner notifications for incoming calls.</figcaption></figure><p>Likewise, the system search feature, which looks more than ever like its macOS counterpart, despite being (oddly) stripped of its Spotlight nomenclature. Like the other UI elements, it floats over the screen instead of taking it over (though you can’t drag the search box wherever you want, à la on the Mac). It’s also better designed now, with the ability to tap a button to start a search within an app such as Mail, Messages, or Files, and offering suggestions for web searches as you type. Apple’s also highlighting its prowess as a launcher for apps, though I’d suspect many users—especially those who use their iPad with a hardware keyboard—have been doing so for years. (If you’re not someone who regularly wants to search the web from the system search field, I recommend disabling Siri &#38; Search &#62; Suggestions in Search—then it surfaces way more results from your other apps, which I find more useful.)</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ipados14-search.png?resize=1360%2C1020&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Search\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>The redesigned search is more compact and potentially more useful.</figcaption></figure><p>There are other changes throughout the UI like revamped pull-down menus, a new calendar-based date-picker, and sidebars (yes, sidebars!) everywhere. On the whole, it feels a lot more like macOS than the iPad ever has in the past, and when you look over at the Mac’s revamped interface in Big Sur, it’s hard not to see plenty of elements there that have been borrowed from the iPad. These two cousins are closer than ever.</p>\n<h2>Scribbling up a storm</h2>\n<p>One aspect of the iPad that got a lot of attention in iPadOS this year—and one of the few that’s <em>only</em> in iPadOS right now—is Apple Pencil support. Apple’s been improving the technology for its stylus a little bit every year, adding things like the ability to search handwriting in Notes and better annotation features.</p>\n<p>This year’s improvements are huge. For those still crying over their dearly departed Newton, the iPad is bringing systemwide support for Scribble, the handwriting feature Apple first introduced on the Apple Watch. Effectively that means that any place on the system that uses a standard text entry field—emails, text messages, Slack, Twitter, even forms in Safari—you can instead use the Apple Pencil to write instead of typing. Your handwriting will then be automatically converted into text. (Albeit with results about on par with that of autocorrect.)</p>\n<figure><div style=\"width: 1440px;\" class=\"wp-video\"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->\n<video class=\"wp-video-shortcode\" id=\"video-11889-1\" width=\"1440\" height=\"960\" loop=\"1\" autoplay=\"1\" preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"video/mp4\" src=\"https://sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ipados14-scribbling.mp4?_=1\" /><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ipados14-scribbling.mp4\">https://sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ipados14-scribbling.mp4</a></video></div><figcaption>iPadOS 14’s Scribble feature has shades of the Newton.</figcaption></figure><p>Apple’s also added Pencil gestures that reduce how much you need to jump back to the keyboard for simple tasks like deleting words (you just squiggle out the word you want to replace), adding space (you touch and hold), selecting (you circle a word), and separate/joining characters (you draw a vertical line). There’s also a floating palette that appears to give you quick access to certain functions in an app, as well as a floating keyboard.</p>\n<p>Currently Apple Pencil’s handwriting only seems to support English and Chinese character recognition, though more languages are sure to follow.</p>\n<p>In addition to adding Scribble, Apple’s also improved taking notes with your Pencil in the Notes app. For example, you can toggle between having it automatically recognized as text or simply shown as handwriting on the screen, and even in the latter case you can still select text, including down to a letter level. iPadOS is also smart enough to avoid pictures that you’ve drawn. After the fact, you can copy that handwritten text and paste it elsewhere as typewritten text.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ipados14-note-taking.png?resize=1360%2C1020&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Note Taking\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>Data detectors can recognize—and let you tap on—email addresses, phone numbers, URLs and more in handwritten notes.</figcaption></figure><p>Apple’s clearly spent a lot of time devoting machine learning to this feature. Since it can read the text, it can use data detectors to recognize phone numbers, email addresses, and more. That is kind of mind-blowing, and I’m sure I’m going to be tapping handwriting on all sorts of non-iPad surfaces all the time now.</p>\n<h2>Take a Shortcut</h2>\n<p>One of the apps to get a more substantial redesign this time around is Shortcuts, especially on the iPad. The new sidebar provides quicker access to automations, as well as introducing groups of shortcuts, including smart collections like shortcuts that appear in the Share Sheet and shortcuts you can run on Apple Watch, plus folders that you create yourself, complete with icons of your choice.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ipados14-shortcuts.png?resize=1360%2C1020&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Shortcuts in iPadOS 14\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>Shortcuts in iPadOS 14 adds support for multiple windows, as well as contextual menus that let you easily copy and paste blocks within or between shortcuts.</figcaption></figure><p>Editing a shortcut has also been revamped, with the list of actions you can search from relocated to the right hand side of the screen. Blocks in shortcuts now have contextual actions available via long-pressing on them, though, after a lot of trial and error, I discovered that you have to make sure to tap on the name of the block. That menu lets you get info about actions as well as delete, copy and paste, favorite, or duplicate them.</p>\n<p>Moving, copying, and pasting large blocks of actions is also much easier. If you’ve got a big set of actions inside an If or Repeat block, tapping and holding on the parent block will collapse it all into one box that you can easily drag around.</p>\n<p>And the Shortcuts app now supports multiple windows, meaning you can have two shortcuts open at once, if you need to refer to one while working on another, or even copy and paste between them. (No dragging and dropping blocks between the two windows, however.) All of this promises to enable even easier and more powerful shortcut creation.</p>\n<h2>What’s missing</h2>\n<p>While the iPad benefits from most of the features that also appear in iOS 14, two of the most radical redesigns have not, alas, made their way to the iPad. If you were excited about the promise of the new App Library feature to let you better organize your apps on the iPad, sorry to say that’s a non-starter so far: you’ll have to keep all your apps in their folders and all your home screens visible.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ipados14-widgets.png?resize=1360%2C1020&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Widgets\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>Widgets are still consigned to that one column in iPadOS 14.</figcaption></figure><p>The same goes for widgets, which made their homescreen debut in last year’s inaugural iPadOS release. But where iOS 14 allows you to mix them in with the app icons on your homescreen, iPadOS keeps them sequestered to that one optional column in landscape mode. They do at least get the new widget architecture underneath the hood, so you’ll be able to access the widget gallery, choose your widget sizes, and organize them into a Smart Stack that uses machine learning to theoretically show you the widgets you want when you want them.</p>\n<p>iPad OS 14 leaves out a handful of other features introduced in iOS 14: for example, though Apple has implemented an emoji popover that appears when you’re using a hardware keyboard, it (and the normal emoji soft keyboard) have no search box, as on the iPhone. This is a disappointment to those who’ve long looked for an easier way to find a specific emoji.</p>\n<p>Likewise, Apple still makes it clear that the iPad is not the primary device that most people are living on.

But, since getting my hands on a pre-release version of SoundSource 5 a couple weeks back, I have bid adieu to macOS’s native widget for good. All SoundSource, all the way.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/soundsource5.jpeg?ssl=1\" alt=\"SoundSource\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>SoundSource 5 can now be configured with an even more compact interface.</figcaption></figure><p>Here’s a few of the reasons why I made the switch: First, SoundSource 5 features a brand new interface that’s not only more attractive than its predecessor (which was certainly no slouch), but allows you to customize it to take up less room. I use both the new built-in Compact view as well as the ability to hide the application list when I don’t need it and, as a result, I end up with just the controls I need at my fingertips.</p>\n<p>Likewise, SoundSource 5 includes the ability to get an alternate menu that’s like the built-in widget by right clicking on the menu icon, so you can easily change sound output and input for the system. And you can now permanently keep both input and output meters in the menu bar to see your levels at a glance. (There’s also an option for per-app volume levels if that’s a thing you need.) Finally, the SoundSource default menu bar icon now shows the volume level, à la the OS’s menu bar. In short: there’s no reason to keep around the built-in menu bar item at all.</p>\n<p>That’s on top of all of SoundSource’s other new features, like being able to favorite certain apps, pin your effects window, search for audio units, and updated versions of the balance and equalizer controls, plus way more.</p>\n<p>SoundSource is, as of this writing, at a special introductory price of $29, which is a solid deal for this app. If you owned version 4, you can upgrade at discounted rate, and if you’re not sure whether or not SoundSource is for you, there’s a free trial. But if you spend a lot of time working with audio, it’s a no brainer.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr><ol><li id=\"fn-12617-disclosure\">\nRogue Amoeba CEO Paul Kafasis is a personal friend, and Rogue Amoeba has sponsored past episodes of several of my podcasts.

These days we can sit on the couch and watch whatever WWDC sessions we want. Here are some interesting tidbits gleaned from a collection of sessions that were posted on Tuesday.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10214/\">Port your Mac app to Apple Silicon</a></strong></p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/apple-silicon.jpeg?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>While many developers can get their apps built for Apple processors quickly, among the limitations will be precompiled software contained within the app that isn’t built for Apple’s processors. Apps can’t mix and match Rosetta and native code; if developers are using precompiled Intel software, they’ll need to contact the author and ask them to provide a new version compiled for Apple’s processors.  Developers running on Macs with Apple-built processors can actually build and run their apps using Rosetta so they can get some idea how they will run on Intel processors.</p>\n<p>More broadly, Apple’s new Macs will be using the same sort of multi-core layout that we currently see on the iPhone and iPad, where there are two different types of processor cores. One set of cores is focused on performance, while the other set is focused on energy efficiency. The system will dynamically choose which cores are used, just as on iPad and iPhone. Apple cautions developers to not be surprised to see their software running mostly on one set of cores or the other—it all depends on the current needs of the system. That will be a major change from current Mac multiprocessing, in which each core is more or less the same, and work is generally spread across all the cores.</p>\n<p>I got a chuckle at the fact that, to target code specifically for the Mac, you used to be able to target Intel x86_64, but now you need to be more broad and just say “os_osx.” Of course, Apple changed the name to macOS two years ago and it’s not even version 10 anymore, but the behind-the-scenes stuff rarely matches the names used in marketing. (Developers will target Macs with Apple silicon by targeting the arm64 architecture, the exact same name as the target would be on iOS.)</p>\n<p>If you want to see what kind of apps you’re running on a Mac with Apple silicon, just open the Activity Monitor utility, which will display every running process and list whether it’s running on Apple or Intel architectures. And just as during the transition <em>to</em> Intel processors, you can choose to force an app to run in Rosetta rather than natively by selecting the app, choosing Get Info, and checking the Use Rosetta checkbox.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10143/\">What’s new in Mac Catalyst</a></strong></p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mac-catalyst.jpeg?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Last year developers were a little concerned about just how much Apple was going to put into continuing to develop Mac Catalyst, since the company talked so little about it during WWDC. This year, though, Apple has rolled out numerous Mac Catalyst updates—probably aided by the fact that two stock Mac apps, Messages and Maps, are now implemented using Mac Catalyst.</p>\n<p>Mac Catalyst now supports dozens of additional iOS frameworks, including some that you wouldn’t expect and that aren’t actually on macOS, like ARKit. No, the Mac is probably not gaining augmented reality support anytime soon, but by including ARKit, Apple allows app developers to simply use the normal checks they’d make to see if an iOS device supports ARKit—and then move on when it turns out the current device doesn’t—rather than having to block out that entire segment of code because the Mac doesn’t know what ARKit is.</p>\n<p>This spring, iOS got an update that provided much richer support for handling changes in keyboard input, and that support has now been rolled into Mac Catalyst, as well. The app now supports the Mac’s color picker, and proper checkboxes, and (rejoice!) the date picker now uses a proper Mac date picker rather than the iPhone’s spinning wheel. (I believe the iPad also gets this feature, once again showing how much the iPad and Mac have in common these days.)</p>\n<p>Mac Catalyst under macOS Big Sur also supports regular Mac pull-down menus, and popovers that are geometrically “real”—in that they can expand outside the bounds of the main app window. (Constraining everything to inside the app window was always a tell that an app came from the iPad.) Three-column views are also supported, and the use of SF Symbols for iconography (since that icon set is moving to the Mac anyway in macOS Big Sur).</p>\n<p>Catalyst apps will also look clearer, with sharper text, because developers can now opt to run them at 100% scale, rather than the scaled-down version that was previously mandatory in order to avoid some interface layout issues.</p>\n<p>Photo editing extensions on iPad can now be brought over to the Mac via Catalyst, and will work with Mac apps that support those extensions, most notably Photos. Widgets should also “just work”, appearing in the new Notification Center widget view just as they would on iOS.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10104/\">Adopt the new look of macOS</a></strong></p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mac-app-design.jpeg?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>macOS Big Sur sure looks different. This session goes through the details. Sidebars are now “full height”, meaning they extend into what used to be the title bar of windows. SFSymbols iconography is everywhere, with icons in sidebars boldly colored. Apps can set the color of those icons themselves, setting the mood themselves—but can opt to allow users to override that color with their own preferred interface accent color. (They can also opt to ignore user preference, as Apple Mail is doing with its VIP items, which also display as yellow.)</p>\n<p>The title bar has basically merged with the toolbar, in the new “unified” toolbar style, in which the window title is left justified and inline among the bold SFSymbols toolbar icon. (There’s also room for a subtitle just below the title, which can provide secondary information about the window you’re looking at. Apple Mail uses this subtitle to display how many unread messages you have, for instance.)</p>\n<p>There’s also a new unified compact window layout, which is shorter, and is meant to be used when the toolbar is sparse and the focus is on window content. There’s also still support for “expanded” toolbars, which is basically how all Mac windows used to work—big title bar, lots of big buttons, labels under the buttons, the works.</p>\n<p>The humble slider control, which used to be a pointed polygonal block sliding along a track with tick marks below it, has been redrawn in Big Sur. It’s now an oval sliding over a track with tick marks on it.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10174/\">Explore App Clips</a></strong></p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/app-clip-hello-world.jpeg?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>App Clips are new mini-apps that quickly launch when you scan a code, tap an NFC sticker, or tap on a link. The method by which App Clips are launched is actually a special URL that Apple is calling an “App Clip experience.” These URLs are parsed by the system and then handled by an app clip rather than being routed to the web browser, in a fashion similar to how Universal Links work on iOS. Apple is launching its own “App Clip Code” format later this year, which seems to be a product that is both an NFC sticker <em>and</em> a visual code, so you can tap them or scan them to activate an app clip.</p>\n<p>As for App Clips themselves, there’s “no magic” here—developers will need to create a second mini application within xcode, a standalone app within their existing app project that’s dedicated to just handling App Clip experiences. An App Clip app can’t exist without a corresponding regular App, and they have to be submitted to App Store review together.</p>\n<p>However, the two apps are actually mutually exclusive. The App Clip only gets downloaded and launched if you don’t have the corresponding app installed—otherwise, the URL just links to that functionality in the existing app. If you use an App Clip and decide you want to download the full app, the App Clip goes away—though it can pass along some of its data to be imported into the full app.</p>\n<p>App Clips are meant to be ephemeral, especially if you don’t use them. After a period of inactivity, App Clips and their data will be automatically deleted by the operating system, and their data doesn’t get backed up, either. However, if you use an App Clip regularly, its life will be extended—and if you use it regularly enough, the system may never delete it at all.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10668/\">Meet Nearby Interaction</a></strong></p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/meet-nearby-interaction.jpeg?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Last fall I wrote about <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2019/09/the-u1-chip-in-the-iphone-11-is-the-beginning-of-an-ultra-wideband-revolution/\">Ultra Wideband</a>, the technology inside Apple’s U1 Chip, found in the iPhone 11 series. It provides the ability to precisely locate other devices with Ultra Wideband chips, and up to now Apple has only rolled out a single feature that uses that chip: an arrow pointing at someone else’s phone while using AirDrop.</p>\n<p>With iOS 14, Apple’s opening up access to the U1 chip to app developers, providing potentially interesting uses of apps that are spatially aware. Apps that want to use this feature have to ask permission, and all devices participating have to agree. Then the apps have access to a stream of distance and direction data for whatever devices they’re tracking—keeping in mind, only devices with the U1 are currently supported.</p>\n<p>The tracking comes courtesy of a temporary discovery token that’s randomly generated to ensure privacy, and it’s discarded at the end of the session, which is why you can only grant an app one-time permission to track another device.</p>\n<p>Some other tidbits from the session: iPhones should be held in portrait orientation for optimal tracking use. (It makes me wonder if the reason the iPad doesn’t have a U1 chip is because of the complexity of that device being used in both portrait and landscape mode far more than the iPhone.) There’s also a “field of view” for device tracking that’s roughly analogous to the field of view of the iPhone 11’s ultrawide camera. If a tracked device is outside that field of view, you’ll still get a distance measurement but won’t be able to get a direction.</p>\n<p>Apple’s even built a simulator for developers to test these features. When you simulate two iPhones on screen, they’ll react to each other as you drag them closer to one another or further apart. Presumably developers will want the biggest screen possible in order to test this feature, so get those Pro Display XDR orders in now.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10206/\">Design(ed) for iPad</a></strong></p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/designed-for-ipad.jpeg?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>This was a nice session about Apple’s current thinking regarding iPad app design. “Just because the iPad is in the middle, that doesn’t mean it’s just halfway between the Mac and the iPhone,” says presenter Grant Paul of the Apple Design Team. “A great iPad app, you need to be just as dedicated to what’s great and special about the iPad” as the iPhone and the Mac.</p>\n<p>For iPadOS 14, there’s been a lot of focus on sidebars—which are very helpful, as Mac users can attest. iPadOS 14 sidebars can contain items that users can reorder, drag in items as favorites, and the like. Handy. Sidebars can be toggled on or off by tapping the sidebar icon in the top left of the app, and can be brought back temporarily via a swipe from the left edge of the screen.</p>\n<p>Another goal for iPadOS 14 design seems to be an increase in density. The Files app, for example, uses smaller icons than in iPadOS 13 in order to dramatically increase the number of items that can be viewed.</p>\n<p>Apple’s designers also want to use the iPad’s extra screen space to improve informational context in apps. For example, you can now rename files inline in the Files app, rather than being taken to a modal rename screen. The Calendars menu in the Calendars app, which was previously a popover, now displays in the sidebar, allowing you to view changes in the calendar as you adjust which calendars are visible.</p>\n<p>The iPad is a versatile device that can handle all different kinds of input methods, but Apple cautions developers to always start with multitouch. The iPad is, first and foremost, a touch tablet. But its many other input methods can be mixed and matched in interesting ways—for example, holding down the command key while tapping on a link in Safari, holding down shift while tapping on items to select them, or even drawing with an Apple Pencil while using a finger to adjust user interface elements in an animation app.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 24 Jun 2020 00:46:01 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/apple-silicon.jpeg?ssl=1","linkMd5":"0419256f029f38d1f80b2aed63160856","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn71@2020_1/2020/08/24/18-19-06-703_6c1dfd9c6f041c9d.webp","destWidth":1360,"destHeight":764,"sourceBytes":95533,"destBytes":30136,"author":"Jason Snell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/apple-silicon.jpeg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn71@2020_1/2020/08/24/18-19-06-703_6c1dfd9c6f041c9d.webp","https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mac-catalyst.jpeg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn87@2020_3/2020/08/24/18-19-12-224_2fd9a34b3fa76140.webp","https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mac-app-design.jpeg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn28@2020_5/2020/08/24/18-19-14-436_c5475b38fb85fe04.webp","https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/app-clip-hello-world.jpeg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn72@2020_6/2020/08/24/18-19-14-698_510dafd140b5c017.webp","https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/meet-nearby-interaction.jpeg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn43@2020_1/2020/08/24/18-19-15-252_555e4a009afd2d0a.webp","https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/designed-for-ipad.jpeg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn79@2020_4/2020/08/24/18-19-12-203_a31e84bffb74adfb.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144207},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"(Podcast) #279: I Predict It Every Year, Why Stop Now?","link":"http://two.wordpress.test/post/2020/01/279_i_predict_it_every_year_why_stop_now/","description":"<p>With a new year come Jason’s predictions for Apple in 2020.

I’m not sure where this one falls. Stephen was curious about how many Macs were released, historically, per year.</p>\n<p>It’s a complicated concept. My first thought was to chart all Macs that have ever been alive at any given time, but that would require a level of research that I am not able to do today. Instead, I decided to focus on release years, and scoured the <a href=\"https://everymac.com/systems/by_year/index-macs-mac-clones-by-year.html\">Macs by year page at EveryMac.com</a> to generate a list. After removing Mac clones, Newtons, and Duo Docks, I got a chart that looked like this:</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/new-mac-models-1-6c.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>This is interesting, and definitely shows off just how many different labels Apple was slapping on computers in the mid-90s. For those who weren’t around back then, in the mid-90s Apple sold many computers under different model names in different markets. The LC line was sold to education; the Performa line was sold in department stores and other consumer retail environments. Often times there’s be several “models” of Performa that weren’t any different except for the bundled monitor or software. Apple would also create special server configurations of desktop Macs and sell them under a different name.</p>\n<p>It was how mid-90s Apple operated. How did it go? They almost went out of business. So… not great.</p>\n<p>I wanted to generate a chart that removed those duplicate computers. I also decided that I wasn’t going to consider a computer that was largely the same but for the speed of its processor as fundamentally different. (By those measures, the 2019 Mac Pro is <a href=\"https://everymac.com/systems/by_year/macs-released-in-2019.html\">five computers</a>. It counts as a single computer for me. If you disagree, make your own list.)</p>\n<p>I did decide, however, that laptops or iMacs with different screen sizes (or, for earlier PowerBooks, color) counted as different models. The 11-inch MacBook Air and the 13-inch MacBook Air are different. The 8-core iMac Pro and 10-core iMac Pro are not.</p>\n<p>With those (admittedly debatable and arbitrary) rules in place, I went back through <a href=\"https://everymac.com/systems/by_year/index-macs-mac-clones-by-year.html\">the EveryMac.com archive</a> and tried to differentiate between the <a href=\"https://everymac.com/systems/apple/mac_performa/specs/mac_performa_6310cd.html\">Performa 6310CD</a> and the <a href=\"https://everymac.com/systems/apple/mac_performa/specs/mac_performa_6300cd.html\">Performa 6300CD</a>.</p>\n<p>Here’s what I got:</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/new-mac-models-2-6c.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>That chart, I think, does a better job of showing just how many models Apple was shipping during its mid-’90s death spiral. And then came 1997.</p>\n<p>In 1997, Apple only released five Mac models. While you might assume this was because Steve Jobs came back and changed how Apple marketed the Mac—including his famous “four quadrant grid”—that’s a bit premature. The big thing that changed in 1997 was the introduction of the G3 processor. Apple introduced a PowerBook G3 and some Power Mac G3 models in 1997, and yes, the Performa line was ended the same year.</p>\n<p>(Meanwhile, 1997 was perhaps the high water mark for Mac clones, which aren’t included here. Jobs managed to kill them off in 1997 by withholding the license for Mac OS 8 from clone makers, which was required to run the G3 processor. The clones were stuck in the past, and they all closed up shop.)</p>\n<p>Over the next few years, you can see Jobs’s simplification of the Mac line, as the iMac and iBook debut, along with new Power Macs and PowerBooks—but never too many variations. In later years Apple has kept the total number of models fairly small. The spikes you see are generally when Apple refreshed a product line twice in the same year—for example, in 2009 Apple revised the Mac mini and iMac twice.</p>\n<p>These days Apple’s pace seems more deliberate. In 2019, by my count, there were <a href=\"https://everymac.com/systems/by_year/macs-released-in-2019.html\">seven new Mac models</a>: Mac Pro, 15″ MacBook Pro, 13″ MacBook Pro, 16″ MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, 27-inch iMac, and 21.5-inch iMac.</p>\n<p>We can argue about the pace of Apple’s Mac updates, but I think we can all agree that the mid-1990s were very bad and they should stay buried deep, deep in the past, along with all those Centrises and Performas and LCs.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 07 Feb 2020 12:55:38 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/jobs-grid-6c.jpg?ssl=1","linkMd5":"087ce1080103e4192b63fa4d9ab428a3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn39@2020_5/2020/08/24/18-19-06-496_fcef7bae226f9c03.webp","destWidth":1360,"destHeight":1116,"sourceBytes":42846,"destBytes":42846,"author":"Jason Snell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/jobs-grid-6c.jpg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn39@2020_5/2020/08/24/18-19-06-496_fcef7bae226f9c03.webp","https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/new-mac-models-1-6c.png?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn48@2020_4/2020/08/24/18-19-15-286_b4e66c67bb02c19b.webp","https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/new-mac-models-2-6c.png?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn59@2020_4/2020/08/24/18-19-12-251_b7776ad3356bcb67.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144632},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"iPad at 10: Why apps made the iPad a success (Macworld/Jason Snell)","link":"http://two.wordpress.test/post/2020/01/ipad_at_10_why_apps_made_the_ipad_a_success/","description":"<p>It’s hard to believe that January 27 marks the tenth anniversary of the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2010/01/27Apple-Launches-iPad/\">announcement of the iPad</a>.

Well, the life of the security certificate on your website, anyway. News out of last week’s meeting of the CA/Browser Forum is that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chosensecurity/status/1230253348236013570?s=21\">Apple has announced Safari will no longer accept HTTPS certificates older than about 13 months</a>, as of September 1.</p>\n<p>For a little background: that padlock you see on your browser, telling you it’s safe to shop or transmit personal information, is regulated by cryptographic certificates, issued by organizations known as Certificate Authorities. Those certificates are generally good for a certain amount of time, after which they expire and have to be renewed.</p>\n<p>Over time, the accepted lifetime of those certificates has gone down: previously, a certificate remained good for as long as five years, but more recently that number has been reduced to two and a half years. Many sites voluntarily use certificates that have even shorter lifetimes.</p>\n<p>The rationale? Shorter certificate lifetimes are safer, <a href=\"https://www.michalspacek.com/maximum-https-certificate-lifetime-to-be-1-year-soon\">for a variety of reasons</a>. For one thing, it prevents a valid (and perhaps abandoned) certificate from being stolen or misappropriated by a bad actor, then used to trick consumers. While there is a process for revoking known bad certificates, it’s cumbersome and many browsers don’t even check the revocation lists.</p>\n<p>For another, quick turnaround helps ensure that the certificates are always secured using the latest cryptographic standards. As above, if a particular manner of encryption is compromised, those old certificates are often still floating around, ripe for exploitation.</p>\n<p>The major downside for certificates that expire more often is that it means more work for organizations that have a large number of certificates that they will now need to renew more often. But there are tools that help manage these things; the increasingly popular free Let’s Encrypt service uses certificates that expire after just 90 days, though it also offers an automated renewal system.<sup id=\"fnref-11026-letsencrypt\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-11026-letsencrypt\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>At least one previous proposal to reduce the life of accepted certificates has been put to the CA/Browser Forum, but while it was widely supported by browser makers, it didn’t garner enough support from Certificate Authorities to make any head way. So Apple, in its own tried and true fashion, has apparently decided to make a unilateral change for what it believes is the best for users. So any certificates issued after September 1 of this year will be rejected if they have a lifetime exceeding 398 days. (Longer certificates issued <em>before</em> September 1 of this year will continue to be honored.)</p>\n<p>Given Safari’s large market penetration, sites will have to comply or risk being flagged by Apple products. Given that, it’s highly likely that other browser makers will follow suit on this decision, and that these shorter certificate lives will become the de facto standard. Will the average user notice? Probably not, but it does mean web browsing will be more secure than it used to be.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr><ol><li id=\"fn-11026-letsencrypt\">\nI use a Let’s Encrypt cert on my personal site, and it’s so amazingly simple that there’s just no reason for every site not to have HTTPS these days. <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fnref-11026-letsencrypt\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/21a9.png\" alt=\"↩\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></a>\n</li>\n</ol></div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Feb 2020 15:32:00 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/21a9.png","linkMd5":"3f8ff568b8c0d9405d54ce24ca725b84","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn51@2020_2/2020/08/24/18-19-11-215_25686225908fe44d.webp","destWidth":72,"destHeight":72,"sourceBytes":462,"destBytes":1318,"author":"Dan Moren","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/21a9.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn51@2020_2/2020/08/24/18-19-11-215_25686225908fe44d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144620},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"WWDC 2020 Tuesday: Session Impressions, Part 2","link":"https://sixcolors.com/?p=11531","description":"<p>One of the best things about virtual WWDC is that sessions no longer feel the need to expand their talks to fit into a certain time slot—nor does the number need to reflect available physical space.

Perhaps the best part of the experience is that shortcuts no longer need to open the Shortcuts app to continue their task now. Any Shortcuts user can tell you that its previous experience of launching the app and stepping through the various actions within it was <em>fine</em>, but not particularly elegant.</p>\n<p>Apple’s also increased the capabilities in this new compact UI. So, for example, a disambiguation interface—asking the user to pick an item from a list, for example—can now also provide images and subtitles in addition to the main option. That way you can be sure you’re picking the right item, such as the soup you want.</p>\n<p>While we know that Shortcuts get folders in iOS 14, the app also includes a couple of prebuilt Smart Folders showing which shortcuts are available in the Share Sheet or on the Apple Watch. It doesn’t look like users will necessarily be able to create their own Smart Folders, though—or at least, not yet.</p>\n<p>There have also been improvements to the Automation abilities of Shortcuts, including more trigger types like receiving an email or text message, the battery hitting a certain level, connecting to a charger, and closing an app. Plus, more of those trigger types can run automatically, requiring no prompt from the user. And the Gallery part of shortcuts will offer suggestions for automations in addition to standard shortcuts.</p>\n<p>iOS 14’s new Wind Down feature will also provide a lot of opportunities for shortcuts as we learn more about it.</p>\n<p>All of these features point towards Shortcuts becoming an increasingly integral part of Apple’s iOS and iPadOS platforms, and these improvements will go a long way toward making it even more approachable for many users.</p>\n<h2>Meet Safari Web Extensions</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/0E9AD5A7-D0AA-4E09-B180-9F41F5571448.jpeg?fit=680%2C680&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Meet Safari Web Extensions\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-11532 jetpack-broken-image\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/0E9AD5A7-D0AA-4E09-B180-9F41F5571448.jpeg?resize=680%2C382&#38;ssl=1 680w, https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/0E9AD5A7-D0AA-4E09-B180-9F41F5571448.jpeg?resize=1360%2C764&#38;ssl=1 1360w, https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/0E9AD5A7-D0AA-4E09-B180-9F41F5571448.jpeg?resize=768%2C432&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/0E9AD5A7-D0AA-4E09-B180-9F41F5571448.jpeg?resize=1536%2C863&#38;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/0E9AD5A7-D0AA-4E09-B180-9F41F5571448.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1151&#38;ssl=1 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-image-w=\"680\" data-image-h=\"382\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></p>\n<p>Previous Safari extensions were tightly regimented into things like Share extensions and app extensions (think 1Password’s extension) written in Objective C or Swift. But this year, Safari gains the ability to run web extensions written in JavaScript/HTML/CSS, including those currently available for other browsers.</p>\n<p>But Apple’s approaching this in an unsurprisingly Apple-like fashion. If you want to distribute a web extension, it’s got to be wrapped in a native Mac application designed in Xcode. Installing the app from the app store will also install the web extension.</p>\n<p>The good news is: for developers with existing web extension written for another browser like Chrome or Firefox, Apple provides a command line tool to convert the extension into an Xcode project. That handles a lot of the work for the developer, creating essentially a barebones wrapper app—little more than a window with a button to open Safari preferences. (For testing, it uses an ad-hoc signing process, meaning you have to enable unsigned extensions in Safari’s Develop menu.) This is a hugely exciting move, since Chrome and other browsers have huge libraries of powerful extensions, and in theory not only will these be open to porting to Safari, but it could help bolster future development of extensions that work on all browsers.</p>\n<p>Of course, Apple’s also emphasizing the effects of privacy and permissions in these extensions. For example, all extensions can be limited to working only on certain web domains. There are also granular permissions for accessing things like cookies or the current active tab. Extensions can also be configured to prompt the user for permission to access a site, and remember that permission for a certain amount of time—one day, for example. In general, Apple wants to make it transparent to users exactly what they’re allowing an extension to do—much in the same way it handles permissions elsewhere in its operating systems. And, since extensions’ JavaScript executes in a separate space from the JavaScript on a page, it prevents collision (and security problems) by interfering with the operation of a site.</p>\n<p>One thing that I started to wonder about during this talk was the platform availability. All the demos revolved around Safari web extensions available on the Mac, though the talk makes a point of not targeting user agent strings (information a browser reports about its own version and what system it’s running on), but rather asking about features that might be present. Given that other types of Safari extensions <em>are</em> available on iOS/iPadOS (namely content blockers), might web extensions eventually make their way to Apple’s mobile platforms as well? One can hope.</p>\n<h2>iPad and iPhone Apps on Apple Silicon Macs</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/BEB31B52-B45C-4392-AAAD-1AFF16333FF3.jpeg?fit=680%2C680&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"iPad and iPhone Apps on Apple Silicon Macs\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-11534 jetpack-broken-image\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/BEB31B52-B45C-4392-AAAD-1AFF16333FF3.jpeg?resize=680%2C380&#38;ssl=1 680w, https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/BEB31B52-B45C-4392-AAAD-1AFF16333FF3.jpeg?resize=1360%2C761&#38;ssl=1 1360w, https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/BEB31B52-B45C-4392-AAAD-1AFF16333FF3.jpeg?resize=768%2C430&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/BEB31B52-B45C-4392-AAAD-1AFF16333FF3.jpeg?resize=1536%2C859&#38;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/BEB31B52-B45C-4392-AAAD-1AFF16333FF3.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1146&#38;ssl=1 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-image-w=\"680\" data-image-h=\"380\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></p>\n<p>There was perhaps no more surprising announcement during Monday’s keynote than the ability to run iPhone and iPad apps, unmodified, on the upcoming Apple Silicon Macs. In retrospect, given that these new Macs will run on the same processor architecture as Apple’s mobile devices, perhaps that shouldn’t have been a surprise.</p>\n<p>But the ease of it is still kind of mind-blowing. iPad and iPhone apps will run on these Macs without even the need for recompiling. To do so, they’ll leverage the same technology that powers Mac Catalyst: the native Mac version of iOS’s UIKit.</p>\n<p>The big question has been: if apps from iOS will run on macOS so easily, why even bother with converting an app using Mac Catalyst? Well, the latter still offers some benefits: for one thing, since iOS and iPadOS apps will run with no changes, you won’t really be able to customize their behavior on a Mac, meaning that still ultimately feel like iOS apps. For another, these apps <em>only</em> run on Apple Silicon Macs, so if you want to support Intel Macs—and the vast majority of Macs in existence will continue to be Intel Macs for some time yet—then Mac Catalyst is your only option.</p>\n<p>But, if your iOS app is compatible with Apple Silicon Macs—which means it doesn’t require frameworks, functionality, or hardware that is missing on the Mac—it will <em>automatically</em> be available on the Mac. (However, developers can still control which of their apps are actually on the store.)</p>\n<p>To ensure compatibility with the Mac platform, iOS app developers need to account for certain differences in hardware, UI, and system software. That includes everything from including hardware keyboard support (which will make the app a better iPadOS citizen as well) to supporting the Split View in multitasking on iPadOS, which will automatically give your app a resizable window on the Mac. (iPhone apps, however, are not resizable when run on the Mac.) It also means using the right APIs for accessing things like the file system, relying on features like Core Location (rather than specifically GPS, which Macs obviously don’t have), and not hardcoding the types of devices you expect the app to run on, i.e. detecting if this is an “iPad” or an “iPod touch.”</p>\n<p>When it comes to distribution, making an iOS app available on the Mac is basically <em>exactly</em> the same as doing so on iOS, right down to the app thinning methods that deliver only the code needed for that platform. “In fact,” says Patrick Heynen of the Frameworks team, “for app thinning, a new Mac looks just like any other very capable iPad.”</p>\n<p>The only real difference is that the Mac doesn’t support TestFlight for testing distribution…though I have to imagine that it might be on its way at some point.</p>\n<h2>Meet WidgetKit</h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2CC00195-0EC9-44EB-B2B3-6D5FA7647D8B.jpeg?fit=680%2C680&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Meet WidgetKit\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-11535 jetpack-broken-image\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2CC00195-0EC9-44EB-B2B3-6D5FA7647D8B.jpeg?resize=680%2C381&#38;ssl=1 680w, https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2CC00195-0EC9-44EB-B2B3-6D5FA7647D8B.jpeg?resize=1360%2C762&#38;ssl=1 1360w, https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2CC00195-0EC9-44EB-B2B3-6D5FA7647D8B.jpeg?resize=768%2C430&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2CC00195-0EC9-44EB-B2B3-6D5FA7647D8B.jpeg?resize=1536%2C861&#38;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2CC00195-0EC9-44EB-B2B3-6D5FA7647D8B.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1147&#38;ssl=1 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-image-w=\"680\" data-image-h=\"381\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></p>\n<p>There is something very important that Nahir Khan, a manager on the iOS System Experience team, needs you to know about widgets: they are <em>not</em> mini-apps. That means no controls or buttons or sliders. (Sorry, PCalc.)</p>\n<p>Widgets have a very specific use case, defined by three characteristics: glanceable, relevant, and personalized. If you think that sounds familiar, you’re right—they’re the same qualities emphasized by complications on the Apple Watch, and WidgetKit even takes some of its cues from that system. And, as on the Watch, users want their information to be up-to-date and available, since, as Khan cites, people visit their iPhone home screens more than 90 times a day and seeing a bunch of loading spinners every time you go to your homescreen is definitely not a great experience.</p>\n<p>Hence, the widget team has leveraged a similar technology from the Watch complications, building widgets using timelines. Apps can preload the widget with the information the should display at certain times. For example, if your calendar knows you have events at 9am, 9:30am, and 10am, it can give all that information to the widget, which automatically knows what information to display at the current time. If the information in the app changes—whether because it gets a background notification updating it, or a user makes a change—it can tell the widget to reload that information, so it remains up to date.</p>\n<p>What’s cool about widgets is that they work across all different devices, are often available in a variety of sizes, and, because they’re built on the same Intents framework used for Siri and Shortcuts, they can handle configuration automatically. For example, when you go to configure the Stocks widget, it can provide a list of the symbols in the Stocks app—but, if you need to find a stock that’s <em>not</em> already in the Stocks app, it can let the user search and then use the Intents framework to go and search for the right symbol. Basically, this helps make it easier for app developers to add widgets without having to redo all the work they did in their app.</p>\n<p>Even though widgets may not be mini-apps, they do support deep-linking into a certain part of an app. For example, tapping on an album in the Music widget can take you to a view of that album in the app. And is it possible that interactivity might be available in the future? I wouldn’t rule it out, though it seems as though Apple is happy to keep these as mainly readable experiences for the time being.</p>\n<p>Widgets have, of course, been around for a long time on the Mac, where they used to live in Dashboard; more recently, they’ve provided some more minor functionality in the Today view on Apple’s platforms. But with WidgetKit and the changes in iOS 14, it seems clear that they’re about to be catapulted into prime time with their appearance on the iPhone home screen.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 24 Jun 2020 14:24:12 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/54CA1509-4F3E-440A-B58B-E3FE980185A1-680x382.jpeg?fit=680%2C680&ssl=1","linkMd5":"394b4e8d5758a8c3cb1b8e66dbf345d7","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn72@2020_3/2020/08/24/18-19-08-814_7a321c5fc7708f71.webp","destWidth":680,"destHeight":382,"sourceBytes":23108,"destBytes":11114,"author":"Dan Moren","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/54CA1509-4F3E-440A-B58B-E3FE980185A1-680x382.jpeg?fit=680%2C680&ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn72@2020_3/2020/08/24/18-19-08-814_7a321c5fc7708f71.webp","https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/0E9AD5A7-D0AA-4E09-B180-9F41F5571448.jpeg?fit=680%2C680&ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn95@2020_2/2020/08/24/18-19-14-171_bef728e0d1381c46.webp","https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/BEB31B52-B45C-4392-AAAD-1AFF16333FF3.jpeg?fit=680%2C680&ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn11@2020_6/2020/08/24/18-19-15-279_3c70c94286f70c9e.webp","https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2CC00195-0EC9-44EB-B2B3-6D5FA7647D8B.jpeg?fit=680%2C680&ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn63@2020_3/2020/08/24/18-19-15-438_6a883490e6664b60.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144488},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"New Mac ransomware spreading via piracy ↦","link":"https://sixcolors.com/?p=11655","description":"<p>Thomas Reed at Malwarebytes <a href=\"https://blog.malwarebytes.com/mac/2020/06/new-mac-ransomware-spreading-through-piracy/\">reports on some new Mac ransomware</a> and how it works:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  A Twitter user going by the handle @beatsballert messaged me yesterday after learning of an apparently malicious Little Snitch<sup id=\"fnref-11655-snitch\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-11655-snitch\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup> installer available for download on a Russian forum dedicated to sharing torrent links.

Fortunately, there is still an option that integrates a keyboard case with a multitouch-capable trackpad, and it even mostly works: the <a href=\"https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/combo-touch.html\">Logitech Combo Touch</a>.</p>\n<p>The biggest argument in favor of the Combo Touch is that it was developed in concert with Apple. That means that, unlike <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/04/review-brydge-pro-ipad-keyboard-with-trackpad/\">other third-party keyboards with trackpads</a>, there’s a reasonable expectation that the pointer support will work pretty well—and it does! Logitech also has a history of making solid keyboards, and the Combo Touch delivers on that as well.</p>\n<p>Where it’s less good is when you want to do other stuff with it.</p>\n<p>(Before we proceed, I’ll add one big caveat to my assessment: I’ve only tested the Combo Touch in and around my house, because where else can I go right now? It may be a more attractive option for those traveling or even going to the local coffee shop to get some work done, but for obvious reasons, I can only speculate on those uses at present.)</p>\n<h2>It all hinges on this</h2>\n<p>The biggest difference between the Combo Touch and the Magic Keyboard is the lack of the latter’s carefully engineered hinges. Instead, you get a keyboard cover that magnets onto the edge of the iPad, and while it might feel nice and light on its own, that feeling quickly evaporates when you snap the iPad into the back cover, for which it seems as though Logitech turned to the Panasonic Toughbook for inspiration.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, that back cover is a necessary part of the equation, since it also features the kickstand that props up the iPad. I know, I know: everybody hates kickstands. There is some advantage to it here, as it really does provide a wide variation of angles at which to prop your iPad. But it comes with at least two major downsides.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/logitech-combotouch-4.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"Logitech Combo Touch\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>Extending the kickstand nearly doubles the amount of space the iPad takes up.</figcaption></figure><p>First, the wider an angle you use, the more space the whole thing takes up on your desk. Once of the things I love about the Smart Keyboard cover for this iPad is that it’s so compact; even when in keyboard mode, it easily fits on the corner of my desk in a small spot next to my iMac’s Magic Trackpad. The Combo Touch, on the other hand, required me to shift a bunch of stuff around on the desk in order to provide enough space for comfortable typing, and even then it was a less than ideal setup.</p>\n<p>The kickstand is also not ideal for use on the lap. It is doable, but in my experience, it’s awkward, and the angle seems to exert some pressure on the keyboard cover, which causes it to potentially lose contact with the iPad’s Smart Connector; every once in a while, it seemed to suddenly stop working for a split second, then come back a moment later.<sup id=\"fnref-10915-connector\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-10915-connector\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup> Even the Smart Keyboard cover is a better lap-typing solution, in my opinion.</p>\n<h2>Key features</h2>\n<p>The keyboard portion of the Combo Touch is perhaps the best part, once I got an annoying bug squashed. It turns out that either something in Logitech’s firmware or in iOS does not correctly detect the hardware keyboard layout, so I initially found that some keys wouldn’t work, but only in certain states. For example, I could type a “7” but Shift-7 would not type an “&#38;”—I’d get absolutely nothing. The inverse was true for the apostrophe key, where I could not type that punctuation mark, but using it with Shift would correctly generate a quotation mark. Once I manually set Settings &#62; General &#62; Keyboard &#62; Hardware Keyboard to U.S. English, the problems vanished.</p>\n<p>The keys themselves feel good, if it a bit plasticky. Their response and travel are both excellent, though the key caps are a bit smaller than a standard keyboard, especially on the modifier keys. That said, as someone accustomed to the Smart Keyboard cover, I had no trouble writing an entire column on the Combo Touch—or indeed, this very review.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/logitech-combotouch-3.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"Logitech Combo Touch\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></figure><p>Logitech has included one thing Apple’s Magic Keyboard lacks, and that’s a row of half-height function keys. As on a Mac, these let you adjust everything from display brightness to volume to the backlighting on the keyboard itself (take that, Magic Keyboard!). It also provides buttons for Home, locking the display, spotlight, hiding or displaying the onscreen keyboard, and rewind, fast forward, and play/pause. These are welcome additions that make it easy to access these features without having to resort to the touchscreen or trackpad.</p>\n<p>If there’s one addition I’d like to see on this and other iPad keyboards, it’s the return of something deeply ingrained into my muscle memory: the Function key. On Mac keyboards, it’s in the bottom left corner of the keyboard, and not only allows you to access secondary functions of those F-keys, but also other useful features. For example, holding Function and using the up- and down-arrow keys allows you to page up and page down; I haven’t discovered any other keyboard shortcuts for that, though command-up-arrow and command-down-arrow do, as they long have on the Mac, double for Home and End.</p>\n<p>One other shortcoming of the Combo Touch, not shared by the Magic Keyboard, is the lack of an inverted-T layout for the arrow keys. Apple has only recently returned to this vastly superior layout, and Logitech is still using the half height up- and down-arrow keys flanked by full height left- and right-arrow keys. Boo.</p>\n<h2>Tracking signal acquired</h2>\n<p>I know what you’re here for, and it’s trackpad judgment. So believe me when I tell you that the Combo Touch’s trackpad is…fine? Like the Magic Keyboard, it’s smaller than the truly expansive surfaces you get on Apple’s current laptop line, but as someone who’s still using an 11-inch MacBook Air, the smaller size didn’t bother me too much.</p>\n<p>The Combo Touch’s trackpad supports all your standard multitouch gestures, including two-finger scrolling and swiping, three-finger swiping between apps or going to the home screen, and pinch-to-zoom. Many of iPadOS’s gestures felt perfectly natural, while others, like bringing up the Slide Over window or Dock, will definitely take some time to learn—but that’s more on me than on the Combo Touch’s performance.</p>\n<p>The tracking speed is adjustable in Settings, and lets you choose whether or not to activate a tap-to-click feature. Unlike current Macs, the Combo Touch’s trackpad is a real physical button, and requires you to click on the bottom portion, rather than anywhere. Despite that, it has a nice satisfying click, requiring enough pressure that you won’t activate it by accident, while also never being unsure of whether or not you just clicked on something.</p>\n<h2>The case against</h2>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/logitech-combotouch-5.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"Logitech Combo Touch\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></figure><p>As I said up top, if there’s a frustration for the Combo Touch, it’s the enormous, heavy nature of the beast. While the keyboard is easily detachable, allowing you to just use the iPad within the back case, part of me wonders why you’d want to lug around such a heavy monstrosity.</p>\n<p>The case itself weighs 610 grams (1.3lbs), and with my 10.5-inch iPad Pro inside, rings in at a not-so-svelte 1.14 kg, or 2.52lbs. That’s slightly heavier than my 11-inch MacBook Air, which weighs 1.08 kg, or 2.38lbs, but lighter than the 1.29 kg/2.8lbs. of the current 13-inch MacBook Air.</p>\n<figure class=\"pull-right\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/mt.sixcolors.com/images/content/2020/logitech-combotouch-detach.GIF\" alt=\"Detaching the Logitech Combo Touch\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>Detaching the keyboard is easy, but then you’re left with a honking big case.</figcaption></figure><p>However, the advantage of an iPad with a keyboard is you can just pull it off the keyboard and use it as a nice lightweight tablet, right? Well, on the Magic Keyboard you can, but on the Combo Touch, you get to take that back case with you, unless you want to spend the time popping the iPad out again (not particularly difficult, but annoying to do every time you want to ditch the keyboard). Without the keyboard cover, the iPad and case combo weigh in at 829 g or 1.83lbs. Lighter, certainly, but not <em>light</em>—still heavier than either of the current iPad Pro models.</p>\n<p>The case provides the usual features: access to all of the iPad’s ports, cutouts for speakers, mics, and cameras, and rubber covers for the Sleep/Wake button and volume buttons. I found those last kind of difficult to use, since the bumpers around the edges of the case are so thick that it’s hard to tell if you’re pressing the buttons or not, but at least in keyboard mode, you can easily use the function keys for most of the same features.</p>\n<p>The kickstand, as mentioned, provides a variety of viewing angles and pivots smoothly, though I wonder how long its fold/hinge will last. One nicety: a loop attached to the “top” edge of the case allows you to easily store your Apple Pencil when not in use. (You cannot fold the keyboard cover around to the back; it’ll just end up popping off.)</p>\n<p>But I’m not particularly a fan of using the case without the keyboard—the cutout that accommodates the keyboard feels awkward when you’re holding the iPad in portrait mode, especially when combined with the slipperiness of the textured plastic case. (It resembles fabric, but I’m not sure that it actually <em>is</em>.) I also find the pressed-and-sealed edges of the keyboard portion a little bit on the sharp side, and the textured material felt like it could become irritating to your palms if you were typing for long stretches of time.</p>\n<h2>Overall</h2>\n<p>Do I love the Combo Touch? No, not really. But, let’s face it: if you’re considering one, it’s because you have an iPad model that doesn’t support the Magic Keyboard. Right now, at least, the Combo Touch is the only game in town.</p>\n<p>If you really want a portable keyboard/trackpad combination, the Combo Touch is <em>fine</em>. The keyboard and trackpad portions are pretty good, all things considered. Personally, I found myself missing my light, foldable Smart Keyboard cover, and even the siren song of the trackpad was not enough to lure me away for most usage.</p>\n<p>The Combo Touch comes in two models, one that supports the 10.5-inch iPad Pro and the third-generation iPad Air, and another for the seventh-generation iPad. Both cost $150, which is, at least, substantially cheaper than the Magic Keyboard—and definitely cheaper than replacing your current iPad with a new iPad Pro <em>and</em> the Magic Keyboard. So if you’re looking to put off a big purchase for a little while longer, but still want the experience of a trackpad and keyboard on your iPad, the Combo Touch is in the sweet spot—just remember that you get what you pay for.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr><ol><li id=\"fn-10915-connector\">\nI have noticed this even when typing on a flat surface, but it definitely seemed to happen less frequently in that situation.

That’s because I have spent the past few months learning the ins and outs of WordPress and rebuilding the site’s design, created by the talented Christa Mrgan, in an entirely new system. It was an experience.</p>\n<p>Now that we’re on this new platform, which is slightly more actively developed than Movable Type, I can begin to add features that were impossible before. For example, we can now post items to Six Colors that were previously available only in our monthly membership newsletter. This means that members who prefer to read Six Colors on the web or via RSS can now see all those items there rather than in email. (Members, <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/subscribe/\">log in to your member page</a> to get a link to a members-only content RSS feed.)</p>\n<p>This week we’re putting out our June issue of the newsletter, so you’ll be seeing these posts on the site every day. (On the web, they’re marked in purple.) But this is the last time that the volume will be like this. Going forward, there will be an average of one members-only post on the site per week.</p>\n<p>In addition, the Six Colors Podcast is also being posted to the website now. If you’re not a member, you may not know that another member benefit is an exclusive weekly podcast featuring me and Dan Moren chatting about the news of the week in a casual format for about 30 minutes. That podcast will now play right in the browser for logged-in members, and there’s also a member-specific podcast feed available from the Member Center.</p>\n<p>Six Colors memberships help us navigate the complicated waters of being independent writers and podcasters. As you may have noticed, we very rarely have advertising on the site anymore—that source of revenue has dried up over the past couple of years. Today Six Colors is almost entirely supported by members.</p>\n<p>If you’re not currently supporting the site, I hope you <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/subscribe/\">will consider doing so</a> in the future. But I have <em>no plans</em> to turn Six Colors into a membership-only site. We’ll still be posting all the same stories and links here regularly, as we’ve done for more than five years. Only those weekly members-only pieces and weekly podcast posts will be limited.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading Six Colors!

The new models are available for order as of today and start shipping next week.</p>\n<p>The most prominent change, aside from the very welcome keyboard, is that Apple has doubled the base storage across the line; higher configurations now use Intel’s 10th generation processors and make 16GB of RAM standard.</p>\n<p>As on the 16-inch model, the keyboard includes a physical Escape key and inverted-T arrow key layout, as well as the Touch Bar and a Touch ID sensor.</p>\n<p>Aside from the doubling of storage and new keyboard, the $1299 and $1499 models of the 13 inch MacBook Pro remain largely untouched. They feature the same 8th-generation Core i5 processor running at 1.4 GHz as their predecessors. They can be configured with an 8th-generation 1.7GHz Core i7 processor, 16GB of RAM, and up to 2TB of SSD storage.</p>\n<p>The $1799 and $1999 models, on the other hand, now feature the 10th-generation Core i5 processor at 2.0GHz. Additional options include a bump to a 10th-generation Core i7 processor at 2.3GHz, 32 GB of RAM, and up to 4TB of SSD storage–the latter two options are available on this model for the first time. This model can also drive an external display at up to 6K resolution; the lower-end models are limited to one external 5K display or two external 4K displays.</p>\n<p>All models feature the same wide stereo sound and Dolby Atmos support as their 16-inch counterpart, though the 13-inch models lack the six-speaker array. They also feature the beamforming three-mic setup.</p>\n<p>The new models are also slightly thicker at .61 inches instead of .59 inches, and slightly heavier, at 3.1 pounds instead of 3.02 pounds.</p>\n<p>These updates mean that all of Apple’s laptops–as well as the iPad Pro–now use the new Magic Keyboard design. Which means it’s just Apple’s desktop Mac line that is now left out in the cold.

The design of the iMac is stale and in desperate need of reinvention—just as it was <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2019/04/2019-imac-review/\">last year when Apple updated the iMac</a>. But before the transition to Apple silicon arrives, it’s time for one last hurrah.</p>\n<p>The 2020 revision to the 27-inch iMac adds in many (but not all) of the features of the late 2017 iMac Pro. It’s an update with some intriguing options and which addresses some of the iMac line’s most glaring weaknesses. If this is the end of the Intel Mac era, at least it’s going out with a bang.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-12628\"></span></p>\n<h2>Forget about the smaller iMac</h2>\n<p>This update is all about the 27-inch iMac. The 21.5-inch model, which was already a step behind its big brother (using eighth-generation Intel processors, rather than the ninth-generation processors in the 2019 model 27-inch iMac), hasn’t been updated at all.</p>\n<p>The base configurations of both models have been altered to include at least a 256GB solid-state drive for storage, rather than a spinning hard drive. This is a good move. While 256GB of storage isn’t a lot, the speed of an SSD improves the base iMac experience dramatically. Buyers of new iMacs can opt for a 1TB Fusion drive instead for the same price; post-purchase, there are plenty of options out there—including some pretty affordable external SSDs if speed is a priority, and spinning discs if you need a lot of room.</p>\n<p>But that all said, I can’t recommend anyone buying the 21.5-inch 4K iMac right now if you can avoid it. Not only is it old, but it’s a prime candidate to be one of the first Macs to get an Apple silicon makeover.</p>\n<p>The 27-inch iMac, on the other hand, is <em>much</em> more interesting, and worth serious consideration if you’re in the market for a desktop Mac.</p>\n<h2>The big feature</h2>\n<p>Now, this review is going to feature all the stuff you’re used to seeing in a computer review. I promise that there will be some bar charts comparing the speed of the new top-of-the-line iMac to my reliable (and, as of this week, discontinued!) 8-core iMac Pro. I’ll detail some of the internal changes made to these iMacs. There’s more here than you might expect.</p>\n<figure class=\"pull-right\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/imac-2020-glare.jpg?ssl=1\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>This is an approximation of what a reflection (of a floor lamp, right side of the screen) looks like on the nano-texture display. It’s incredibly diffuse.</figcaption></figure><p>But I need to begin with what is probably the single biggest reason people will buy this iMac: As a $500 option, you can trade in the normal glass on the front of the iMac for a glass sheet that’s been etched by Apple to create a glare-killing “nano-texture.” This is the same technique Apple uses to create the $1000 anti-glare option for the Apple Pro Display XDR. It comes with a special cloth you’re supposed to use to clean it. Apple will sell you a replacement cloth for $10 if you lose it.</p>\n<p>But here’s the thing: It’s <em>spectacular.</em> The nano-texture glass doesn’t stop all light from bouncing off the display and back into your eyes, but it cuts it down and diffuses it remarkably. Unlike so many add-on films and coatings that cut down on glare but make a display feel murky or muddy, the iMac’s display feels unnaturally clear. Even with a window directly behind me, I could see everything on the screen clearly.</p>\n<p>If you’re someone who struggles with glare on your monitor, especially if you’re a graphics or video pro for whom every little visual detail matters, you might have sighed at the cost of the Pro Display XDR (let alone the $1000 add-on for the nano-texture). Now it’s here as a $500 option on an iMac. (This is otherwise the same excellent 5K iMac display seen in previous models.) I suspect Apple is going to sell a lot of iMacs just for its nano-texture display.</p>\n<h2>Inherited from other Macs</h2>\n<p>If this is the last Intel iMac, at least the 2020 27-inch iMac takes advantage of the last few years of Mac progress. (Better late than never!)</p>\n<p>Most of these new features spring from the addition of the T2 processor <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3245764/the-t2-chip-makes-the-imac-pro-the-start-of-a-mac-revolution.html\">introduced with the iMac Pro in 2017</a>. This Apple-designed coprocessor replaces a bunch of other chips and enables all sorts of features, like “Hey Siri,” seamless disk encryption, and even digital signal processing that can dynamically adjust the settings of the iMac’s webcam. (It’s now a 1080 HD camera, by the way, also matching the iMac Pro.)</p>\n<p>Though the iMac’s speakers haven’t changed, Apple says that the audio is also processed by the T2, as it is on the 16-inch MacBook Pro. This allows Apple to dynamically adjust EQ settings as volume levels change, which should make quieter volumes still have more audible bass. I am happy to report that the iMac’s speakers do sound very good.</p>\n<p>Another feature <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2019/11/macbook-pro-16/\">picked up from the 16-inch MacBook Pro</a> is what Apple is calling a “studio quality” microphone. It’s actually three microphones in an array; there are two behind invisible microperforations in the iMac’s aluminum chin, just to the right of the Apple logo, and another one in a visible microperforation on the machine’s back side. The iMac processes the signal from those three microphones and cancels out echo and background noise, improving audio whether you’re creating a song demo in GarageBand or just talking to your colleagues in a videoconference.</p>\n<p>I recorded my voice on the new iMac and on my iMac Pro’s built-in microphone, and honestly I think I preferred the recording from the iMac Pro. I’m sure that in certain circumstances these microphones can provide good-enough audio, but I have to admit that I’m a little baffled about how Apple can call them “studio quality,” because I would be quite disappointed if someone sent me an audio file of this quality after a podcast recording session.</p>\n<p>This new 27-inch iMac also adds support for TrueTone, which uses a light sensor to automatically match the white point of the iMac’s display to the predominant color temperature of its locale. (And yes, you can turn it off if you don’t want your display’s white point shifting all the time.) And like the Mac mini before it, the 27-inch iMac can now optionally be configured with support for 10-Gigabit Ethernet (which comes standard on the iMac Pro).</p>\n<h2>10 generations, 10 cores</h2>\n<p>If it’s a last hurrah, the iMac is going out with a bang—the latest and greatest 10th-generation Intel core processors. Most impressive is the fact that the high-end model, which is the one I tested, has ten processor cores. It’s so many cores, in fact, that it’s shamed the old eight-core right out of existence—now the base-model iMac Pro is the ten-core version.</p>\n<p>That’s probably a good move, since in my tests, the 10-core i9 iMac configuration beat the pants off of my poor 8-core iMac Pro. Last year’s top-of-the-line iMac beat my iMac Pro at many tests, but the ol’ girl eked out a few wins of her own. This year, it’s no contest.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2020-imac-chart.png?resize=1172%2C1360&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>With the addition of so many new features and these powerful new processors, it’s worth asking the question: why pay $4999 for an iMac Pro when you can spend $3299 for an iMac with similar specs?</p>\n<p>Well, you probably shouldn’t. But while the iMac Pro may start at 10 cores, it does go up to 18 cores—a configuration that will cost a lot more, but will also deliver greater performance. If you need copious amounts of multi-core performance, the iMac Pro can deliver.</p>\n<p>The other reason is, quite simply, the robustness of the iMac Pro cooling system. The iMac’s cooling system, while upgraded somewhat in order to account for the new processors, is still much weaker than the system in the iMac Pro. When running my speed tests for this review, the iMac’s fans spun up immediately and were clearly audible as long as the computer was under load. My iMac Pro, on the other hand, didn’t break a sweat as it silently blew hot air out of its superior cooling system. If fan noise matters to you, the iMac Pro wins hands down. But no nano-texture display for you!</p>\n<h2>Where do we go from here?</h2>\n<p>Should you buy a new Mac when Apple is about to switch up the Mac’s chip architecture? It depends on your worldview. If you want to be on the cutting edge, this new iMac will feel outmoded within months. But if you want a reliable and powerful computer that’s based on well-understood technology that will serve you well for years, this iMac will deliver.</p>\n<p>Which leads me to ponder what happens next for the iMac. As I <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3569949/where-does-the-imac-go-from-here.html\">wrote at Macworld earlier this week</a>, it feels like this 27-inch iMac refresh allows Apple to attend to some other, more needy products in the earliest days of the transition to Apple silicon.</p>\n<p>There’s not a Mac more needy than the smaller iMac. Perhaps the little buddy will blaze a trail for its larger sibling to follow. I love the iMac, but it’s wearing a bit thin. It’s time for a regeneration. I hope that this new 27-inch iMac, as impressive as it is, is remembered as the last (and best) of its kind.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 06 Aug 2020 16:00:08 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/imac2020.jpeg?ssl=1","linkMd5":"548e18c1ffeb9192d9f1ab051251e1ed","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn12@2020_4/2020/08/24/18-19-09-144_431420d418531de6.webp","destWidth":1360,"destHeight":964,"sourceBytes":132061,"destBytes":51600,"author":"Jason Snell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/imac2020.jpeg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn12@2020_4/2020/08/24/18-19-09-144_431420d418531de6.webp","https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/imac-2020-glare.jpg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn43@2020_3/2020/08/24/18-19-13-078_7893e6b9b52763c3.webp","https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2020-imac-chart.png?resize=1172%2C1360&ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn91@2020_1/2020/08/24/18-19-16-417_22f2ae16275d3758.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144168},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"Apple Q3 2020 results: Everything up","link":"https://sixcolors.com/?p=12507","description":"<p>Apple’s results for its most recent financial quarter <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/07/apple-reports-third-quarter-results/\">are out</a> and they’re really good.

The AV Club <a href=\"https://tv.avclub.com/fox-redesigns-its-nfl-graphics-for-the-point-your-phone-1841522459\">reviews Fox’s new NFL graphics</a>, which debuted on the Super Bowl broadcast last Sunday:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  As Kansas City Chiefs kick returner (and buffet line troublemaker) Mecole Hardman carried the opening kickoff out of the end zone, Fox unveiled its new look. It happened without an excess of ceremony, unlike everything else that day. A tight formation of parallelograms unfurled at the bottom of the screen. The words “49ERS” and “CHIEFS” glided into view and faded away, replaced by logos of the respective teams—logos so large that no parallelogram can contain them, but these parallelograms try their best nevertheless.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>It’s a good overview and, overall, a good package. Though I’m not entirely convinced that using gold as the fill color in the 49ers score box is the right idea, since they were wearing white shirts. One of the pieces of information that broadcast graphics can convey quickly is which team is wearing which color. That’s less important in a high-profile game like the Super Bowl, but more important if you’re broadcasting the XFL or college football. By using white numbers in the score box, it seems that Fox is unable to display a white background for a team wearing white.</p>\n<p>[<em>via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tvaziri/status/1225905096124317697\">Todd Vaziri</a></em>]</p><p><a href=\"https://tv.avclub.com/fox-redesigns-its-nfl-graphics-for-the-point-your-phone-1841522459\">Go to the linked site</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/link/2020/02/fox-redesigns-its-nfl-graphics/\">Read on Six Colors</a>.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 07 Feb 2020 15:50:29 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"f9547a29e5c5c7a02095fe2fe0dc5237","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jason Snell","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144631},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"Apple reports a record $91.8 billion holiday quarter","link":"http://two.wordpress.test/post/2020/01/apple_reports_a_record_918_billion_holiday_quarter/","description":"<p>Apple announced that its calendar 2019 holiday quarter (the first quarter of its fiscal 2020) was its all-time best in terms of revenue, with a total of $91.8 billion, with a $22.2 billion profit.

Work is starting to resume around the country, but we are experiencing a slower return to normal conditions than we had anticipated. As a result, we do not expect to meet the revenue guidance we provided for the March quarter due to two main factors.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>To wit: 1) factories making iPhones that were closed have reopened, but production is ramping up only slowly, meaning units will be constrained; 2) all of Apple’s brick-and-mortar stores in China have been closed, as well as many of its partners.</p>\n<p>This is the second time in two years that Apple has had to adjust earnings expectations—it did so in January of 2019 due in large part to currency exchange rates and phone launch timing. In both cases, the factors at play were difficult (if not impossible to predict), though this year’s outbreak is certainly even more complex.</p>\n<p>Apple didn’t provide revised earnings estimates in its press release, as it did in 2019, but the company had previously issued guidance of between $63 billion and $67 billion in revenue.</p>\n<p>Long term, this is probably not a big deal. Apple will be far from the only company impacted by this, and as the press release points out, it’s only a temporary disruption. But this is an unprecedented situation that’s already having significant repercussions throughout the tech community, such as the recent cancellation of the upcoming Mobile World Congress trade show. We’ll have to wait until April to find out just how much of a dent this made in the company’s earnings.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/02/investor-update-on-quarterly-guidance/\">Go to the linked site</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/link/2020/02/apple-warns-of-q2-earnings-miss-due-to-coronavirus/\">Read on Six Colors</a>.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 17 Feb 2020 13:31:00 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"4f7b4c896f096eb1a9f9c315bc9dda25","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Dan Moren","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144649},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"Oscar winner Taika Waititi tells Apple to fix its keyboards ↦","link":"http://two.wordpress.test/post/2020/02/oscar-winner_taika_waititi_tells_apple_to_fix_its_keyboards/","description":"<p>Taika Waititi, director of <em>Thor: Ragnarok</em>, the upcoming <em>Thor: Love &#38; Thunder</em>, <em>What We Do in the Shadows</em>, as well as this year’s Academy Award winner for Best Adapted Screenplay, really thinks Apple should fix those MacBook keyboards:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Taika Waititi jokes about what writers should be asking for in the next round of talks with producers: “Apple needs to fix those keyboards.

For example, if you’re on the command line and you need to go to a folder buried deep within several subfolders, you have a few options.

The lingering danger of something going wrong with the demo is palpable, and that’s what makes live events great…. I want to see a show, not watch a marketing video. The risk of live is what makes it.</p>\n<p>  The technical sessions were also all pre-recorded this year … and they should keep them that way. It was brilliant. The seminar format conveyed the information with more detail and more clarity. For learning materials, that’s exactly what you want….</p>\n<p>  In the hypothetical future, WWDC would still be an in-person event with consumer Keynote and developer State of the Union presentations on the Monday. Session videos would then be released that evening, leaving the rest of the week for extended labs, mixers and hands-on workshops for the developers in attendance.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>I don’t know if WWDC will ever return in its prior form, but if it does come back in some way, I agree with this view—the technical sessions being pre-recorded was a smash hit. Maybe the keynote and State of the Union events could be live in front of an audience, and there’s a question about how to fill out the rest of the week. But the bottom line is, I want WWDC to return in person <em>and</em> I want the technical sessions to be like WWDC 2020 forever.</p><p><a href=\"https://bzamayo.com/prerecorded-wwdc-format\">Go to the linked site</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/link/2020/07/benjamin-mayo-on-wwdcs-format/\">Read on Six Colors</a>.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 13 Jul 2020 20:05:14 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"3f8b22429d4f56fb23898bcfd183c0bb","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jason Snell","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144237},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"(Podcast) The Rebound 295: That’s What I Learned From Jurassic Park","link":"https://sixcolors.com/?p=11502","description":"<p>Apple announced many things!

The left sidebar can come and go with a swipe.</figcaption></figure><p>I’ve been using Fantastical as my calendar app across all my devices for years now. I’ve come to appreciate its thoughtful interface and its excellent natural-language parsing for event entry.</p>\n<p>But with <a href=\"http://flexibits.com/fantastical\">Fantastical 3</a>, Flexibits has transformed the product—it’s got a refined new look, yes, but what’s going on behind the scenes is the biggest part of the story. With this release, Fantastical is now stepping away from its attachment to Apple’s built-in calendar database, adding the ability to connect to all sorts of calendar and task services. It’s also connecting with Flexibits’s own new cloud service, which adds a slew of new features—and further possibilities down the line.</p>\n<p>As you might expect in this era of App Store apps, there’s also a new payment model for the app. Existing Fantastical 2 users will be able to upgrade and get access to all the version 2 features while using version 3. But access to the new features (across Mac, iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch) will require a $5/month or $40/year subscription.</p>\n<p>“Every month we’re making the app better,” Michael Simmons of Flexibits told me during our briefing, explaining that the company’s goal is to regularly roll out new features to the apps and via the cloud service. Flexibits seems to understand that asking for a subscription means delivering new stuff on a regular basis, rather than dropping a standalone update and then going into hibernation while the subscription fees roll in.</p>\n<p>If you’re offended by the idea that a calendar app would want you to pay $40/year for its services, that’s fine—every device you use has a built-in calendar app that’s free to use and does the job fine. If you want more, you can pay for more<sup id=\"fnref-4076-more\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-4076-more\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup>—and if you’re a version 2 user who doesn’t like the subscription model, Flexibits isn’t going to force you to upgrade unless you want those new features. (<em>Update:</em> Version 3 seems to nag version 2 owners way too aggressively about upgrading, though. Flexibits needs to back off a bit.)</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/fc-week-mac-6c.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>The Mac version, showing off the time zone sidebar (far right) and per-day weather at the top.</figcaption></figure><p>Now, about those new features.</p>\n<p>I’m a fan of the direct connection to calendar services, because a lot of the weird quirks I’ve experienced with my calendars end up being quirks of Apple’s calendar syncing system, including random duplicate alerts from both Calendar and Fantastical. By default Fantastical 3 will keep using Apple’s calendars on iOS, but I added my Google calendar and turned off calendar syncing in iOS’s Passwords &#38; Accounts setting, meaning there’s just one set of calendar data on my devices now, and it’s in Fantastical.</p>\n<p>To use Fantastical 3, you have to sign up for a free Flexibits account, whether or not you subscribe to the new features. By offering its own cloud-syncing service, Flexibits says that it can keep better the apps and their preferences in sync across devices. Calendar sets, for example, are now available on iOS, making it easy to toggle between different views of different calendars.</p>\n<figure class=\"pull-right\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/fc3-dark-iphone-6c.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"fc3-dark-iphone\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>You can now easily change between calendar sets on iOS.</figcaption></figure><p>The Flexibits cloud service also lets the company build additional features that go beyond standard calendar protocols. For example, Fantastical 3 launches with a cloud meeting scheduler that will generate emails and try to negotiate a common time among invitees, and then send out official invites. You make the proposal from within Fantastical, the cloud service does the rest.</p>\n<p>I’m enjoying a bunch of the extra data sources Flexibits has pumped into the app, as well. There’s now AccuWeather data on my weekly calendar, so I can see that today’s rainy but tomorrow it’s going to be sunny and warmer, all at a glance. Clicking on an event with an associated location will display a map and a weather forecast for that event—so you’ll know if it’s going to snow when you’re on that business trip to Denver.</p>\n<p>Fantastical 3 also offers “interesting” third-party calendars via <a href=\"https://www.schedjoules.com\">Schedjoules</a>, so you can add things like TV shows and sports teams to your calendar directly from within Fantastical (without searching for a remote calendar subscription URL).</p>\n<p>Despite a lifelong aversion to task management, I’ve been using Todoist for a while to track some of my recurring tasks. It’s going pretty well, but I’m more enthusiastic about it now that I can view my tasks right within Fantastical 3 via its direct Todoist integration. (The app also supports Google Tasks and iCloud Reminders.)</p>\n<p>I’m also taking advantage of Fantastical’s integration with Zoom (and Google Hangouts) for meeting scheduling. After linking my Zoom account to Fantastical, I’m able to generate Zoom meeting invitation URLs right within an event, rather than needing to open the Zoom app.</p>\n<p>There’s improved time zone support, too. You can set up favorite time zones, and then click any event to see what time it will take place in those locations. You can also optionally display a second time zone on your calendar, on the side, if you find yourself endlessly adding or subtracting hours to figure out what time it is wherever your collaborators are today.</p>\n<p>I’m also thrilled to report that Fantastical’s natural-language parser has finally been upgraded to intelligently parse repeating events, something that I could never get to work right. If I type “Picard every Wednesday at 11pm for 9 weeks” it does the right thing and creates an event called <em>Picard</em> on Wednesdays at 11pm, with the repeat ending in nine weeks. Similarly, “Newsletter check third thursday of every month” will do exactly what you’d expect it to do.</p>\n<p>While the Mac version of Fantastical has tended to be more full featured than its iOS variants, with this release the iOS apps are more or less at parity with the Mac version. The iPad version, which I never really liked, is <em>vastly</em> improved, with a better calendar view and an optional event-list sidebar that you can drag in and out with the swipe. It mirrors the excellent iPhone interface, which has been retained. Even the Apple Watch app can work in standalone mode, so if I’m out running with just my cellular watch, I can get a live view of my calendar.</p>\n<p>I realize that a premium calendar app is not for everyone—and free calendar apps and services abound. But I’ve always felt that Fantastical was worth the extra price, and this new slew of features hasn’t changed my mind. This is an impressive update.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr><ol><li id=\"fn-4076-more\">\nIf you think you can pay a developer once and you own their work forever, check your entitlement. <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fnref-4076-more\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/21a9.png\" alt=\"↩\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></a>\n</li>\n</ol></div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 29 Jan 2020 07:00:00 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/fc3-ipad-frame-6c.jpg?ssl=1","linkMd5":"3dcdedce3260f008aed9dede7a7992e0","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn56@2020_3/2020/08/24/18-19-09-990_f9a16e9be7e62e67.webp","destWidth":1360,"destHeight":1046,"sourceBytes":51400,"destBytes":51400,"author":"Jason Snell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/fc3-ipad-frame-6c.jpg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn56@2020_3/2020/08/24/18-19-09-990_f9a16e9be7e62e67.webp","https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/fc-week-mac-6c.jpg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn39@2020_2/2020/08/24/18-19-15-995_887dce8ee5b4b3b8.webp","https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/fc3-dark-iphone-6c.jpg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn12@2020_3/2020/08/24/18-19-14-123_cc838108ecb9d9fe.webp","https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/21a9.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn51@2020_2/2020/08/24/18-19-11-215_25686225908fe44d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144647},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"The Comeback of Fun in Visual Design ↦","link":"https://sixcolors.com/?p=11989","description":"<p>Designer Michael Flarup <a href=\"https://applypixels.com/blog/comeback\">suggests</a> that macOS Big Sur will start the pendulum swinging back away from minimalism and toward richness, across the entire technology industry:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  Given the chance of a redesign on the mac, Apple did <strong>not</strong> choose minimalism as the single guiding design pillar.

A basic package will include Apple Music and Apple TV+, while a more expensive variation will have those two services and the Apple Arcade gaming service. The next tier will add Apple News+, followed by a pricier bundle with extra iCloud storage for files and photos.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Gurman’s careful to note that the bundle plans may change—which should go without saying, given that this is still a few months off. But the proposed structure here is interesting. Layering TV+ and Music at the base makes sense on the face of it: they’re both media services and Apple has a ton of control over how it sells TV+ (witness the free year that it offered along with device purchases starting last fall). Music is also probably one of the company’s strongest both in terms of paid subscribers and in terms of how it structures its deals with content providers.</p>\n<p>Arcade makes sense as an add-on. After an initial burst of enthusiasm, its adoption seems to have slowed somewhat, which jibes with recent reports that Apple was <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-30/apple-cancels-arcade-games-in-strategy-shift-to-keep-subscribers\">reconsidering its strategy</a>. And News+ has been glacial in its pick-up by both consumers and news providers alike.</p>\n<p>Which leaves us with iCloud, thrown in there at the end with a shrug. It’s perhaps the least interesting of Apple’s services, but also among the most in demand, thanks in no small part to the measly 5GB of standard storage the company continues to offer for free. By putting that at the high end of the pay list, users who want that storage may be convinced to fork over more money with the philosophy that at least they get a bunch of stuff thrown in (even if it’s stuff they don’t want).</p>\n<p>Or, as one of the biggest and catchiest lies in capitalism has always put forth: “the more you spend, the more you save.”<sup id=\"fnref-12714-themoreyouspend\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-12714-themoreyouspend\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>One additional tidbit that Gurman mentions is that Apple is working on a new subscription service focused around fitness, à la offerings from Nike. Given the rebranding of the Activity app to Fitness, and Apple’s continuing interests in health, this seems utterly plausible.</p>\n<p>The bottom line seems to be that consumers will save $2-5 a month via bundle pricing. Which isn’t <em>nothing</em>, especially given the amount most consumers are probably paying for their mountain of subscriptions these days, but also may not prove that attractive.

That’s thanks in no small part to the NYT Crossword app’s tracking of your streak-how many days you’ve done the crossword puzzle on the day it comes out, without resorting to using its check or solve features.</p>\n<p>As I write this, my streak stands at a rather paltry 36 days.&#8230;</p> <p>This story is for Six Colors members only. <strong><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/subscribe/\">Become a member</a></strong> to get access to exclusive stories, podcasts, and community..</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Sat, 29 Feb 2020 17:05:09 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/nyt-crossword.jpeg?ssl=1","linkMd5":"4a8519cd223de4f111f439a9e63e9359","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn68@2020_6/2020/08/24/18-19-09-616_9d56dbead5a7ca2d.webp","destWidth":1360,"destHeight":1020,"sourceBytes":178793,"destBytes":96586,"author":"Dan Moren","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/nyt-crossword.jpeg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn68@2020_6/2020/08/24/18-19-09-616_9d56dbead5a7ca2d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144612},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"(Podcast) Upgrade #304: Somebody’s Gotta Do It and It’s Gonna Be Us","link":"https://sixcolors.com/?p=11629","description":"<p>This week we welcome Apple’s Bob Borchers and Ronak Shah to the show to discuss macOS Big Sur, including all the new features in Safari.

On Thursday Epic turned on a new Fortnite feature and <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/the-fortnite-mega-drop-permanent-discounts-up-to-20-percent\">trumpeted it in a press release</a>—it was bringing direct purchase of digital goods to its iOS and Google Play apps, and at substantial discounts to buying through the purchase methods offered by Apple and Google.</p>\n<p>Of course, this is a violation of the terms of both app stores, and Epic knew it would get shut down on both platforms. Which it did. But no worries—it had a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euiSHuaw6Q4&#38;feature=youtu.be\">video mocking Apple for the decision</a> ready to drop, and <a href=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/apple-complaint-734589783.pdf\">a lawsuit ready to be filed</a>.</p>\n<p>This is not the usual story of a developer accidentally stepping into a confusing App Store policy, or even of a developer gently pushing the limits of the App store rules only to be rebuked. I doubt Epic Games has any expectation that they’ll be able to use this publicity as leverage to get Apple and Google to agree to different payment terms. That ship has sailed. What Epic Games wants to do is go to war with Apple and Google—in both actual courts and, more importantly, in the court of public opinion.</p>\n<p>What Epic Games seems to want is for it to be illegal for platform owners to force software developers through a single commerce engine, from which the platform owners skim a percentage of the take. Epic’s behavior on Android suggests that it’s not <em>really</em> advocating for the freedom to sideload its app on iOS—because it knows that it would likely be an even worse user experience than what it found on Android. Epic wants the freedom to install its own sales engine in its app and keep all the money.</p>\n<p>Epic also knows that this is all happening at a time where stories of large tech companies using their power to increase their control and profitability are breaking on a regular basis. Legislators and regulators have threatened to investigate and punish big tech companies, including Apple and Google. This is another log on the fire.</p>\n<p>How this will end is anyone’s guess. It will be interesting to see how the tech giants play this. I really do believe that, if left to its own devices, Apple would simply shrug and walk away, leaving Epic unable to reach people who want to play Fortnite on an iPhone or iPad. But surely Apple is also considering the potential threat of government intervention in its business. If I were at Apple, I would rate that threat as one of the top two existential threats to Apple. (The other is Apple’s reliance on China both as a place to sell products and as its manufacturing hub, given the deteriorating relationship between it and the U.S.)</p>\n<p>This goes beyond arguing over money. Should Apple be allowed to keep Microsoft’s game-streaming service off its platforms? Should the maker of any computing platform be able to set itself up as the arbiter of what software and services can run on it? Right now, companies have a great deal of latitude in this area—which is why the Mac has a free and open software market and the iPad and iPhone don’t.</p>\n<p>My inclination is that Apple should compete on the merits of its features, rather than winning because it’s the only option. Apple’s in-app purchase system will be simpler, more convenient, and more familiar to most users of its platforms. Add in Sign In With Apple and Apple Pay and things could become even more frictionless. If Apple is afraid that video-game-streaming services threaten the future of games in the App Store, I can relate—but if that’s truly the future of gaming, Apple won’t prevent it from coming true by banning the future from its store. It’ll just end up being behind the times.</p>\n<p>But this is a complicated, multi-faceted issue. Every time I try to simplify it, it gets more unwieldy. In the end, Apple can do what it wants—but it risks losing control of its platform if governments decide that what it’s doing needs to change.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/the-fortnite-mega-drop-permanent-discounts-up-to-20-percent\">Go to the linked site</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/link/2020/08/tired-of-paying-fees-to-platform-owners-epic-games-goes-to-court/\">Read on Six Colors</a>.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 23:32:31 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"6546936e6958aa2b3440945c48bf66a9","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jason Snell","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144124},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"Service Station: iPhone Upgrade Program (Member Post)","link":"https://sixcolors.com/?p=11631","description":"<figure class=\"pull-right\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/iPhone-11-lineup.jpeg?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>After years of spending every fall hemming and hawing over whether or not I was going to buy a new iPhone, I decided in 2015 to sign up for Apple’s newly unveiled iPhone Upgrade Program. First offered alongside the iPhone 6s, the Upgrade Program allows you to pay for your phone on a month-by-month basis over the course of two years. While that might not save you on the cost of the phone outright, it helped avoid having to plop down several thousand dollars in a single go.</p>\n<p>But, of course, the kicker is that after twelve months of payments, iPhone Upgrade Program members are eligible to send back their current phone and upgrade to a new phone—and, conveniently enough, that’s usually how long Apple goes between new iPhone models. (What a coincidence.) The Upgrade Program also bundles in AppleCare+, though you don’t get a discounted price: again, it’s just the full cost of the AppleCare+ service plan, divided by twenty-four.</p>\n<p>Five years later, I’ve remained a happy Upgrade Program subscriber. Not only has it removed having to worry about whether or not I’ll get a new phone each year, but Apple has greatly improved how the program works.

I deleted the reference because I thought the thought deserved its own chart and its own article, which is this one.</p>\n<p>Here’s the chart: This is total Apple revenue for each fiscal year (shifted a quarter from the real calendar—on January 28 we’ll hear the results of Apple’s fiscal first quarter of 2020) since 2009.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/decade-apple-revenue-6c.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"A decade of Apple revenue.\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Apple left the previous decade<sup id=\"fnref-4063-decade\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-4063-decade\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup> as a company that was generating 43 billion dollars in revenue every fiscal year. It exited the 2010s generating 260 billion. Or to put it another way, The Apple of January 2020 is roughly six times the size of the Apple of January 2010.</p>\n<p>I have been making charts based on Apple’s financials every three months for most of the last decade, and if there’s one thing that I think the charts don’t properly convey, it’s just how explosive Apple’s growth has been. The iPhone’s growth in the middle of the decade changed the game. And while that growth has slowed or stopped, it leaves Apple as a company that is working at a scale that’s nothing like it was when Steve Jobs was in his final years as CEO.</p>\n<p>Let’s break that growth down by product line.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/decade-iphone-revenue-6c.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"iPhone sales figures\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Apple’s iPhone growth essentially parallels its overall growth. The iPhone is the engine that drove Apple’s growth in the 2010s, peaking at $165 billion in revenue in 2018. In 2011, Apple made more money on the iPhone than the entire company had earned just two years earlier. When you can increase your revenue in a product category by an order of magnitude in a decade, you’ve had a <em>really</em> good decade.</p>\n<p>This is not to say that Apple’s other product lines didn’t have success in the decade.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/decade-ipad-revenue-6c.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"iPad sales figures\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Yes, the iPad peaked early, with three $30 billion years from 2012 to 2014. But it’s settled in as a $20 billion/year business, which is pretty good—and keep in mind, the iPad didn’t exist until the spring of 2010.</p>\n<p>The Mac’s story in the 2010s is less dramatic:</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/decade-mac-revenue-6c.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"Mac sales figures\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The decade was clearly a success for the Mac, but it was an incremental success. The Mac business didn’t quite double between 2009 and 2019, but it came close. The first decade of this century was one of enormous growth for the Mac, but this one was still pretty good, if not spectacular.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-4063\"></span></p>\n<p>If charts don’t always clearly portray just how much Apple’s business has grown over the decade, they <em>really</em> obscure just how huge the iPhone is compared to Apple’s businesses. I try to get it across in other chart types, but these historical revenue charts never do it justice because the scale of the charts doesn’t match.</p>\n<p>So this time, I thought I’d match the scales. The Mac and iPad charts above are both at the same scale. Below I’ll leave the iPhone revenue chart for the decade, at the same scale as the Mac and iPad.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/decade-iphone-revenue-scale-6c.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"decade-iphone-revenue-scale\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr><ol><li id=\"fn-4063-decade\">\nIf you want to argue that the decade of the 2020s does not include 2020 but <em>does</em> include 2030, take your coat and go.

Apple’s final near-death experience and subsequent revival has wiped away a lot of memories of the darkest era in Apple history. Apple introduced <a href=\"https://lowendmac.com/1994/blackbird-the-powerbook-500-series/\">the PowerBook 500 series</a> to replace the original PowerBooks, and the original laptops proved to be a tough act to follow. It got worse during the transition to PowerPC processors, when the new PowerBook 5300 arrived—and erased all the goodwill Apple had built up over the years.</p>\n<p>The PowerBook 500 series was code-named Blackbird, and while they look boxy by today’s standards, they were much curvier than the original PowerBooks, made of lighter-weight plastics and with a redesigned keyboard that added a row of function keys (and a properly placed escape key). They were also, unfortunately, a lot heavier.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/macworld-blackbird.jpeg?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>(Macworld magazine, July 1994.)</figcaption></figure><p>Most notably, Blackbird replaced the trackball of the original PowerBook line with a completely new sort of device. It’s so easy to point and laugh now, like watching cave people discover fire, but at the time the little spinning trackball of the PowerBook was one of the device’s most iconic features. Explaining what was replacing it took a little bit of effort.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/trackpad.jpeg?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>Someone had to popularize the trackpad.</figcaption></figure><p>It was “what Apple calls a <em>trackpad</em>, a slightly recessed rectangle of black composite material,” according to <em>MacUser</em>. Most MacUser editors who tried it preferred it to the trackball.</p>\n<p>MacWEEK referred to it this way:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  A rectangular, high-resolution touch pad that controls the pointer. Called Midas TouchPad, it reportedly uses special tracking software to increase the distance the mouse travels across the screen the faster a user’s finger moves on the touch pad’s glass. Sources said Midas takes some getting used to, but it is both more reliable and accurate than a trackball.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Trackpad? TouchPad? Midas? I dunno. Whatever you call it, it’s still going strong 25 years later.</p>\n<p>Blackbird was modular, too: it had two battery bays, but you could remove one of the batteries and instead replace it with other accessories that could be directly plugged into the PowerBook’s processor. The $199 PowerBook Expansion Module let you use PCMCIA expansion cards, which were becoming common on PC laptops. But the module was wonky and Mac support for PC Cards was almost nonexistent and the module didn’t even quite meet the actual PCMCIA standard so some stuff just… didn’t work.</p>\n<p>Blackbird also rolled out just after the Mac had begun its transition to using PowerPC processors, but they were built with older-generation Motorola 68030 processors instead. To make Blackbird not seem instantly outdated (although it sort of was!), Apple promoted all the 500-series PowerBooks as “PowerPC upgradeable” via an add-on daughtercard that would be available in 1995. But at launch Apple had no price estimates or spec details for those upgrades.</p>\n<p>Turns out, Apple was really slow to offer those upgrades. So slow, in fact, that they were beaten to the punch by Newer Technology, which offered the NUpowr upgrade card for 500-series PowerBooks. Not only did Newer beat Apple’s single upgrade to market, but the Newer upgrade cards ran a faster processor than the one in Apple’s kit.</p>\n<figure class=\"pull-right\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/powerpc-powerbook.jpeg?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>At long last, a PowerPC PowerBook. But about that battery…</figcaption></figure><p>It was a bumpy ride, but a year later, it got bumpier. In 1995, the PowerBook finally entered the PowerPC world, with the PowerBook 5300. (So named because Power PowerBook would’ve been a <em>really</em> dumb name.) The 5300 was a boxier design—in the articles from the time, the disappointment over the design is palpable (“The industrial design is still PC wannabe!” raved MacWEEK’s Andrew Gore)—and it made a bad first impression.</p>\n<p>This is a laptop that shipped too soon, with buggy software—and it was savaged in early reviews. MacWEEK gave it “one of the worst [reviews the publication had] ever given an Apple product,” citing frequent system crashes that rendered two of their review models unusable. A software update <em>five months</em> after release fixed some of these problems, but many early 5300 logic boards were lemons, and needed to be completely replaced. Repairs could take as much as a month.</p>\n<p>There was a built-in PC card slot that actually met the standard, which was good… because you’d need to use it if you wanted to connect the PowerBook to Ethernet or use a modem, since Apple removed both of those networking ports from the 5300. (That’s okay, I’m sure networking isn’t important to a laptop.)</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/5300-side.jpeg?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>The floppy drive was removable, but it wasn’t a space large enough to hold a CD-ROM drive.</figcaption></figure><p>Like the Blackbird, the PowerBook 5300 also had two expansion bays. One was reserved for a swappable battery, and the other came with a floppy drive that could be swapped out for other devices—though very few of them every really came to fruition. The real tragedy here is that this was the heyday of the CD-ROM—people were playing Myst and reading Cinemania and watching a tiny, tiny QuickTime movie of A Hard Day’s Night on their desktop Macs—and Apple somehow designed the PowerBook 5300 with a removable storage bay that was too small to fit a CD-ROM disc.</p>\n<p>It gets worse. The PowerBook 5300 shipped with a cool new battery technology, a Sony-supplied Lithium Ion battery. You can probably guess what happened next—this was the Galaxy Note of its era. A few of the Lithium Ion batteries caught fire, although fortunately not while in the hands of consumers. Regardless, Apple had to recall the 5300’s batteries and replace them with less efficient Nickel Metal Hydride batteries.</p>\n<p>Talk about a messy roll-out: Here’s our new laptop! It caught on fire, wait, we’ll be right back! Now here’s our new laptop, now with 70 percent less battery!</p>\n<figure class=\"pull-right\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pittelkau-cover.jpeg?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><br></figure><p>In 1995 I was a junior editor at <em>MacUser</em> and I remember that once a week, we’d get our delivery of copies of our sister publication <em>MacWEEK</em>, which was the newspaper of record for the Mac world. And for most of the summer of 1995, I’d read about the latest scandal involving Apple’s PowerBook 5300 roll-out disaster as I walked to buy my lunch at the sandwich shop across a large lawn from our office building. It’s a strong sense memory of mine: Lawn, sun, brown paper bag from Togo’s, and a copy of <em>MacWEEK</em> detailing just how terrible Apple’s laptops were doing.</p>\n<p>The PowerBook 5300 series was star crossed from beginning to end. It survived for about a year before Apple had to kill it. It’s one of the greatest product failures in the company’s history, even if nobody remembers it today.</p>\n<p>The cover of the December 1996 issue of MacUser has this line: “Has Apple fixed the PowerBook?”</p>\n<p>Yeah, they did—by releasing the PowerBook 1400, a laptop that I dearly loved. But it really wouldn’t be until Steve Jobs returned and the “Wall Street” PowerBooks were released that Apple would regain its footing and start making truly great laptops once more.</p>\n<figure class=\"youtube\"><p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/R398Yhd55MI\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n</figure><p>I’ll be back next week with number 16.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 16:00:48 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pb5300.jpeg?ssl=1","linkMd5":"ba4d098529cec5a45d9d708f91a541e3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn7@2020_5/2020/08/24/18-19-09-088_e12b3b7c72b01825.webp","destWidth":1360,"destHeight":858,"sourceBytes":160000,"destBytes":41228,"author":"Jason Snell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pb5300.jpeg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn7@2020_5/2020/08/24/18-19-09-088_e12b3b7c72b01825.webp","https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/macworld-blackbird.jpeg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn43@2020_2/2020/08/24/18-19-12-352_8d577bd6df7432a4.webp","https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/trackpad.jpeg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn52@2020_4/2020/08/24/18-19-15-666_55903c7e3a63f5a7.webp","https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/powerpc-powerbook.jpeg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn72@2020_3/2020/08/24/18-19-15-436_670e2008046f24a8.webp","https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/5300-side.jpeg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn80@2020_5/2020/08/24/18-19-17-106_71741241702ed04e.webp","https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pittelkau-cover.jpeg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn67@2020_2/2020/08/24/18-19-17-183_819c051983015351.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144242},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"Where does the iMac go from here?

But streaming services have apparently realized it too, as today, both Hulu and Plex have announced such features.</p>\n<p>Hulu’s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/28/21273246/hulu-watch-party-feature-how-to-use-test\">Watch Party</a> will allow a subscriber to Hulu’s ad-free plan to send a link to others who can watch along with them. There’s also a shared group chat, the ability to individually control your playback, and a “catch up” button that brings you to where the party is if you have to step away for a moment.</p>\n<p>However, it comes with a few restrictions. For one thing, not only do you have to be an ad-free subscriber, but so does anybody who wants to watch along with you. (I suppose that’s because syncing with dynamically served ads is a technical challenge, but also probably doesn’t hurt that it’s a more expensive plan.) Secondly, it’s only available on the web, so if you’re using a mobile device or set-top box, you’re out of luck for now.</p>\n<p>Plex, on the other hand, is taking almost an inverse approach. All you need to use <a href=\"https://www.plex.tv/blog/coming-in-hot-watch-together-chill/\">the new Watch Together feature</a> is a free Plex account; then you can invite someone to watch a movie or show–from Plex’s on-demand library or your own personal collection.

And that can make it tricky to share passwords, since it often either means sending them over another medium (hopefully one that’s encrypted, such as an iMessage) or using a low-tech method like just reading them to the other person and hoping they don’t accidentally make a typo or you don’t mistake a zero for the letter O.</p>\n<figure class=\"pull-right\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sharepassword-ios-6c.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"Stored Passwords\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Fortunately, Apple’s got a clever way to make sharing passwords easy.

(I always figured that the lawyers were just an excuse, and that our owner didn’t want to overly antagonize Microsoft, since Ziff-Davis also published both PC Magazine and PC/Computing magazine.)</p>\n<p>Here’s the truth about Windows 95, though: it was devastating to the Mac. Before Windows 95, PCs were spectacularly bad. (Sorry, fans of Windows 3.1, but it was garbage.) Windows 95, on the other hand, lifted an enormous amount of features from the Mac and drastically improved usability. Long filenames, trash can, aliases, a desktop, easy app switching, the promise of plug-and-play peripherals—these are all things the Mac had and that PCs didn’t, and with the release of Windows 95, the gap between the operating systems closed substantially.</p>\n<p>Was Windows 95 better than the Mac? Any Mac user at the time will tell you it absolutely wasn’t. But Windows just being <em>decent</em> made it that much harder to justify buying a Mac in an increasingly Windows-centric environment. Windows 95 didn’t make Windows good, but it made it <em>good enough</em>.</p>\n<p>And the technical underpinnings of Windows 95, most notably its support for pre-emptive multitasking, was a shot to the heart of Mac OS. This is a feature that every operating system today has, where the system arbitrates between different processes and doles out processor time. But the classic Mac OS did no such thing. Once an app grabbed control of the processor, it kept it until it relinquished control. If you were downloading a file in the background and then did something in the foreground, that download would just… stop. It was very bad.</p>\n<p>At the time Apple was desperately trying to create a re-archictected Mac OS called Copland, which would offer <em>limited</em> preemptive multitasking, with the promise to follow it up with a more robust OS version called Gershwin. A Copland developer preview appeared at WWDC one year—I got the t-shirt!—but was ultimately scrapped. Apple had to turn to outsiders to find a solution to its operating system problems, auditioning BeOS before finally purchasing NeXt Inc. and getting both the foundations of Mac OS X and Steve Jobs at once.</p>\n<p>Mac OS X helped Apple build back up the Mac, but in the intervening years, the dominance of Windows accelerated, to the point where Microsoft essentially needed to prop up Apple with investment and promises of future Microsoft Office development in order to prevent the Mac from fading away entirely and giving Microsoft a complete PC monopoly.</p>\n<p>Windows 95: So what? It made a huge impact on the Mac, driving Apple to the edge of oblivion. It’s kind of a miracle that the Mac survived it. So there.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 17:28:31 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/win95-rotated.jpeg?ssl=1","linkMd5":"3cf5fa8883386d925118aaa322ad1b23","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn36@2020_5/2020/08/24/18-19-06-564_c62a8ec006bdacfc.webp","destWidth":1020,"destHeight":1360,"sourceBytes":208880,"destBytes":122220,"author":"Jason Snell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/win95-rotated.jpeg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn36@2020_5/2020/08/24/18-19-06-564_c62a8ec006bdacfc.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144105},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"What will the ARM Mac look like? ↦","link":"http://two.wordpress.test/post/2020/06/educated_guesses_on_software_transitioning_to_macos_on_arm/","description":"<p>I really enjoyed <a href=\"https://shapeof.com/archives/2020/6/educated_guesses_about_a_mac_transition_to_arm.html\">this post by Gus Mueller</a> about what’s likely to happen if Apple is indeed transitioning the Mac to ARM processors:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  With all the recent rumors flying around about the Mac transitioning to ARM processors, I’ve seen some assertions about what this means for software going forward.

Apple says most third-party apps won’t need to be changed, but that new APIs allow developers to get even more out of it. And, of course, Apple’s enhanced its own iWork productivity apps with trackpad support. The trackpad support arrives with iPadOS 13.4, which Apple says will drop on March 24, and will also work with earlier iPad models and the Magic Mouse 2 and Magic Trackpad 2, as well as third-party USB or Bluetooth mice.</p>\n<p>Of course, trackpad support means new hardware, and that’s come in the form of the Magic Keyboard. Like the Smart Keyboard, it attaches to the iPad via magnets, but it uses cantilevered hinges so you can set different viewing angles, and it features both a scissor mechanism with 1mm of travel, and full-sized backlit keys. (Plus, most importantly, an inverted-T arrow key layout.) Essentially it looks like the Magic Keyboard on the new MacBooks and the Smart Keyboard had a baby.</p>\n<p>The keyboard also has a USB-C port on the side of the hinge, with can provide pass-through charging for the iPad, so that you can still use the iPad Pro’s USB-C port for peripherals. And it’s compatible not only with the new iPad Pro models introduced today, but also the previous models, the third-generation 12.9-inch iPad Pro and the first-generation 11-inch iPad Pro.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Apple_new-iPad-Pro_03182020-6c.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"New iPad Pro\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>While the keyboard may get all the attention, the new iPad Pro also delivers a brand new camera system with not just a 12MP standard wide-angle lens but a 10MP Ultra Wide camera. (For those paying attention at home, that’s slightly less megapixels than the Ultra Wide lens on the iPhone 11 series.) To complement the camera, Apple’s also improved the iPad’s audio, with five “studio-quality” microphones.</p>\n<p>The new models <em>also</em> include LiDAR, a first for any mobile device. LiDAR is a light-based version of radar, which most people are probably familiar with as one of the sensors used in autonomous vehicles. LiDAR bounces a laser off an object, then measures it with a sensor allowing it to come up with very precise measurements. Apple touts the use of that sensor in Augmented Reality applications—as a proof of concept, the company has improved its Measure app, which now makes it easy to, say, measure a person’s height, as well as providing a Ruler View with better measurements. But that’s definitely one place that third-party developers may have the opportunity to lead the way in interesting applications.</p>\n<p>Finally, there’s a new chip at the heart of these models: the A12Z Bionic. It features an eight-core CPU, eight-core GPU, Neural Engine, and better thermal architecture to bring the best performance ever in an iPad, which Apple says is faster and more powerful than most Windows PC laptops.<sup id=\"fnref-10832-shotsfired\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-10832-shotsfired\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>The new iPads are up for order today in space gray and silver, with the 11-inch model starting at $799 and the 12.9-inch model at $999, both with 128GB of storage.

The Magic Keyboard comes in sizes for both iPads, though it’ll cost a premium in the larger size: $299 for the 11-inch model, and $349 for the 12.9-inch model.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr><ol><li id=\"fn-10832-shotsfired\">\nShots fired… <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fnref-10832-shotsfired\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/21a9.png\" alt=\"↩\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></a>\n</li>\n</ol></div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 18 Mar 2020 12:58:00 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ipad-pro-magic-keyboard-6c.jpg?ssl=1","linkMd5":"b76399e02c8a37365fd430a6c9fb1bd0","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn80@2020_2/2020/08/24/18-19-07-511_56f7f2a4e994c0ee.webp","destWidth":1360,"destHeight":1256,"sourceBytes":69090,"destBytes":69090,"author":"Dan Moren","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ipad-pro-magic-keyboard-6c.jpg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn80@2020_2/2020/08/24/18-19-07-511_56f7f2a4e994c0ee.webp","https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Apple_new-iPad-Pro_03182020-6c.jpg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn27@2020_6/2020/08/24/18-19-15-175_3ff1c36be6938d3f.webp","https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/21a9.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn51@2020_2/2020/08/24/18-19-11-215_25686225908fe44d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144598},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"Fun With Charts, Apple Silicon edition","link":"https://sixcolors.com/?p=12145","description":"<figure><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/apple-silicon-chart.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>I’ve been thinking about this chart since it appeared in Apple’s WWDC keynote last month.</p>\n<p>On one level, it’s a meaningless bit of marketing fluff. There are no labels. The vast breadth of notebooks and desktop PCs is represented by two perfect rounded rectangles. “Macs with Apple Silicon” are represented by a fuzzy gradient of squares. What does it mean?</p>\n<p>It’s a question that won’t be answered until after the Betas of Summer have gone. It’ll be a while before we get a clear picture of what the first Macs of this new era will look like. We don’t have a lot to go on… but there is this chart.</p>\n<p>So here’s what it implies:</p>\n<p><strong>Macs with Apple Silicon will largely be faster than existing notebooks.</strong> This isn’t too far-fetched, given Apple’s claims about the superior performance of the 2018 iPad Pro when it was announced. If the iPad Pro is faster than most PC laptops, wouldn’t it stand to reason that even the slowest of the new generation of Macs would be as fast or faster than the competition?</p>\n<p>Let’s not forget how Apple’s pride factors in to this transition. If Apple releases a Mac that’s not any faster than the Intel-based competition, that reflects poorly on the prowess of Apple’s processor design. I firmly believe that Apple would never initiate a processor transition like this unless it was confident that its chips would end up looking like world-beaters.</p>\n<p><strong>Some Macs with Apple Silicon will offer lower power consumption than existing notebooks, at the same or greater performance.</strong> What Apple chooses to do with that power efficiency is an open question, however. It could use it to shave some size and weight off its batteries while maintaining the same quoted battery life totals as current models. It could use it to boost its battery-life claims to new heights. Or it could spend that energy savings on additional performance, so that the next-generation Macs are that much faster than the competition.</p>\n<p>It seems unlikely that Apple will go all in on any of these strategies. Instead, I’d expect it to strike a balance. Ultimately, it will want to make lighter and thinner laptops that offer more power and longer battery life than the previous generation.</p>\n<p><strong>Macs with Apple Silicon can offer Desktop-beating performance with dramatically lower power consumption.</strong> What does a desktop computer (or a high-end laptop) running an Apple-designed ARM processor look like? The iPad can be at least a rough analog for a laptop, but no iPad or iPhone has ever been asked to match up with a high-performance PC before. “No problem,” Apple’s vague chart proclaims. “Our gradient extends above Desktops, while remaining far to the left on power consumption.”</p>\n<p>We’ll see what Apple’s got up its sleeve when it comes to more high-end applications. But I will remind you that the A12X and A12Z processors that power the 2018 and 2020 iPad Pro, respectively, are eight-core processors with seven- and eight-core graphics processors. Do you know what Mac models currently offer eight-core processors? The highest-end configuration of the 16-inch MacBook Pro, the iMac Pro, and the Mac Pro.</p>\n<p>Now, you can’t gauge performance by counting cores any more than you can gauge image quality by counting megapixels. The A12 processors use two different kinds of cores, four geared toward energy savings and four geared toward performance, and the system can use those cores as needed given its current needs. But I do think it’s interesting that Apple has been gradually ramping up its core count on its processors, as it spins off more duties into integrated coprocessors like the Neural Engine (used for machine-learning tasks).</p>\n<p>It wouldn’t be surprising, then, for Apple to announce a new Mac processor that’s got a large number of processor cores, some of which would be able to sip power to extend MacBook Pro battery life, and some of which would crank up as fast as possible in moments of true power-user need.</p>\n<p>At least, that’s how I read Apple’s chart. We’ll all see how reality matches up later this year.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 17 Jul 2020 21:48:45 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/apple-silicon-chart.png?ssl=1","linkMd5":"ffbd6bc0a94ae81058abe1fac8f61bc7","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn68@2020_6/2020/08/24/18-19-06-547_02c0a9b086d20fb3.webp","destWidth":1360,"destHeight":765,"sourceBytes":16100,"destBytes":16100,"author":"Jason Snell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/apple-silicon-chart.png?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn68@2020_6/2020/08/24/18-19-06-547_02c0a9b086d20fb3.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144157},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"Apple Q2 2020 results: $58B revenue, but no guidance","link":"http://two.wordpress.test/post/2020/04/apple_to_release_financial_results_amid_global_crisis/","description":"<p>Apple on Thursday announced that it generated $58B in revenue during its second fiscal quarter.

Russo (in a Facebook Live session), <a href=\"https://trekmovie.com/2020/05/15/jeff-russo-confirms-remote-recording-of-star-trek-discovery-season-3-score-has-begun/\">as reported by TrekMovie’s Anthony Pascale</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  What we are doing is recording individual session players from here in Los Angeles. They are fantastic and most of the people I have used on the <em>Star Trek</em> scores and <em>Picard</em> scores and <em>Umbrella Academy</em> scores. So we will record each individual in their home and then combine all of it to make the orchestra, so we don’t have to put everybody in the same room….</p>\n<p>  Michael Perfitt, who is my recording engineer and mixer, is and has been working diligently with the players to make sure they have the right microphones and the right mic pre-amps and where to put the mic in conjunction to the instrument. And then it is literally his mission to figure out how to take all these players and put them together and make it sound like it is at the Warner Brothers or Fox scoring stage, or wherever we record these things.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>An approach like this isn’t what anyone prefers, but it’s what is required now. My guess is that it’ll sound great. (“Discovery” season 3 is also being <a href=\"https://trekmovie.com/2020/03/24/star-trek-discovery-and-lower-decks-work-continues-by-remote/\">edited at home</a>.)

Those moments are a lot less frequent they were even a couple of years ago, but they do exist.</p>\n<p>What’s funny is that in the last year or so, I’ve noticed an increasing number of incidents when I find myself sitting at my desk, staring at my iMac, realizing that the task I need to perform would be done far more easily on my iPad.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3544629/three-ways-ipad-beats-mac.html\">Continue reading on Macworld</a>.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 20 May 2020 14:49:28 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"312103399f127fd736da041d90d9c9ee","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jason Snell","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144243},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"Streamlabs OBS arrives for Mac ↦","link":"http://two.wordpress.test/post/2020/04/streamlabs_obs_arrives_for_mac/","description":"<figure><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/tpk-stream-obs-6c.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>For a few years now I’ve been live streaming stuff on YouTube, mostly Dungeons and Dragons play sessions as a part of the <a href=\"https://www.theincomparable.com/tpk\">Total Party Kill</a> podcast. For a while I was using Gameshow, Telestream’s dedicated game-streaming app, and it was okay, but it was discontinued and I ended up using <a href=\"https://www.telestream.net/wirecast/overview.htm\">Wirecast</a>, a behemoth of a product that lists for $599.</p>\n<p>So a funny thing happened earlier this month: <a href=\"https://streamlabs.com/streamlabs-obs\">Streamlabs OBS</a>, one of the leading video-streaming apps on Windows, arrived for the first time on the Mac. (It’s powered by the OBS engine, an open-source streaming system I’ve tried a couple of times and always felt way too rough for me to want to use.) Streamlabs OBS is open source, free, and I think I like it <em>better</em> than Wirecast.</p>\n<p>Does Streamlabs OBS have rough edges? Sure it does. But it somehow seems <em>better</em> integrated with streaming services like Twitch and YouTube than Wirecast does. While it doesn’t offer some of the precision layout tools that Wirecast does—I’d like to be able to specify the exact size of objects on the canvas—it’s got some nice shortcuts that make it easy for me to create a new layout in a hurry.</p>\n<p>Audio capture can be an issue. I use Rogue Amoeba’s Loopback to create a custom audio input for use by OBS, but <a href=\"https://howto.streamlabs.com/streamlabs-obs-19/capturing-desktop-audio-in-streamlabs-obs-for-mac-13229\">Streamlabs also suggests</a> that you can use the free <a href=\"http://shinywhitebox.com/\">iShowU</a> to do much the same thing.</p>\n<p>The results are <a href=\"https://youtu.be/LqW7oiYzGhw?t=697\">pretty good</a>! And given that my Wirecast license is about to run out, I think I’m going to move to Streamlabs OBS permanently—and save a whole bunch of money.</p><p><a href=\"https://streamlabs.com/streamlabs-obs\">Go to the linked site</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/link/2020/04/streamlabs-obs-arrives-for-mac/\">Read on Six Colors</a>.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 20 Apr 2020 22:28:57 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/tpk-stream-obs-6c.jpg?ssl=1","linkMd5":"90e9614dee03c94ad813fd020854e745","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn25@2020_4/2020/08/24/18-19-07-522_e2466d908e8a345e.webp","destWidth":1360,"destHeight":895,"sourceBytes":69816,"destBytes":69816,"author":"Jason Snell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/tpk-stream-obs-6c.jpg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn25@2020_4/2020/08/24/18-19-07-522_e2466d908e8a345e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144489},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"(Sponsor) SoundSource","link":"http://two.wordpress.test/post/2020/04/soundsource/","description":"<p>My thanks once again to Rogue Amoeba and <a href=\"https://rogueamoeba.com/sentBy.php?6CSS2\">SoundSource</a> for sponsoring Six Colors this week.

I looked at a handful of other comparison tools and spent a lot of time searching the web, trying to figure out the best way to reconcile lots of old files, and Beyond Compare was the one tool I found continually name-checked—and, as it turns out, for good reason.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/beyondcompare-6c.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"Beyond Compare\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Essentially, you can drag any two folders into Beyond Compare’s two panes and have it compare their contents. You can choose to have it show only the files that are missing on one side or the other, or all of the differences in files, or even just the files that are the same. Plus, you can add filters that exclude certain filename patterns (for example, I frequently set it up to ignore directories that begin with a period, since those hidden files are generally configuration files I didn’t care about).</p>\n<p>Beyond Compare excels when comparing identical or very similar folder structures, and it offers options for comparing files, folder structure, both, or neither. But there are also commands that help when things don’t line up quite right. For example, the “Align with…” command lets you line up two sub-directories to compare, even if they don’t have the same name. If you need to go more in depth on files, Beyond Compare can also compare images and text documents, and can even provide side-by-side hex comparisons, which is way more than I need, but will doubtless prove useful to others.</p>\n<p>The app can be a little tricky to use: it took me a while to get the hang of it, figuring out which views I wanted, and what all the various colored icons meant. (Purple, for example, are orphans—files on one side that aren’t on another, whereas red just means there are differences within the files.) One complication arose from the fact that my Synology NAS, which is now my official file server, is formatted with the BTRFS filesystem, and several of my older files got renamed, leading to lots of file differences that were merely differences in file name, not in content.<sup id=\"fnref-10855-characters\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-10855-characters\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>I’ve spent a lot of time in Beyond Compare over the last few weeks, and I definitely got more adroit at using it as time went by, though I’m certain I missed features that could have saved me even more time. In the end, it still didn’t handle exactly the task I’d like it to—namely, scan a folder hierarchy and tell me <em>all</em> the files that are missing from another drive—but that’s a pretty intensive procedure that I frankly couldn’t find <em>any</em> software to handle. So I ended up spending a little more time manually drilling down into folder hierarchies and comparing file sizes and dates.</p>\n<p>Despite those travails, Beyond Compare has proved to be more than worth its $30 price tag, not least of all for the peace of mind it brings in being sure that I have all of the data I want. (And, I’ll add, it has an extensive—and perhaps even <em>too</em> generous trial option that allowed me to do pretty much all of my comparisons for free, so I made sure to buy a license anyway.) If your file comparison needs are even more in-depth—say you need to handle three-file comparisons or folder merges—there’s also a $60 Pro version, but for most users, the standard will probably suffice.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr><ol><li id=\"fn-10855-characters\">\nFun trivia time! In the classic Mac OS, directory hierarchies were indicated using the colon (“:”). But, when Apple moved to Mac OS X, which was based on BSD, directories instead used the more common forward-slash (“/”) delimiter. Problem is, back in the classic Mac OS days, you could put all the forward-slashes you wanted in a filename and the system didn’t care—until you migrated all those files to Mac OS X, where the file system very much <em>did not</em> want slashes in file names. But, in order to keep backwards compatibility with classic APIs, Apple essentially converted all those slashes in file names to colons, but still <em>displays</em> them as forward slashes anywhere in the GUI. To this day, you can still put forward slashes in your filenames, but <a href=\"https://149426355.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/colons-slashes-6c.jpg\">if you go and look in the Terminal, they’re colons</a>. However, if you try to put colons in filenames, it’ll generally automatically use a hyphen instead.

Fortunately, last fall I purchased an <a href=\"https://www.evehome.com/en-us/eve-degree\">Eve Degree</a>, a little HomeKit-compatible sensor that can measure temperature and humidity. It sits on the dresser in my bedroom so I can glance over and quickly see the current temperature on its display, or look it up in the Home app.<sup id=\"fnref-12276-weather\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-12276-weather\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>So, I put together a little shortcut that gets the current outdoor temperature and compares it, then tells me where it’s warmer.</p>\n<p>Of course, that wasn’t enough. I quickly realized I have <em>two</em> possible sources in my house, as my office has a <a href=\"https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/hue-motion-sensor/046677473389\">Philips Hue Motion sensor</a> that can also measure temperature. So, I now have the temperature comparison shortcut <em>average</em> the two temperatures (which are rarely more than a degree or two apart), just so I can get a better sense of indoor temperature.</p>\n<figure class=\"pull-right\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shortcuts-feels-like.jpeg?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>All well and good. But we all know—especially those of us that live in moister climates like New England—that what the temperature <em>is</em> and what it <em>feels like</em> are two different things. And while most weather apps can provide a “feels like” temperature (also known as the heat index), my indoor temperature sensors don’t have that information.</p>\n<p>Or <em>do</em> they? How <em>is</em> the heat index calculated anyway? Well, the fine folks at the U.S.’s National Weather Service not only provide a handy <a href=\"https://www.weather.gov/epz/wxcalc_heatindex\">web-based heat index calculator</a> but are also thoughtful enough to <a href=\"https://www.weather.gov/media/epz/wxcalc/heatIndex.pdf\">publish the mathematical formula behind it</a>. All the calculation requires is the temperature and the relative humidity, both of which the Eve Degree can measure, so all <em>I</em> have to do is plug those values into the formula.</p>\n<p>Well, what’s a computer good at if not mathematical formulas? So I set out to build my own shortcut to calculate feels like temperature. In a bit of serendipity, one of the actions I needed—Calculate Expression, which lets you just throw a bunch of math into an action—was just added in iOS 14, so I composed the shortcut in the beta. It took a little work to figure out exactly how to convert the notation from the formula into a shortcut-friendly version, but after a bit of trial and error, I figured it out.</p>\n<p>And so, voila! Pass <a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/ae6a6142caee473ab35b9a1bdc7839bb\">this shortcut</a> temperature (in Fahrenheit) and humidity<sup id=\"fnref-12276-dictionary\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-12276-dictionary\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">2</a></sup> and it’ll pass you back the “feels like” temperature. (The version there requires iOS 14, as mentioned, though some third-party apps, such as <a href=\"https://toolboxpro.app\">ToolBox Pro</a>, may offer actions that can handle the work of the Calculate Expression action.)</p>\n<p>For my purposes, I’ve wrapped it in a second shortcut that retrieves the temperature and humidity from my home sensors and formats the output to compare it to the outside temperature, but you can adapt it for whatever purposes you want.</p>\n<p>Now, if you don’t mind, it feels very hot in here, so I’m going to…uhh…<em>consults shortcut</em>…stay inside, I guess.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr><ol><li id=\"fn-12276-weather\">\nSee?

Motorola’s 68K chips were losing steam, and in order to keep up with IBM PC compatibles running Intel processors, Apple got together with Motorola and IBM to define a new processor architecture, the PowerPC. In order to make this move while still supporting all of the Mac’s existing software, including its operating system, Apple needed to create an emulator for 68K instructors that would run on the PowerPC. This was a multi-year project, which was started by engineer Gary Davidian at Apple in the middle of 1990….</p>\n<p>  Davidian’s emulator served as a proof of concept that emulation of 68K code could be done without too big of a hit in software speed. This convinced managers at Apple that emulation was a workable solution for users…. In October 1991, Apple announced the PowerPC alliance with IBM and Motorola, and work began to shift Davidian’s emulator over to the PowerPC architecture. New prototype plug-in boards and then full machines were built with the new chip, whose bugs were still being worked out. It took several more years, until 1994, for the first Macs with PowerPC processors, the Power Macintosh <a href=\"https://www.computerhistory.org/collections/catalog/102647305\">6100</a>, <a href=\"https://www.computerhistory.org/collections/catalog/102647308\">7100</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.computerhistory.org/collections/catalog/102661920\">8100</a>, to be released to customers. The PowerPC would be the Mac’s CPU until 2006, when Apple replaced it with Intel’s processors.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>The CHM article links to a couple of its oral-history interviews with Davidian. Nobody thinks about the PowerPC transition much now, but it set the bar for Mac chip transitions.

(Macworld/Jason Snell)","link":"http://two.wordpress.test/post/2020/05/what_will_the_arm_mac_line-up_look_like/","description":"<p>For a company with a reputation for sudden bursts of industry-shaking creativity, Apple’s pretty conservative most of the time. The company has a years-long product pipeline, and while we’re beginning to anticipate the 2020 iPhone, its hardware engineers are finishing work on the 2021 model while its component designers are pondering the chips and sensors that will power the device into the mid-2020s.</p>\n<p>For so many of Apple’s product choices, a decision now is likely to be a decision that sticks for years to come. Think of how many years it took for the company to backtrack on the butterfly keyboard in the MacBook line, even after it was obvious that it had made a mistake. More to the point, consider the continued existence of the low-end, two-port version of the 13-inch MacBook Pro, which is largely the consequence of a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3407747/macbook-air-why-didnt-it-die.html\">failed attempt to replace the MacBook Air</a> with the 12-inch MacBook and the low-end MacBook Pro.</p>\n<p>Some fairly strong news reports suggest that in 2021, Apple’s going to being a major reset of the Mac product line, thanks to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3529428/arm-macs-are-coming-three-years-after-apples-attitude-change.html\">its transition from Intel processors to its own ARM chips</a>. After a decade and a half in which Mac product designs were often constrained by the Intel processor types that were available, Apple’s got a chance to build a Mac product line exactly as it envisions it—right down to the right chips for the right computers. It’s not an exaggeration to suggest that this will affect the shape of the Mac for the next five years, if not more.<br>\nWhat is Apple likely to do? I’ve got some ideas, informed by my observations of the last two transitions, a sense of where the Mac is today, and maybe a little bit of wishcasting.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3543255/what-will-the-arm-mac-line-up-look-like.html\">Continue reading on Macworld</a>.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 13 May 2020 14:47:27 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"00adf0194b5f4126e72e6aad62cd007e","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jason Snell","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144246},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"How to stream games and more online ↦","link":"http://two.wordpress.test/post/2020/04/how_to_stream_games_and_more_online/","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21213548/live-stream-obs-how-to-streamlabsobs-windows-mac-hardware\">Great guide from Bijan Stephen at The Verge</a> that runs through the basics of streaming:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  I keep writing about live-streaming like it’s accessible and easy to do – which it’s not.

It’s not just that it looks good. It does, but Good Sudoku accomplishes something that you don’t see too often. It takes an established game and makes it better by applying computing power so that it doesn’t get in the way of enjoying the game.

Apple responded to the request on Friday, emphasizing that it was enforcing previously stated policies, but not denying that iOS support was at risk.</p>\n<p>  Epic says removing support would be unnecessarily punitive, affecting developers who have built on Epic’s engine but have no direct interest in the case…. The filing came alongside <a href=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21810025/statement_support_microsoft.pdf\">a new declaration</a> from Microsoft in support of Epic’s motion, emphasizing how disastrous it would be to revoke Epic’s access to Apple’s developer tools.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>I dislike many of Apple’s App Store policies, and think they should change—but let’s be clear about this. Epic can revert the changes it made to the Fortnite app specifically to cause the incident and still continue its lawsuit against Apple. Epic is being strategically smart in pushing hard to get that restraining order, but I’m skeptical that legal intervention is called for when Epic can defuse this situation by returning to the status quo while it presses its case in court.</p>\n<p>Given how calculating Epic has been about every step it has taken in this manufactured controversy, I also have to assume that it knew full well that Unreal Engine would be a target. Microsoft’s support of Epic is understandable, given the importance of Unreal Engine, but let’s remember that this is a situation entirely of Epic’s making. In the end, will Epic’s status as a legal provocateur make developers more or less likely to use Unreal Engine?</p><p><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/23/21397369/epic-apple-fortnite-lawsuit-ios-microsoft-developer-tax\">Go to the linked site</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/link/2020/08/epic-to-apple-dont-bring-unreal-engine-into-this/\">Read on Six Colors</a>.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 23 Aug 2020 19:05:22 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"849e5d55af4006f38cd4d2c92224a6e2","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jason Snell","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144137},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"Apple apologizes for botched WordPress rejection ↦","link":"https://sixcolors.com/?p=14542","description":"<p>It’s not every day you see an Apple apology, but <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/22/21397424/apple-wordpress-apology-iap-free-ios-app\">Matt Mullenweg of WordPress got one this week</a> after Apple—spectacularly failing to read the room—rejected the free open-source WordPress unless it added Apple’s in-app purchase system, because some web views in the app could lead to the display of premium WordPress<sup id=\"fnref-14542-wordpress\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-14542-wordpress\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup> hosting plans.</p>\n<p>Apple:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  We believe the issue with the WordPress app has been resolved. Since the developer removed the display of their service payment options from the app, it is now a free stand-alone app and does not have to offer in-app purchases. We have informed the developer and apologize for any confusion that we have caused.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>That’s great, but this entire situation shouldn’t have happened. Not only is it predicated on the dumbest of Apple’s App Store rule choices—banning links to a company’s web site if there’s any way to get to a page that might possibly insinuate that there’s a way to give them money that isn’t via in-app purchase—but the act of approaching WordPress and recommending in-app purchases feels an awful lot like a shakedown. (“If you want to stay in the App Store, you might want to start upselling your users right within your app and giving us 30 percent,” Mullenweg might have imagined Apple saying.)</p>\n<p>Also troubling: Mullenweg only went public with Apple’s rejection because Apple had, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/1297325896274030593\">weeks before</a>, told WordPress that Apple’s decision was final and that they’d need to alter their app to add in-app purchases in order to stay in the App Store. It was only after Mullenweg’s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/1296879217297113088\">original tweet</a> went viral that Apple re-examined the decision, backed down, and apologized.</p>\n<p>This shows that the old (Steve Jobs? Phil Schiller?) guideline that “going to the press never helps” may be the most hilariously false thing Apple has ever produced.</p>\n<p>But let’s consider the larger issues. What is wrong with the App Store approval system that a major vendor like WordPress would apparently be rejected in a way that would have been entirely final without the intervention of higher-ups? What is broken within the App Store’s culture that leads a developer to walk away feeling like his only option is to add commerce to his free app because of Apple’s apparent hunger to generate more in-app revenue?</p>\n<p>And most troubling for the company and its prospects for the future: What does it say about Apple’s <em>reputation</em> in this area that so many of us jumped to the conclusion that Apple was just shaking down another developer in order to make more money?</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr><ol><li id=\"fn-14542-wordpress\">\nDisclosure: Six Colors is built on WordPress and hosted at Automattic’s Pressable hosting service, and Automattic staff aided me in transferring my site from Movable Type earlier this year. <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fnref-14542-wordpress\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/21a9.png\" alt=\"↩\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></a>\n</li>\n</ol></div><p><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/22/21397424/apple-wordpress-apology-iap-free-ios-app\">Go to the linked site</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/link/2020/08/apple-apologizes-for-botched-wordpress-rejection/\">Read on Six Colors</a>.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 23 Aug 2020 18:49:38 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/21a9.png","linkMd5":"6bef5beda59779ba96892a04dfe0741a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn51@2020_2/2020/08/24/18-19-11-215_25686225908fe44d.webp","destWidth":72,"destHeight":72,"sourceBytes":462,"destBytes":1318,"author":"Jason Snell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/21a9.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn51@2020_2/2020/08/24/18-19-11-215_25686225908fe44d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144113},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"How Seattle’s NHL team became the Kraken ↦","link":"https://sixcolors.com/?p=12244","description":"<figure><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/kraken.jpg?ssl=1\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></figure><p>Seattle’s expansion NHL franchise <a href=\"https://www.seattlekrakenhockey.com/\">is now officially the Kraken</a>.

It’s designed to feature ultra-high-resolution screens that will make it almost impossible for a user to differentiate the virtual world from the real one. A cinematic speaker system will make the experience even more realistic, people who have used prototypes say.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to the report, Apple was at one point working on a more powerful headset targeted more at VR, but Jony Ive and Tim Cook nixed the idea of something that took you out of the world around you.</p>\n<p>Both VR and AR strike me as being at the place that smartphones and smart watches were before the iPhone and Apple Watch: technology that exists and is available, but hasn’t yet reached mass consumer acceptance. That said, Apple needs to crack two key things in order to get there: First, explain to the average person what’s compelling about using such a device, and second, get those consumers to a point where they’re willing to overcome the reluctance to wear such a device.</p>\n<p>VR has a leg up in both those departments: in the first case, because VR games mostly demo pretty well (excepting for people who have nausea-related problems with them), and second, because it’s something you only wear for a little while, in a specific place—such as your house. By contrast, AR’s use cases are more nebulous, and it’s something that you’re probably going to be wearing when you go out in the world.</p>\n<p>Other interesting tidbits in the piece include the suggestion that chips used in an early prototype of Apple’s more advanced headset have been repurposed for the upcoming Mac transition (I’m presuming they’re graphics related), and that Apple’s car project has been “deemed a disaster” inside the company.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-19/apple-team-working-on-vr-and-ar-headset-and-ar-glasses\">Go to the linked site</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/link/2020/06/bloomberg-apple-team-working-on-vr-ar-hardware/\">Read on Six Colors</a>.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 19 Jun 2020 14:39:37 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"59927136d456983329a884ff4a872166","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Dan Moren","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144478},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"The weighty matter of the Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro ↦","link":"http://two.wordpress.test/post/2020/04/the_weighty_matter_of_the_magic_keyboard_for_ipad_pro/","description":"<p>I was going to adjust my pundit hat and write a post guessing about the weight of the new Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro—which Apple is not interested in disclosing at this time.

Tech giants aren’t just capable of playing a long game, it’s required — because it can take years for technology to be conceived of and years more for the production lines to be built to manufacture it.</p>\n<p>Every smartphone is the sum of dozens of these different technologies, not just the hardware itself but the software that makes it function. Whether it’s a new camera design or a folding screen or a microprocessor or a charging port, it takes time. As Yoda taught us, always in motion the future is — and if you’re a tech CEO or product strategist, you’re making decisions now that will affect your products a year, two years, even five years down the road. There’s a reason those people get paid the big bucks, and it’s not (just) the cost of living in Santa Clara County, California.</p>\n<p>As so often happens, this week we got a glimpse at what Apple’s been working on for its next round of software updates, thanks to a series of iOS 14 leaks and Apple Watch 6 disclosures.

What this new model has done is eliminate almost every caveat, warning, or footnote that might have come along with that recommendation. If the MacBook Air wasn’t definitively the center of the Mac world before—and Apple says it’s been the most popular Mac model “by far”—it certainly is now.</p>\n<h2>The key upgrade</h2>\n<p>If you’ve followed along with the ongoing story of Apple’s “butterfly” keyboard design, introduced with the <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2015/04/the-new-macbook-a-reviewers-notebook/\">12-inch MacBook</a> in 2015, you know that it’s been criticized for both its typing feel and its fragility. Apple instituted a special <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/link/2018/06/apple-announces-macbook-keyboard-service-program/\">service program</a> to deal with the repair issues.</p>\n<p>This new MacBook Air model, thankfully, does not use that keyboard design. Instead, it’s got the same design as the 16-inch MacBook Pro introduced last fall. The keys use a more traditional scissor switch and offer about a millimeter of key travel. That’s not as much as in the previous, non-Retina MacBook Air, but it’s still pretty good. (And yes, this new MacBook Air also has a proper “inverted T” layout for arrow keys, as it was in the old days, allowing you to orient more easily based on key feel.)</p>\n<p>I still prefer the feel of that older Apple keyboard, but given the choice between the keyboard on the new Air and the one from the previous generation, I’d choose this new one every time. In contrast, my wife—who uses a 2018 MacBook Air with the butterfly keyboard—tried the new keyboard and shrugged. Some people just don’t care that much about keyboards!</p>\n<p>But if you’ve been holding out for a MacBook Air with Retina display that’s got a keyboard with more travel, you can end your holdout now. It’s here.</p>\n<h2>The right price</h2>\n<p>My 2018 excitement that the MacBook Air would be revived was tempered by the butterfly keyboard (did I mention I didn’t like it?), but more than that, it was by the price: $1199 (dropped to $1099 last July). After the MacBook and 13-inch MacBook Pro failed to catch on because of their high prices, I was hoping that the MacBook Air would give Apple a solid laptop option for $999. The MacBook Air was cheaper, but it couldn’t hit that magic price. (Though in fact, it <em>has</em> been hitting it via sales at various websites over the past year. I’ve bought two of the 2018 Airs for $999. But it wasn’t the “real” price.)</p>\n<p>This 2020 MacBook Air finally sets the bar at the right place: $999. While that price will only get you a dual-core i3 processor, it’ll get you 256GB of storage, double the base storage available on the old $1099 Air. (You can also upgrade to 512GB for $200, 1TB for $400, and 2TB  for $800.)</p>\n<p>I wish Apple had hit this price two years ago, but I’m glad it’s gotten there today. $999 (and $899 for education) makes this Air a lot easier to recommend to price-conscious Mac laptop buyers. Fortunately, if you were hoping for more power than a dual-core i3, Apple has options for you, too.</p>\n<h2>Choices at last</h2>\n<p>Back in the old pre-Retina days, you could configure the MacBook Air’s processor to be much more powerful than the default. (I’ve got a 2012 MacBook Air with an i7 processor that’s only now starting to show its age.) But when the Retina MacBook Air debuted in 2018, it came with only a single processor configuration: a 1.6GHz dual-core Intel Core i5, with Turbo Boost up to 3.6GHz.</p>\n<p>The 2020 MacBook Air lets users buy a faster processor if they want—and for the first time, there are four-core options for the MacBook Air. The $999 base model is powered by a 1.1GHz dual-core Intel Core i3, with Turbo Boost up to 3.2GHz. But you can also configure a 1.1GHz quad-core Intel Core i5, with Turbo Boost up to 3.5Ghz for an additional $100, or a 1.2GHz quad-core i7 with Turbo Boost up to 3.8GHz for an extra $250. While all models use Intel’s integrated Iris Plus graphics, Apple says that graphics on these models are up to 80 percent faster than the previous model.</p>\n<p>I was only able to test the $1299 model that includes the quad-core i5 processor, so I can’t test whether the highest-end model meets Apple’s claims of speeds twice as fast as the prior model. But I was able to test the new laptop in Primate Labs’ Geekbench 5 and compare it to older Mac models. The results were encouraging, with a 32 percent improvement in single-core performance and 63 percent improvement in multi-core tests. (More cores helps.)</p>\n<p>Apple seems to have hit the $999 price point by saddling it with the two-core i3 processor, while for the old $1099 price you get the mid-range processor with four cores. I’d expect the $999 model to be roughly comparable to the old model in terms of performance, but the good news is that if you want a bit more processing power, you can pay and get it. (And yes, you can take the $999 model and simply configure up the processor to the i7 model if you want to.)</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/geekbench-air-6c.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h2>Worth the wait?</h2>\n<p>If there’s a hint of things to come in my test results, though, it’s the performance of the iPad Pro. This isn’t the new 2020 model that’s due out next week, either—it’s the third-generation iPad Pro that was released the same day as the first Retina MacBook Air model. The 2018 iPad Pro was faster in single-core performance and 70 percent faster in multi-core performance.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/geekbench-air-ipad-fixed-6c.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Even if we accept that macOS and iPadOS are different beasts and that a Mac built around Apple’s own A-series processors wouldn’t necessarily score quite as high, it’s a clear sign that Apple’s state of the art iPad processor from 18 months ago is faster than the mid-range MacBook Air processor today.</p>\n<p>Though rumors abound that Apple is going to be introducing ARM Macs, there’s no telling when that might happen and what form those computers might take. How compatible will they be with older software? Will Intel apps that haven’t been recompiled for ARM run in a slow code-translation layer? Will Apple have to work out bugs that come along with the transition?</p>\n<p>If you don’t really need a new Mac laptop, maybe you should wait to see what happens with ARM. But if you’re someone who has been holding out for a new MacBook Air—and ideally one without that infamous keyboard—I wouldn’t recommend that you wait. This is the MacBook Air that you’ve been waiting for.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 20 Mar 2020 12:30:00 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/air18-bleed.jpg?ssl=1","linkMd5":"f54565b1ce43beacdc554b3d82e0d9df","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn11@2020_5/2020/08/24/18-19-07-496_ff6ad3873ecae716.webp","destWidth":2048,"destHeight":1135,"sourceBytes":199682,"destBytes":199682,"author":"Jason Snell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/air18-bleed.jpg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn11@2020_5/2020/08/24/18-19-07-496_ff6ad3873ecae716.webp","https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/geekbench-air-6c.png?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn64@2020_3/2020/08/24/18-19-16-981_8dbbc07a69977809.webp","https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/geekbench-air-ipad-fixed-6c.png?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn46@2020_1/2020/08/24/18-19-12-309_afaee7177a033b7e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144592},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"iPad Pro 2020 review: Small steps","link":"http://two.wordpress.test/post/2020/03/ipad-pro-2020-review/","description":"<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ipad-2020-hey-buddy-6c.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The 2018 iPad Pro was <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2018/11/ipad-pro-2018-review/\">a great leap forward</a>, with a stylish new design, support for a new Apple Pencil, a USB-C port, and a powerful processor that was more than a match for PC laptops. In fact, you could make the argument that the 2018 iPad Pro was so far ahead of the game that it doesn’t really need much of an update, even a year and a half later.</p>\n<p>That’s essentially the argument Apple is making with this early 2020 refresh to the iPad Pro. With a few small exceptions, these new iPad Pros aren’t substantially improved from their previous generation. Even so, they’re still faster than the mid-range MacBook Air Apple also released this week.</p>\n<p>I got to spend several days using the new iPad Pro and a Smart Keyboard Folio—alas, no Magic Keyboard—and I can definitively report that unless you’re using an augmented-reality app or taking an ultra-wide photo, it’s pretty much exactly like its predecessor.</p>\n<h2>Augmented AR</h2>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ipad-2020-ar-6c.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>This iPad looks great in AR, not just because of LiDAR but because it’s the only way to get the Magic Keyboard into your house before May.</figcaption></figure><p>So let’s start with the big hardware upgrade: The camera bump on the iPad Pro has expanded to a square resembling the housings found on the iPhone 11 family. In this case, the iPad Pro has gained a second camera and a new LiDAR sensor.</p>\n<p>The camera is a 10 megapixel ultra-wide, allowing you to perform some of the same tricks you’d get from an iPhone 11. But there are some puzzling omissions. There’s no portrait mode, despite the presence of two cameras and a depth sensor. You also don’t get the option to integrate images that are just outside the frame of the wide camera but within the field of view of the ultrawide, presumably because that feature requires the A13 processor found in the iPhone, and doesn’t work on the A12Z processor found in the iPad Pro. There’s also no Night Mode. Basically, the iPad Pro is a state-of-the-art Apple camera—from 2018.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the iPad Pro’s LiDAR Scanner is pure 2020. This scanner projects infrared light onto objects as far as 15 feet away, and calculates how long it takes to bounce back. That’s all happening at the speed of light, of course, so we’re talking about nanoseconds—but it allows the sensor to build a depth map of the space around it.</p>\n<p>The result is that Apple’s built-in augmented-reality engine <em>immediately</em> detects surfaces such as floors, tabletops, and walls. I was forced to wave my other Apple devices around a scene for a little while before they understood the geometry of the room I was in, but the iPad Pro knew immediately. I could quickly place an AR model on the floor, and when I slid it to a table, it immediately (and accurately) moved it there.</p>\n<p>This precision should also aid in features Apple introduced with iOS 13, most notably people occlusion, since understanding the depth of a person’s location allows the AR engine to properly guess what should go in front of or behind that person.</p>\n<p>For existing AR apps, the new LiDAR sensor will just build a better depth map—and those apps will work better. But developers can also make additional adjustments to take advantage of the increased spatial awareness caused by the LiDAR Scanner’s depth maps.</p>\n<h2>All our yesterdays</h2>\n<p>I’d like to gin up some disappointment to toss Apple’s way for not upgrading the iPad Pro to an A13-class processor, but it’s hard to do so. The A12X found in the 2018 iPad Pros is not really showing its age, and so it’s perhaps not surprising that Apple has more or less kept it around for this revision. Perhaps there’s an awesome new iPad chip in the offing, but it’s not the A12Z, which has the same processor cores as the A12X (four high-speed cores and four power-efficient ones), but has eight GPU cores instead of seven.</p>\n<p>When I ran Geekbench 5 on the two iPads, the results were entirely what you’d expect: Identical scores on single- and multi-core tests, and a slightly elevated graphics score on the new iPad. It’s truly nothing to get too excited about.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ipad-pro-chart-update-6c.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>If there’s any other performance to be gained on these iPads, it’s from a somewhat improved thermal system in the tablet’s internal design. A more efficient thermal design doesn’t change the fundamental speed of the processor, but the better a chip can be cooled, the longer it can run at higher speeds. This means that for extended activities that tax the processor, like a video encode, the new iPad Pro might be a bit faster than the older model.</p>\n<h2>Ghost features</h2>\n<p>Apple doesn’t talk about iPad memory, but if you recall, only the highest-end model of 2018 iPad had 6GB of RAM. This meant that it could go longer without quitting apps during multitasking, and if you pushed it hard, you could tell the difference. Reports say that the 2020 models all have 6GB of RAM, and while Apple’s keeping mum, that’s a nice upgrade if true.</p>\n<p>There are also reports that it’s got a U1 chip, the same chip that Apple introduced in the iPhone 11 and enabled Ultra Wideband technology that <em>might</em> be used in future Apple products but doesn’t do much more than enhance the AirDrop interface slightly. Again, Apple won’t talk about it, and I can report that there’s no enhanced AirDrop interface on the new iPad Pro. But that doesn’t mean there isn’t a U1 chip lurking inside, ready to be activated if Apple ever ships that much-rumored tracking tag product.</p>\n<p>Apple <em>does</em> say that the new iPad Pro has a new microphone system. Like the previous model, it has five different microphones—but these use a new architecture that’s borrowed from the same source as the 16-inch MacBook Pro. I have to be honest—I recorded some audio on both iPads and couldn’t really notice any difference.</p>\n<h2>It’s important to accessorize</h2>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ipad-2020-case-6c.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>When I was a kid, the action figures were cool but their accessories were even cooler. Those Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock action figures were more exciting when they were exploring the universe in a Barbie Winnebago. (Hey, you work with what you have.) In any event, the new iPad Pro is a small update, but there’s a lot of fun action happening on the accessory front.</p>\n<p>Perhaps most notable about all of Apple’s new accessories for the 2020 iPad Pro is that they’re also compatible with the 2018 iPad Pro. (Users of older models will notice that the camera cut-out is a bit larger than the actual camera bump on those models.) Apple could’ve mandated an update to the 2020 iPad Pro model just to get at the new accessories, but it chose not to, and I appreciate that.</p>\n<p>Of course, the big attraction is the iPad Pro Magic Keyboard, which features an adjustable hinge, USB-C charging port, floating design, backlit scissor-switch keys, and a trackpad. The trackpad announcement comes <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/03/the-ipad-cursor-is-here-no-wait-required/\">with a major iPadOS update</a> enabling cursor support. But Apple says the accessory itself won’t be available until May, and so all I can do is stare at pictures and wonder how it feels to type on, how stable it is in a lap, and how much it actually weighs. (Apple is not saying—and yes, I asked.)</p>\n<p>Both the Magic Keyboard <em>and</em> the Smart Keyboard Folio are dark gray, the uninspiring choice of iPad Pro accessories everywhere, but I’m excited to report that Apple has added an embossed Apple logo on their backs—and the logo is oriented like you’d see it on a MacBook, in landscape. I love it.</p>\n<p>The regular Smart Folio has the logo, too, but on that one it’s in portrait orientation, so you can’t win ’em all. But I’m still excited that Apple has expanded the color options of the Smart Folio, beyond the monochrome and a pale pink, to include two “seasonal” colors—Surf Blue and Cactus. Those gray cases are so boring. I ordered a Surf Blue Smart Folio case and look forward to giving my iPad Pro some personality—when it’s not in a keyboard case, anyway.</p>\n<h2>Familiar buying advice</h2>\n<p>For years now, reviews of the new iPhone have to go out of their way to point out that most people won’t be upgrading from the previous model of phone—but from a model two or three generations back. That’s just how the upgrade cycle rolls.</p>\n<p>This is that kind of iPad Pro update. If you’ve been thinking about getting an iPad Pro, or if you’ve been using one of the first- or second-generation iPad Pro models, this product was made for you. But if you’re using a 2018 iPad Pro, you can give this iPad a pass. The difference between your 2018 model and today’s 2020 version are relatively minor, so unless you care about AR or having an ultrawide camera, you can hang tight for the <em>next</em> generation of iPad Pro.</p>\n<p>The good news is, even if you don’t upgrade, you’ll still get to take advantage of all of those new accessories for the new iPad Pro. And really, that Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro is going to be what we remember the most about this new iPad Pro. Unfortunately, that story won’t be complete until that accessory arrives on the scene in a few months. With any luck, our patience will be rewarded.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 24 Mar 2020 12:30:00 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ipad-2020-hey-buddy-6c.jpg?ssl=1","linkMd5":"014dbbfb2e61a15a7e51889288bb68b1","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn84@2020_2/2020/08/24/18-19-09-365_d935da9904e3dc25.webp","destWidth":1360,"destHeight":793,"sourceBytes":63480,"destBytes":63480,"author":"Jason Snell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ipad-2020-hey-buddy-6c.jpg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn84@2020_2/2020/08/24/18-19-09-365_d935da9904e3dc25.webp","https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ipad-2020-ar-6c.jpg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn67@2020_6/2020/08/24/18-19-15-369_71459f43cb13aef0.webp","https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ipad-pro-chart-update-6c.png?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn39@2020_3/2020/08/24/18-19-16-853_8bea6cbd1f568850.webp","https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ipad-2020-case-6c.jpg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn71@2020_3/2020/08/24/18-19-13-139_efd806c10ec279cd.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144605},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"Fun With Charts: Entirely speculative charts about Apple Silicon","link":"https://sixcolors.com/?p=12254","description":"<p>Last week I stared directly into the Apple marketing content and <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/07/fun-with-charts-apple-silicon-edition/\">speculated about the information it was trying to impart with a WWDC slide</a>.

That makes it fairly easy to estimate the speed of the A14 processor, which presumably will power the new iPhone models being released this fall.</p>\n<p>Did you know that the current-model Apple A13 processor generates a faster Geekbench single-core score than the fastest single-core Mac, the 2019 i9 iMac? It’s true. Now, a Geekbench score doesn’t necessarily equate to real-world speed, because every operating system can be more or less efficient. But it’s a pretty decent proxy for us to use on the back of this envelope.</p>\n<p>Assuming the normal pace of growth, that theoretical A14 processor will put that 2019 iMac to shame in terms of single-core performance. Now let’s imagine a processor designed for the Mac—I’m going to call it the M14, because why not—that’s based on the A14 but is capable of running at a higher clock speed due to active cooling systems that don’t exist on iOS. (Again, this is a guess—maybe many future Macs will be entirely fanless—but let’s go with it.) A reasonable boost, from a theoretical 3GHz M14 chip to a 3.5GHz M14 would skyrocket single-core performance.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/silicon-speculation-single2.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"A chart full of made-up numbers.\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>That’s fun to imagine, but now let’s turn to where the rubber meets the road: multi-core performance. Again, Geekbench scores don’t tell the whole story — different operating systems behave differently when parceling out tasks to different cores. Also, Apple’s approach to multi-core processors in iOS devices is very different from the Intel processors used in Macs. Apple’s chips have two separate sets of processor cores, one set designed for high performance and the other for energy efficiency. When you really need to get work done, though, it’ll use all of them.</p>\n<p>Still, for my exercise I decided to just focus on the performance cores, because Geekbench scores really do seem to scale directly with the number of performance cores on a processor. Looking at recent trends, I again tried to extrapolate what the two-performance-core A14 processor in the next iPhone would offer, and likewise for a theoretical four-performance-core A14X processor that would power a new iPad Pro and perhaps (in some form) new Macs. Then, looking at current ratios of single-core and multi-core Geekbench scores, I imagined that my imaginary M14 processor had eight performance cores instead of four.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/silicon-speculation-multi.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"Another speculative chart.\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Look, this envelope is getting messy. But just consider the possibilities. Simply extrapolating the growth of the iPad Pro-class processor into the A14X generates a multi-core score that’s faster than the fastest MacBook Pro Apple currently makes.</p>\n<p>Now for giggles, toss in that eight-core “M14” processor. Now you’ve got a Mac that’s basically faster than any Intel Mac other than the very fastest Mac Pro and iMac Pro configurations.</p>\n<p>Will it happen? Who knows what Apple’s roll-out strategy will be. But if Apple wanted to use its iPad Pro-class processor in some lower-end Macs, and a souped-up processor in some higher-end Macs, it’s not unreasonable to imagine that it could blow away the performance of almost every Intel-based Mac.</p>\n<p>To repeat: These numbers are entirely made up. But going through the exercise makes me pretty confident that Apple will be able to deliver major upgrades to Mac performance.</p>\n<p>[<em>Thanks again to reader David Hovis for the suggestion.</em>]</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 24 Jul 2020 18:46:11 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/silicon-speculation-single2.png?ssl=1","linkMd5":"5e12264fba6cbc0357cc4a16e4efd9a0","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn41@2020_1/2020/08/24/18-19-09-992_705555e749487293.webp","destWidth":1360,"destHeight":882,"sourceBytes":28188,"destBytes":28188,"author":"Jason Snell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/silicon-speculation-single2.png?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn41@2020_1/2020/08/24/18-19-09-992_705555e749487293.webp","https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/silicon-speculation-multi.png?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn64@2020_6/2020/08/24/18-19-12-142_52e7fc0ef70b827b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144146},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"Viticci on the iPad as modular computer ↦","link":"http://two.wordpress.test/post/2020/04/viticci_on_the_ipad_as_modular_computer/","description":"<p>On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the iPad shipping, it’s worth reading <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/stories/modular-computer/\">Federico Viticci’s story about how he uses his iPad</a> today:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  The more I think about it, the more I come to this conclusion: the iPad, unlike other computers running a “traditional” desktop OS, possesses the unique quality of being multiple things at once. Hold an iPad in your hands, and you can use it as a classic tablet; pair it with a keyboard cover, and it takes on a laptop form; place it on a desk and connect it to a variety of external accessories, and you’ve got a desktop workstation revolving around a single slab of glass. This multiplicity of states isn’t an afterthought, nor is it the byproduct of happenstance: it was a deliberate design decision on Apple’s part based on the principle of modularity.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Federico pushes his iPad further than almost anyone else, but that’s okay. He is showing us what’s possible today and making us wonder about what might be possible tomorrow. (Like, true native external monitor support, maybe?)

We do everything our own way so that we can do it our own way.

Stern specifically calls out the brand new MacBook Air, which includes a 720p FaceTime HD camera; in some low-light conditions it’s arguably <em>worse</em> than a 2010 MacBook Pro. (Dell’s laptop camera was arguably worse, while the Pixelbook Go and Surface Laptop 3 did better in some places.)</p>\n<p>But here’s the thing: it’s not <em>just</em> the MacBook Air. The 13-inch <em>and</em> newly released 16-inch MacBook Pro both have a 720p camera, which is probably the exact same part. The tech specs for the 5K iMac say it has a “FaceTime HD camera” and don’t specify the resolution, but it says the same about the 2017 5K iMac I’m using, which definitely has a 720p camera. In fact, only <em>one</em> Mac has a webcam better than 720p—the 2017 iMac Pro, which has a 1080p camera.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, every iPhone in the 11 series can shoot 4K video with that front-facing camera, while the XS, XR, 8, and 7 all have at least 1080p cameras on the front. The iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad mini all have 1080p front-facing cameras—you have to get down to the $329 iPad in order to find a mobile device with a 720p camera.</p>\n<p>As Stern says, we obviously use the front-facing cameras on our iPhones and even iPads more than we probably use the webcam on our Macs. Apple made a gamble here, arguably skimping on a component that it didn’t think most people would care about—and it might have continued to skate by on that for a while, if it hadn’t been for all of us forced into video conferencing by the coronavirus outbreak.</p>\n<p>It’ll be interesting to see if this changes in new Macs, but you shouldn’t hold your breath: unless Apple had already independently decided to upgrade the webcams, it’s likely to be quite some time before they make their way into new Macs.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/video/series/joanna-stern-personal-technology/webcam-showdown-macbook-air-dell-xps-theyre-pretty-bad/415D393C-4320-442B-974D-1887E20C057F\">Go to the linked site</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/link/2020/04/laptop-webcams-are-kind-of-terrible/\">Read on Six Colors</a>.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 06 Apr 2020 22:36:00 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"06efcee67dd0f932de7364d643d0dffa","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Dan Moren","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144543},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"(Sponsor) Magic Lasso Adblock","link":"https://sixcolors.com/?p=12247","description":"<p>My thanks to <a href=\"https://www.magiclasso.co/\">Magic Lasso Adblock</a> for sponsoring Six Colors this week.

As someone who’s worked from home for 14 years–and lived alone for much of that time–I’m more than familiar with having to come up with ways to stay in touch with friends even when we can’t get together.</p>\n<p>One thing we’ve been doing over at <a href=\"http://theincomparable.com\">The Incomparable</a>–in addition to <a href=\"http://theincomparable.com/tpk\">playing a whole ton of D&#38;D</a>–is playing games online that we stream live for our listeners.</p>\n<p>A few people have asked what my setup is for these games, in particular the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Aq1rwQL-z8\">Jackbox sessions</a> we occasionally do, so I’m going to run down how I make it work. Note that my method is a little complex and very specific to me, and there are definitely other–and probably easier–ways to make it work. Where possible, I’ll mention alternatives, but this isn’t intended to be an exhaustive examination–just an explanation of how I do it.</p>\n<h2>Play</h2>\n<p>Jackbox Games’s <a href=\"https://jackboxgames.com/games/\">Jackbox Party Packs</a> are collections of delightful little mini games, usually intended for a bunch of folks clustered around a single game console. But they adapt pretty well to online play, thanks in large part to the fact that, besides the person hosting the game, other players need only access to a browser, regardless of whether it’s on a computer, tablet, or phone.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/streaming-jackbox-6c.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"Jackbox Games\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>I own five of the Jackbox Party Packs on my Xbox One, which is definitely not the ideal setup for streaming with friends who <em>aren’t</em> on Xbox. (Microsoft actually has pretty solid built-in tools to stream games via Mixer, which it now owns. If you’re only playing with people on that platform, it’s by far the easiest and best option. There’s also a Twitch app on Xbox which is reportedly pretty easy to use as well.)</p>\n<p>However, I’m streaming with folks who are on a variety of different devices, so I use my iMac to stream. Again, it would be much easier if I simply owned the Jackbox games, which are available on most common platforms, on my Mac. But I’m bought in on the Xbox, so that’s what I have to work with.</p>\n<h2>Capture</h2>\n<p>So, the first challenge is getting those games from my Xbox onto my Mac, so I can, in fact, stream them. For this I use an older version of an Elgato capture box, the Game Capture HD. The one I own<sup id=\"fnref-10841-appletv\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-10841-appletv\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup> isn’t for sale anymore, but frankly, that’s fine because the newer models that Elgato sells are better. If I were buying a new box today, I’d pick up <a href=\"https://www.elgato.com/en/gaming/game-capture-hd60-s-plus\">the HD60 S+</a>, which supports up to 1080p at 60 frames per second. (There’s a 4K version that is considerably more expensive, as well as internal capture cards which would require a PC or a Mac Pro.)</p>\n<p>Most of these capture devices work on roughly the same principle: plug the HDMI from your game console into one end, plug an HDMI cable from the other end back into the TV, so the capture box essentially sits in the middle, intercepting the signal. Then plug a USB cable into your Mac, fire up Elgato’s Game Capture HD software (or some other supported software) and you’ll be able to see the game in a window on your computer.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/streaming-gamecapturehd-6c.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"Game Capture HD\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>One of the downsides to having an older version of this hardware is that my only option on the software side is Elgato’s program–third-party software no longer supports or recognizes my game capture box. So I’m locked in to using Game Capture HD which, while serviceable, has its limitations. (More on which in a bit.)</p>\n<h2>Share</h2>\n<p>Okay, so I’ve got the game on my computer. Now to share it with my fellow players so they can see the screen while we’re playing. Like most of the world, I’ve been using video conferencing software <a href=\"https://zoom.us\">Zoom</a> to keep in touch with friends and family as well as recording podcasts. (This is what we’ve been using for Total Party Kill on The Incomparable for a while now.) That said, you don’t strictly <em>need</em> everybody to broadcast their camera for a game like this; as long as your players can see the screen, they only need to provide audio.</p>\n<p>However, you do need communication software that supports a) multiple people and b) screen sharing. Zoom works well for this, and it does have a free plan, though it’s not without its limitations. (Most crucially that it has a 40-minute limit on group calls.) Skype should work as well, although, full disclosure, I haven’t tried it in this workflow.</p>\n<p>Zoom also has the benefit of providing software that lets you not only share your screen but also your computer’s audio, which in games  like Jackbox, which have a lot of audio cues (and amusing dialogue), is pretty necessary. You could also use a piece of software like Rogue Amoeba’s <a href=\"https://rogueamoeba.com/loopback/\">Loopback</a> to create a virtual interface that meshes the game audio with your own mic input (assuming you’re participating in the game and not just hosting it).</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/streaming-zoom-6c.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"Zoom screen capture\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>Zoom lets you share one window off your screen; just remember to check the “Share computer sound” box if you need audio.</figcaption></figure><p>A few notes about using Zoom: first, you may need to configure it to show both your screen and your camera (again, assuming that you want or need your camera as well). Play with the Preferences &#62; General settings for Dual Displays or Side-by-Side Mode if it doesn’t seem to be working at first. For other systems, you might need to rely on a piece of software like <a href=\"http://camtwiststudio.com\">CamTwist</a>, which can let you merge multiple video sources into one.</p>\n<p>Second, since I’m sharing the Game Capture HD window, it means my players also see the sidebar of controls in that app. Though you can hide it using the View menu, it automatically–and annoyingly–appears whenever you mouse over the window. You could in theory fullscreen Game Capture HD, which also hides it in a separate space, but then you can’t see the game on the same screen as your video chat, and Zoom’s screen sharing seems to pause when you’re sharing from a separate space. Alternatively, you could capture just a portion of your screen, but be aware that if you move the window, another app overlaps on the game screen, or you use something like Mission Control, it will disrupt your screen sharing.</p>\n<p>And do be aware that, no matter what you do, both the capture and sharing via Zoom add some degree of delay to the game. While this is generally okay in games like Jackbox, it’s not really suitable for anything that requires fast reaction times. (Even in Jackbox, it’s worth turning on the Extended Timer options most of the games have, and reminding your players that the countdown timer they see is probably a few seconds behind the actual time.)</p>\n<h2>Stream</h2>\n<p>The game is coming into your Mac and all your players can (hopefully) see it. Now, how do you get your game out to the masses? Well, Elgato’s Game Capture HD does have built-in streaming that works pretty well and even allows you to layer over game commentary…and wouldn’t it be nice if that were the answer. Unfortunately, since Game Capture HD serves as both the input <em>and</em> output, trying to pipe audio from the game to the Zoom call, and then send it out again results in a whole lot of feedback.<sup id=\"fnref-10841-audioshenanigans\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-10841-audioshenanigans\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">2</a></sup></p>\n<p>So instead, I fell back to another piece of software that we use for TPK: Telestream’s <a href=\"http://www.telestream.net/wirecast/overview.htm\">Wirecast</a>. Wirecast is an extremely powerful piece of software that allows you to stream to one (or more) places, including YouTube and Twitch.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/streaming-wirecast-6c.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"Wirecast\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>Wirecast is a powerful–but pricey–piece of streaming software.</figcaption></figure><p>I use Wirecast’s screen capture features to grab the Game Capture HD window, just as I do in Zoom. You may remember that I had problems with capturing the sidebar for my players–the good news is that Wirecast makes it easy to scale and crop the screen capture, so that only the portion of the screen you want is sent to the stream.</p>\n<p>That said, Wirecast is very expensive, especially if you’re just looking for a way to relax with your friends. While perhaps not as user friendly, the open source <a href=\"https://obsproject.com\">OBS Studio</a> offers a lot of the same features for free, and is probably a much better choice for most folks.</p>\n<p>There’s also a service named <a href=\"https://streamyard.com/\">Streamyard</a> that some folks have recommended; it has both paid and free plans, though the latter has more limitations. I don’t have any personal experience with it, so can’t speak to its utility.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Not everybody needs all of the above steps. Some might just want to get together on a chat program like Zoom or Skype and play a game. Others might want to stream a Zoom chat live. You can mix and match these various steps to get the parts and tools you need.</p>\n<p>The most important thing about all of this is that it’s a great way to bring people together. Even in this time of isolation, the best way to deal with these things is together.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr><ol><li id=\"fn-10841-appletv\">\nOriginally purchased by my former employer when there was no way to get high quality captures of the Apple TV interface without this kind of hardware. <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fnref-10841-appletv\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/21a9.png\" alt=\"↩\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-10841-audioshenanigans\">\nIt’s possible there is a simpler way to do this using Loopback or some other audio routing software, but I definitely haven’t figured it out yet. <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fnref-10841-audioshenanigans\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/21a9.png\" alt=\"↩\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></a>\n</li>\n</ol></div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 20 Mar 2020 17:21:39 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/streaming-jackbox-6c.jpg?ssl=1","linkMd5":"df3cbed17e538b68669ff81cdce09dc5","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn92@2020_4/2020/08/24/18-19-07-441_4eb495c86d1a2b98.webp","destWidth":1360,"destHeight":818,"sourceBytes":36530,"destBytes":36530,"author":"Dan Moren","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/streaming-jackbox-6c.jpg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn92@2020_4/2020/08/24/18-19-07-441_4eb495c86d1a2b98.webp","https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/streaming-gamecapturehd-6c.jpg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn55@2020_5/2020/08/24/18-19-17-868_149db887824bc95b.webp","https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/streaming-zoom-6c.jpg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn35@2020_4/2020/08/24/18-19-15-250_b049b28a2056e95b.webp","https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/streaming-wirecast-6c.jpg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn76@2020_2/2020/08/24/18-19-14-016_238c2bf3fa857708.webp","https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/21a9.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn51@2020_2/2020/08/24/18-19-11-215_25686225908fe44d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144591},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"(Podcast) Rebound #293: John Gruber’s Footnote","link":"http://two.wordpress.test/post/2020/06/293_john_grubers_footnote/","description":"<p>Arm yourselves.

(Though let’s not be too altruistic: I’m sure Apple hopes that it will short circuit the current process of going public, thus potentially saving them the bad PR of having people yelling about the issues on Twitter.)</p>\n<p>Second, Apple says it will no longer hold up bug fix updates because of App Store review guidelines. Frankly, this should have always been the case—not only was this a bad policy for developers, but it was actively user-hostile, forcing customers into two bad options: keep using apps with annoying or potentially serious bugs or stop using the app altogether, all because of bureaucratic guidelines.</p>\n<p>While these are moves in the right direction, I doubt they will be enough to stave off the government inquiries that are already underway, nor earn back all the goodwill that the company has burned with developers.</p>\n<h2>The Force will not always be with you</h2>\n<p>Apple effectively killed 3D Touch last year by replacing it with the haptic touch feature in the iPhone 11 line, but it looks like its old-friend/the-same-exact-feature-with-a-different-name Force Touch is not long for the world either. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/23/apple-drops-force-touch-gesture-in-watchos-7/\">MacRumors reports that watchOS 7 is shifting developers away from using the Force Touch interaction</a>, in favor of exposing those features in other ways.</p>\n<p>Gotta say, I’m not broken up about that. Force Touch was clever, but too often it concealed features that were not easily discoverable. Moreover, I’m sure the technology to detect those harder presses took up space in the Apple Watch that could have been used for other things—battery, for example, or just making the Watch slimmer.</p>\n<p>My question is, now that Force Touch/3D Touch are gone on the Watch and on future iPhones, will it also quietly be phased out on the Mac? (That is, if anybody even remembers that it’s actually there in the first place…)</p>\n<h2>Never taken a Shortcut before?</h2>\n<p>Apple’s Shortcuts automation system got very little time on stage (what there was was mostly linked to the new Wind Down feature), but the app itself did get <a href=\"https://twitter.com/viticci/status/1275172195497623552\">a number of useful enhancements</a>, including folders, copy and pasting actions within shortcuts, new automation triggers, <em>and</em> running Shortcuts on the Apple Watch, including triggering them from complications on the watch face.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Shortcuts got some very cool updates in iOS/iPadOS 14:</p>\n<p>– Folders<br>\n– Disable confirmation for automations<br>\n– New compact UI for lists, input dialogs, running shortcuts in share sheet<br>\n– Automatic categories for share sheet/Watch<br>\n– Copy &#38; paste actions (!)<br>\n– New automation triggers <a href=\"https://t.co/8j4iZ0pyks\">pic.twitter.com/8j4iZ0pyks</a></p>\n<p>— Federico Viticci (@viticci) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/viticci/status/1275172195497623552?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 22, 2020</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>These changes make Shortcuts even more useful for its most devoted users. It warms the cockles of my heart to see Apple continue to invest in the power and utility of Shortcuts, even if it doesn’t give them much time in front of the keynote audience.</p>\n<h2>Other feature tidbits</h2>\n<p>iOS 14 has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gregbarbosa/status/1275188696296325121\">a very cool new Accessibility feature that can recognize certain sounds</a>, like fire alarms and animals, and then provide notifications to users. This is potentially amazing—and heck, life-saving—for hard-of-hearing folks who might otherwise not catch these sounds.</p>\n<p>There’s now <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gregbarbosa/status/1275187584864526336\">an NFC reader button in Control Center</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/kvanh/status/1275261658030649344\">Game Center got a refresh</a>!

In most cases, these wild ideas never come true—but sometimes they do. Because Apple has never lost its capacity to surprise us.</p>\n<p>So let me pitch a wild idea. For a few years now, there’s been discussion about how one day iOS, or at least the iPad, will need to become a full-fledged app development platform in order to become a Real Computer. I have never really bought into this rather arbitrary line of thinking, but if Apple truly believes the iPad has all the real-computer power most people need, at some point it needs to bring professional-level apps to the party. And one of those would be a tool for software developers.</p>\n<p>I don’t expect Apple to ever roll out full-bore Xcode on the iPad. But a tool that goes way beyond Swift Playgrounds and lets developers build iPhone and iPad apps right on the iPad? Sure, I can see that. I won’t say it would bestow magical Real Computer powers on the iPad, but it certainly would send a better message about the iPad being a professional device than an update to Pages would.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere, I’ve advocated for other features that would allow the iPad to approach the functionality of my Mac. Most of the automation I do on my Mac takes advantage of the Unix command line that lurks beneath the surface, most commonly manifested via the Terminal app. While plenty of developers have experimented with bringing <a href=\"http://ish.app\">command-line power to iOS in ingenious ways</a> like emulating Intel x86 devices,  this is really a Pandora’s Box that Apple should open, in the most secure and appropriate way possible.</p>\n<p>But these two observations really go together. Developing software isn’t always about writing iOS apps. Xcode comes with a whole host of command-line tools. Sometimes you need to compile source code, or cryptographically sign a file, using command-line tools on the Mac. Why not make those tools available on the iPad, too?</p>\n<p>So here’s my wild idea: Apple should introduce a Developer Mode to iPadOS. Like ChromeOS’s <a href=\"https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/docs/+/master/developer_mode.md\">Developer Mode</a>, this should be a feature that’s off by default and that requires users to enable several scary options in order to get access to the power of developer tools, including access to the command line and the ability to compile and run all sorts of software on your device.</p>\n<p>Do I think this will ever actually happen? No, not really. I suspect Apple will eventually release a software development app and will never offer anything resembling a command-line prompt. But you know what? Sometimes Apple does surprise us. And adding a whole bunch of features developers use every day to the iPad would be one great WWDC surprise.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 20:16:08 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ish-ipad.png?resize=1360%2C1047&ssl=1","linkMd5":"f05f0157ec98dc8cce123c3a84dff120","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn19@2020_2/2020/08/24/18-19-09-843_718937f53c8828a5.webp","destWidth":1360,"destHeight":1047,"sourceBytes":122310,"destBytes":122310,"author":"Jason Snell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ish-ipad.png?resize=1360%2C1047&ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn19@2020_2/2020/08/24/18-19-09-843_718937f53c8828a5.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144218},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"Brent Simmons provides some App Store reality ↦","link":"https://sixcolors.com/?p=12342","description":"<p>I love <a href=\"http://www.firejoemorgan.com/2008/10/lets-talk-about-whats-important-here.html\">a good</a> <a href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Fisking\">Fisking</a>, and Brent Simmons <a href=\"https://inessential.com/2020/07/28/untrue\">has done a number on a Cult of Mac piece about the App Store</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  [That the App Store was a much better deal for selling software than what came before] is enormously untrue. I know because I was one of many small developers who were there.</p>\n<p>  We used Kagi as our payment processor at the time, and I think we paid around 5% for our storefront and payment processing and everything. Completely reasonable, and we were perfectly happy with it.</p>\n<p>  There were a lot of small companies operating that way. Hardly any of us were selling boxes through retail stores in the 2000s — we were already selling over the web by the mid ’90s.</p>\n<p>  Nobody saw this as a bargain. The developers I knew — small developers with nice toeholds! — were shocked and astonished, because we were used to paying 5-10%.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Tim Cook will be <a href=\"https://docs.house.gov/meetings/JU/JU05/20200729/110883/HHRG-116-JU05-Wstate-CookT-20200729.pdf\">speaking before Congress</a> on Wednesday, and will apparently be using a version of this argument in his opening statement.</p>\n<p>It’s so misguided. The right argument is that the App Store provided a safer, more convenient place for people to find and buy software. To make a disingenuous comparison to buying a box of software at a brick and mortar store misses the reality of how software was distributed on the Internet before the App Store was founded.</p>\n<p>The truth is, Steve Jobs really believed that everyone who made money off of the Apple ecosystem was a parasite living off Apple’s greatness.<sup id=\"fnref-12342-sounddock\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-12342-sounddock\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup> The 30% App Store cut is rooted in that philosophy.

What I discovered was an incredibly versatile solution that accomplishes in a single device what Snell and Federico cleverly constructed from a field recorder and USB audio interface: <a href=\"https://www.sounddevices.com/product/mixpre-3-ii/\">the Sound Devices MixPre-3 II</a>.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>The iPad podcast workflow of mine that John references is <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2019/02/a-week-of-podcasting-with-only-an-ipad-pro/\">this one from last year</a>, in which I took two devices I already owned—the Zoom H6 recorder and the USPBPre2 audio interface—and chained them together to build a set-up that records my audio and also lets me send and receive audio from Skype as usual.</p>\n<p>It works, but it’s two boxes—and John’s solution is a single box. That’s better. However, the MixPre-3 seems to fail at a key moment:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  The trouble was that, although I could record my audio locally to the SD card, the audio of the Skype call still played over my iPad’s speakers and used the iPad’s microphone. It was a perplexing problem because audio from other apps was properly routed over the USB-C cable.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Short of Apple supporting more sophisticated audio on the iPad itself, the iPad podcasting dream is a single USB interface that will act as a proper audio interface for the iPad—routing iPad sound out and microphone input in—while also acting as a recorder. It seems like the MixPre-3 fails this at the very last moment. John’s solution, of routing via analog means instead, is very clever—but it means that the audio he’s sending back over Skype is probably coming out of his iPad’s onboard microphones, not his good microphone. That’s good enough, unless his recording fails.</p>\n<p>These days… well, these days I don’t travel at all. But before the pandemic, my travel iPad toolkit ended up being the <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/02/review_audio-technica_atr-2100x_microphone/\">Audio Technica ATR-2100</a> microphone, which I connect to the iPad via USB <em>and</em> to an external recorder via XLR, since the Audio Technica microphone offers both ports. I end up with a pristine recording of my voice, but no backup recording of the Skype call in case of a recording failure on the other end.</p>\n<p>The real question is, which process will complete first — us finding a bulletproof solution to recreating <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2017/02/audio-hijack-3-flexibility/\">Audio Hijack</a> in external hardware, or Apple realizing that it needs to seriously upgrade its audio game on iPadOS.

For contact tracing, most people wouldn’t opt out either. And if they do, there are plenty of things we could do to push them to opt-in again, such as asking for a new confirmation every few hours, or asking them to navigate to settings every few hours to confirm the opt-out. Every country might not achieve 99% penetration with an opt-out because of politics, but if we want these apps to be useful, this is the only way.</p>\n<p>  The point that I am trying to make here is that we need a very, very high penetration of these apps for them to matter, and every decision that users make will drop that significantly. But if we achieve it, the prize is amazing.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>His argument is that these Bluetooth-based tracking systems will really only be effective in stopping the spread of the disease if they’re pushed out to as many phones as possible and opted in automatically with a very strong warning to anyone who would consider opting out. Otherwise, they won’t be running on enough devices for it to make an effective tool.</p>\n<p>Pueyo also suggests that since wireless carriers have access to GPS data (they’ve <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/10/18176898/sprint-t-mobile-att-phone-tracking-data\">even been caught selling it!</a>), an effective contact-tracing tool would involve the carriers giving up all that data so that people’s movements can be tracked even more precisely.</p>\n<p>Pueyo’s suggestion that we should get over concerns about privacy and get to collecting as much personal tracking data as possible makes me deeply uncomfortable. He writes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  We fear 1984. We want to avoid an AI-driven world where the government knows our every movement, rate us according to our behavior, and soon tell us what to think. We don’t want to be China…. The first way we break it down is realizing that this is not about everybody’s data, but rather that of two small groups: the infected and their contacts….</p>\n<p>  We should put privacy in context of the other rights we’ve lost. <em>We’ve lost our health. We’ve lost our economy. We have lost our freedom.</em> If we can get them back with a little bit of privacy, are we not going to consider it?\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>What an unsettling question.</p><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-how-to-do-testing-and-contact-tracing-bde85b64072e\">Go to the linked site</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/link/2020/04/bluetooth-and-the-virus-dance/\">Read on Six Colors</a>.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 28 Apr 2020 22:01:47 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"e546bb64a9b5a0ca1cbdca87ad701d17","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jason Snell","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144272},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"(Podcast) #279: The Luke Skywalker","link":"http://two.wordpress.test/post/2020/03/279_the_luke_skywalker/","description":"<p>Dan, Lex and John discuss the coronavirus, WWDC, sketchy rumors, hoarding and Apple not making the things we want.</p><p><a href=\"http://reboundcast.com/episode/279\">Go to the podcast page</a>.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 05 Mar 2020 18:15:00 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"0304f7ecd2f37545c134c8e88208cb50","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Dan Moren","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144607},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"(Podcast) #296: You Wouldn’t Believe The Stuff I Know","link":"http://two.wordpress.test/post/2020/05/296_you_wouldnt_believe_the_stuff_i_know/","description":"<p>Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman joins Myke and Jason to discuss how Apple’s responding to the pandemic, the current state of iPhone development, and how he handles breaking major Apple news.

We think that iPhone 5G support, ”ŒiPad”Œ’s adoption of innovative mid-size panel technology, and Mac’s first adoption of the own-design processor are all Apple’s critical product and technology strategies. Given that the processor is the core component of new products, we believe that Apple had increased 5nm-related investments after the epidemic outbreak. Further, Apple occupying more resources of related suppliers will hinder competitors’ developments.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>If this report is accurate, the first thing it means is that I’m going to be wrong again and 2020 isn’t the year we finally see ARM Macs. But they’re coming.</p>\n<p>The next question is, will developers be given advance warning from Apple? I would hope so, as early as WWDC this year. Ideally developers would even have some transitional hardware to use as a testbed—whether that’s an iPad Pro that can be wiped and turned into a sample ARM Mac, or something even weirder—as they work out any kinks involved in recompiling their apps to run on ARM. There is probably no company in the computer industry that has done a better job of navigating chip transitions than Apple. And in this case, they’re managing a transition to chips they design themselves. That’s gotta help, right?</p>\n<p>The next question, of course, is <em>what</em> Macs make the move to ARM? The biggest appeal of ARM processors is that they’re remarkably energy efficient. And of course, Apple’s current chips are all designed for phones and tablets. As a result, it seems most likely that Apple’s first ARM Macs would be consumer laptops. We really don’t know if Apple intends to entirely replace Intel with ARM, or offer two different architectures for different kinds of devices. (There’s also that rumor that Apple may be toying with using AMD’s processors rather than Intel’s, adding yet another confusing wrinkle.)</p>\n<p>That all said, as <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/02/fun-with-charts-mobile-prices-and-performance/\">my chart from last week shows</a>, Apple’s processors in the iPad Pro are remarkably powerful. Wouldn’t you want that kind of power (and energy efficiency) in a Mac laptop?

No deal there (at least not yet). And if you subscribed to HBO via Apple’s Channels interface, <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2020/05/27/hbo-now-leaves-apple-tv-channels/\">that’s gone too</a>.</p>\n<p>Thanks to Comcast’s <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/warnermedia-strikes-eleventh-hour-hbo-max-distribution-deal-comcast-1296120\">last-minute deal with WarnerMedia</a>, I was able to try out the HBO Max app on my iPad and Apple TV today. Both appear to be new versions of the existing HBO NOW app, which makes sense since this new service subsumes the older, smaller HBO over-the-top subscription service.</p>\n<p>The apps seem… fine, if not groundbreaking. Like HBO’s existing apps, HBO Max doesn’t offer descriptive video, has poor support for accessibility, and doesn’t support 4K HDR video. So it’s behind many of its competitors technically. I found that the Apple TV app tended to jump over some featured blocks of content when scrolling down, forcing me to scroll back to to select them. (Seems like a bug to me.)</p>\n<p>As with Apple’s TV app and Apple TV+, it feels like all of the content from the core HBO service is a little too hidden from the rest of the app—I had to search and search to find “Last Week Tonight With John Oliver” and add it to my list of shows.</p>\n<p>The HBO Max content story is a bit of a mess, too. Some of the originals from AT&#38;T’s separate DC Universe service <a href=\"https://twitter.com/loudmouthjulia/status/1265676975332564994\">aren’t available at launch</a>, which seems silly—do they expect us to subscribe to both HBO Max and DC Universe? Most of the DC TV series on The CW aren’t here, owing to that network’s deal with Netflix. It will probably take WarnerMedia and AT&#38;T years to unravel all of its agreements with rival streaming services.</p>\n<p>But with HBO Max here and Comcast/NBCUniversal’s Peacock currently in a soft-launch on Xfinity hardware only <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/peacock-sets-national-launch-slate-1294559\">in advance of its public launch in July</a>, we’re rapidly reaching the end of the multi-year period where everyone knows that all the media giants are coming for Netflix with their own streaming services—and entering the period where the battle is truly joined.</p>\n<p>This will take years to resolve. Billions will be spent in the name of streaming supremacy. All I know is, I can watch “Doom Patrol” now, and these new Looney Tunes shorts look fun. We’ll see where this goes from here. And can I put in a plug for an original series set in the Harry Potter universe?

I mean, I know you’re all waiting with bated breath to hear about function calls and implementing error handlers, but let’s not get <em>too</em> excited. Anyway, here are a few quick tidbits I picked up from Thursday’s sessions.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/10617\">Bring keyboard and mouse gaming to iPad</a></strong></p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/59CCA79B-8905-4883-8310-E64081F73658-680x510.png?resize=680%2C510&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Gaming with Keyboard and mouse on the iPad.\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>Now I’m going to get wrecked by iPad players, aren’t I?</figcaption></figure><p>It’s been a long time since I’ve played a game on a PC (or even my Mac), but I was once a decent FPS player back in the era of Quake 3 and I’m totally dating myself here, aren’t I.</p>\n<p>Keyboard and mouse input have often been considered the gold standard for gaming<sup id=\"fnref-11589-preferxbox\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-11589-preferxbox\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup>, and with the advent of support for external pointing devices as well as the new Magic Keyboard, Apple has moved quickly to provide APIs for games that want to take advantage of playing via these devices.</p>\n<p>The system for using these devices is built on top of the same framework provided for external game controllers, but provides certain features tuned towards using keyboard and mice. For example, you can check whether keys on the keyboard are in up or down state, you can lock the pointer to avoid triggering system events like showing the Dock (and hiding the system cursor), and you can even implement support for scroll wheels on mice.</p>\n<p>It’s even possible to switch between the usual cursor and keyboard support and game-related input within the game, for situations where, for example, you’re using a keyboard and mouse to play a multiplayer game, but want to allow users to access menus between matches.</p>\n<p>Gamers will no doubt welcome these advancements, just as they did for external controller support. They also provide additional accessibility options for those who can’t or prefer not to use the touch screen or an external game controller. Moreover, they reinforce both the idea that pointer support isn’t just something Apple threw together, as well as investing in the longevity of both of these devices as input methods on both iPadOS <em>and</em> macOS.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/10061\">Expand your SiriKit Media Intents to more platforms</a></strong></p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/4B0D235B-CE58-401A-A05E-1CA2A938C36F.png?resize=680%2C510&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Siri Alternatives UI\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>When you request a song, album, or artist via Siri, the UI can now provide alternatives, in case it misunderstood the request.</figcaption></figure><p>Maybe I’m in the minority, but I do actually use Siri fairly often to play a specific song, album, or artist. While Apple had previously added the ability for third-party music apps to hook into the virtual assistant, it’s now made some further enhancements, allowing for both support on more platforms and additional features.</p>\n<p>The HomePod will use a new cloud playback API as well as integrating the same media intents used on iOS, and Apple TV will also now support third-party media intents, meaning that you can use Siri on the remote to play music (and presumably other media) in non-Apple applications.</p>\n<p>There’s also a new UI for an Alternatives feature that allows apps to provide other options, in case what starts playing wasn’t exactly what you were looking for. So, for example, if you asked Siri to start playing an album but it plays the wrong song, you could use this to pick a different song from the album.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/10173\">Get the Most Out of Sign in with Apple</a></strong></p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1AB567E9-7A33-43AC-8FD7-F18E029D0D46.png?resize=680%2C510&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Sign in with Apple\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>Converting an existing account to Sign in with Apple is about to get a lot easier.</figcaption></figure><p>Sign in with Apple was one of last year’s most exciting announcements, and adoption for the feature has been on the rise. But there were some limitations with the approach, and this year Apple is targeting one specific way to bolster adoption: converting existing user accounts to Sign in with Apple.</p>\n<p>Some services do this already, but Apple’s providing a standardized API for doing so, via a few different entry points. One is when you log into a service for which you have a weak credential, like an easily guessable password. You can be prompted to update your account to Sign in with Apple, if the service provides it. Similarly, if the password manager in Settings alerts you that you have a weak password, it can offer the option to convert the account for you. Finally, developers can offer an option within their app for users to choose to convert their account.</p>\n<p>Once the conversion process, which is largely transparent, has concluded, the old weak credential is removed, avoiding the risk of duplicating accounts. (I will say it was unclear to me whether that involves changing the account on the service’s back end, as opposed to just changing the credential within iOS/iPadOS. Is Apple trusting third-party services to merely do the right thing, and not hold on to existing account information, or does it enforce this policy somehow?)</p>\n<p>These days, when I have the option to use Sign in with Apple when creating an account, I often take it, but there are so many services on which I already have accounts that I’m looking forward to this option being more widely available.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr><ol><li id=\"fn-11589-preferxbox\">\nI’ve been playing a lot of <em>Sea of Thieves</em> on my Xbox recently, and since the game has cross-play with the PC, one of the multiplayer options is to prefer sessions with only players using Xbox controllers, so you don’t get consistently and mercilessly slaughtered by keyboard and mouse users.

This is, I believe, the key differentiator for the iPad Pro and Magic Keyboard: when paired together, you have a useful, credible laptop mode for your iPad; pick up the iPad – which you can even do with one hand by just pulling it from the cover without knocking it loose – and you still have a fantastic tablet with a vibrant ecosystem of tablet-optimized apps and a multi-touch OS. For the same price and weight, yes, you could get a MacBook Air (or even a MacBook Pro) instead of an iPad Pro with Magic Keyboard; however, I wouldn’t recommend trying to pull a MacBook’s display away from the keyboard when you’d like to use a tablet instead.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>The ability to choose your preferred working style moment to moment, with the ability to switch it up on a moment’s notice when your needs change, is really the killer feature of the iPad.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/stories/magic-keyboard-for-ipad-pro-a-new-breed-of-laptop/\">Go to the linked site</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/link/2020/04/viticci-on-the-magic-keyboard-for-ipad-pro/\">Read on Six Colors</a>.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 21 Apr 2020 18:10:04 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"91eaa248b452b837a620a2ca838964fc","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jason Snell","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144489},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"Wish List: Activity Pause for Apple Watch","link":"http://two.wordpress.test/post/2020/03/wish_list_activity_pause_for_apple_watch/","description":"<p>Earlier this year, before the world found itself in the grips of a pandemic, I had a nasty bout of the flu. It laid me flat for a solid week, and even after I’d mostly recovered, it took a while for me to ramp back up to my normal activity.</p>\n<figure class=\"pull-right\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/iphone-activity-streak-6c.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"iphone-activity-streak\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>That one week in January/February was rough.</figcaption></figure><p>But apparently nobody told my Apple Watch. For the worst of my illness, I didn’t even bother putting it on, but once I started feeling better, I dutifully got back into the habit. And thus began my Watch’s repeated daily reminders about how I was failing to be active enough. “Stand up!” it would proclaim at ten to the hour, even as I lay huddled on the couch, consuming the entirety of <em>Star Wars: Resistance</em>. “You’re usually further along in your rings by now!”</p>\n<p>Look, I get it, Apple Watch. You want us to be active, healthy, and happy. And most of the time, that’s just fine. But sometimes circumstances are beyond our control, and not only should we not be made to feel guilty about it, but more to the point, we should not be forcing ourselves into action when it would be actively detrimental to our health.</p>\n<p>So now, as many people around the world may be sick (hopefully only mildly) or stuck in their houses, perhaps it’s time to think about dialing back on this a bit. To that end, a couple of suggestions about how to adapt the Apple Watch’s activity tracking features.</p>\n<p>First, the Apple Watch activity alerts should allow an option to tell the watch that you’re under the weather.<sup id=\"fnref-10847-beatit\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-10847-beatit\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup> That should reduce the number of nagging reminders for you to be active during the day, without tempting us to rip our watches from our wrist and fling them across the room. (Yes, you can turn off all activity-related notifications, but that’s inconvenient and perhaps overkill for a few days.)</p>\n<figure class=\"pull-right\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/activity-watch-nag-6c.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"activity-watch-nag\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>Bug someone else, I’m busy.</figcaption></figure><p>Secondly, I propose some form of “streak forgiveness.” Many of us are devoted to closing our rings every day, and it’s a real bummer when illness gets in the way. So you should be able to mark that you’re sick and take a day or two off without affecting your overall fitness streak.</p>\n<p>“But surely people will use that to <em>cheat</em>!” I can hear you exclaiming.</p>\n<p>Friends, there’s no prize here. (Okay, yes, there are those medals you get for completing challenges, but I hate to be the one to break it to you: they’re just pixels on a screen.) We’re all doing this voluntarily, because we <em>want</em> to be healthy and active–the only person you’re cheating if you were to abuse this feature is yourself. And if you want to cheat yourself, who is Apple to get in the way? If it’s that much of a concern, put an asterisk next to it. This isn’t the Houston Astros, folks.</p>\n<p>For those who partake in activity competitions, since your points are based on how much you actually move, then you wouldn’t get any extra points anyway. But again, those competitions are totally voluntary, and you’re not competing in an Olympic event.</p>\n<p>It’d be great to see a feature of this sort in watchOS 7 or, hey, sooner. Apple should at the very least consider letting you temporarily mute the Activity reminders for a preset amount of time. Because we all want to be getting out more–it just may not be our fault if we can’t.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr><ol><li id=\"fn-10847-beatit\">\nColloquially, I refer to this as the “[expletive] off, I’m sick!” button. <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fnref-10847-beatit\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/21a9.png\" alt=\"↩\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></a>\n</li>\n</ol></div>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 25 Mar 2020 15:50:22 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/iphone-activity-streak-6c.jpg?ssl=1","linkMd5":"d5dee5bb61cca5ffe4ea888f703eef3a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn60@2020_2/2020/08/24/18-19-06-464_da14297455efbb05.webp","destWidth":680,"destHeight":903,"sourceBytes":49440,"destBytes":49440,"author":"Dan Moren","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/iphone-activity-streak-6c.jpg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn60@2020_2/2020/08/24/18-19-06-464_da14297455efbb05.webp","https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/activity-watch-nag-6c.jpg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn56@2020_6/2020/08/24/18-19-15-393_6e2af6a9b100bb53.webp","https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/21a9.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn51@2020_2/2020/08/24/18-19-11-215_25686225908fe44d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144587},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"Using emojis to describe the COVID-19 outbreak ↦","link":"http://two.wordpress.test/post/2020/03/using_emojis_to_describe_the_outbreak/","description":"<p>The entire world is in the midst of massive disruption due to the global COVID-19 pandemic.

The investigations concern in particular the mandatory use of Apple’s own proprietary in-app purchase system and restrictions on the ability of developers to inform iPhone and iPad users of alternative cheaper purchasing possibilities outside of apps.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>It seems like it was only a matter of time before Apple ran afoul of the EU antitrust concerns, especially after <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/link/2019/03/apple-responds-to-spotify/\">Spotify complained last year</a>.</p>\n<p>The EC is particularly focusing on Apple’s requirement of its proprietary in-app purchase system, and the requisite 30-percent cut that the company takes of those transactions. There seems to have been some signs of this softening in recent years, such as the <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/link/2020/04/did-apple-and-amazon-just-settle-their-in-app-purchase-dispute/\">limited ability to purchase video content in app</a> and lowering subscriptions to a <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/link/2016/06/schiller-details-app-store-revisions/\">15-percent cut after a year</a>, but it remains a contentious issue. Additionally, the EC is not thrilled that Apple doesn’t let app developers advertise other ways for users to get content, which has long resulted in a sub-par experience on iOS that requires a lengthy explanation of, say, how to buy a book for an e-book reader.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_1075\">The <em>second</em> investigation is related to Apple Pay</a>, namely the inability of third-party apps to use an Apple device’s NFC technology for their own payment system:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  The investigation concerns Apple’s terms, conditions and other measures for integrating Apple Pay in merchant apps and websites on iPhones and iPads, Apple’s limitation of access to the Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality (“tap and go”) on iPhones for payments in stores, and alleged refusals of access to Apple Pay.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Which is to say, the only way to use tap-and-pay systems on your iPhone or Apple Watch is via Apple Pay. Your credit card company, or PayPal, Square, or other payment system, is stuck using QR codes or other methods, unless they agree to Apple Pay’s terms. The EC announcement references “alleged restrictions of access to Apple Pay for specific products of rivals on iOS and iPadOS smart mobile devices,” though it does not spell out those complaints.</p>\n<p>While both of these investigations are taking place in Europe, they could have far-reaching implications for Apple’s operations around the world.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com\">a statement to The Verge and elsewhere</a>, Apple said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  “It’s disappointing the European Commission is advancing baseless complaints from a handful of companies who simply want a free ride, and don’t want to play by the same rules as everyone else…We don’t think that’s right — we want to maintain a level playing field where anyone with determination and a great idea can succeed.”\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>However, the wheels of justice grind exceedingly slow, so this is probably only the beginning of what’s likely to be a lengthy process.

Two decades ago Apple parked the sixteen-year-old Classic Mac OS and leaped to version 10.0, but four years ago the company rebranded the software that drives the Mac as macOS, and the writing was on the wall. And now in 2020 it’s macOS Big Sur, version 11.0. The name is an extension of Apple’s use of California places to brand its Mac releases, but the version number is the real story. The Mac OS X era is truly over. macOS Big Sur is the start of a radically new era in the Mac’s life.</p>\n<p>With the release of the macOS Big Sur Public Beta, Apple is inviting users to get a head start on the journey that will eventually lead to Macs running Apple-designed processors and software built for iPhones and iPads alongside apps made specifically for the Mac. With <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/07/what-changes-might-be-coming-to-new-mac-hardware/\">huge changes to Mac hardware looming on the horizon</a>, Apple has made the biggest design changes to macOS since the launch of Mac OS X.</p>\n<p>Last year’s macOS Catalina felt like a release designed to settle old scores and clear the field for future advancement. It broke a lot of old software, frustrated a lot of users, and generally had the worst reputation of any macOS update in a decade. (I see you, Mac OS X Lion.) Did Apple sacrifice Catalina so that future OS updates wouldn’t be blamed for them? That’s probably a conspiracy theory too far, but I will say this: Good Cop macOS Big Sur fills me with excitement about the future of the Mac in a way Bad Cop Catalina never did.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-12331\"></span></p>\n<h2>The new macOS design</h2>\n<p>When Apple makes major operating-system design changes, they tend to start out a bit extreme and then get beaten into shape over time—until they become boring and are replaced by a new design. There are definitely some aggressive, challenging changes in the macOS Big Sur design that will throw long-time Mac users for a loop. And I expect that some of them will end up getting re-thought by Apple’s designers, if not this summer than over the next couple of years.</p>\n<p>That said, a lot of aspects of the Big Sur already feel comfortable—probably because I also use an iPhone and an iPad (as do most Mac users) and Big Sur is picking up aspects of the design of those devices. Big Sur’s design has a lot of rough edges, but it also has a lot of potential.</p>\n<h3>High-contrast windows</h3>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bigsur-finder-composite.jpeg?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>Windows in Big Sur are very white (or very dark grey).</figcaption></figure><p>If the atom of the Mac interface is the window, then Apple has split the atom in Big Sur. The first time you look at a Finder window in Big Sur, you will realize that the Mac you have known for years is gone. Let’s start with the sheer lightness (or in Dark Mode, darkness) of it all: the gray gradient of the title bar and toolbar is gone, replaced by a white (or very dark gray) space that’s populated with the contents of both the title bar and toolbar, collapsed into a single row of items. Toolbar icons are simple glyphs that only gain an outline when you mouse over them. The title, once centered, has been aligned to the left and made bolder, with its icon hidden (until you mouse over). The Back and Forward buttons are perched on the extreme left, even beyond the title of the window. The Search box is now gone, collapsed by default—you must click the Search icon to make it appear.</p>\n<p>Apple has also altered the geography of the window itself, in a move that was telegraphed with the design of several apps, including Music, Podcasts, Reminders, and Maps, in macOS Catalina. Previously, a normal Mac window was best thought of as a single space with a title bar and toolbar spanning its entire width, and within it could be a content area or a sidebar and content area. But if you have a window with a sidebar in Big Sur, the geography is different. The window is instead sectioned in two, with the sidebar and the red/yellow/green “traffic light” buttons on the left (with a slightly translucent background), and the title bar, toolbar, and content area on the right.</p>\n<p>SF Symbols, Apple’s library of glyphs, has been added to macOS with Big Sur, and it lends an air of consistency to toolbars and sidebars. The appearance of colored glyphs in sidebars—favorites in the Finder are blue, for example—is a pleasant addition. Even the venerable “disclosure triangle” that you can click to reveal the contents of a folder has been reduced—it’s lost its third edge and its gray fill color, and is now just a carat. (It also appears in sidebars as a way to collapse or expand lists of sub-items, replacing the word “Hide” that appears in Catalina.)</p>\n<p>While the density in the toolbar has gone way up, the rest of the window has spaced out. There’s much more space between the red/yellow/green “traffic light”  buttons and the edge of the window, and the same is true of the additional white space above and to the right of the title bars/toolbar.</p>\n<p>The windows of apps that haven’t been updated to support this new format will receive a more minor makeover. The title bar will be white (or dark gray), and the title font is now bold, but the title is still centered and there’s none of the additional padding that’s been added to new-style Big Sur windows.</p>\n<h3>Make room for Big Sur</h3>\n<p>Adding more padding is a recurring theme in Big Sur. Apple has also made the menu bar taller (as well as making it distractingly translucent). The menus themselves now sport curved edges at the top (which seems wrong metaphorically?), and there’s additional space between each menu items.</p>\n<p>The big question is, does this mean that Apple is preparing for a future where Mac screens also support touch input, so that you could navigate a menu with your finger in a pinch? It sure feels that way, but I’m open to the possibility that Apple just thinks that our displays are big enough now that they can afford to look a little less cramped. I wonder what this design decision means for the future of tiny Apple laptops. I know I’d be frustrated if my old 11-inch MacBook Air was this inefficient with space.</p>\n<p>It also feels that everything in Big Sur is rounded at the edges, from windows to menu items to alerts to the Dock to the icons… it’s consistent, and in keeping with most of Apple’s hardware designs, which eschew sharp edges. It makes me wonder why Apple didn’t just mask the corners of the screen in Big Sur (as they were on the original Mac) to make them feel equally curved. The right angles at the corner of my display seem awfully jarring when I’m using Big Sur.</p>\n<p>Speaking of icons, I should mention that Apple has <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/07/dr-icon-and-the-icons-of-big-sur/\">redesigned all of its app icons</a> and appears to be all in on making the iOS-style rounded rectangle the standard on macOS as well. Every single Apple icon is a roundrect, and given that future Macs will be able to run iOS and iPadOS apps, perhaps it makes sense to strive for some sort of icon harmony.</p>\n<p>That said, Apple’s icons are peculiarly inconsistent when it comes to items placed in front of the roundrect, such as the (outmoded) hard drive in Disk Utility, the loupe in Preview, and the chess piece in Chess. Not only do these items break the silhouette of the roundrect shape, which spoils the entire point, but they’re not even placed consistently—they’re all viewed from somewhat different perspectives.</p>\n<p>I’m also not sold on some of the additional detail Apple has added to the icons. Apple says that the level of detail in the new Mac icons is intended to be an homage to the rich icons from OS X’s past. But at most sizes, the added shading to the Messages icon just makes it look dusty. And I guess adding a line of text on the back of the Mail icon’s envelope is a fun easter egg, but at certain sizes it’s just a nondescript line that kind of looks like a mistake.</p>\n<p>If you happen to be someone who designs app icons, though, you will be cheering. One look at the Dock in Big Sur will tell you who has gotten with the program and who is, in the words of Steve Jobs, a “laggard app.” Circles? Random shapes? They stick out like sore thumbs. Apps with existing iOS counterparts will probably just use versions of those icons; every other Mac app is going to need a roundrect icon update to avoid looking hideously out of step with the times.</p>\n<p>The Dock itself has, of course, also gotten a makeover. It’s more translucent (which is fine, since there are no legibility problems with icons like there are with text in the menu bar), it’s floated away from the edge of the window (there’s that trend toward more padding again), and of course the corners are aggressively rounded.</p>\n<h3>Revolution in the menu bar</h3>\n<figure class=\"pull-right\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bigsur-controlcenter.jpeg?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>Control Center in Big Sur.</figcaption></figure><p>Another major change to macOS is happening in the upper right corner of the menu bar, where Apple has introduced Control Center and redesigned Notification Center. Both of these moves have a lot of potential, but I’m less impressed with the execution.</p>\n<p>When you click on the new Control Center menu bar item, you’ll see a Mac expression of the Control Center concept that’s been on the iPhone and iPad for a while now. Essentially, Apple is grouping a bunch of common device controls in a single sub-menu, rather than putting them all under individual menu bar items. If you <em>do</em> want an individual menu bar item for a particular control, you can drag it out of Control Center and into the menu bar to add it. (But it remains in Control Center, too.)</p>\n<p>Control Center offers controls for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, AirDrop, Do Not Disturb, keyboard brightness, AirPlay Display, display brightness and related controls, volume level and other sound controls, and a Now Playing item for media control. Many of these controls are simple sliders and buttons, but when you mouse over them you’re offered a carat symbol that leads to more in-depth settings.</p>\n<p>It’s a nice idea, but the execution is a mixed bag. You can remove some items from Control Center (via the Dock and Menu Bar area in System Preferences), but not others. I like the idea of pulling a lot of stray icons out of the menu bar, and giving users a single place to go to adjust a lot of device settings. But there needs to be more customizability and consistency.</p>\n<p>To access the new Notification Center, you click on the clock in the menu bar, rather than the previous Notification Center icon. I’m all for reducing menu bar clutter, but this doesn’t make sense to me. Notification Center isn’t related to the clock in any way. This is Apple attempting to cut corners and hide one thing underneath another in order to save space. There should be a Notification Center menu bar item, separate from the clock.</p>\n<p>Appearing underneath the clock when you click on it (or if you swipe from the right edge of a trackpad) is a remixed Notification Center that’s a lot better than the previous version. Gone is separation between Today and Notification views—there’s a single view with notifications at the top and widgets below. Notifications are now grouped by app and they’re limited to a few slots, with a button to view more notifications below them, so they don’t consume all the space. It’s a more iOS-like approach, and it’s an improvement, though I feel like I’ve never really properly used Notification Center on the Mac and I’m not sure this will improve matters.</p>\n<p>Below the notifications is where the fun really begins, though. The new-style widgets from iOS 14 and iPadOS 14 are also present in Big Sur. Widgets come in three sizes and you can configure them to display how you like. I doubt that the Mac will ever be as big a home for widgets as iPhone or iPad, but I’m glad they exist. It might be nice if you could choose to drag widgets out of Notification Center and plop them on your Desktop, too. But it’s a nice addition to macOS that also brings across some family unity with Apple’s other devices. If you like that weather widget you’ve got on iOS, you can get in on your Mac, too.</p>\n<p>It’s early days in beta season so I won’t judge Apple’s widgets too harshly, but they do seem a bit buggy. I was unable to reorder cities in the World Time widget, for example, and sometimes widgets didn’t seem to be serving out updated data. I hope that Apple works the bugs out over the summer.</p>\n<h2>App changes</h2>\n<p>As always, a new operating system means changes to many of the apps Apple includes with the operating system. This year Apple has made a bunch of changes to Safari—which, for those of us who don’t use an alternate web browser, might just be the most-used app on our Macs. There are also new apps that have been imported from iPadOS via Mac Catalyst, and a raft of other changes. Here are some of the highlights.</p>\n<h3>Safari</h3>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bigsur-safari-start.jpeg?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>The redesigned Start page lets you add a background image and customize what appears on it.</figcaption></figure><p>I am a loyal Safari user, across all of Apple’s platforms. And I’ve got an admission to make: I use the Start page. That page that feels like the web-browser equivalent of a super-uncool, AOL-start-page, MySpace-using, “gateway to the ‘Net”? That Start page. I don’t use it exclusively—on the Mac, at least, I also keep a row of toolbar favorites visible at all times. But I have gravitated toward using it on my iPad, and that has in turn trained me to use it more on my Mac, too.</p>\n<p>In Safari 14—which, as is generally the case, will appear not just on Big Sur but will also be available for macOS Catalina and macOS Mojave—the Start page has gotten a nice upgrade. You can now customize it with a background image of your choosing, which is fun, but you can also click on an icon in the bottom corner of the screen and choose which sorts of items you want to see in the Start page: Favorites and Frequently Visited, of course, but also Siri Suggestions, Reading List, and the new Privacy Report feature that sums up what Safari has been doing to prevent anyone from tracking you from site to site.</p>\n<figure class=\"pull-right\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bigsur-tracker.jpeg?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>Tracking trackers in Big Sur.</figcaption></figure><p>Privacy Report also appears in the Safari toolbar by default. Click on it when you’re on any webpage and it’ll give you a report about how many cross-site trackers that Safari encountered. There’s not really anything you can do with this information, so it’s more of an advertisement for Apple’s laudable attempts to guard the privacy of its users than an actual feature unto itself.</p>\n<p>I’m also not a fan of the way the information is presented by Privacy Report: It lists how many “trackers prevented,” but it’s not actually preventing the “trackers” from working—it’s just preventing the information they gather from tracking you when you visit different sites. And many of the “trackers”, like Google Analytics and ChartBeat, are arguably not trackers at all.</p>\n<p>I’m also a bit disappointed that Apple didn’t go the extra mile and have the Privacy Report widget display a score or grade for the privacy features of any particular website. That’s what DuckDuckGo’s Safari extension does, and while the user can’t really do anything with that information other than complain or choose not to go to that website ever again, at least it would have some name-and-shame value that might motivate websites to be better citizens.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bigsur-translate.jpeg?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>Click to translate in Big Sur. (Also pictured: favicons in tabs.)</figcaption></figure><p>Safari is finally catching up to Google Chrome with the addition of in-place translation across seven languages. Once Safari detects a foreign language, it will display a translation icon in the search bar. Once you’ve clicked to see a translation, any additional pages you visit on that site will automatically load in translation while you’re there. Apple is launching with support for seven languages, including English, Spanish, Simplified Chinese, French, German, Russian, and Brazilian Portuguese.</p>\n<p>Safari 14 also completely embraces the website favicon in browser tabs. If you don’t remember the <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2017/08/safari_should_display_favicons_in_its_tabs\">debate about this feature</a> from back in 2017, the short version is that for ages now Chrome has included a small website icon in its browser tabs, along with the name of the page. Safari didn’t used to show the icon, though it now lets you optionally display it. In Safari 14, favicon display is on by default, and Apple has improved legibility when you’ve got a lot of tabs open by collapsing tiny tabs down to only display the icon. Apple has also added a quick page preview when you hover the pointer over a tab, letting you see what’s there before clicking.</p>\n<p>Finally, Apple is adding support for the popular WebExtensions API that’s used by developers to write plug-ins for other browsers, such as Chrome and Firefox. Theoretically, this will allow Safari users to finally take advantage of all of the cool extensions written for those other browsers. But of course, there’s a catch. For an extension to work in Safari, the developer may need to make some changes in order to meet Apple’s security standards. They’ll also need to use Xcode (which means they’ll need to buy a Mac if they don’t own one), and they’ll need to submit their extension to the App Store.</p>\n<p>That’s a lot of barriers just to reach Mac users running Safari who could just as easily open a different browser to get that functionality. It feels like the big inducement here is to be ready with Safari extensions for macOS and then rush into iOS and iPadOS the moment Apple supports these extensions on those platforms, too. But if you’ve got a favorite Chrome extension that you’d like to see come to macOS, you may need to write to the developer and try to convince them.</p>\n<p>I hope Apple makes this work and Safari gets a much richer extension library out of this, but there’s also a scenario where plug-in developers just don’t bother with Safari. That would be a shame. We’ll see.</p>\n<h3>Catalyst moves ahead (at last)</h3>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bigsur-catalyst-shadow.jpeg?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>The Catalyst date picker isn’t a spinning circle anymore!</figcaption></figure><p>Two years ago, in macOS Mojave, Apple began the migration of iPad apps to the Mac with four stock apps. Last year, Apple opened up the technology used to make that migration possible, Mac Catalyst, to all app developers. The results in the past year have been mixed. While a few interesting apps have come across, it’s been a relatively quiet migration. Developers I’ve talked to have cited the limitations of Catalyst, and expressed hope that it would be improved in Big Sur.</p>\n<p>Early indications are that it has been improved quite a bit, and maybe this will finally bring a much larger number of iPad-only apps to the Mac at last. Perhaps one reason for the improvement during this cycle is Apple’s replacement of two prominent Mac apps with new Catalyst versions: Maps and Messages. Apple might’ve been able to sneak by with an iffy implementation of Catalyst for a bunch of apps that hadn’t existed before on the Mac, as was the case with previous Catalyst apps, but with Maps and Messages each feature regression would be an indictment of Catalyst.</p>\n<p>So I’m happy to report that my early experience with both apps is good. They feel like Mac apps, albeit with an iPad sort of flavor. Catalyst now supports multiple windows, so you can pop out a chat from Messages into a separate window without any trouble. The date and time pickers are no longer spinning wheels, which was perhaps the most glaring example of Catalyst’s unfinished nature.</p>\n<p>And then there’s the upside: Apple’s been adding features to both Maps and Messages over the years—and just <em>not</em> bringing them to macOS. With the move to Catalyst in Big Sur, we finally get access to those features on the Mac. If someone on an iPhone sends you a message with lasers, you will see the lasers. And can respond with balloons. This isn’t just the case where the Mac is getting this year’s Messages improvements (like pinned chats, threading, and mentions)—it’s getting those, and last year’s improvements, and the previous year’s, too. The same is true for Maps, which gets this year’s feature additions like bike directions, but also previous iPad features like street view.</p>\n<p>Now, let’s be clear: Getting this version of Messages is only a cause for celebration because Apple essentially abandoned the Mac app for several years. And the same is true, to an extent, to Maps. I don’t want to praise Apple too much for these new apps, because it was shameful that these core system apps (especially Messages) were kept in stasis, buggy and behind the times, for so long. But at least now, they will move in lockstep across Apple’s platforms—and that’s fundamentally good for the Mac.</p>\n<p>This is really a glimpse into the future of the Mac, too. Mac Catalyst really exists because Apple doesn’t want to (or can’t afford to) maintain separate apps for the Mac and iPhone/iPad. Now Apple—and any other developer who wants to take advantage of Mac Catalyst—can start looking at the Mac as an additional place for their iOS development work to go. I think in the end this will be a <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/offsite/2020/07/why-the-mac-is-once-again-central-to-apples-future/\">net benefit for the Mac</a>.</p>\n<h2>And the rest</h2>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bigsur-reminders.jpeg?ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>You can now assign tasks to different people in Reminders.</figcaption></figure><p>There are dozens of other feature additions in Big Sur, and I look forward to spending the rest of the summer investigating them. A few stood out, though.</p>\n<p>Reminders gets a bunch of new features, including the ability to assign items to people in a shared list. Photos has improved its Retouch tool to use machine learning, which has the potential to dramatically improve that feature.</p>\n<p>And if you use a laptop with Big Sur, you get access to the very nice Battery system preferences panel, which displays some graphs of your battery level and usage in the last 24 hours and 10 days. (Desktop users will instead see the classic Energy Saver panel.)</p>\n<p>Apple has revamped the system sounds, both beeps and other sound effects. We went over many of them in <a href=\"http://relay.fm/upgrade/307\">a recent episode of Upgrade</a>, and while some of them are improvements, others feel like real downgrades. I guess we’ll all get used to them.</p>\n<p>Of course, perhaps the biggest feature of macOS Big Sur aren’t even really available to the general public yet: support for Macs running Apple silicon rather than Intel. This is the first version of macOS that will support those Macs, when they begin arriving later this fall. I’d imagine that we may see some special macOS features that are only enabled on those systems and that Apple is holding close to its chest in the meantime. (I’m fascinated to see just how the process of downloading iOS apps and running them on a Mac feels, for instance.) But it’s worth remembering that this isn’t just a normal macOS release, but the first release that offers compatibility with an entirely different processor architecture.</p>\n<h2>How big is Big Sur?</h2>\n<p>It’s still early yet. There are probably months to go before macOS Big Sur makes its way to people who haven’t signed up for beta testing, and there are rough edges here, to be sure.</p>\n<p>But overall, I think this is an exciting time to be a Mac user. Yes, Big Sur looks and feels very different from the Mac we’ve all come to know. But that’s part of the excitement. I’m excited that Apple is shaking up the Mac after many years of complacency. If you’re not excited by this, I understand it—and Catalina (and let’s be honest, Mojave) is there for you in the meantime.</p>\n<p>I’m happy that the Mac has more life left in it, and Big Sur feels like the start of the next phase. With it, Apple is redefining how we use our Macs and the software on them while preparing for a new generation of Macs running Apple-built processors. If Catalina was a bitter taste of medicine, maybe Big Sur is the reward.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 06 Aug 2020 17:15:41 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bigsur-finder-composite.jpeg?ssl=1","linkMd5":"9e44684cb92c10b3a125359a77e64764","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn4@2020_6/2020/08/24/18-19-07-683_9d7a2b7394f27cdc.webp","destWidth":1360,"destHeight":357,"sourceBytes":77382,"destBytes":33046,"author":"Jason Snell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bigsur-finder-composite.jpeg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn4@2020_6/2020/08/24/18-19-07-683_9d7a2b7394f27cdc.webp","https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bigsur-controlcenter.jpeg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn87@2020_1/2020/08/24/18-19-16-439_6dc00be36de7508c.webp","https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bigsur-safari-start.jpeg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn37@2020_1/2020/08/24/18-19-13-217_c94842952c7d8e59.webp","https://i1.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bigsur-tracker.jpeg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn100@2020_5/2020/08/24/18-19-16-574_5cf07471d910f6aa.webp","https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bigsur-translate.jpeg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn16@2020_2/2020/08/24/18-19-13-187_fd09efe26a9f241c.webp","https://i2.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bigsur-catalyst-shadow.jpeg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn20@2020_5/2020/08/24/18-19-28-780_1d7000f7eec26131.webp","https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bigsur-reminders.jpeg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn64@2020_4/2020/08/24/18-19-13-846_6f489b6eab1ccd2c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144173},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"Maybe it’s time to Breathe ↦","link":"https://sixcolors.com/?p=11362","description":"<p><a href=\"https://512pixels.net/2020/06/in-praise-of-the-apple-watchs-breathe-feature/\">Stephen Hackett</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  When Apple added the Breathe feature to watchOS 3, I — like many of you, I suspect — turned it off pretty quickly.

As a kid, I’d dig through the newspaper to find the funny pages, and the full-color Sunday section was the highlight of the week.</p>\n<p>But for the past twenty years or so, my comic strip reading has been all digital; I’ve even added a few webcomics into the mix over time.<sup id=\"fnref-12693-abandoned\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-12693-abandoned\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup> At some point in the dim and misty past, I put all of my comics into a folder in my browser’s bookmark bar; every morning, I would click (or later tap) that folder and all my comics would open in tabs.</p>\n<p>As systems go, it’s fine. But it presents two challenges: first, not every comic I read updates on the same schedule. Some are seven-day affairs, like reruns of “Calvin &#38; Hobbes” and “Doonesbury.” Others update only on weekdays. Some are just on Sundays. Others solely on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Which meant that most days I knew I would just be automatically closing some of those tabs.</p>\n<p>In and of itself, I could handle the sheer <em>onerous</em> nature of having to close some tabs—the horror!—but there was another more bothersome annoyance. Many of the comics I read are served up through one of the major comics syndicate websites, GoComics. Several years ago, the site changed its interface so that when you go to the main landing page for a comic—say, again, <a href=\"https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/\">Calvin &#38; Hobbes</a>—all you would see is a crop of the day’s comic, which you would then have to click to get to the full comic. That meant every comic I read on that site now required an extra, obnoxious step.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gocomics-calvinandhobbes.png?resize=1360%2C855&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" data-image-w=\"\" data-image-h=\"\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>This page basically seems to designed to force you to look at a bunch of ads before getting to the content you want (and it runs half the content in the bargain!)</figcaption></figure><p>Boy, this sounds like a job for automation, if there ever was one.</p>\n<p>A few weeks back, I finally had the impetus to create a shortcut to streamline this process. After mucking with it on and off during various beta updates, I finally ended up with a version that works pretty well <em>and</em> is easily customizable, meaning I can share it with people.</p>\n<p>The whole process ended up being more complicated than I initially thought, for a few reasons. First, though I’ve spent more time in Shortcuts recently, I’m still in a scenario of having to fit my programming knowledge (derived mainly from my time as a PHP developer) into the available receptacle (creating Shortcuts), which is, at times, very much a round-peg, square-hole situation.<sup id=\"fnref-12693-loops\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-12693-loops\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">2</a></sup> Second, some of the iOS 14 beta releases had glitches that interfered with Shortcuts, meaning I had to set the shortcut aside until the next release came along.</p>\n<p>But what I ultimately ended up with is <a href=\"https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/317da8bd3dc54dfc8d9ab324237e08b1\">this shortcut</a>: It takes a list of comics, each of which has an associated schedule and a URL. When it’s launched, it checks to see which of the comics have the current day in their regular schedule, then compiles a list which it opens in tabs in Safari.

It must be rapidly filling with Macs with Apple silicon, but on Tuesday that pipeline <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/08/27-inch-imac-gets-a-major-update/\">disgorged a new Intel-based 27-inch iMac</a> with a bunch of technical improvements, while retaining the prices of previous models.</p>\n<p>For those expecting a redesign to the exterior of the iMac, which has been largely unchanged for many years now, it’s clear that any major rethinking of Apple’s venerable all-in-one is going to have to wait for the Apple silicon era. Apple’s not doing what it did with the iMac back during the last processor transition and redesigning the exterior just <em>before</em> swapping chips, and future Mac historians will be thankful for that.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-12574\"></span></p>\n<p>The biggest external change to the iMac this time around is an optional one: You can order one with the same glare-killing “nanotexture” glass texture as on Apple’s Pro Display XDR, for an additional $500. If you live in a very bright environment and the glare is making you sad, this upgrade might be worth it. Regardless of which texture, though, the iMac display also now supports TrueTone.</p>\n<p>Moving to the inside, the iMac has gotten a lot of big improvements over <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2019/04/2019-imac-review/\">the versions that it released in March 2019</a>. The new 27-inch iMac is powered by 10th-generation Intel processors, and for the first time, there’s a 10-core i9 option. Graphics are powered by 7nm AMD Radeon Pro 5000 series GPUs, including a configure-to-order version with 16GB of VRAM for the first time on the 27-inch iMac.</p>\n<p>(Last year’s iMacs already pushed up against the performance of the iMac Pro, and these will undoubtedly beat it—especially that 10-core model. In an acknowledgement of this, Apple has rejiggered the iMac Pro line, dropping the old base eight-core model and moving the 10-core model to the base price. So now the iMac line ends at 10 cores and the iMac Pro line begins there.)</p>\n<p>But this is more than just a processor bump, because Apple made a bunch of upgrades to other aspects of the iMac subsystem. The biggest news is that SSD storage is now standard across the entire iMac line (with options up to 8TB), where previously Apple made Fusion Drive (which is a small SSD coupled with a spinning hard drive) the standard. This is a long-overdue move, but I’m glad that Apple has finally made it. All iMac users deserve the speed of SSD storage.</p>\n<p>However, there are a few wrinkles: The base storage level starts at 256GB, which is not a lot of storage. It might be plenty for some use cases, but other users will run into that limitation awfully quickly, especially if they’re storing a bunch of family photos locally in a Photos library. That’s why Apple is still offering a 1TB Fusion Drive as a configurable option on the 21.5-inch model, for no added cost. So while we can’t definitively say that the spinning hard drive has finally been pushed out of all Mac hardware, it’s gone from all the default configurations, at least.</p>\n<p>Memory capacity has been doubled on the 27-inch iMac, so it now supports up to 128GB of DRAM. And the iMac has become the last Mac to receive a T2 security chip, which <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/offsite/2018/01/the-t2-chip-makes-the-imac-pro-the-start-of-a-mac-revolution/\">enables all sorts of features</a> previously unavailable on the iMac. That includes automatic disk encryption and security features, yes. But it also means improved image quality from the iMac’s camera, which has been upgraded to 1080p resolution. The T2 also provides improved audio processing, which should improve the sound of the (otherwise unchanged) iMac speakers.</p>\n<p>As it did last year <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2019/11/macbook-pro-16/\">with the 16-inch MacBook Pro</a>, Apple has upgraded the microphone system on the 27-inch iMac. There are two microphones on the iMac’s chin, and another on the back, and they work together to cancel out echo and noise and create what Apple calls a “studio quality” experience. My experience with the MacBook Pro’s microphone system was positive, but with caveats depending on how you positioned the laptop. I would imagine that the iMac, as a much more stationary device, will generate a more consistent sound—and the people on the other end of teleconferences will appreciate the added clarity.</p>\n<p>The new iMac is available to order as of now and will ship later this week.</p>\n<p>As for the future, is this the last Intel Mac we’ll see? There’s no way to tell, though reading between the lines, it wouldn’t be surprising if there were some more Intel-based Mac releases as Apple progresses through its two-year-long processor transition. But I’d wager good money that the next time we see an iMac update, there won’t be an Intel processor at its heart. And perhaps it will look appreciably different, too.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, though, here’s a fast new Intel iMac with upgraded internals and no more spinning-disk storage. It’s not the <em>giant</em> step forward that seems inevitable—but it’s a step forward all the same.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 04 Aug 2020 15:00:11 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/imac2020.jpeg?ssl=1","linkMd5":"79b62dccc48a4782166722c351a077d1","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn12@2020_4/2020/08/24/18-19-09-144_431420d418531de6.webp","destWidth":1360,"destHeight":964,"sourceBytes":132061,"destBytes":51600,"author":"Jason Snell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/imac2020.jpeg?ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn12@2020_4/2020/08/24/18-19-09-144_431420d418531de6.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144167},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"The most invisible and influential eras in Apple history (Macworld/Jason Snell)","link":"https://sixcolors.com/?p=12203","description":"<p>I wrote my first story about Apple in 1993, meaning I’ve been covering Apple for 60 percent of its existence.

Bill Cassidy (La.), one of the bill’s sponsors. “This is a matter of perception. It’s not an indictment of Google,” added Cassidy, a doctor by background before arriving in the Senate. “We’re making sure people are comfortable with this.”\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>The way Cassidy frames this is about providing reassurance to people so that they are more likely to opt in to tracing features, because many people are suspicious of tech giants and what they do with their information. I can quibble about how so many people are perfectly willing to trade their privacy for convenience, but I also appreciate that these virus-tracking systems won’t work without most people participating, and government reassurance that they can’t be used for an invasion of privacy could help grease the skids.</p>\n<p>But then there’s this:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  The bill by Cantwell and her peers requires companies developing contact-tracing applications to do so in collaboration with public-health authorities. These tools must also obtain consent before they can begin tracking a user’s location to determine the spread of the coronavirus.</p>\n<p>  Under the proposed, bipartisan legislation, any data collected as part of coronavirus monitoring technology could not be used for commercial purposes, and users could request at any time to delete it. App makers and other companies behind contact-tracing tools further would have to notify users in the event of a breach, and the U.S. government would gain new powers to penalize privacy and security abuses, the bill prescribes.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>The debate over these tools has largely involved public-health authorities demanding more information than Google and Apple’s system is willing to provide. This line suggests to me that the government may expect Google and Apple to weaken the privacy restrictions built into their system in exchange for legal protection against the extra personal data being misused.</p>\n<p>I wouldn’t bet against this having the opposite of its intended effect, by making the resulting system even more invasive—and leading people to opt out rather than pass even more personal information to a government agency, whether or not there are legal restrictions on its misuse.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/06/01/contact-tracing-congress-privacy/\">Go to the linked site</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/link/2020/06/congress-may-want-to-tinker-with-apple-and-googles-tracking-system/\">Read on Six Colors</a>.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 01 Jun 2020 22:15:00 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"585c9e66b86b9c115ef3c8795b883ecb","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jason Snell","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144230},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"Dr. Icon and the Icons of Big Sur","link":"https://sixcolors.com/?p=12326","description":"<p><a href=\"http://relay.fm/upgrade/308\">This week’s Upgrade</a> is a walk through the many icons of macOS Big Sur.

I’m still getting my bearings, and it’s important to pace one’s self for the week to come, but here are a few of my quick observations about the opening day of Apple’s first-ever virtual WWDC.</p>\n<h2>Bye Intel, hello Apple silicon</h2>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/8AF7C24C-137F-4907-9037-189DDA589894.jpeg?resize=1360%2C907&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Johny Srouji\" data-image-w=\"1360\" data-image-h=\"907\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>Apple senior vice president of Hardware Technologies Johny Srouji. (Photo by Brooks Kraft/Apple Inc.)</figcaption></figure><p>Well, here we go. The Mac begins the third processor transition of its life with a move from Intel processors to Apple-designed ARM processors that Apple’s referring to, generically, as “Apple silicon.” (My guess is that this is a necessary placeholder until Apple unveils the specific name for this series of processors when the first ARM Macs ship later this year.)</p>\n<p>This transition is likely to be the smoothest of the three. Mac development almost entirely occurs with Apple’s development tools and compilers, so the path will be fairly straightforward for developers. That means that many apps will run natively on Apple’s chips from the start. For those that won’t, there’s Rosetta 2, a code-translation system that builds a version of your apps translated in advance for the new chips and using native system features whenever possible—so even your old, not-yet-native apps will run, and probably run at decent speeds. Apple has also indicated that these new Macs will follow the same general software policies as current Macs do, so they won’t be restricted to only Mac App Store apps or anything like that.</p>\n<p>People who rely on running Windows apps on their Macs, however, will not find a comforting story. Apple made a point of highlighting virtualization features that are built into macOS Big Sur running on Apple Silicon, but these seem to be for virtualizing operating systems built for Apple’s processors, not for emulating an operating system built for a different processor. I would imagine that, eventually, there will be a way to run Windows on ARM Macs—but it may take a while and it may be a slow, frustrating experience when it does arrive.</p>\n<p>Now let’s talk about the upside. In a lengthy presentation, Apple’s chip czar Johny Srouji offered a few tantalizing suggestions about why Apple was making this move. Of course, Srouji doesn’t want to steal the thunder of future Mac product announcements, but he does want to impress upon all of us that there are good reasons. I appreciated his line about how the 2018 iPad Pro’s status as a device that was more powerful than most PC laptops “foreshadows how well this architecture scales to the Mac.”</p>\n<p>Srouji also made it clear that Apple is designing a series of processors that are purpose built for the Mac, just as it has built custom processors for the iPhone, the iPad, and the Apple Watch. While many developers will test their apps this summer on a Mac mini running the same A12Z Bionic processor that’s in the 2020 iPad Pro, Apple’s shipping ARM Macs will contain processors that are not left over from an iPad, but made specifically for them.</p>\n<p>Of course, Apple has been headed in this direction for a while now. “Performance is enough of a reason to change, but it’s just part of the story,” Srouji said. That’s simultaneously a boast about the fact that Apple expects its processors to be superior to Intel’s across the board, and a declaration about the fact that Apple wants to do more than Intel processors can provide.</p>\n<p>Most modern Macs already contain within them an Apple-designed T2 processor that is handling security, video encoding, control of onboard cameras, running the Touch Bar, and acting as a disk controller, among other functions. All of it is built around the edges of the Intel processor at the center—but soon, Apple will be able to build the whole package at once.</p>\n<p>All of that is to say that while the transition to be smooth, the <em>reason</em> for the transition will probably be readily apparent. These new Macs with Apple-built processors will almost certainly offer speed and power efficiency far beyond what the Intel equivalent models currently offer. Apple has judged that the leap is worth the inconvenience.</p>\n<h2>Rethinking the home screen</h2>\n<figure class=\"pull-right\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6FF7FEB5-7B28-462E-BC55-2699219569AF.jpeg?resize=792%2C1360&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"iPhone home screen\" data-image-w=\"792\" data-image-h=\"1360\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></figure><p>The grid of app icons on the iPhone home screen has served Apple well, but it was past time to provide users with more functionality. So with iOS 14, Apple has created a new version of its widget architecture and allowed users to place widgets generated by various apps on the home screen, nestling among the app icons or even living on home screen pages all by themselves.</p>\n<p>The design of these widgets looks great, though Apple has pulled support for interactivity, killing some more daring widgets like James Thomson’s PCalc calculator. It wasn’t entirely clear from the keynote, but if space is at a premium you can actually stack like-sized widgets together, so multiple widgets can share space. You swipe to move among them. (This is in addition to the Smart Stack features, which uses Siri to guess about which widget you need depending on context.) Fans of high-density, information-packed screens will take advantage of widget stacks.</p>\n<p>Then there’s the App Library, which—when combined with the ability to hide as many pages of your home screen as you like—solves the issue of providing access to all of your apps while not forcing you to wade through all of them on many pages of home screen. It’s a carefully balanced feature that rolls in a bunch of existing iOS technology—Siri app recommendations and App Store categorizations to name two—to offer a little bit more than just a bare search field or alphabetical list. (And if you regret making one of your home-screen pages disappear, don’t worry—hiding them is nondestructive, and you can always bring them back.)</p>\n<p>This is all good stuff. I look forward to redesigning my iPhone’s home screen to display fewer apps and more widgets. There’s just one thing missing: the iPad. In iPadOS, there’s no App Library, and while the new widgets are supported, they’re limited to a single column on the first page of the home screen.</p>\n<p>The iPad’s home screen app icon grid is no less monotonous than the iPhone’s, so it could certainly use App Library. And the vast expanse of iPad screen real estate could happily gobble up a whole bunch of widgets, full of useful data. Instead, there’s just a single column on a single page. It’s a curious and unfortunate omission.</p>\n<h2>The Mac and iPad influence each other</h2>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/40DA247E-FA01-4A57-9E0C-88B608C21808.jpeg?resize=1360%2C765&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Craig Federighi\" data-image-w=\"1360\" data-image-h=\"765\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>Apple senior vice president of Software Engineering Craig Federighi.</figcaption></figure><p>Are the Mac and the iPad merging together? I don’t think so, but they’re definitely exerting gravitational pulls on one another. It’s hard not to look at the new macOS design and not see how it’s picking up a huge chunk of design language from the iPad, from the rounded rectangles in icons and windows to the use of SF Symbols glyphs to the mouseover effect on buttons. (That new Mac window design, with the title bar demoted into the toolbar, is going to take some getting used to.)</p>\n<p>But the iPad, too, picked up a bunch of Mac interface elements, including a new search interface that’s basically the Mac version of Spotlight, the addition of drop-down menus, and app sidebars everywhere. I had to chuckle when Apple showed off the new sidebar in Photos on the iPad—that’s a feature that’s been in Photos (and before that, iPhoto) on the Mac <em>forever</em>. But on the iPad, it’s new—and those sidebars are showing up everywhere in iPadOS 14.</p>\n<p>The iPad and the Mac are different, but they’re also joined. Mac Catalyst may have started the flow, but this goes beyond that. Apple’s using the iPad to make the Mac feel more modern, and using the Mac to make the iPad feel more functional. We’ll see how this relationship evolves.</p>\n<h2>The Mac at the end of the universe</h2>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/8E91192A-7BD6-4F37-9BD0-E24EBEAD7866-1360x907.jpeg?resize=1360%2C907&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Andreas Wendker\" data-image-w=\"1360\" data-image-h=\"907\" class=\" jetpack-broken-image\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>Behind Apple’s Andreas Wendker is a Mac running unmodified iOS apps. (Photo by Brooks Kraft/Apple Inc.)</figcaption></figure><p>At last year’s keynote, Apple focused its attention on SwiftUI and barely mentioned Mac Catalyst. This year, though, Catalyst got its own slide and a whole bunch of improvements, which is only fitting since two stock Mac apps—Messages and Maps—have been re-implemented entirely using Mac Catalyst. This is good news for developers who have been waiting to see if Catalyst was going to continue to be developed and improved.</p>\n<p>But then Apple dropped a bit of a bomb: For Macs running on Apple’s own processors, iOS app developers will be able to place their apps in the Mac App Store, unaltered. These Macs will just… run iOS apps.</p>\n<p>On one level, this is great news, because there are iOS developers who will never be bothered to build Mac apps—and now can make their apps available on the Mac, albeit in weird app wrappers that don’t feel like real Mac apps.</p>\n<p>But on another level, it calls into question the very existence of Mac Catalyst. While some developers will put in the extra work to make the iPad apps into proper Mac apps, some will decide that it’s not worth the trouble since their iPad apps will run just fine on macOS.</p>\n<p>So far as I can tell, Apple has decided that it’s not going to strongarm developers into doing the work to support the Mac. Maybe it’s confident in the powers of Mac Catalyst. Or maybe it realizes that some developers are just not going to care about the Mac, and it’s better to lower the standards of what a proper Mac app should be in order to get those apps on the platform.</p>\n<p>The idealist in me says this is a terrible idea and that it will just lead to developers abandoning the Mac and just shoveling their iOS app onto the platform. If you think Mac Catalyst apps are weird, wait until you’re running pure iOS apps that have made no attempt to appear even remotely Mac-like.</p>\n<p>The optimist in me says that there will always be good Mac apps, but there are also a lot of great iOS apps and being able to run them makes my Mac more useful and relevant.</p>\n<p>The truth is probably that the future of the Mac is as a “pro” version of iOS and iPadOS. It’ll run more or less every app that’s available on the iPhone and iPad, but it’ll also run traditional Mac software. Over time, the distinction between iPad apps and Mac apps will begin to fade away entirely, and the Mac will just become a keyboard-and-trackpad mode of the iPad.</p>\n<p>Like reading about our sun becoming a red giant and swallowing the Earth, or pondering the heat death of the universe, it sounds like a depressing story until you realize the time scales involved. If Apple handles it right, the Mac will fade away so slowly that by the time it’s gone, it won’t matter anymore. But it’s hard not to look at the appearance of unmodified iOS software on the platform and not see the endgame.</p>\n<p>Wow, that got dark. This is going to be a really interesting week. I’m looking forward to what Tuesday brings.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 23 Jun 2020 03:25:23 +0000","feedId":1506,"bgimg":"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/8AF7C24C-137F-4907-9037-189DDA589894.jpeg?resize=1360%2C907&ssl=1","linkMd5":"f2fe43e9c77fed5893b9ce71fb435d46","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn76@2020_2/2020/08/24/18-19-09-485_5ba2d2233dfe8f16.webp","destWidth":1360,"destHeight":907,"sourceBytes":229670,"destBytes":110726,"author":"Jason Snell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/8AF7C24C-137F-4907-9037-189DDA589894.jpeg?resize=1360%2C907&ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn76@2020_2/2020/08/24/18-19-09-485_5ba2d2233dfe8f16.webp","https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6FF7FEB5-7B28-462E-BC55-2699219569AF.jpeg?resize=792%2C1360&ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn60@2020_6/2020/08/24/18-19-14-444_5f68f38b861850d7.webp","https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/40DA247E-FA01-4A57-9E0C-88B608C21808.jpeg?resize=1360%2C765&ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn15@2020_2/2020/08/24/18-19-12-205_cc0a2cfd8e29b889.webp","https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/8E91192A-7BD6-4F37-9BD0-E24EBEAD7866-1360x907.jpeg?resize=1360%2C907&ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn12@2020_2/2020/08/24/18-19-15-741_df055b41b811c124.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598293144215},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 02:19:04","title":"Neil Young is wrong (about everything) ↦","link":"http://two.wordpress.test/post/2020/01/neil_young_is_wrong_about_everything/","description":"<p>I’m not a Neil Young fan. I don’t really like most of his music, though I have enjoyed some of it. I appreciate him more as a songwriter than as a performer. But what I <em>really</em> don’t like about Neil Young is his recent refactoring into becoming a useful idiot for people who want to get rich quick by selling audiophiles on lossless, high-resolution music devices and services that charge premiums for music that doesn’t really sound any different to what you’d find on a CD or even on Apple Music.</p>\n<p>There was the Pono Player, which Ars Technica <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/02/pono-player-review-a-tall-refreshing-drink-of-snake-oil/\">likened to a shot of snake oil</a>. He went on stage <a href=\"http://allthingsd.com/20120131/neil-young-and-the-sound-of-music/\">at tech conferences</a> and explained that even if you couldn’t hear the differences between analog and digital audio, you could <em>feel</em> them, maaaan.</p>\n<p>Young’s latest Old Man Yells At Digital Cloud moment <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/28/21091655/neil-young-podcast-vergecast-interview-phil-baker-book-pono-hi-res-audio\">came on the Vergecast</a>, where he went on a rant about MacBooks and audio that was… something.</p>\n<p>The Loop’s Jim Dalrymple <a href=\"https://www.loopinsight.com/2020/01/28/neil-young-is-wrong-about-the-macbook-pro/\">took it apart</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  So what exactly is Young arguing here? Does he not know the quality of the DAC gear is high-quality enough to make an album, even on a MacBook Pro? Is there a specific album he thinks is poorly recorded? I sure would like to know the answer to that one…. To me, Young seems to be arguing something that is halfway between “analog is better,” and for some reason, “the MacBook Pro sucks.” He’s just confusing all kinds of thoughts that don’t fit together at all.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>As Jim points out, not only does the MacBook Pro have a pretty good audio system, but laptops have enabled musicians (and people who dream of being musicians) to create sketches, demos, and even full-fledged releases when they might otherwise have let the inspiration slip through their fingers. And there’s a long line of musicians, Grammy-winning and otherwise, who use Apple’s hardware and tools to create their work.</p>\n<p>In the end, Jim’s post is left with more questions than answers, because it’s unclear what Young is really arguing here. Let me boil Young’s argument down to a single paragraph:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  It’s not about money. It’s not about hits. It’s about quality. It’s about sound. It’s about museum quality. It’s about the real thing. The facts. The real sound. What happened when you opened your mouth and sang? What went into the air? That’s what we’re not getting with the new technology.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>It’s just more of the analog woo woo<sup id=\"fnref-4081-jade\"><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com#fn-4081-jade\" class=\"jetpack-footnote\">1</a></sup> that Young has been ranting about for years now.
