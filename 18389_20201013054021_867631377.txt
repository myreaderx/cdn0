Is all out of the box right? right? Well no, as with all the worthwhile things in life there is a bit of effort involved on getting the Vim setup just like I wanted it. Fortunately, is far from custom and is mostly the right combination of plugins.</p><p>You can find my current Vim configuration and dot files in its corresponding <a href=\"https://github.com/amacgregor/dot-files\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Github repository</a> feel free to fork it and give a shot.</p><p>We are in particular interested in the vimrc file, let’s break it down:</p><script src=\"https://gist.github.com/amacgregor/0467f99e0e75725f57682ccd1f2189fb.js\"></script><p>Each plugin in this setup is separated in the following categories:</p><h3>Utility</h3><p>This kind of a miscellaneous category and is comprised of plugins used to enhance or change the behaivour of core vim; the most useful important ones are:</p><ul><li><strong>Nerdtree</strong>: It gives you easy access to the file system in the form of a directory tree on the left side of the screen, as well provides shortcuts for filesystem manipulation(create, delete, move files and directories)</li><li><strong>Tagbar</strong>: Quick tag browser for the current file, a must have if you are using any kind of <strong>ctags</strong> like exuberant-tags.</li><li><strong>FZF</strong>: Fuzzy finder, another handy utility for finding files and commands.</li><li>Neocomplete: Vim Autocomplete on steroids.</li></ul><h3>Generic Programming Support</h3><p>These plugins fall directly on the category of programming and are used my all or most of the <strong>programming languages</strong> that I currently have setup:</p><ul><li><strong>Exuberant-Ctags</strong>: tags are named definitions of classes, functions, abstract types and so on; adding support to Vim gives you some of that ‘magic’ IDE code navigation functionality.</li><li><strong>Syntastic</strong>: THE syntax checking plugin for Vim, if you are familiar with the way that code inspections work on Jetbrains and similar IDEs, syntastic will make feel right at home.</li><li><strong>Vim-autoclose</strong>: Automatically closes a character that could/should have a matching closing counterpart, like () &quot;&quot; [] {} and so on.</li></ul><h3>Markdown/Writing</h3><p>As I mentioned Vim is my go to editor for drafting new posts be it books, blogs or random angry letters. From this particular section only language tools deservers a special shot-out as it makes for a great Grammar checker directly from inside Vim.</p><h3>Erlang/Elixir/PHP/Elm Support</h3><p>When it comes down to the <strong>individual language support</strong> there isn’t really much to highlight other than I’ve tried (and somewhat failed) to keep the plugins to a minimum and focus only on the <strong>essential language support</strong>.</p><p>So far elixir is winning the battle in terms of plugins as I’ve added additional functionality like the ability to run tests and generate content from inside Vim, I have yet to decide if I’m keeping all the plugins for it.</p><h3>Git Support</h3><p>Standard git support that I’m afraid I rarely use, I find myself going directly back to the <strong>shell</strong> and doing the <strong>git workflow</strong> outside of Vim, so I’m open to suggestions and to hear what everyone else is using in terms of setup.</p><h3>Themes and Interfaces</h3><p>Ok this is a big one but mostly because I keep forgetting to remove unused themes and colorschemes, let’s highlight the important ones:</p><ul><li><strong>Vimarline</strong>: Lean and mean status/tabline for Vim; it also looks cool as fuck.</li><li><strong>Vim-Devicons</strong>: Because not only atom gets all the fancy icons on the sidebar, highly recommended to if you are using nerdtree.</li></ul><p>The remaining parts of the configuration file are either plugin configuration or personal key re-mappings that I use for quality of like; I’ve done my best to document and segment each section so it should be easy enough to understand what each setting is doing.</p><p>For anyone getting starting with Vim, I do want to bring special attention to the following:</p><div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">&quot; Disable arrow movementundefined resize splits instead.\nif get(g:undefined &#x27;elite_mode&#x27;)\n\tnnoremap &lt;Up&gt;    :resize +2&lt;CR&gt;\n\tnnoremap &lt;Down&gt;  :resize -2&lt;CR&gt;\n\tnnoremap &lt;Left&gt;  :vertical resize +2&lt;CR&gt;\n\tnnoremap &lt;Right&gt; :vertical resize -2&lt;CR&gt;\nendif</code></pre></div><p>As there is no quickest way to force one-self to use the home row for navigation.</p><script async=\"\" src=\"//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js\"></script><ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" style=\"display:block;text-align:center\" data-ad-layout=\"in-article\" data-ad-format=\"fluid\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-6937861309533018\" data-ad-slot=\"9206842858\"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push();</script><h1>Final Remarks</h1><p>I hope that for some of you this post has been helpful for some, and I’m far from done with my current setup, in that sense this is <strong>very much a toy</strong> that I continue playing on a nearly daily basis; now that being said and in order to get back to the original premise of the post; it is indeed a very powerful toy, specially when combined with other tools like <strong>Tmux</strong>, here is a sneak peak of my <strong>Elixir</strong> ‘IDE’ powered by <strong>Vim</strong> and <strong>Tmux</strong>:</p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/vI0KjXB\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/vI0KjXB.gif\" title=\"source: imgur.com\"/></a><p>If you want to know more about my setup, or want to <strong>share yours</strong> please leave a comment below.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 16 Apr 2017 15:55:59 +0000","feedId":18389,"bgimg":"https://i.imgur.com/AQSIXwj.gif","linkMd5":"33fd1fbd17c1b04ae552f8ed6e1d3bcb","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn90@2020_1/2020/10/13/05-38-17-095_6365236ce16bb7ff.webp","destWidth":1122,"destHeight":800,"sourceBytes":8819606,"destBytes":5801046,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.imgur.com/AQSIXwj.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn90@2020_1/2020/10/13/05-38-17-095_6365236ce16bb7ff.webp","https://i.imgur.com/vI0KjXB.gif":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602567481001}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-10-13 13:38:01","updatedTime":"2020-10-13 13:38:01","feedId":18389,"fetchDate":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 05:38:01 +0000","fetchMs":519,"handleMs":1980,"totalMs":143339,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":47,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"b7527567a3f1dbda02b464d907e55b0a","hostName":"us-014*","requestId":"c86b8c692c414d47bfe6e572ef7f3453_18389","contentType":"application/xml","totalBytes":5801046,"bgimgsTotal":1,"bgimgsGithubTotal":1,"articlesImgsTotal":2,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":1,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx33":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 02:17:24","updatedTime":"2020-09-07 02:17:24","id":18389,"name":"Allan's Feed","url":"http://coderoncode.com/feed.xml","subscriber":180,"website":null,"icon":"https://allanmacgregor.com/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":null,"description":"Hi, I'm Allan, this is where I write.
