Today, we&#8217;re watching a video that explores the design of Pedro Almodovar films.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>The look of a <strong>Pedro Almodóvar</strong> film is many things: campy, vibrant, obsessive, outrageous. But it is not subtle. You notice it.</p>\n<p>Following in the footsteps of Alfred Hitchcock and Powell and Pressburger, Almodóvar&#8217;s approach to design is total. It takes hold of everything from the smallest object to the most meaningful centerpiece, saturating everything from the costumes to the set design and lighting.</p>\n<p>Almodóvar&#8217;s films proudly display artifice and revel in abundance. He populates his frames with garish kitsch, vibrant hues, and a reckless abandon for patterns, paintings, and a good silk shirt. It is an unforgettable aesthetic as unapologetic and passionate as any of his characters.</p>\n<p>However, Almodóvar&#8217;s sense of design isn&#8217;t just a matter of aesthetics for the sake of aesthetics. As the video essay below explains, bold design is a narrative tool for Almodóvar. Focusing on <strong><em>Laws of Desire</em></strong> and the film that brought him to widespread international attention, <strong><em>Women of the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown</em></strong>, the essay unpacks how Almodóvar uses design to tell a story.</p>\n<p>Watch &#8220;<strong>Total Design: Pedro Almodóvar’s<em> Law of Desire</em> and <em>Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown</em></strong>&#8220;:</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"Video Essay: Total Design | Almodóvar’s Law of Desire &#38; Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZfB7OnAAi0c?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Who made this?</h2>\n<p>This video is the 32nd entry in a series of audiovisual essays by <strong>Cristina Álvarez López</strong> and <strong>Adrian Martin</strong>.

Welcome to <strong><a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/great-performances/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Great Performances</a></strong>, a column exploring the art behind some of cinema’s best roles. This entry spotlights the performance given by Michael Shannon in Take Shelter.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>There are few films I connect with more deeply on an emotional level than <strong><em>Take Shelter</em></strong>. A good deal of this has to do with <strong>Michael Shannon</strong>&#8216;s impeccable starring performance in a film that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC91-s5\">he describes as</a> &#8220;<span class=\"s1\">the most meaningful movie that I’ve made,&#8221; with &#8220;profound, personal resonance.&#8221;<br />\n</span></p>\n<p>Writer-director <strong>Jeff Nichols</strong> crafts an introspective drama with the tension and stakes of a thriller, as Shannon&#8217;s character, construction worker Curtis LaForche, finds his life interrupted by nightmares of an apocalyptic storm. Are they truly prophetic? Or is a family history of mental illness rearing its ugly head?</p>\n<p>Shannon plays Curtis with such depth and nuance that unspoken sentiments come across as clearly as those that are expressed in dialogue. You feel like you’re in his head, struggling along with him, without needing to look to expository voiceover or any other shortcuts for aid.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you’re writing that part for Mike, he’s going to be able to fill all those spaces in between the lines,&#8221; <a href=\"https://consequenceofsound.net/2016/03/decoding-midnight-special-an-interview-with-jeff-nichols/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nichols told Consequence of Sound</a> in 2016. &#8220;He’ll be able to fill those with all the subtext that you don’t want to have to write about. He can carry all of that on his face, and that makes him a very powerful tool.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Many dramas focused on mental illness play like casually active volcanoes. Their protagonists dribble lava, chewing the scenery and bugging their eyes. They&#8217;re devotees of the time-honored tradition of heavy-handed award bait. Or they take the opposite approach, their lead characters struggling with depression, staring slumped and dead-eyed into the camera and attempting to emote.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Shannon plays Curtis as the build-up to an explosion and its aftermath. He Goldilockses it to perfection &#8212; never overdone or underdone but just right. There&#8217;s a</span><span class=\"s1\"> pressure building underneath the surface. Curtis is close to falling apart in every scene, despite his desperate effort to hold himself together. The rising tension is communicated through everything from Shannon&#8217;s tone to his posture to the clench of his jaw. His performance never missteps or feels false.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While Curtis slips up a little here or there in keeping his struggles to himself as the hallucinations intrude on his waking life, he only fully loses control once. </span><span class=\"s1\">“There’s a storm coming,” is one of those cinematic stock phrases so overused that it tends to play as a bit of a joke no matter how solemnly it’s delivered. But when Curtis’ internal struggles finally boil over at a community dinner, Shannon accomplishes the near-impossible by turning this all-too-common expression into something that feels fresh and authentic. Some regard this scene &#8212; undoubtedly the films most explosive &#8212; as the highlight of Shannon&#8217;s performance, and it really is a superb bit of acting.</span></p>\n\n<a href='https://filmschoolrejects.com/michael-shannon-take-shelter/take-shelter-storm-coming-1/'><img data-attachment-id=\"356260\" data-orig-file=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Take-Shelter-storm-coming-1.png\" data-orig-size=\"799,600\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&#34;aperture&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;credit&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;camera&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;caption&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;created_timestamp&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;copyright&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;focal_length&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;iso&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;shutter_speed&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;orientation&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;keywords&#34;:&#34;Array&#34;}\" data-image-title=\"Take Shelter Storm Coming\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Take-Shelter-storm-coming-1.png\" data-large-file=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Take-Shelter-storm-coming-1.png\" width=\"128\" height=\"96\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Take-Shelter-storm-coming-1.png\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"Take Shelter Storm Coming\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Take-Shelter-storm-coming-1.png 799w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Take-Shelter-storm-coming-1-768x577.png 768w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Take-Shelter-storm-coming-1-160x120.png 160w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Take-Shelter-storm-coming-1-320x240.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 128px) 100vw, 128px\" /></a>\n<a href='https://filmschoolrejects.com/michael-shannon-take-shelter/take-shelter-storm-coming-2/'><img data-attachment-id=\"356261\" data-orig-file=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Take-Shelter-storm-coming-2.png\" data-orig-size=\"832,600\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&#34;aperture&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;credit&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;camera&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;caption&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;created_timestamp&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;copyright&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;focal_length&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;iso&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;shutter_speed&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;orientation&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;keywords&#34;:&#34;Array&#34;}\" data-image-title=\"Take Shelter Storm Coming\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Take-Shelter-storm-coming-2.png\" data-large-file=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Take-Shelter-storm-coming-2.png\" width=\"128\" height=\"92\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Take-Shelter-storm-coming-2.png\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"Take Shelter Storm Coming\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Take-Shelter-storm-coming-2.png 832w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Take-Shelter-storm-coming-2-768x554.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 128px) 100vw, 128px\" /></a>\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Confronted by Dewart (Shea Whigham), his estranged friend and former coworker, Curtis gets in a tussle that proves to be the straw that broke the camel&#8217;s back. &#8220;I said enough, goddamnit!&#8221; he explodes, flipping a table and earning the judging, horrified stares of basically the entire small-town. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">&#8220;You think I&#8217;m crazy, huh?!&#8221; As he blows his top, describing the apocalyptic visions that have consumed his own thoughts to a community clearly unmoved by his warnings but becoming deeply fearful of <em>him</em>, the adrenaline rush fades and shame rushes in. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Shannon plays every emotional beat to perfection. </span><span class=\"s1\">He plays the wild-eyed, gesticulating, and spit-flying moment of rage dialed up to eleven with awesome grandeur &#8212; and then, more crucially, he hits all the quieter but no less important notes directly afterward with the same precision. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In a long, quiet moment, he looks to his family as he&#8217;s hit by the reality of the situation and the inevitable consequences of his outburst, rage giving way to remorse. In seconds he goes from daring onlookers to meet his beady gaze to his eyes brimming with tears, too overcome with shame to meet his wife&#8217;s gaze.</span></p>\n<p>Another key moment that exemplifies the brilliance of Shannon&#8217;s performance comes later, quite close to the end of the film. Curtis has sunk his savings into building a storm shelter, an obsessive pursuit that has also cost him his job. He sees it as the one thing he can do to try to cope with &#8212; and exert some semblance of control over &#8212; the fears quickly consuming him.</p>\n<p>One night, a storm does come, one severe enough to merit tornado sirens. So, Curtis takes wife Samantha (Jessica Chastain) and young daughter Hannah (Tova Stewart) down into the storm shelter. But then the rain and thunder stop and the winds die down. The family is faced with re-emerging, with leaving the underground bunker to return to the real world in all its unpredictability.</p>\n<p>Curtis has the key to open the shelter door, but he can&#8217;t bring himself to do it. He tries to get Samantha to do it for him, but she won&#8217;t. She insists it&#8217;s something he needs to do himself &#8212; because it is. And eventually, he does, even though it&#8217;s very clearly difficult for him. He does because he knows he needs to keep facing his demons, to keep fighting. So he opens the door, and they emerge to a bright and sunny day, a battle won but an unending war left to fight.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-356263\" src=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Take-Shelter-emerging.png\" alt=\"Take Shelter Emerging\" width=\"800\" height=\"339\" srcset=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Take-Shelter-emerging.png 800w, https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Take-Shelter-emerging-768x325.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>Curtis&#8217;s struggle against opening the storm shelter door is a quieter scene, but it&#8217;s more powerful. The way Shannon imbues his voice with barely-contained desperation as Curtis tries to convince Samantha to stay in the bunker, that the storm is still raging outside, is truly masterful.</p>\n<p>Samantha calmly reiterates that the storm has passed &#8212; that any lingering sense of danger exists only in Curtis&#8217; head &#8212; as a message largely unspoken but nonetheless clearly received. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; he repeats, between long heavy pauses and shakes of his head. Each &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry&#8221; is delivered with subtle but impactful variations in inflection. Shannon manages to convey what&#8217;s left unspoken with clarity.</p>\n<p>The actor&#8217;s every glance and gesture tells you all you need to know as Curtis forces himself to comply with Samantha&#8217;s rational request in spite of the fear that consumes him. The way his hand trembles holding the key. The particular way in which he pauses, not just while finally resolving himself to open the door but again with his hand on the shelter door and the key in the lock and need to gather his courage once more.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve never seen the scene played out on any screen larger than a mid-sized television, and yet, of thousands of movies I&#8217;ve seen, it&#8217;s one of the moments that looms largest in my head, the crowning jewel of an impeccable performance from a truly special film.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/GbWhpNJnNqA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 10 Aug 2020 18:23:33 +0000","feedId":24,"bgimg":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Take-Shelter.png","linkMd5":"6d74664fce906071a2670aa9f46704bf","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn37@2020_4/2020/08/12/02-12-25-769_59ecc5be29b062d9.webp","metaImg":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Take-Shelter.png","author":"Ciara Wardlow","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Take-Shelter-storm-coming-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn51@2020_6/2020/08/12/02-12-25-645_9a2aa70b0e689fc1.webp","https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Take-Shelter-storm-coming-2.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn61@2020_4/2020/08/12/02-12-27-749_09cac892236ba40d.webp","https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Take-Shelter-emerging.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn73@2020_2/2020/08/12/02-12-25-587_06e4a3bf0ef7ca72.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/GbWhpNJnNqA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn45@2020_4/2020/08/12/02-12-26-862_b529713f5b9bcb28.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-12 10:12:19","updatedTime":"2020-08-12 10:12:19","title":"The Morbid Hilarity of “The Junior Mint”","link":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/?p=356313","description":"<p><em>This essay is part of our series <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/episodes/\"><strong>Episodes</strong></a>, a bi-weekly column in which senior contributor <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/author/valerie/\">Valerie Ettenhofer</a> digs into the singular chapters of television that make the medium great. This entry looks at the darkly uproarious episode of Seinfeld titled &#8220;The Junior Mint.&#8221;</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>If you only know one thing about <strong><em>Seinfeld</em></strong>, it’s probably that it’s “a show about nothing.” The de facto tagline for the sitcom, which George Costanza (<strong>Jason Alexander</strong>) himself used in a pitch for a failed show-within-a-show, is the descriptor that history has chosen for one of TV’s best-ever comedy series.</p>\n<p>It’s also not entirely true. Sure, <em>Seinfeld</em> is, as Saul Austerlitz writes <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/Sitcom.html?id=ydDFAgAAQBAJ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">in his book <em>Sitcom</em></a>, “A masterful exploration of minutiae.” From the start, <strong>Larry David</strong> and <strong>Jerry Seinfeld</strong>’s series hones in on the quirks and pet peeves and neuroses that make up everyday experiences. But as it grows bolder with each season, mixing absurd situations with comically mundane moments, the series in some ways becomes the opposite of a show about nothing. <em>Seinfeld</em> pulls off several of the most hilariously complex self-contained plotlines ever seen on a sitcom, the comedy series equivalent of spinning a half-dozen plates atop poles without letting any drop to the ground.</p>\n<p>The series often weaves together outlandish scenarios that’ll put you in stitches just to describe aloud (I think often of George’s custom napping desk) and turns schadenfreude into high art by giving its characters an amoral shrugginess that makes <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/seinfeld-and-veep-finales/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">nearly every twist of fate</a>, even the bad ones, enjoyable. <em>Seinfeld</em> often gets lumped in with its ‘90s contemporary, <em>Friends</em>, but unlike any other traditional sitcom of its time, it refuses to give in to sentimentality and always makes a stranger, funnier choice than viewers expect. For a show about nothing, it’s got a lot going on.</p>\n<p>Which brings us to “<strong>The Junior Mint</strong>.” Though it’s a less-referenced entry in the <em>Seinfeld</em> canon &#8212; perhaps because, unlike classics including “The Contest” and “The Soup Nazi,” it doesn’t have a pithy catchphrase &#8212; ”The Junior Mint” is nonetheless spit-take-level uproarious. The titular candy doesn’t appear until midway through the half-hour, but the episode, written by <strong>Andy Robin</strong>, is on its game from the start. In the opening scene, Kramer (<strong>Michael Richards</strong>, who won an Emmy for this episode), making a heavily applauded entrance, gets passionate about his log cabin wallpaper. “I need wood around me. Wood, Jerry.” He snaps his fingers, then once more for emphasis: “Wood!”</p>\n<p>Jerry talks about meeting a woman (<strong>Susan Walters</strong>) in the produce section of the grocery store. George mulls over the idea of putting down $1,900 in “found money” on a bet, then rents <em>Home Alone</em> since he’s only seen (and hated) the sequel. We’re in classic <em>Seinfeld</em> territory here, with the gang riffing on topics both familiar and niche alike. It’s a fun guessing game for viewers, trying to determine which of these riffs will tie into the episode’s usually interwoven main plot, and which are equally funny one-offs.</p>\n<p>Elaine (<strong>Julia Louis-Dreyfus</strong>) enters and asks the others if they remember an artist she dated, a guy named Roy. In the mythologically dense New York-set series’ fourth season, it’s possible that we’d know this minor character, but the audience hasn’t met him yet. He’s an artist known for paintings of triangles, and Elaine says she dumped him because he was fat. This is a jarring moment to watch in 2020; Elaine’s fatphobia bristles against our retrospective sensibilities even as other unconscionable moments within the episode still warrant belly laughs. Roy’s in the hospital awaiting surgery, she says, so the gang decides to visit him.</p>\n<p>At the hospital, disasters are set into motion in a typically Seinfeldian way. Kramer side-eyes the surgeon (<strong>Victor Raider-Wexler</strong>), worried he’ll use a faulty retractor he heard about on <em>20/20</em>. Roy (<strong>Sherman Howard</strong>) has lost weight and tells Elaine it’s because he didn’t eat for weeks after she dumped him. Of course, she’s into him again.</p>\n<p>Austerlitz, describes the structure of the series in his book: “If there is a platonic ideal of the <em>Seinfeld</em> episode, it is the foursome encountering a new patsy and promptly proceeding to destroy his or her life.” This week, Roy’s the patsy, and his destruction is multi-pronged and morbidly funny. As Kramer tactlessly describes the guts and gore of surgery like a grisly horror movie and Elaine single-mindedly hits on Roy, the two have no regard for his personhood. Across <em>Seinfeld</em>’s nine seasons, most of the people they meet are treated as props, and Larry David &#8212; like Kramer swimming the East River &#8212; continuously plunges deeper into the depths of their selfishness, returning each time with bigger and more surprisingly callous laughs.</p>\n<p>Roy heads into surgery in an operating theater. Kramer and Jerry watch from an overlooking balcony alongside a group of medical students. Enter: the Junior Mints. Kramer, who has treated this surgery like a cinematic event from the start (“Spleenectomy.” “Isn’t that where they remove the&#8230;” “Don’t ruin it for me; I haven’t seen it yet!”), brings candy to share during the show. He tries to force some on Jerry, who pushes them away. A Junior Mint arcs through the air in slow motion, falling down, down, down through the operating theater before plopping neatly into Roy’s open body cavity. Jerry and Kramer look around them with shocked guilt. No one saw.</p>\n<p>How many sitcoms, even nearly thirty years later, have given us plots this audacious and ridiculous? TV lovers are lucky to have witnessed the advent of shows like <em>It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Community</em>, and <em>Arrested Development</em>, each of which stretches the limits of what a comedic misadventure can look like, and none of which would exist without <em>Seinfeld</em>. Yet no shows &#8212; except, perhaps, Larry David-driven heir apparent <em>Curb Your Enthusiasm </em>&#8212; go as boldly and brilliantly into uncharted comedic territory while still keeping a <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/seinfeld-still-holds-up/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">comfortingly recognizable structure</a> as<em> Seinfeld</em> does.</p>\n<p>The Junior Mint, obviously, isn’t great for Roy’s recovery. When Elaine tells the guys that he’s taken a turn for the worse, the episode becomes the most darkly comedic, unnervingly high-stakes bit of product placement imaginable. “Who’s gonna turn down a Junior Mint?” Kramer says in defense of his faux pas. “It’s chocolate, it’s peppermint, it’s delicious!”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, George considers investing in some of Roy’s artwork in case his death makes it more valuable, and Jerry, in a classic B plot, tries to guess and snoop his way into learning the name of a woman he’s already kissed, whose name “rhymes with a part of the female anatomy.” This episode takes place seasons before George shrugs off his fiance’s death at the hands of cheap envelope glue, but the conceit is similar. We knew the gang was shallow, selfish, and cowardly, but their total disregard for human life is a bleakly hilarious new low.</p>\n<p>The Junior Mint acts as a sort of a tell-tale heart, haunting Jerry and Kramer as they decide whether or not to report the excruciatingly embarrassing incident to save a man’s life. They themselves are ultimately saved, however, when it turns out the minty freshness isn’t what caused Roy’s infection, but what staved it off.</p>\n<p>In the spirit of <em>Seinfeld</em>, there’s no lesson to be learned here. Elaine dumps Roy yet again when it’s clear he’s back to his overeating habit. George bemoans his useless new triangle paintings. Kramer and Jerry are off the hook, although Jerry’s down a girlfriend thanks to his inability to communicate (“Mulva?” he guesses sheepishly).</p>\n<p>The surgeon gets in one wry final joke about the unbelievable events of the episode: “I think there were other factors at play here&#8230;something happened during the operation that staved off that infection. Something beyond science. Something perhaps&#8230;,” he says, hesitating in reverence, “from above.” Kramer offers him a Junior Mint.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/Ynyh0lyRYGY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 10 Aug 2020 16:16:09 +0000","feedId":24,"bgimg":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Seinfeld-Junior-Mint.jpg","linkMd5":"6f5a8a6cdf67653d5211034fa0e75249","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn33@2020_1/2020/08/12/02-12-25-641_8a2dd9d5f8ae388d.webp","metaImg":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Seinfeld-Junior-Mint.jpg","author":"Valerie Ettenhofer","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FilmSchoolRejects/~4/Ynyh0lyRYGY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn41@2020_1/2020/08/12/02-12-25-342_5f3c2793dd856ed2.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-12 10:12:25","updatedTime":"2020-08-12 10:12:25","title":"Celebrating the Deadly Duo of Stuart Gordon and Jeffrey Combs","link":"https://filmschoolrejects.com/?p=356328","description":"<p><em>Welcome to <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/topics/the-queue/\"><strong>The Queue</strong></a> — your daily distraction of curated video content sourced from across the web.

Coffee and doughnuts. <a href=\"https://filmschoolrejects.com/remembering-stuart-gordon/\"><strong>Stuart Gordon</strong></a> and <strong>Jeffrey Combs</strong>. That last pair is a match made in heaven, one of the most iconic team-ups in horror history.</p>\n<p>With a repertory mindset, Gordon is no stranger to long-term collaboration, repeatedly joining forces with the likes of Barbara Crampton, Dennis Paoli, Charles Band,  Brian Yuzna, and David Mamet. His alliance with Combs produced some of the grizzliest, funniest, and most audacious characterizations in genre film: from the scene-chewing machinations of the mad doctor Herbert West in <em>Re-Animator</em> to the pathetic wounded masculinity of <em>Castle Freak</em>&#8216;s John Riley. <span style=\"font-size: 15.9999px;\">United</span><span style=\"font-size: 1.14285rem;\"> by a background in theatre and a shared appreciation for going over the top, when Gordon and Combs get together, it&#8217;s magic. They&#8217;re electric, eccentric, and invariably unforgettable.</span></p>\n<p>The video below works through the duo&#8217;s intertwined careers, from their iconic Lovecraft adaptations (<em>Re-Animator</em>, <em>From Beyond</em>) to their shared fascination with Edgar Allen Poe (<em>The Pit and the Pendulum</em>, &#8220;The Black Cat,&#8221; <em>Nevermore &#8230; An Evening with Edgar Allan Poe</em>). The video also makes sure to mention the pair&#8217;s more esoteric collaborations like <em>Robot Jox </em>and <em>Edmund. </em>It&#8217;s a touching tribute that underscores one of the genre&#8217;s greatest team-ups, bonding two creatives who consistently found ways to serve each other&#8217;s talents, leaving a lasting legacy of their wake.</p>\n<p>Watch &#8220;<strong>S</strong><strong>tuart Gordon &#38; Jeffrey Combs &#8211; Deadly Duos</strong>&#8220;:</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"STUART GORDON &#38; JEFFREY COMBS - Deadly Duos\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6l7iaiIkEtQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Who made this?</h2>\n<p>JoBlo Horror Videos is a part of the <a href=\"http://www.joblo.com\">JoBlo Movie Network</a>.
