Pre-pandemic median annual earnings for<a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2019/11/21/low-wage-work-is-more-pervasive-than-you-think-and-there-arent-enough-good-jobs-to-go-around/\"> 44% of US workers was just $18,000</a> and almost<a href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/wages-and-transfers/\"> 50% of government assistance in 2016 went to full-time working people</a> who fell below the poverty line.&#160;&#160;</p><p>We should follow the leadership of organizations like<a href=\"http://impact.jwj.org/by-the-numbers\"> Jobs with Justice</a>, the<a href=\"https://www.nelp.org/about-us/our-impact\"> National Employment Law Project</a> and<a href=\"https://onefairwage.com/\"> One Fair Wage</a> who have marshaled the collective power of working people across sectors to advance more just and fair compensation in places like New York, California, New Jersey, Illinois, Connecticut, Maryland and across sectors. Their work is a timely rudder for this moment.</p><h2><strong>Guaranteed access to healthcare, paid leave, and benefits&#160;</strong></h2><p>Before the onset of the pandemic,<a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ncs/ebs/\"> one in four working people in the US</a>—approximately 34 million people—lacked paid sick leave. While just<a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/03/12/as-coronavirus-spreads-which-u-s-workers-have-paid-sick-leave-and-which-dont/\"> 8% of working people in the top quarter of earnings lacked access to paid sick days, almost half of those in the lowest quarter faced the same challenge</a>. Additionally, growing swaths of the workforce, including those in gig, domestic caregiving, food processing, and farm work, did not have access to healthcare and other basic benefits, particularly among immigrant and migrant communities.&#160;</p><p>In the US, the pandemic is revealing how predicating an economy on a system that ties healthcare to employment and incentivizes limitations to paid leave and basic benefits impacts us all.&#160;</p><p>Coalitions like<a href=\"https://familyvaluesatwork.org/media-center/timeline-of-wins/\"> Family Values @ Work</a> and<a href=\"https://paidleaveforall.org/\"> Paid Leave for All</a> are making major strides in campaigning for and securing paid leave and sick days across the United States. <em>We need to build an economy that guarantees access to critical benefits for all working people and their families.</em></p><p>&#160;</p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MZAmuYLfZdU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>&#160;</p><p><em>&#160;</em></p><h2><strong>A robust care infrastructure</strong></h2><p>Care work is essential to a functioning and sustainable economy. Whether caring for children or elderly parents, growing numbers of workers need care support<a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/ai_jen_poo_the_work_that_makes_all_other_work_possible\"> to remain in the labor force</a>. Yet, it remains barely affordable and accessible to many working families.&#160;</p><p>Working parents in low-wage work have been found to spend up to a<a href=\"http://www.diversitydatakids.org/sites/default/files/2020-02/child-care_update.pdf\"> quarter of their annual income on childcare expenses</a>. Today, many working parents are struggling to manage dueling work and childcare responsibilities intensified by school and childcare center closings.</p><p>Care work has long been undervalued in the US economy, which lags behind many industrialized countries in its approaches to<a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/els/soc/PF3_1_Public_spending_on_childcare_and_early_education.pdf\"> childcare</a> and<a href=\"https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/surveys/2017/nov/2017-commonwealth-fund-international-health-policy-survey-older\"> eldercare</a>. Care workers themselves were<a href=\"https://www.nelp.org/blog/wage-hour-protections-for-home-care-workers-take-effect/\"> denied labor protections until just a few years ago</a> and still continue to<a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/research/essential-but-undervalued-millions-of-health-care-workers-arent-getting-the-pay-or-respect-they-deserve-in-the-covid-19-pandemic/#:~:text=Home%20health%20and%20personal%20care,some%20form%20of%20public%20assistance.\"> face </a>low wages. Consequently, up to<a href=\"https://phinational.org/policy-research/workforce-data-center/#tab=National+Data&natvar=Public+Assistanceance\"> 42% of care workers have been found to rely on public assistance</a> for their food, healthcare, and cash needs.&#160;</p><p>We need a bold and robust infrastructure for caregiving that ensures working people can afford care. The<a href=\"https://www.domesticworkers.org/\"> National Domestic Worker Alliance</a> is demonstrating how this national caregiving challenge can be addressed through its<a href=\"https://www.domesticworkers.org/sites/all/themes/NDWA2017/images/LearnMore.pdf\"> Domestic Workers Bill of Rights</a> which has seen adoption in several states. Others like the<a href=\"https://nwlc.org/issue/child-care/\"> National Women's Law Center</a> and<a href=\"https://universalfamilycare.org/\"> Caring Across Generations</a> are articulating and driving bold visions for universal care.</p><h2><strong>Safe and healthy working conditions&#160;</strong></h2><p>Working people simply desire to conduct their work in environments where they can stay safe and healthy. Yet, this is not prioritized by many US employers where up to<a href=\"https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR2014.html\"> 50% of US workers face hazardous or unpleasant conditions</a>. More recently, workers on the frontlines of the pandemic continue to find themselves working without adequate safety measures or equipment.&#160;</p><p>This is disproportionately experienced among workers who are Black or come from other communities of color. Recent polls indicate that up to<a href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/covid-risks-and-hazard-pay/\"> 73% of Black Americans have worked outside their homes during the pandemic compared to half of white workers. Some 68% of those Black workers</a> working outside their homes were concerned with risks of contracting and spreading the virus. More importantly, Black workers were found to be<a href=\"https://s27147.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/Silenced-About-COVID-19-Workplace-Fear-Retaliation-June-2020.pdf\"> more than two times as likely than white workers to experience retaliation</a> by employers when they raised their concerns about COVID-19.&#160;</p><p>We need an economy that values the safety of workers as people and as critical drivers of economic activity; where working people have a collective voice in shaping their work conditions without fear of retaliation.</p><p>Workers with organizations such as<a href=\"https://united4respect.org/\"> United for Respect</a> are calling for changes that prioritize their safety and well-being amidst this pandemic. They are also experimenting around shared employer-worker governance models where workers can voice their concerns, including through<a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90429425/how-a-few-former-toys-r-us-employees-are-leading-the-brands-comeback-and-putting-workers-first\"> the worker board they established at Toys \"R\" Us</a> following its emergence from bankruptcy.<a href=\"https://home.coworker.org/\"> CoWorker.org</a> is supporting workers in the tech, gig, and other sectors to collectively raise their voices and transform their workplaces.</p><p>The rampant inequality working people face is not a fire that will burn itself out. The decisions we make, the demands we deliver, will determine whether we recover or relapse, whether we withstand this crisis and prevail over those to come. Let's honor essential workers by committing to a fight to advance an economy that truly works for all. The future of work must be today.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/workers-us-economy-covid-19-income-inequality-wages-healthcare-2020-9'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=U0BRb0_Cj3k:ql4t-o3k8Cw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=U0BRb0_Cj3k:ql4t-o3k8Cw:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=U0BRb0_Cj3k:ql4t-o3k8Cw:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=U0BRb0_Cj3k:ql4t-o3k8Cw:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=U0BRb0_Cj3k:ql4t-o3k8Cw:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=U0BRb0_Cj3k:ql4t-o3k8Cw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=U0BRb0_Cj3k:ql4t-o3k8Cw:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=U0BRb0_Cj3k:ql4t-o3k8Cw:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/U0BRb0_Cj3k\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 05 Sep 2020 12:43:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f515d1ee6ff30001d4e6fe4?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"634cef822ff3dc6c53110c0b001c7237","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn61@2020_3/2020/09/06/02-59-44-271_108612ad1f67a8f6.webp","destWidth":1246,"destHeight":934,"sourceBytes":123094,"destBytes":123094,"author":"insider@insider.com (Sarita Gupta)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5f515d257ed0ee001e25d66a?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn92@2020_6/2020/09/06/02-59-45-603_68b0b36c6234a129.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn78@2020_1/2020/09/06/02-59-58-308_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=U0BRb0_Cj3k:ql4t-o3k8Cw:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn2@2020_1/2020/09/06/03-00-00-236_d373e535323e8b52.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=U0BRb0_Cj3k:ql4t-o3k8Cw:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn41@2020_4/2020/09/06/02-59-56-937_acafc600ec53e158.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn60@2020_6/2020/09/06/02-59-52-353_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=U0BRb0_Cj3k:ql4t-o3k8Cw:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn99@2020_4/2020/09/06/02-59-48-066_a87a4fe6d3d36e19.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/U0BRb0_Cj3k":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn1@2020_2/2020/09/06/02-59-54-810_c05a8167a51deede.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599361164628},{"createdTime":"2020-09-06 10:59:24","updatedTime":"2020-09-06 10:59:24","title":"This luxurious custom Land Rover is for people who want a car and a yacht — see inside the 'Defender Yachting Edition'","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/land-rover-defender-yachting-edition-carlex-built-for-boat-enthusiasts-2020-9","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f501169e6ff30001d4e6c3b?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Land Rover Defender Yachting Edition\" height=\"1562\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Land Rover Defender Yachting Edition.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Carlex Design</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>Polish car-customization firm Carlex Design just dropped images of its latest offering &#8212; a lavish Land Rover Defender catered to the yachting community.&#160;</li>\n<li>Dubbed the Defender Yachting Edition, the SUV boasts a brushed-silver exterior and a custom interior with wood flooring.</li>\n<li>Carlex also offers a yacht-themed package for the Mercedes-Benz G-Wagen and the Mercedes X-Class pickup, which isn't available in the US.&#160;</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>Sometimes when you're on the road, you can't help but wish you were out at sea — traffic and the sound of the pavement miles away.

No jerks.</p><p>\"We have a saying,\" Alpine skier Aksel Lund Svindal&#160;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/15/sports/olympics/norway-skiing-olympics.html?login=smartlock&auth=login-smartlocklock\" rel=\"nofollow\">told</a> The&#160;New York Times. \"There is almost no skill or ability you can have that is so good it allows you to ruin the social qualities of the&#160;<a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/team\" data-ga-category=\"autotag-linking\" data-ga-label=\"ai-metadata\" data-ga-action=\"/topic/team\">team</a>.\"</p><p>For Norway's men's ski team, keeping jerks at bay has allowed them to form a strong bond that improves their performance in competition: Every Friday, the team gathers for taco night. Their dynamic is so functional that they'll share hotel rooms — and even beds — while they're on the road. They share all of their tactics and techniques with one another freely, ensuring everyone is bringing their absolute best to the slopes.</p><p>&#160;\"If you have teammates who consistently lift you up, then the environment will make you happy,\" Svindal's teammate, Kjetil Jansrud, said. \"You'll work harder and stay motivated. You're giving yourself your best chance to win.\"</p><p>The same, of course, is true of the workplace. A healthy team dynamic is crucial to the well-being of the company. But that also means that one bad hire can collapse an otherwise healthy office ecosystem.&#160;</p><h2>The cost of a bad hire&#160;</h2><p>Bad hires are expensive on several levels.&#160;Zappos&#160;CEO&#160;Tony Hsieh, whose company boasts notoriously&#160;happy employees,&#160;<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/falonfatemi/2016/09/28/the-true-cost-of-a-bad-hire-its-more-than-you-think/#511156314aa4\" rel=\"nofollow\">once estimated</a>&#160;that bad hires cost the company \"well over $100 million.\"</p><p>But your bottom line isn't even where a bad hire hurts the most. In fact, chief financial officers rank bad hires' impact on morale and&#160;productivity&#160;ahead of monetary loss.</p><p>As the Norwegian men's ski team knows, an employee that doesn't fit with the company's culture can have a destabilizing effect on the whole organization.</p><p>In some cases, productivity across the board can decrease, since others need to work harder to meet targets and goals to compensate for someone who isn't pulling their weight. This increases the risk of driving your best team members out, taking their skills and knowledge with them.</p><p>They can also damage your company's reputation both outwardly and inwardly. Client-facing bad hires can permanently harm relationships with customers. Internally, word of mouth and review websites like Glassdoor allow employees to make educated decisions about where they want to work. Satisfied employees will often refer friends and colleagues to your company. If they're unhappy, though, they'll often warn talented, would-be hires to stay away.</p><h2>How to avoid making a bad hire</h2><p>Each&#160;employee you hire won't be perfect. But there are ways of increasing your odds of choosing a team that will go the distance.</p><p>Before you even post an ad, figure out exactly what skills you want a new hire to have. Create a job description that clearly outlines job duties and the experience needed to excel. A detailed outline will not only help attract talent that's actually right for the job, but it will give you a guide to stick to&#160;in order to avoid getting sidetracked.</p><p>As a bootstrapped founder, I grew my company,&#160;JotForm,&#160;slowly and carefully. This gradual growth has allowed me to figure out what I truly value. I've made some mistakes, but in the process of expanding from a solo venture to a company with over 250 employees, I've learned a lot about what to look for in a hire.</p><p>One of my main takeaways? Having the right skills is only a piece of the puzzle.</p><p>Throughout the interview process, look for what HBR&#160;<a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/02/how-to-avoid-hiring-a-toxic-employee\" rel=\"nofollow\">terms</a>&#160;\"signs of civility.\" Asking the applicant how she managed past situations provides more insight than presenting hypothetical scenarios, like \"how would you handle…\" or \"what would you do if…\" and so on.&#160;Make your values known during the interview, and ask for examples of how their past behavior matches those values.</p><p>Zappos actually has two interview types. The first explores the candidate's abilities, experience, etc. But they also conduct another round specifically to determine cultural fit. To get the job, a candidate needs to pass both types.</p><p>Another helpful Zappos tactic is seeking references in unexpected places. When a candidate flies in for an interview, the company sends a shuttle to the airport. Company leaders will later ask the driver if the applicant was nice, or whether they were rude. No matter how qualified the candidate, the rude ones never make the cut.</p><p>Remember the Norwegian ski team? No jerks.</p><h2>What to do if you've made a bad hire</h2><p>Let's face it — sometimes, despite doing everything right, you wind up with someone who just isn't a good fit.</p><p>Don't beat yourself up: Only 19% of new hires are <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2018/08/what-to-do-when-you-realize-you-made-a-bad-hire\" rel=\"nofollow\">considered</a> completely successful. By 18 months, 46% are deemed failures. Yikes.</p><p>So what to do when you've mis-hired?</p><p>Rather than hoping that the person will magically change overnight, it's best to have a direct conversation with your new recruit. Share your concerns with them, and explore solutions that might satisfy you both.</p><p>If that doesn't work, it's time to evaluate the current and future expenses of hanging on to the hire. Has there been an increase in workplace conflict? Are other employees struggling to cover for them? Often, you won't even realize the extent of the negative impact the bad hire has had until you remove them.</p><p>If the relationship can't be saved, you can still make their departure as painless as possible. Work with your HR department and try to negotiate a plan that benefits everyone.</p><p>If parting ways with the employee is not an option, you can at least mitigate the damage:&#160;<a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/10/how-to-manage-a-toxic-employee\" rel=\"nofollow\">Separate</a> them from the rest of the team by rearranging desks or holding fewer all-hands meetings. Christine Porath, an associate professor at Georgetown and the author of \"Mastering Civility: A Manifesto for the Workplace,\" refers to this as \"immunizing\" others.</p><p>\"You're trying to protect people like you would with a disease,\" Porath told <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/10/how-to-manage-a-toxic-employee\">Harvard Business Review</a>. \"You will hopefully decrease the number of run-ins and [minimize] the cognitive loss.\"</p><p>That said, it's important not to let one individual take up all your time and energy. Porath suggests surrounding yourself with supportive, positive people, and looking for meaning and purpose in your work.</p><p>\"If someone is draining you, build yourself up by exercising, eating right, sleeping, and taking breaks, both short-term ones, and [long-term] vacations,\" she <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/10/how-to-manage-a-toxic-employee\">said</a>. \"Being healthy and proactive is the one thing we know that buffers people from the effects of toxic behavior.\"</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

the US hard in March, Ford and every other major global automaker had to shut down production, taking the unprecedented step of idling assembly lines nationwide to protect workers from COVID-19.</p><p>At the same time, as the virus ripped through American society, sickening thousands, hospitals faced shortages of protective gowns, gloves, face masks and shields, respirators, and — for critically ill patients — ventilators.</p><p>Ford had been making pickup trucks and SUVs at its factories, so the company dusted off its World War II playbook and shifted gears. But this time around, instead of tanks and warplanes, the Blue Oval and its workers made medical equipment.</p><p>About five months and 50,000 ventilators later, the effort has been chronicled in a short film, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=4&v=lYHgV2u1T2Y&feature=emb_logoemb_logo\">\"On the Line\"</a><em>,</em> directed by Hollywood veteran Peter Berg, known for films such as \"Friday Night Lights\" and \"Hancock<em>.\" </em>The eight-and-a-half-minute documentary debuted at Aspen Ideas Now (an extension of the Aspen Ideas Festival) on Friday.</p><h2>The new UAW president steps up to the challenge</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5e738a2dc485406e2f50fd52?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Rory Gamble\" height=\"1307\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>UAW President Rory Gamble has to deal with a pandemic and a leadership crisis at the union.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Reuters</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Ford CEO Jim Hackett and GE Healthcare executives oversaw what the companies called \"Project Apollo,\" a name inspired by the movie \"Apollo 13<em>,\" </em>which celebrated American engineering ingenuity under the extreme stress of a failed 1970 Moon mission when NASA fought to return three astronauts to Earth after an accident damaged their spacecraft.</p><p>An unsung hero of the story was Rory Gamble, the new president of United Auto Workers, who had been on the job less than six months when the pandemic struck, and was dealing with his members' concerns about workplace safety while simultaneously managing the fallout of a leadership crisis at the union. (His predecessor, Gary Jones, had stepped down amid a scandal and later pled guilty to embezzlement charges.)</p><p>The UAW and the Detroit Big Three — Ford, General Motors, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles — are often thought to be adversaries. And the differences between labor and management had exploded in late 2019, when the almost 50,000 UAW members walked out on GM, striking for more than a month.</p><p>But the Ford effort (as well as a similar undertaking at GM) showed that Detroit's leaders, on both sides, could put aside their differences to \"take care of each other,\" as Gamble said in an interview with Business Insider.</p><p>\"He flawlessly rose to the occasion,\" Hackett said of Gamble's determination. \"He saved a bunch of people's lives and deserves a ton of credit.\"</p><p>Gamble had been instrumental in pushing for factory shutdowns in mid-March, advocating for his membership. In the span of a week, the Detroit automakers and the UAW went from talking about how they would deal with the coronavirus crisis to idling plants in the US.</p><p>Hackett acknowledged that the pressure was a good thing. He estimated that Ford could have lost nearly 3,000 workers to the disease if the company hadn't swiftly pulled the plug.</p><p>\"We got them out of the exposure path,\" Hackett said, calling the undertaking a phenomenal effort by Ford and the UAW. His praise for Gamble was unflinching. \"I'd love to sit across the table from him,\" Hackett said.</p><p>\"We set a common goal and left our differences behind,\" Gamble said, adding that the UAW and Ford approached the pandemic from a \"humanitarian perspective.\"</p><p>\"The entire world is fighting this virus,\" he noted. \"It's a threat to all life, so all life should be fighting it collectively.\"</p><h2>Enter the Hollywood storyteller</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5e94a02a0b3c9b68e05a6084?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Ford Coronavirus tech\" height=\"2194\" width=\"2925\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Ford rapidly shifted from making pickups to producing medical equipment.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Ford</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>The story captured the attention of Berg, who had already been working on a project with Ford and Hackett about how the 117-year-old company was reinventing itself for the 21st century. So he set about following Ford workers and executives as they repurposed numerous automotive components to make millions of masks and face shields and tens of thousands of ventilators, at a pace Hackett called \"mind-boggling.\" (UAW members volunteered to work at facilities that had to be revamped to make the medical technology.)</p><p>\"There wasn't a lot of shaping that had to be done,\" Berg said of the narrative, which features longtime Ford employees talking about their commitment to the company and its history, but also to the virus-beleaguered public and to front-line medical personnel and emergency workers.&#160;</p><p>\"It's an example of the very best within us, as a country, as workers, and for Ford as a company.\"</p><p>Berg agreed that he had filmed a distinctly American story.&#160;</p><p>\"We're desperate for these stories today.&#160;Cynicism is at levels I haven't seen in my lifetime.

According to several unnamed sources in the report, Trump had made multiple disparaging remarks about military veterans and appeared callous to the sacrifices made by service members.</p><p>During a trip to Paris in 2018, Trump reportedly resisted the idea of visiting a military cemetery to commemorate the 100th anniversary of World War I, saying that the revered site was \"filled with losers\" and \"suckers\" who died.</p><p>The Atlantic report, which was written by the publication's editor in chief Jeffrey Goldberg, also noted that Trump made critical remarks about former Republican leaders who served in the military. Three sources told Goldberg that Trump was furious at Sen. John McCain of Arizona, even after his death from an aggressive form of brain cancer in 2018. McCain and Trump have long been at odds with each other, despite being in the same political party.</p><p>\"We're not going to support that loser's funeral,\" Trump said after McCain's death, according to The Atlantic. The US senator's funeral included a widely-attended proceeding at the Capitol Rotunda from both Democratic and Republican icons, including Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Trump was not invited to the proceedings.</p><p>\"What the f--- are we doing that for?

Bush as a \"loser,\" because the former president's aircraft crashed during World War II, the Atlantic reported. Both McCain and Bush served in the US Navy as pilots and were shot down by enemy forces.</p><p>Following the publication of The Atlantic's story, other news organizations have confirmed the alleged remarks with their own reporting. <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-didnt-cancel-visit-to-american-military-cemetery-in-france-over-disdain-for-slain-veterans-sources-say\">Fox News</a> also confirmed in its report portions of The Atlantic's original story, including a claim that Trump referred to Vietnam War draftees as \"suckers.\" Trump received five deferments — four for attending college and one for a bone spur diagnosis — and was not required to serve in the war.</p><p>Long before The Atlantic published its report, Trump's former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/michael-cohen-on-trump-vietnam-war-military-service-bone-sppurs-2019-2\">testified</a> that Trump made similar comments about successfully avoiding the Vietnam War: \"You think I'm stupid, I'm not going to Vietnam,\" Cohen recalled Trump as saying, during a congressional testimony in 2019.</p><p>A book written by Philip Rucker and Carol Leonnig, two Pulitzer Prize-winning reporters from the Washington Post, also references Trump berating his senior military leaders and describing them as \"dopes and babies\" — in addition to \"losers.\"</p><p>\"You're all losers,\" Trump said at a meeting with his national security team in 2017, according to the book \"A Very Stable Genius.\" \"You don't know how to win anymore.\"</p><p>Trump, in addition to his advisers, publicly denied the claims made in The Atlantic's report. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany on Friday characterized The Atlantic as \"liberal activists,\" and provided emails of weather reports that threw cold water on claims that Trump did not want to visit the Paris cemetery because of fears that his hair \"would become disheveled\" from the inclement weather.</p><p>In a late-night tweet on Thursday, Trump also acknowledged he \"was never a big fan\" of McCain and that he \"disagreed with him on many things.\" Still, he claimed, he \"never called John a loser.\"</p><p>But the description of McCain as a \"loser\" echoes much of what Trump has said <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-falsely-claimed-didnt-call-john-mccain-loser-2020-9\">in the past</a>: \"I like people who weren't captured,\" Trump said of McCain's time as a prisoner of war, during his presidential campaign in 2015. Trump added at the time, \"I don't like losers.\"</p><p>Following the event, Trump also tweeted a link to a political blog that quoted his remarks.

The official recalled that immediately after Trump called the family members of US Army Sgt. LaDavid Johnson, a soldier who was killed during a militant ambush in Niger in 2017, the president's behavior was as though \"it was another day at the office for him.\"</p><p>That same phone call was criticized by Johnson's widow, who said at the time that it had \"made me cry even worse.\"</p><p>\"The president said that 'he knew what he signed up for but it hurts anyways,'\" Myeshia Johnson said during an interview with ABC. \"It made me cry because I was very angry at the tone of his voice and how he said it. He couldn't remember my husband's name.\"</p><p>One current Trump administration official told <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/trumps-defenders-he-doesnt-hate-the-troops-he-just-sounds-like-an-asshole\">The Daily Beast</a> that Trump's seemingly indifference towards the military was not intentional.</p><p>\"The president means no disrespect to our troops; it's just that the way he speaks, he can sound like an asshole sometimes,\" the official said to The Daily Beast, adding, \"it's his style.\"</p><p>The former White House official disputed that assertion to Insider; however, and called it \"totally disingenuous.\"</p><p>\"When I saw Donald Trump hugging the flag, it reminded me of Donald Trump the performer; the showman pandering,\" the former senior official told Insider, referring to the multiple occasions in which Trump physically embraced the US flag. \"Not Donald Trump,

New York.&#160;</p><p>After recently <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/teacher-salary-in-every-state-2018-4\">ranking</a> the teacher salaries in every state and DC and with the school year beginning around the country, Business Insider decided to look at what are the 10 states where public school teachers make the lowest. To do this, we used 2018-2019 average salaries of teachers in public elementary and secondary schools from the <a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d19/tables/dt19_211.60.asp?current=yes\">National Center for Education Statistics</a>. This is the most recent academic year with available data.&#160;</p><p>The US average salary for 2018-2019 was $61,730, same as the previous year. At the state level, 36 states have an annual average less than this US figure. Mississippi had an average salary of $45,574 in 2018-2019, the lowest among the states and DC. When adjusting for inflation, this state's salary decreased by 4.4% from the average salary of $47,659 in 1990-200 and decreased by 14.6% from the average salary of $53,338 in 2009-2010.</p><p>Florida was another state where teachers do not make as much compared to the salaries of other states and DC. The current average annual salary in this state is low compared to figures from the past two decades. The average annual salary in Florida declined by 11.9% from the inflation-adjusted salary of 1999-2000 and 11.3% from the inflation-adjusted salary of 2009-2010 to $48,395 average salary in 2018-2019.&#160;</p><p>Some schools in Florida have already reopened for in-person schooling. The <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2020/09/02/photo-shows-students-jammed-together-florida-high-school/\">Washington Post</a> recently shared a tweeted photo of crowded students in a Florida high school.</p><p>Utah is another state with a low average teacher salary relative to other states and DC. School plans vary throughout the state with some using a hybrid model of in-person and virtual learning. The <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/news/education/2020/08/09/heres-breakdown-how-some/\">Salt Lake Tribune</a> compiled a list of the varying plans from some of the state's largest districts.</p><p>The following are the 10 states where public school teachers earned the lowest average salaries during the 2018-2019 academic year. We also included total amount spent per pupil during the 2018 fiscal year in each state using public school data from the <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/school-finances/data/tables.html\">US Census Bureau</a>.&#160;</p>\n<div id=\"slideshow\">\n\t10.

href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories</a>.</li></ul><p>&#160;</p><p>Following is a transcription of the video:&#160;</p><p>Narrator: Scooped up across 38 countries and up to 75 flavors, Ben &#38; Jerry's is no pint-sized operation. Its two Vermont factories run 24/7, operated by hundreds of flavor makers. Together, they pump out nearly a million pints a day, from classic flavors like Cherry Garcia and Half Baked to flavors on a mission for criminal-justice reform and refugee rights. And all those flavors have to be delicious.</p><p>Sarah Fidler: Our minimum run size, once we get a flavor to the factory, is 80,000 pints. So not only do we have to love it, but 80,000 fans have to love it too.</p><p>Narrator: We visited the St. Albans plant in northern Vermont to see how these famous pints flip their way to our freezers. Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield started Ben &#38; Jerry's Homemade Ice Cream in 1978. From a renovated gas station in Burlington, Vermont, they launched a brand based on sustainable ice cream making and advocating for causes they believed in, and it worked. Today, Ben &#38; Jerry's is the best-selling single brand ice cream label in the US. To pump out its iconic flavors, first it starts with ingredients.</p><p>Ben &#38; Jerry's partners with 250 farms globally to source everything from vanilla bean to milk. Milk comes from the St. Albans Cooperative Creamery, just a mile and a half from the factory. Once the milk's at the plant, it heads to one of these massive, 6,000-gallon silos.</p><p>But before it can be made into ice cream, everyone involved has to suit up, including us. Gowns, hairnets, caps, and boots.</p><p>To make the ice cream base, the milk heads to the blend tank. Cream, milk, and lots of sugar are churned together. The factory goes through 6,700 gallons of cream every single day. Every ice cream flavor starts with either a sweet cream base or a chocolate base.</p><p>Next, the Mix Master will pour in eggs, stabilizers, and cocoa powder if it's a chocolate base. Then it's piped into the pasteurizer. You can't see it happening, but hot steel plates are heating up the mix to kill any harmful bacteria. The newly pasteurized milk is stored in a tank for four to eight hours, so the ingredients can really get to know each other.</p><p>After making the two bases, they'll head to one of the 20 flavor vats to get a flavor boost.</p><p>Fidler: We're always coming up with new flavors, hundreds of flavors a year, and we usually narrow it down to about three or four. We really love to bring our social mission values into our naming process. For example, Empower Mint to talk about voting rights.</p><p>Narrator: Before Ben &#38; Jerry's famous chunks can be added, the mix has to get to below-freezing temperatures. It's pumped through this giant freezing barrel, and when it gets to the front, it's finally ice cream. Along the way, it's quality tested, meaning lucky factory floor workers get to taste the ice creams.</p><p>Then it goes into the first of two freezer visits. When it comes out, it's 22 degrees and somewhere between the consistency of a milkshake and soft serve.</p><p>Now for the best part, the chunks. Founder Ben actually didn't have a great sense of smell, which meant he couldn't taste much either. So his big thing was texture. That's why Ben &#38; Jerry's has some of the biggest chunks in the ice cream industry. These chunks end up in flavors like Half Baked, Chubby Hubby, or the one we're making, Chocolate Therapy.</p><p>Workers dump in add-ins through the Chunk Feeder, from brownie bites and cookie dough globs to chocolate chunks, fruits, and nuts. They let us give it a try, but it's not as easy as it looks. Then it's finally time to pack those pints. Workers stack the empty containers into the automatic filler. The machine drops the pints into position and perfectly pumps in ice cream. It can fill up 270 pints a minute. The pints are pushed towards the lidder and sealed tight.</p><p>At this point, six pints every hour are pulled off the line for quality testing. Quality assurance personnel first cut pints open. They're making sure the ingredients are symmetrical and there aren't any big air bubbles.</p><p>Worker: There is a small gap, but that's what we call a functional void. If we saw large voids, it would be concerning. It's actually quite the workout, as you can tell.</p><p>Narrator: They also measure the weight and volume of pints to ensure that the right amount of ice cream makes it into each container.</p><p>Worker: So, we know the weight of the ice cream, and anything below 460 is not passable.</p><p>Narrator: Now back to the factory line. It's now time for the pints to take a second spin in the freezer. The ice cream has to get even colder, down to minus 10 degrees. The pints travel along the Spiral Hardener, a corkscrew-shaped conveyor belt inside a freezer. With the wind chill, it can get up to minus 60 degrees in there.</p><p>After three hours, the pints are finally frozen and ready to be packaged. They're flipped over and shrink wrapped into groups of eight. Together, they make a gallon.

already shattered records.</p><p>In March, the biotechnology company Moderna entered its vaccine candidate in a clinical trial less than 70 days after the virus was sequenced, shaving a year off the development process. Since then, two US drug companies, Moderna and Pfizer, have <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-vaccine-timeline-what-to-watch-leading-research-2020-3\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"40\" data-uri=\"ce6be15cc44baee5e33fdd7aa39c6f48\">published early data</a> showing that their vaccines generated immune responses without causing serious side effects.</p><p>That could put the companies on track to finish their human trials in October, under the most optimistic scenario. But scientists and public-health experts worry about the push to bring a vaccine to market before data clearly shows it's safe and effective.&#160;</p><p>To assuage these concerns, Moderna and Pfizer — along with US pharmaceutical company Johnson &#38; Johnson and French pharmaceutical company Sanofi — are preparing to release a joint statement that promises to put safety before speed.</p><p>The statement <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-19-vaccine-developers-prepare-joint-pledge-on-safety-standards-11599257729\">could be released as early as next week</a>, according to the Wall Street Journal, which obtained an early copy. In the draft, the companies pledge to only seek emergency FDA approval for their vaccine candidates after final human trials show \"substantial evidence of safety and efficacy.\"</p><p>A sentence from the draft reads: \"We believe this pledge will help ensure public confidence in the COVID-19 vaccines that may ultimately be approved and adherence to the rigorous scientific and regulatory process by which they are evaluated.\"</p><p>Most experts agree there's little hope of a coronavirus vaccine being ready before 2021. But President Donald Trump has suggested otherwise: On Friday, Trump said a coronavirus vaccine would <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/09/04/coronavirus-covid-live-updates-us/\">probably be available for distribution</a> next month, according to The Washington Post. Trump has previously said <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-claims-coronavirus-vaccine-will-be-ready-right-around-election-2020-8\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"20\" data-uri=\"e43bd95d142c574a8ad2ea975d2171da\">a vaccine may become available</a> \"right around\" the presidential election on November 3.</p><p>\"I'm rushing it. I am. I'm pushing everybody,\" Trump&#160;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-claims-coronavirus-vaccine-will-be-ready-right-around-election-2020-8\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"20\" data-uri=\"e43bd95d142c574a8ad2ea975d2171da\">told radio host Geraldo Rivera</a>&#160;in an August 6 interview.</p><p>The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is prepared for that scenario: The agency has asked public health officials in all 50 states to get ready for vaccine distribution by late October. CDC Director Robert Redfield said the goal was to be ahead of the game. The agency expects there to be one or more vaccines ready by November or December.</p><p>Still, public-health experts fear that the Trump administration could rush the timeline before researchers know whether a vaccine produces adverse side effects. Some White House officials believe Trump's reelection prospects <a href=\"https://apnews.com/7cc45cdcb3e53515b8ff4304a4ae5c06\">hinge on whether a vaccine comes to market</a>, the Associated Press reported in July.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f2c32ee7924a13ad872185a?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Trump NIH NIAID coronavirus vaccine\" height=\"1666\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Dr. Barney Graham, Deputy Director at the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institutes of Health, speaks with President Donald Trump during a lab tour on March 3, 2020, in Bethesda, Maryland.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Evan Vucci/Associated Press</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>\"This timeline of the initial deployment at the end of October is deeply worrisome for the politicization of public health and the potential safety ramifications,\" Saskia Popescu, an epidemiologist at the University of Arizona, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/02/health/covid-19-vaccine-cdc-plans.html\">told The New York Times</a> on Wednesday. \"It's hard not to see this as a push for a pre-election vaccine.\"</p><p>Under normal circumstances, vaccines take 10 years or more to develop and approve. The Trump administration's effort to accelerate and fund vaccine research, Operation Warp Speed, hopes to deliver 300 million doses of a safe, effective coronavirus vaccine by at least January 2021. The program is manufacturing six vaccine candidates in large quantities while clinical trials are still ongoing.&#160;</p><p>\"My concern is even with the name Operation Warp Speed, because it suggests that speed is the determining factor as opposed to science,\" Dr. Leana Wen, a public-health professor at George Washington University who previously served as Baltimore's Health Commissioner, previously told Business Insider.</p><p>At <a href=\"https://www.al.com/news/2020/09/uab-expert-says-rushed-covid-vaccine-is-pushing-scientists-into-data-free-zone.html\">an online press conference</a> on Thursday, Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, director of the University of Alabama at Birmingham's Division of Infectious Diseases, said it would take until at least early 2021 to know whether a vaccine was safe and effective.</p><p id=\"IZBGHI76LNFYRJJDOKJYOR7VA4\">\"People have been incredibly concerned about vaccine safety for decades and we've spent countless hours, countless press conferences, countless meetings, trying to assure them that we have done our absolute best to make sure that every vaccine we give is safe,\" Marrazzo said. \"This is not that.

to supply the Los Angeles Police Department with hundreds of all-electric BMW i3s for use in its transportation fleet.

All of them were 2017 models, only had a few thousand miles on them, and were priced at less than $18,000.&#160;</p><p>A representative at New Century BMW confirmed to Business Insider that the cars were indeed from the LAPD's fleet, and that the dealership was selling them as CPO models. Some prices were as low as $15,000, which is a steal for a three-year-old, low-mileage CPO BMW <a href=\"https://www.kbb.com/bmw/i3/2017/#:~:text=The%20Manufacturer's%20Suggested%20Retail%20Price,with%20the%20Range%20Extender%2C%20%2448%2C445.\">that had a starting price of more than $43,000</a>.

He said there was a lot of interest, but also noted that due to the high demand, the dealer will not be accepting phone or online orders. Interested customers must show up in person at the dealership and the cars will be sold on a first-come, first-serve basis.&#160;</p><p>The i3s were part of Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti's push to go greener.&#160;Despite the good intentions, things didn't go according to plan.</p><p>The cars didn't wind up doing much of the outreach they were intended for, a <a href=\"https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2018/01/16/goldstein-investigation-10-million-lapd-electric-bmws-appear-unused-misused/\">CBS Los Angeles investigation</a> from January 2018 found. Instead, they sat, rarely used. If they were used, CBS Los Angeles said they were used for non-police business, such as visiting nail salons and picking folks up for lunch.&#160;</p><p>CBS Los Angeles <a href=\"https://jalopnik.com/that-fleet-of-electric-cars-the-lapd-paid-at-least-2-9-1822197230\">later clarified</a> that, according to numbers it obtained from the LAPD, the entire cost of the i3 and charging-station operation cost $10.2 million, with plans for 300 cars in the fleet.</p><p>In an emailed response to Business Insider, an LAPD spokesperson said the department is not selling the i3s. Rather, they said the cars' leases had expired and that's why they're being resold by the leasing company.</p><p>\"The 50 vehicles were turned in by us at the end of the leasing period per the contract,\" the spokesperson said.</p><p>So if you're in the Southern California region and you're looking for a cheap EV, keep your eyes on New Century BMW's inventory list. Once that new shipment comes in, it'll probably go fast.&#160;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/lapd-selling-fleet-bmw-i3-cheap-ev-electric-vehicle-california-2020-9'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=msjK1YYD0lI:aHH7xCD4Zdc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=msjK1YYD0lI:aHH7xCD4Zdc:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=msjK1YYD0lI:aHH7xCD4Zdc:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=msjK1YYD0lI:aHH7xCD4Zdc:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=msjK1YYD0lI:aHH7xCD4Zdc:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=msjK1YYD0lI:aHH7xCD4Zdc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=msjK1YYD0lI:aHH7xCD4Zdc:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=msjK1YYD0lI:aHH7xCD4Zdc:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/msjK1YYD0lI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 05 Sep 2020 12:04:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f5297f77ed0ee001e25da55?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"257572a0e3cabd65135ea73152e630ed","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn92@2020_4/2020/09/06/02-59-50-957_5d2cec67f5d9ebda.webp","destWidth":2222,"destHeight":1666,"sourceBytes":217770,"destBytes":217770,"author":"klee@businessinsider.com (Kristen Lee)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5f5297bae6ff30001d4e73c1?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn38@2020_4/2020/09/06/02-59-54-327_c3a253959fb1e32b.webp","https://i.insider.com/5f5297bb7ed0ee001e25da54?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn29@2020_4/2020/09/06/02-59-56-798_aaee954f874339a4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn78@2020_1/2020/09/06/02-59-58-308_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=msjK1YYD0lI:aHH7xCD4Zdc:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn93@2020_3/2020/09/06/02-59-55-552_d867a8519b94d1af.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=msjK1YYD0lI:aHH7xCD4Zdc:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn26@2020_4/2020/09/06/02-59-54-977_80fed14b7baba948.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn60@2020_6/2020/09/06/02-59-52-353_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=msjK1YYD0lI:aHH7xCD4Zdc:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn37@2020_4/2020/09/06/02-59-59-838_acfe5122f762bdbf.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/msjK1YYD0lI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn55@2020_2/2020/09/06/02-59-44-250_87b8d5471c494450.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599361164654},{"createdTime":"2020-09-06 10:59:24","updatedTime":"2020-09-06 10:59:24","title":"Kentucky GOP Rep.

There were people around him who could have caused him harm, but as soon as they showed any sign of retreat or nonaggression, he did not shoot them. He exhibited more restraint than a lot of the police videos I've seen.\"</p><p>Local authorities charged Rittenhouse with first-degree intentional homicide, first-degree reckless homicide, and a misdemeanor charge of possession of a deadly weapon following the August 25 shooting. Rittenhouse, <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/kyle-rittenhouse-who-shot-kenosha-protesters-was-obsessed-with-cops-2020-8\">who previously attended a rally for the president and expressed support for Blue Lives Matter</a>, reportedly shot the first victim after the man threw a plastic bag at him, according to <a

of the incident shows a crowd chased a person believed to be Rittenhouse</a> before an ensuing struggle that ended when Rittenhouse fired his semiautomatic weapon at two people in close range, fatally wounding one of them.</p><p>Rittenhouse wouldn't be arrested until the following day.</p><p>\"He was fulfilling his obligation to retreat, and then he fell down, and these, one tried to attack him with a skateboard, another pulled a handgun on him, another tried to jump on him with his foot, and he responded in self-defense,\" Massie said in the interview with radio host Tom Roten.</p><p>\"I would not convict him of a single one of these charges,\" Massie added.</p><p>As Insider previously noted, Rittenhouse told the conservative outlet The Daily Caller he traveled to Kenosha from Illinois to protect businesses amid chaotic anti-racism demonstrations in the city that occurred following the police shooting of 29-year-old <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/category/jacob-blake\">Jacob Blake</a> in the city.</p><p>Massie also said Thursday that he was \"not as aware of that situation\" of Blake as he was as Rittenhouse, who was shot multiple times by police in the back on August 23, which sparked the events in Kenosha that lead up to the shootings two days later.</p><p>\"It needs to be reviewed, everybody gets a trial,\" Massie said of the police shooting of Blake.</p><p>When asked about Rittenhouse and the president's refusal to condemn the actions of his supporters, like Rittenhouse, in an interview earlier this week, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-law-enforcement-and-the-rule-of-law-2020-8\">Trump was \"on the side of law enforcement and the rule of law</a>.\" On Monday, the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-defends-kyle-rittenhouse-charged-with-homicide-in-kenosha-2020-8\">president defended Rittenhouse at a press conference</a>.</p><p>As Insider's Kelly McLaughlin noted, <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/kenosha-suspect-kyle-rittenhouse-right-wing-symbol-2020-9\">experts have said the president's refusal to condemn the accused Kenosha killer could ratchet up tensions</a>, as the right continues to view Rittenhouse as a symbol for their cause in favor of gun rights and against the anti-racism protests.</p><p>\"That was an interesting situation,\" Trump said on Monday. \"He was trying to get away from them, I guess, it looks like, and he fell, and then they very violently attacked him.\"</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/massie-defended-rittenhouse-showed-great-restraint-2020-9'>Business Insider</a></div><div

the year living south of the border — except, of course, for this particular year amid the pandemic. So instead of sampling tequila in its birthplace, I reached out to top tequila experts in Mexico and beyond to unearth their favorites.</p>\n<div id=\"slideshow\">\n\tBut first, let's dispel a few tequila misconceptions.\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5eb04af4204ad30429090526?format=jpeg\" alt=\"tequila expert Iliana Partida\" height=\"3000\" width=\"4000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Iliana Partida, tequila expert.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Iliana Partida</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>More often than not, we associate the word \"tequila\" with bad decisions followed by painful mornings. Well, it might surprise you know that the tequila of your past was, simply put, not tequila. And until you've had the real deal, you don't know what you're missing.&#160;</p><p>\"Great tequila starts with great agave,\" tequila expert Iliana Partida told Business Insider. Agave is the raw material for tequila. \"First, you want to make sure that your tequila is 100% de agave, which means that all of the alcohol in the tequila is distilled from the agave plant.\" Partida is a fourth generation master distiller at Tres Agaves, based in Jalisco, Mexico.&#160;</p><p>What you drank in college was definitely not 100% de agave. That tequila, called mixto, can have as little at 51% of alcohol coming from agave. The other 49% comes from other alcohols &#8212; and usually the cheap stuff &#8212; which is why you may not have fond memories of drinking it.</p>\n\tBut it can't be just any agave.\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5eb04b76e3c3fb072e028ae5?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Juan Bonilla, CEO of Juan Bonilla Imports\" height=\"3648\" width=\"4864\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Juan Bonilla, tequila expert\n<p class=\"copyright\">Juan Bonilla</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>In order for it to be pure tequila, it must be produced from the Blue Agave plant, and a plant that has matured for a minimum of six years. \"The optimum maturing time is nine years, but still the best tequilas are made with agaves that are at least six years in the ground,\" said Juan Bonilla, CEO of Juan Bonilla Imports, an Atlanta-based company dedicated to importing and distributing tequila. Bonilla grew up with tequila in his blood. His family has owned agave farms for generations in Mexico.</p><p>Similar to Champagne, tequila can only truly be called \"tequila\" when it comes from one of the five designated states in Mexico that have the government designation to make and produce it. The most well-known tequila state is Jalisco, which is where tequila was born.&#160;</p><p>After harvesting, the agave undergoes a distilling process and then is aged in barrels, steel or oak, to produce its four different types: Blanco, Reposado, Anejo, and Extra Anejo. Blanco tequila is the youngest tequila, meaning that it is aged for less than 60 days. Sometimes it is bottled immediately after distillation. Reposado tequila is typically aged from 60 days to one year. Anejo, which means \"vintage,\" is aged from one to three years, while Extra Anejo is aged four years.</p>\n\tAs for tasting tequila, the experience is quite similar to a wine or whiskey tasting.\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/55588eeaeab8eaa32fc4f734?format=jpeg\" alt=\"tequila\" height=\"2332\" width=\"3110\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Shots are not the proper way to taste tequila.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Reuters</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>There is a \"proper\" way &#8212; and no, it's not in a shot. Tequilas are always best when sipped, usually neat, to get the raw flavors of the spirit. \"Tequila is known to have 600 different aromas,\" said Javier Moreno Gomez, Tequila &#38; Wine Sommelier at Grand Residences Riviera Cancun, a luxury resort in Cancun. \"Some of them include citrus, mint, floral, honey, oak, almond, vanilla, butterscotch, chocolate, among others.\" The basic tasting method for tequila is: swirl, sniff, sip, swallow.</p><p>So now, without further ado <strong>and in no particular order</strong>, here are 13 of the best tequila brands out there, according to our experts.</p>\n\t1. Don Nacho\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5eb04c8fe3c3fb07cc393903?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Don Nacho tequila Añejo\" height=\"3000\" width=\"4000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Añejo.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Tequila Don Nacho</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>The family that produces the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=35871X943606&#38;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdrizly.com%2Fliquor-brands%2Fdon-nacho%2Fb3033\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\">Don Nacho</a> tequilas have been harvesting agaves for more than two generations. They are one the largest producers of agave in Mexico. \"[The family] gives agaves to a lot of other tequila companies, but they harvest the best for their own,\" said Bonilla. \"[Don Nacho] is 100% de agave with no additives. The taste is superb.\"</p><p>Don Nacho has two lines of tequila: Premiere and Extra Premiere. The Premiere has Blanco and Reposado, while the Extra Premiere has Blanco, Reposado, and Anejo. This year they will add an Extra Anejo to their Extra Premiere line.</p><p>&#160;</p>\n\t2. La Cava de Don Samuel\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5eb0617c204ad310b055bd19?format=jpeg\" alt=\"La Cava de Don Samuel tequila\" height=\"730\" width=\"974\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>La Cava de Don Samuel Reposado tequila.\n<p class=\"copyright\">La Cava de Don Samuel</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>From the small highland town of Atotonilco in Jalisco comes this extraordinary line of tequila.&#160;</p><p>\"Don Samuel was one of the biggest commercial entrepreneurs in the town,\" said Bonilla. \"In 2007 he created a special production of around 10,000 bottles of Reposado tequila. This reserve is so unique, and there are not that many on the market. It must be tried.\"</p>\n\t3. Don Fernando\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5eb04d96cdfd48024460e2b3?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Don Fernando blanco tequila\" height=\"702\" width=\"936\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Tequila blanco.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Don Fernando Facebook</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>Don Fernando tequila is grown and produced in the lowlands of Jalisco, which gives it a dry flavor. \"This gives it a very subtle taste,\" said Bonilla. \"The location brings a lot of natural spring water into the mix, which is just amazing.\"</p><p>Don Fernando has a regular line of tequila, which produces Reposado and Blanco. They also have a premium line, which includes Anejo and Extra Anejo.</p>\n\t4. Tres Agaves Anejo\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5eb04e0348d92c0c347fbbe5?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Tres Agaves Anejo tequila\" height=\"1332\" width=\"1776\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Tres Agaves Anejo.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Dustin Smith</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>\"I always sip Anejo with some chocolates, berries, or nuts around to snack on when I do &#8212; maybe some water, too, so I don't dehydrate myself,\" said Partida. \"I just love the combination of flavors &#8212; the caramel and vanilla from the Anejo with the sweet and bitter combinations of the snacks.\"</p>\n\t5. Fortaleza Blanco\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5eb04e82204ad3066e580559?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Fortaleza blanco tequila\" height=\"4800\" width=\"3200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Fortaleza Blanco.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Tequila Fortaleza</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>\"A tried and true brand, the brand's commitment to heritage shows itself in the consistently pungent agave flavor that is good enough to enjoy neat, and powerful enough to stand out in cocktails,\" said tequila expert, Tess Lampert. Lampert is a New York-based educator and writer about agave spirits. She consults with top tequila brands and restaurants and organizes events across the nation to educate consumers, trade, and media on all aspects of agave.</p>\n\t6. Arette Blanco\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5eb062a3fc593d09ef549472?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Arette Blanco tequila\" height=\"1286\" width=\"948\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Arette Blanco.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Tequila Arette</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>\"A lot of folks have gone down the path of considering <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=EHFxW6yx8Uo&#38;mid=2025&#38;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Farette-artesanal-blanco-tequila%2F528374%3F\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\">Blanco tequilas</a> the best for 'shots.'

Originally from Mexico, he leads the bar program at Ghost Donkey in New York, which was named Imbibe magazine's cocktail bar of 2020. \"Her Blanco has a nice velvet palate complemented by nice earthy and herbaceous notes.\"</p>\n\t10.

Tequila Mi Tierra\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5ef616f85af6cc6c045b97a6?format=jpeg\" alt=\"mi tierra silver 1\" height=\"720\" width=\"390\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Tequila Mi Tierra tequila.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Tequila Mi Tierra</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>Tequila Mi Tierra is a very small, boutique producer. The extra attention and focus allows them to be exceptional across the board from their blanco to their extra anejo.<br /><br />\"The water in the region [in Jalisco] gives a unique touch,\" said Bonilla. \"The natural flavors from the soil can be detected giving a peppery sensation. There is a great finish and aroma. Both the reposado, the anejo, and the extra anejo have an outstanding nose.\"<br /><br />Bonilla recommends all for sipping, but says that both the blanco and reposado can be used for mixing.

While the last eruption was more than 22,000 years ago, the volcano's red soil fosters beautiful blue agave today, and it's from these agaves that Santera is born.&#160;</p><p>The Santera Reposado is aged in American oak up to seven months and has hints of that oaky flavor, along with touches of cinnamon. The Anejo is aged up to 16 months and threads in notes of leather and tobacco.</p><p>\"Santera is an excellent example of brick oven-roasted agave being used to craft a tequila,\" said Freddie Sarkis, chief cocktail officer at Liquor Lab in New York City. \"It is elegant with a peppery finish.\"</p><p>He recommends Santera for sipping, but the Blanco is also bright and citrusy when mixed in cocktails.</p>\n\t13. Coça Pura Plata\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f52813f7ed0ee001e25d9b9?format=jpeg\" alt=\"COCA PURA BOTTLE SHOT CLOSE UP\" height=\"1313\" width=\"1033\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Coca Pura.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of Coca Pura</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>Blanco tequilas have the reputation for being harsh on the palate, but this doesn't necessarily have to be the reality. There are plenty of fantastic Blanco tequilas that are delicious and smooth as sipping tequilas. For Anthony Baker, cocktail professor at Momentum Mixology, <a href=\"https://cocapura.com/\">Co&#231;a Pura Plata</a> is one to know.</p><p>\"It is a blanco tequila with a higher-than-normal ABV &#8212; 90 proof &#8212; yet extremely smooth,\" he said. \"These qualities make it perfect for boozy tequila cocktails, and even good enough to just sip.</p><p>Baker said the reason behind the smoothness is due to the aging process. The tequila is aged in a barrel for just under two months, which means it's just as smooth as a Reposado, but can still legally be called a Blanco.</p><p>\"In fact, it's so lovely and smooth, I've used it in an espresso martini-esque cocktail, and it came out absolutely perfect. These types of cocktails typically call for vodka, but I needed something clean with a fuller body to it.\"</p>\n</div><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

There's a hidden risk to consider, and it's not a virus.</p><p>If you post about your outing, <a href=\"https://www.eater.com/21409384/dining-out-shame-keeps-restaurant-patrons-off-instagram-during-the-pandemic\">prepare to face judgment</a> from friends, followers, or some random person across the country. No, it doesn't matter if you're following all recommended safety measures. To some, there's simply no ethical way to go out to a restaurant, and they've found comfort in isolation and misery, holding it as proof that they're getting through the pandemic \"the right way.\"</p><p>To be fair, there's a lot to be miserable about living in America during Covid-19. Over <a href=\"https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fcases-updates%2Fcases-in-us.html#cases\">180,000 people dead</a>, dwindling and insufficient economic support, and dithering leadership at the highest levels. This has made for little clarity on best practices for reducing the spread of the virus. People have been left to make their own calls on how to behave responsibly.</p><p>Social pressure can be a useful tool in keeping everyone on track, especially given the void in leadership. Seeing everyone else wear their masks can be the reminder that you need to throw yours on. But it can also go too far, when it becomes less about promoting rational behavior and more about signaling who's handling the crisis better than others.&#160;</p><h2>The partisan pandemic</h2><p>As with everything else, the response to the pandemic is largely divided on political lines. The right wants to largely ignore the outbreak, quickly rallying against mask protocols and pushing to reopen the economy as soon as possible. In April, Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said \"<a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2020/04/21/texas-dan-patrick-economy-coronavirus/\">there are more important things than living</a>\" while praising the state's moves towards re-opening, tacitly offering up his life for the economic future of the country. President Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1241935285916782593\">tweeted</a>: \"WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF.\" The protests of masks and closures align with basic reactionary ideological lines, dismissing science to \"own the libs\" and prove a point.</p><p>Meanwhile, the left adopted a cautious approach while questions swirled about what measures are actually effective. Are masks harmful or helpful? Can we jog outside? What about surface contact? Many chose to stay locked up inside alone, minimizing outside contact and lowering the risk of infection. All alone in isolation with nowhere to go, there was now plenty of time to worry about other people's behavior and whether it matched your own standards. Additionally, the right's brash ignorance led to a lack of nuance when it came to a serious conversation about a responsible return to society.</p><p>Contrary to much of the left's outcries,there <em>are</em> areas where reopening seems possible, namely New York City, which of course suffered one of the worst outbreaks in the world. Cases are now down to less than <a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page\">300 a day</a>, compared to over 5,000 daily in April. The<a href=\"https://twitter.com/NYGovCuomo/status/1300094116735447040?s=20\"> infection rate is under 1%</a>. So what's working for New York? Masks are worn indoors, testing is widely available, and restaurants and bars have appropriately-distanced outdoor seating.</p><p>And yet, social media posts showing socially-distanced, rule-following public outings are often met with digital finger-wagging, deeming anyone not holed up in their apartment as selfish, uncompassionate, and irresponsible.&#160;</p><p>Even worse are well-intentioned but <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/v74az9/the-viral-study-about-runners-spreading-coronavirus-is-not-actually-a-study\">misleading studies</a> on the spread of the virus. Everyone has become a keyboard epidemiologist since March, and these comments only heighten anxiety. I suspect it's rooted in a desire for some agency in a time when we seemingly have none.</p><p>While the right dismissed facts as a sign of loyalty to the president, the other side is also overlooking science to signal a moral superiority, shaming those who are choosing to venture out of complete solitude while still behaving safely.&#160;</p><p>So, let's look at the facts of the situation: the odds of indoor transmission are <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jvchamary/2020/06/30/face-mask-outdoors-coronavirus/#725ffcc81822\">18.7 times greater </a>than in open air. A <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html\">study of 7,300 cases</a> in China found just one was connected to outdoor transmission. Research suggests that the likelihood of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/28/well/live/whats-the-risk-of-catching-coronavirus-from-a-surface.html\">surface transmission </a>has been <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/laninf/PIIS1473-3099(20)30561-2.pdf\">exaggerated</a> and is actually quite unlikely. Washing your hands regularly and avoiding touching your face should do the trick. Reducing your social circle to a smaller \"quarantine pod\" has also been <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/quarantine-bubbles-when-done-right-limit-coronavirus-risk-and-help-fight-loneliness\">shown to be rather effective.</a>&#160;</p><h2>Outside looking in</h2><p>The restaurant industry is among those hardest hit by the pandemic. While <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/23/nyregion/outdoor-dining-new-york.html\">over 10,000 restaurants in NYC </a>have set up outdoor seating and increased takeout, they are still serving only a fraction of their regular number of customers. The federal paycheck protection program simply won't be enough to keep these restaurants above water, especially once outdoor seating is no longer an option during the winter. Without a more substantial bailout of the industry, the only way these restaurants and bars have any chance of survival is if they're patronized.&#160;</p><p>My biggest question for people quick to judge others for going out is: what are you waiting for? While there have been positive updates on a vaccine, it still could be years away, if we're lucky enough to ever have one. In the meantime, in places with deflating case numbers, we must find a manageable way to live.</p><p>The cost of the pandemic isn't just Covid-19 cases and financial burdens; there's also a mental toll. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/05/opinion/coronavirus-mental-illness-depression.html\">More than 1 in 3 Americans reported symptoms of an anxiety disorder this year, compared to 1 in 12 last year, and over 53% believe the pandemic has taken a toll on their mental health.</a> Seeing friends can help ease the existential dread surrounding us, and if one can do so safely and without endangering others, why shouldn't they?</p><p>Naturally, ignoring all safety protocols is more dangerous than being overly cautious, but snidely commenting on Instagram posts won't cure the virus either. There's no prize for who can be the loneliest person, and ignorance can swing both ways. Don't let the reactionary right push you into a paranoid furor, and likewise, don't shame those who are safely trying to make it through this. It doesn't mean we're \"over it,\" just that we need to adapt based on the current situation. Like it or not, we're all in this together.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/science-safe-social-covid-19-pandemic-shaming-outdoor-virus-2020-9'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=izQIQtor6Po:wbUhPOlJhFY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=izQIQtor6Po:wbUhPOlJhFY:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=izQIQtor6Po:wbUhPOlJhFY:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=izQIQtor6Po:wbUhPOlJhFY:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=izQIQtor6Po:wbUhPOlJhFY:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=izQIQtor6Po:wbUhPOlJhFY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=izQIQtor6Po:wbUhPOlJhFY:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=izQIQtor6Po:wbUhPOlJhFY:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/izQIQtor6Po\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 05 Sep 2020 13:00:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f527eda7ed0ee001e25d9aa?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"81a82becc5d0a2c6cd5b4f9b8e19592f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn34@2020_6/2020/09/06/02-59-44-278_b828baa81459ae1e.webp","destWidth":910,"destHeight":682,"sourceBytes":65342,"destBytes":65342,"author":"nfriedman@businessinsider.com (Noah Friedman)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5f527ee2e6ff30001d4e731f?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn13@2020_4/2020/09/06/02-59-55-661_fec53e99ab69b339.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn78@2020_1/2020/09/06/02-59-58-308_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=izQIQtor6Po:wbUhPOlJhFY:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn19@2020_6/2020/09/06/02-59-56-701_2e212b7ac56598c0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=izQIQtor6Po:wbUhPOlJhFY:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn28@2020_4/2020/09/06/02-59-50-171_d685b46031a90576.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn60@2020_6/2020/09/06/02-59-52-353_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=izQIQtor6Po:wbUhPOlJhFY:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn90@2020_5/2020/09/06/02-59-58-579_3b027cfcf39df5a5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/izQIQtor6Po":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn22@2020_4/2020/09/06/02-59-58-660_5896838175cdf76e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599361164661},{"createdTime":"2020-09-06 10:59:24","updatedTime":"2020-09-06 10:59:24","title":"Photos from 10 countries around the world show why most Americans say they are 'embarrassed' by the US coronavirus response","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/photos-us-has-the-worst-coronavirus-response-in-the-world-2020-9","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f4ec261e6ff30001d4e680c?format=jpeg\" alt=\"new zealand and china under control \" height=\"600\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Infection rates in China and New Zealand are so low that people can get cheek-to-cheek without risking much.

strength coach, and international bestselling author.</li>\n<li>Despite its casual references in pop culture, Morin explains that gaslighting is a serious term in therapy, and a problem that many victims struggle to recognize due to the nature of the abuse.</li>\n<li>Morin says that someone who is gaslighting you will deny things that you know to be true, make you question your own memories, and weaponize your displays of emotions against you.</li>\n<li><strong data-stringify-type=\"bold\">If you're struggling, call the SAMHSA National Helpline, 1-800-662-HELP (4357), or reach out to the

thinking they're losing touch with reality. Over time, the victim often grows convinced that they can't trust their own judgment.</p><p>The term gaslight stems from a <a href=\"https://www.concordtheatricals.com/p/2380/angel-street-gaslight\">play in the 1930s</a> where the husband manipulated small aspects of the environment — such as dimming the gaslights — to convince his wife that she was delusional.&#160;&#160;</p><p>Now, gaslighting is frequently referenced in pop culture — perhaps you've heard the song \"Gaslighter\" by The Chicks (formerly the Dixie Chicks).</p><p>While it's often referenced in a fun manner in the media, in the therapy office, it's a serious problem. Quite often, by the time a victim seeks professional help, they've often endured a painful existence for quite some time. Most of them have spent years thinking they were \"going crazy.\" And for some of them, seeking treatment only reinforces the idea that there is something seriously wrong with them.</p><p>If someone can identify that they're being gaslighted early on, it could prevent years — maybe even decades — of manipulation. Psychoanalyst Robin Stern has written a book called <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Gaslight-Effect-Survive-Manipulation-Control/dp/0767924452/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1599099855&sr=1-3p;sr=1-3\">\"The Gaslight Effect</a>,\" which outlines signs that you're being gaslighted.</p><p>Her research is in line with what I've seen firsthand as a therapist. Here are the top signs that someone is gaslighting you:</p><h2><strong style=\"color: #000000;\">1. They deny things you know to be true</strong></h2><p>You might think someone who is gaslighting you would only lie about big things that they could cover up or hide. But that's not the case.</p><p>They often lie about all things big and small just to throw you off. They might deny something that just happened — and then insist your memory is \"off.\" They may lie about what you did yesterday and then insist you are \"crazy\" if you don't remember doing it.</p><h2><strong style=\"color: #000000;\">2. They pretend to be concerned for your psychological well-being</strong></h2><p>A gaslighter will often say things like, \"That's disturbing you can't remember where you put your purse.\"</p><p>In reality, they probably hid it from you. They'll constantly act like you're fragile or that you're not in your \"right mind\" so that you'll question yourself.</p><h2><strong style=\"color: #000000;\">3. They isolate you from other people</strong></h2><p>They will tell you that your loved ones are talking about you behind your back. And they will do all they can to separate you from your friends and family.</p><p>They may even reach out to people without your knowledge to tell them that you're having some problems lately. This may lead to people asking if you're OK — which could reinforce your fear that there's something wrong with you.</p><h2><strong style=\"color: #000000;\">4. They minimize your feelings and use them against you</strong></h2><p>Whether you express sadness, anger, or fear, they'll use it against you. They'll tell you that crying is \"proof that you're crazy\" or getting upset is evidence that you are \"an emotional wreck.\"</p><p>They will insist that all of your emotions are unreasonable and irrational. You might find yourself constantly apologizing for your feelings.</p><h2><strong style=\"color: #000000;\">5. They insist getting help is proof you aren't stable</strong></h2><p>If you talk to your therapist or get hospitalized due to the emotional distress of the situation, they'll insist they were right when they said you were mentally unstable.</p><p>They'll likely say you're beyond help anyway or that mental health professionals can't \"fix you.\" They may even reach out to professionals to tell them that you seem confused lately, in an effort to make sure you don't get effective treatment for what's really going on — you're being manipulated.</p><h2><strong>How to get help</strong></h2><p>It's impossible to feel psychologically well when someone is constantly trying to convince you that you are mentally ill, or that you can't trust your own judgment or memory.</p><p>So the key to feeling better usually involves getting away from the perpetrator. Being away from the person, even for a short period of time, often helps victims see that they are OK.</p><p>If you suspect you might be the victim of gaslighting, reach out for help. Talk to a therapist, either online or in-person, about your distress.&#160;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/what-gaslighting-is-and-5-signs-someone-is-gaslighting-you-2020-9'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=5xJfQfNN-j0:p-txnuoYa4k:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=5xJfQfNN-j0:p-txnuoYa4k:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=5xJfQfNN-j0:p-txnuoYa4k:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=5xJfQfNN-j0:p-txnuoYa4k:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=5xJfQfNN-j0:p-txnuoYa4k:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=5xJfQfNN-j0:p-txnuoYa4k:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=5xJfQfNN-j0:p-txnuoYa4k:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=5xJfQfNN-j0:p-txnuoYa4k:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/5xJfQfNN-j0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 05 Sep 2020 14:00:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f527ea2e6ff30001d4e731e?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"555fe54b0c75333e28fefe7d230b7079","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn100@2020_1/2020/09/06/02-59-50-801_828c508213b884cb.webp","destWidth":1885,"destHeight":1414,"sourceBytes":95104,"destBytes":95104,"author":"insider@insider.com (Amy Morin)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5f494d4b7ffa48002894ceb2?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn14@2020_3/2020/09/06/02-59-56-741_4a0a858d54432288.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn78@2020_1/2020/09/06/02-59-58-308_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=5xJfQfNN-j0:p-txnuoYa4k:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn66@2020_3/2020/09/06/02-59-55-513_d030dc6e8a3c4928.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=5xJfQfNN-j0:p-txnuoYa4k:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn12@2020_2/2020/09/06/02-59-51-973_0016d3775c99a40b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn60@2020_6/2020/09/06/02-59-52-353_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=5xJfQfNN-j0:p-txnuoYa4k:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn38@2020_5/2020/09/06/03-00-01-406_490d547495b020f4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/5xJfQfNN-j0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn67@2020_5/2020/09/06/02-59-51-405_11dbfab6fb780645.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599361164616},{"createdTime":"2020-09-06 10:59:24","updatedTime":"2020-09-06 10:59:24","title":"All the best sales and deals to shop for Labor Day weekend 2020","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-labor-day-sales","description":"<p class=\"financial-disclaimer\"><i>When you buy through our links, we may earn money from our affiliate partners. <a href=\"https://www.insider-inc.com/commerce-on-insider-inc/\">Learn more.</a></i></p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f4fecb7e6ff30001d4e6b3d?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Labor Day Sales (everything you need to know) 4x3\" height=\"1250\" width=\"1667\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Wayfair;

class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>Charge, a British startup now owned by Cannondale, wants to simplify the bike-buying process.&#160;</li>\n<li>I tested out their high-end model, a $2,300 behemoth designed to handle off-road trails.&#160;</li>\n<li>It's the most fun I've had on two wheels since childhood, but just not a feasible purchase for my current living situation.&#160;</li>\n<li>If you have the space &#8212; and funds &#8212; it might be the best socially distant recreation option possible, and it's actually in stock (<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/united-states-is-running-out-of-bikes-during-coronavirus-pandemic-2020-5\">unlike many other bikes)</a>.&#160;</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>There's no real reason to own an electric bike as tough as a tank, that glides over asphalt as easily as gravel or mud and bounds up hills with no struggle.</p><p>But, if you can afford it, there's also no reason <em>not</em> to.</p><p>At $2,300, the Charge XC — the heaviest duty member of the British company's three-bike lineup meant to have a choice for everyone — is a seemingly perfect fit for the weekend warrior or a cycle-curious explorer. It's also great for a slightly out-of-shape journalist like me, who just wants to tear up some dirt trails to blow off steam.</p><p>I took out a fully loaded version of the bike for spins around New York City to see how well it weathered rough asphalt, bumpy bike lanes, gravel paths, muddy trails, and any other obstacles I could find.</p><h2><strong>Unlike some new bikes, the Charge XC was a breeze to put together — even in a tiny apartment</strong></h2><p>The box is heavy but has punched-out handles like any good box should. It also has handy pull cords that rip along perforated edges, easily exposing the bike and its parts.</p><p>A cardboard stand — no plastic here! — helped keep the bike upright while installing the front wheel and other parts. Still, it's an easier job with two people.</p><p>\"A gigantic challenge in design, really more than the bike, was to get rid of all the plastic, the zip ties, all the foam,\" Charge founder Nick Larsen told me in an interview. \"That might seem like something that would be normal to most people — but if you saw the equivalent of what a bike would normally come like, it was a huge undertaking.\"</p><p>From the packaging to the integrated battery, the sleek design made it clear how much thought went into the bike's creation. Larsen told me many of his design peers from school ended up at Dyson, the legendary British design shop, and the inspiration for Charge bikes was closely linked.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f529678e6ff30001d4e73b7?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Charge XC electric review bike\" height=\"3024\" width=\"4032\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Graham Rapier / Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>\"Bikes are a little bit like computers used to be,\" he said. \"They're complicated to understand and a bit of an intimidating purchase. That's what computers were before Apple and others made the user experience more simple.\"</p><p>Within 30 minutes, it was ready to ride (but still needed to charge). Within a few hours I was ready go go explore — and had some hills in mind to put it through the gauntlet.</p><h2><strong>First impression: the smoothest ride I've been on in a while</strong></h2><p>This thing is like riding a motorcycle no matter how high the seat is set thanks to a 60 mm handlebar rise. The handlebars are also incredibly wide, which is nice for off-road control, but I was hesitant to squeeze through the gaps in traffic road bikes can go without a problem, but was never uncomfortably hunched over.</p><p>And when the motor kicks in, it's smooth sailing. It has three settings, from \"eco\" mode's slight boost up to the near-whiplash-inducing \"sport\" mode.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f529676e6ff30001d4e73b6?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Charge XC electric review bike\" height=\"3024\" width=\"4032\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Graham Rapier / Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>I set off with two targets in mind: the oldest bike path in the United States, and the only forest in Brooklyn.</p><p>First up was Ocean Parkway. This bustling road was designed by the architectural duo behind Central Park and other famous US green spaces, and has two grassy malls flanking its lanes from Prospect Park all the way down to Coney Island. It was one of the first true \"highways\" in the United States, and a few years after its construction it also became home to the first true bike path in the country — it's only seen a spattering of maintenance since.</p><p>Jokes aside, the bike lane is notorious for bumps after years of water, ice, tree roots and other forces have buckled the asphalt. Charge XC's massive Goodyear tires and fork suspension handled the rough riding with ease.</p><p>Its plastic fenders also helped keep disgusting gutter water from splashing up at intersections. However, for all their utility, the fenders shake like crazy over the smallest bumps, rattling loudly nearly constantly — and I'm not the first person to notice it. These seemed easily removable, and are a small part of otherwise perfect bike.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f5296717ed0ee001e25da4a?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Charge XC electric review bike\" height=\"3024\" width=\"4032\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A better look at the bike&#39;s tough tires, disc brakes, and finicky fenders.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Graham Rapier / Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h2><strong>Up hills and through mud where the bike truly shined</strong></h2><p>The Charge XC isn't a mountain bike, despite having a frame that easily could. Its numerous warnings against attempting jumps seemed funny at first, until I realized just how tempting it would be to shoot for a dangerous amount of air.</p><p>The bike didn't skip a beat over loose gravel or puddles of mud that would be impossible to find traction on with many other bikes. Even on steep up-hill climbs, I lost balance before its motor ever spun the back wheel. With so much power underfoot, it's easy to forget to change gears sometimes too.</p><p>Down the other side of a hill is where things got interesting. I'd never used disc brakes before this very moment. I'm here to testify that the hydraulic disc brakes on the Charge work instantaneously, and well. In hindsight the near incident was hilarious, and goes to show no matter how much energy the 55-pound bike and its rider can muster, things can stop quickly.</p><p>After an hour or so of taking the bike on every different earthen path I could find in the park's winding ravine, I felt the bike had been adequately put through the paces.</p><p>It was when I got home that I realized an important qualifier for potential customers: the weight.

She feels strongly about that for her own safety as well as that of her students and two youngest sons, who attend a high school in the district.&#160;</p><p>However, Landry's school district decided on Monday to do a phased reopening, with all grades slated to be back by October 13.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f4fb941e6ff30001d4e69ee?format=jpeg\" alt=\"kerri landry\" height=\"3024\" width=\"4032\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Kerri Landry, a teacher in the Coventry School District in Rhode Island, with her youngest sons.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of Kerri Landry</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Landry's school isn't exceptional: Research shows that air quality is a major issue in tens of thousands of schools across the US. A June report from the <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/assets/710/707374.pdf\">Government Accountability Office estimated</a> that 41% of districts nationwide, or 36,000 schools, need major upgrades to their HVAC systems.</p><p>Before the pandemic, poor air quality in schools was problematic because it impeded kids' learning and lowered their test scores. But now, faulty HVAC systems are even more concerning since they could facilitate the spread of the coronavirus.&#160;</p><h2><strong>The link between coronavirus transmission and HVAC systems</strong></h2><p>The coronavirus most commonly spreads via respiratory droplets emitted when an infected person coughs, sneezes, speaks, or breathes heavily. But research suggests it can also be airborne, meaning the virus gets transmitted via aerosols: tiny particles or droplets that can hang in the air, potentially <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/coronavirus-resource-center\">for hours at a time</a>.&#160;&#160;</p><p>Either way, most instances of documented coronavirus transmission have occurred in <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-risk-higher-tight-indoor-spaces-with-little-air-flow-2020-5\">tight, poorly ventilated indoor spaces</a>; one <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.28.20029272v2\">study</a> (though not yet peer-reviewed) suggested that a person might be nearly 20 times more likely to spread the coronavirus inside than outside.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5ebc1d66578532025d11d9a5?format=jpeg\" alt=\"FILE PHOTO: Students wearing face masks are seen inside a classroom during a government-organised media tour at a high school as more students returned to campus following the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, in Shanghai, China May 7, 2020.

In one <a href=\"https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/7/20-0764_article\">case study</a>, a single person infected nine others at a restaurant in Guangzhou, China. Epidemiologists found that the strong airflow in the restaurant's air conditioning — and lack of effective filtration and ventilation — likely carried droplets from one table to several others.&#160;</p><p>\"The biggest risk comes from poorly ventilated, crowded environments where people spend a lot of time. Unfortunately, that kind of perfectly describes a lot of schools,\" <a href=\"https://civmin.utoronto.ca/home/about-us/directory/professors/jeffrey-siegel/\">Jeffrey Siegel</a>, a professor of civil engineering at the University of Toronto, told Business Insider.</p><p>To ensure an HVAC system removes coronavirus particles from the air — at a school or elsewhere — it needs have adequate ventilation and filtration, not just circulation. One crucial factor, then, is airflow: the amount of new air that flows through a building. Most buildings should have at least 15 cubic feet per person per minute.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f4fc2247ed0ee001e25d031?format=jpeg\" alt=\"MERV installation\" height=\"5464\" width=\"8192\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Mike Saladino cleans an air duct before installing an HVAC filter at Gold&#39;s Gym in Islip, New York, August 24, 2020.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Al Bello/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Filtration is also key: On commercial HVAC units, filters are rated according to their minimum efficiency reporting value (MERV). Both HEPA and MERV-13 or -14 filters can block most coronavirus particles.</p><h2><strong>Most schools don't have safe indoor air</strong></h2><p>Most US schools don't meet the standards necessary to prevent coronavirus transmission indoors, according to Corey Metzger, who leads the school-reopening task force for The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, or ASHRAE. The group offers a list of <a href=\"https://www.ashrae.org/file%20library/technical%20resources/covid-19/ashrae-reopening-schools-and-universities-c19-guidance.pdf\">HVAC guidelines</a> for schools.&#160;</p><p>\"A large percentage of facilities, if not the majority, don't meet our recommended minimums for ventilation or other operating capabilities,\" Metzger said.</p><p>These standards include proper filter installation, ensuring circulation of outdoor air, and balanced humidity levels.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5ebb322b48d92c2a17674f43?format=jpeg\" alt=\"school class children coronavirus reopen reopening\" height=\"1492\" width=\"2300\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A teacher wears a mask at a private school in Saint-Sebastien-sur-Loire, France, May 12, 2020.\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://www.reutersconnect.com/all?id=tag%3Areuters.com%2C2020%3Anewsml_RC2YMG941C1C&#38;share=true\" target=\"_blank\">Stephane Mahe/Reuters</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Landry's husband, Tom, said these problems certainly persist in the schools where his wife teaches and sons study: Most don't have systems that can support MERV-13 and 14 filters.&#160;</p><p>\"Our schools are very old and [have] antiquated HVAC systems,\" he said. \"The majority of schools in our town don't have any fresh air coming into them at all.\"</p><p>Craig Levis, the Coventry district's superintendent, told Business Insider that the middle school where Landry teaches is his \"primary focus\" in terms of addressing air quality. He said he's hired HVAC specialists to inspect the district's other buildings and help with quick fixes, like placing fans near windows to increase ventilation.</p><p>\"If there are simple things I can do to mitigate the virus, I put a stake in the ground, and that's what we're doing,\" he said.</p><p>Siegel said he's concerned that fall and winter could make air-quality problems in schools even worse, since cold weather will likely lead teachers to close windows, and holding classes outside will be difficult. Plus, Siegel said, indoor heating could dry out the air, enabling viral particles to travel farther and drying out people's mucous membranes, which can weaken immune systems.&#160;</p><h2><strong>What parents can look out for, and what teachers can do</strong></h2><p>Even before the coronavirus hit, poor ventilation in schools created problems for students, primarily due to the buildup of carbon dioxide. Previous studies have shown that high levels of CO2 in classrooms can contribute to poor focus and <a href=\"https://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/article/stuffy-classrooms-may-lower-test-scores\">lower test scores.</a></p><p>But upgrading a school's HVAC system can cost millions of dollars and take months to years.</p><p>Siegel said a few other measures can mitigate the risks of low-quality ventilation systems in the meantime, though. For instance, portable ventilation systems can help filter air in individual classrooms. The filters are loud, but they work.</p><p>\"I don't want anyone to think that I'm saying this is a simple problem, but it is a solvable problem,\" Siegel said.&#160;</p><p>Additionally, although there's no simple, easy, or cheap way to measure coronavirus particles in the air, carbon dioxide can be a \"canary in the coal mine,\" according to Roger Silveira, an air-quality specialist and the facilities director at San Jose's East Side Union High School District. Carbon-dioxide monitors sell for <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/CO2Meter-AZ-0004-Temperature-Relative-Humidity/dp/B001PDGFR8?tag=bisafetynet2-20\">about $100</a>.&#160;</p><p>In a building with good ventilation, CO2 levels should generally stay under 1,100 parts per million, Silveira said.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f4fc2c0e6ff30001d4e6a2e?format=jpeg\" alt=\"CO2 monitor\" height=\"1024\" width=\"821\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A wall-mounted carbon-dioxide meter reads 818 ppm in Walnut Creek, California, September 2, 2019.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Opening windows is another obvious way to mitigate the problem, as is holding classes in larger spaces, like gymnasiums and auditoriums, according to Dr. Tina Tan, an infectious-disease specialist at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine.</p><p>\"I think right now we have to think outside the box,\" Tan said.&#160;</p><p>She also recommends that teachers limit activities involving shouting or singing, since those create <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/08/wear-your-mask-and-stop-talking/615796/\">more potentially virus-laden droplets</a> than ordinary talking.</p><p>Of course, remote learning is likely the safest option for many districts, though it comes with plenty of its own challenges.</p><p>Some districts that are reopening still offer a remote option for that reason; Landry's is one of them. At the moment, she's not sure what to do. Her sons want to go back to school, but both have preexisting respiratory issues. She doesn't want them to have a subpar, remote education, but she's also afraid for their lives.&#160;</p><p>\"It's so difficult as a parent to make this decision — no parent should have to make it,\" Landry said, adding, \"it's like playing Russian roulette.\"</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

would create a recession, economists have debated the \"shape\" of it, with big implications for the future of the economy. Would it be a \"V\" shape, with a rapid recovery, a \"U\" shape, with a softer recovery, or the dreaded \"L\" shape, with no recovery at all?</p><p>Joe Biden weighed in on the matter in a speech on Friday, blaming President Trump for creating an unusual \"K shape.\" He said many Americans thought the country would bounce back economically within months of March's record job losses, but Trump's leadership botched that recovery.&#160;</p><p>\"As a result, economists are starting to call this recession a K-shaped recession, which is a fancy phrase for everything that's wrong with Trump's presidency,\" Biden said. \"What 'K' means is those at the top are seeing things go up, and those are the middle and below are seeing things go down and get worse.\"</p><p>The economists and pundits Biden referred to have surmised the economic recovery is taking the shape of a \"K\" — allowing for those at the top to prosper while sending working class Americans into further debt.&#160;</p><p>Here's what the \"K-shaped\" recovery means, and how that impacts jobs and economic inequality.&#160;</p><h2>What is a 'K' shaped recovery?</h2><p>The US entered a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/us-recession-economy-february-coronavirus-nber-official-data-2020-6\">recession in February</a>, per the National Bureau of Economic Research, ending a record 128-month economic expansion.&#160;</p><p>Economists and analysts use letters like \"V\", \"L\", and \"I\" to describe their projections for the length of the recession and potential recovery, <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/recession-recovery-coronavirus-alphabet-letter-shape-project-economic-when-analysts-2020-3-1029042463#\">Business Insider's Ben Winck reported</a>.</p><p>A \"V-shaped\" recovery, for instance, is the most optimistic, as it suggests economic spending and employment will rapidly decline, but quickly pick back up like a \"V.\" A \"U\" shape is similar but suggest the period of unemployment and low economic activity will remain longer than a \"V\" recovery.&#160;</p><p><a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/recession-recovery-coronavirus-alphabet-letter-shape-project-economic-when-analysts-2020-3-1029042463#\">\"L\" and \"I\"</a>-shaped recovery outlooks are much more dire, suggesting the high unemployment and low spending will have other ramifications, like cause debt defaults and overwhelm health systems.</p><p>A \"K-shaped\" recovery is somewhere between a \"V\" and \"L\" — depending on who you are. Industries like technology, retail, and software services have recovered from the industry and begun re-hiring, while the travel, entertainment, hospitality, and food services industries have continued to decline past March levels.</p><p>\"The pandemic's uneven economic impact on industries and workers has been stark,\" US Chamber of Commerce president Suzanne Clark wrote in a blog post on Thursday, called \"Enter the K-Shaped Recovery.\"</p><h2>What does a 'K' shaped recovery mean for jobs?</h2><p>In March, following the rapid spread of the coronavirus that prompted officials to shut down businesses and schools, the US <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/labor-market-charts-show-bad-march-jobs-report-coronavirus-outlook-2020-4#based-on-the-monthly-survey-of-employers-the-number-of-jobs-in-the-us-fell-by-701000-between-february-and-march-ending-a-113-month-streak-of-net-job-creation-5\">lost 701,000 non-farm jobs</a> and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/us-weekly-jobless-claims-unemployment-filings-record-labor-market-coronavirus-2020-4\">nearly 10 million people</a> filed for jobless claims.&#160;</p><p>While the record job loss hit the travel and hospitality industries, some economists assumed the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/economic-outlook-coronavirus-labor-market-unemployment-rapid-recovery-recession-experts-2020-4\">US would bounce back</a> once businesses reopened. The result would have resulted in a \"V-shaped\" recovery, where unemployment and spending drop sharply but pick back up in a short period of time.&#160;</p><p>But the US has yet to control the virus to the point of safe reopening. The country has the most cumulative infections at more than 6 million, and a resurgence of infections have been tied to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/states-and-cities-slowing-pausing-coronavirus-reopening-plans-2020-6\">hasty restaurant and business reopening</a>.</p><p>The stagnated recovery has meant the restaurant and travel industries have continued to decline, as more and more chains and restaurants have gone <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/restaurant-chains-at-risk-of-bankruptcy-amid-pandemic-2020-8\">bankrupt</a>. While job growth has <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/job-openings-are-down-20-percent-high-wage-growth-lags-2020-9\">picked back up slowly</a>, the unemployment rate is still <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/august-jobs-report-nonfarm-payrolls-unemployment-rate-us-economy-recovery-2020-9\">8.4% nationally</a>.&#160;</p><p>Clark said the financial services sector has already recovered 94% of its pre-pandemic employment, while the leisure and entertainment industries have only brought back 74% of their former workers.

hotel.</li>\n<li>Zero Bond, founded by hospitality magnate Scott Sartiano, is the latest private members&#8217; club on the New York scene, attracting celebrities and athletes.</li>\n<li>At members&#8217; clubs, staff know your name, you can leave belongings with peace of mind, and you&#8217;re always guaranteed a place to sit, unlike a restaurant or bar.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>&#160;</p><p>For centuries, private clubs have been attracting powerful businessmen and dignitaries — often exclusively males — for business and social purposes. Private clubs were extremely popular in London, which, in the late 19th century, had more than 400 clubs. In 20th century America, golf and country clubs, which often required a strict dress code, also gained popularity among upper-class individuals.</p><p>Today, many private members' clubs have chosen to abandon this old-fashioned model in favor of attracting young creatives and entrepreneurs. Gone are the hallmarks of old members' clubs, like strict dress codes and no workspaces. Those have given way to new members' clubs, which offer a stylish, contemporary space to work and network.</p><p>Nick Jones, founder of Soho House, was one of the first to do this with the opening of the club in London in 1995. As of 2020, Soho House operates more than 27 clubs worldwide, with locations slated to open in Tel Aviv, Rome, Paris, Nashville, Austin, Canouan, and another in London, in 2021 and 2022.&#160;</p><p>Henry Wallmeyer, President and CEO of the National Club Association, whose members include 400 clubs like the prestigious Yale Club of New York City, New York Athletic Club and New York Yacht Club, said within the last five years clubs have become a \"third place.\"&#160;</p><p>\"Everybody's first place is their home, second is work and the third place is their personal refuge,\" he told Business Insider.</p><h2><strong>A hospitality magnate makes a pivot into private members' clubs</strong></h2><p>Scott Sartiano is a hospitality magnate and the founder of some of the world's hottest nightclubs, including New York City's 1Oak, favored by celebrities like Drake and Paris Hilton, and Up &#38; Down. This month, he's slated to open his first-ever private members' club, Zero Bond.</p><p>Located at 0 Bond Street in Manhattan's NoHo neighborhood, Zero Bond is a work and social club for individuals in the art, entertainment, media, fashion, and literary industries.</p><p>\"I wanted to create an elevated environment,\" Sartiano told Business Insider of the decision to open the members' club. \"I thought the 28- to 50 year-old bracket was kind of underrepresented in New York when it came to social options. People want to know who they're associating with, but also want their own space and more control over their experiences.\"</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f512c12e6ff30001d4e6e8f?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Zero Bond\" height=\"607\" width=\"1387\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A rendering of Zero Bond&#39;s communal space.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Zero Bond</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Membership fees are $3,000 annually, with a $500 initiation fee. And while it's not the most expensive members' club in the city, it's also not easy to get in: Those who apply are required to have a reference by a current member. It has a roster of high-profile celebrities, athletes, and designers on board as founding members, including Kim and Kourtney Kardashian, Liev Schreiber, Tom Brady, Zac Posen, and Caroline Wozniacki.</p><p>\"There's no one type of person that Zero Bond is looking for,\" Sartiono said. \"I want a mixture and diversity. That's New York City. When you go out in New York and meet someone you wouldn't have ordinarily met, that's the makings of a great night.\"</p><p>\"My goal is to create the safest place in New York to work and socialize,\" Sartiano said of Zero Bond. He's implemented technology to automatically take the temperature of anyone who walks through the door. Staff's temperature will be taken hourly and upon entry. There will also be dividers and separators to ensure social distancing.&#160;</p><p>The 20,000-square-foot, high-ceilinged space spans two floors with several lounge areas, two restaurants, five private rooms, and a bar. Design aficionados will love Zero Bond's contemporary aesthetic, designed by William Sofield and Studio Sofield, which designed store interiors for Gucci and Tom Ford. The building, built in 1874, retains much of its original structure, including red-brick archways and large windows.&#160;</p><p>The building was formerly the second-ever Brooks Brothers store and factory; in a nod to the building's past, the staff will wear custom-designed Brooks Brothers uniforms. Zero Bond will also hang artwork by Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, Robert Mapplethorpe, and Keith Haring, whose former studio was next door.</p><p>\"I'm trying to tie things back into the neighborhood,\" Sartiano said.</p><h2><strong>The office landscape is shifting, and private clubs serve as remote workspaces</strong></h2><p>As the pandemic swept the US, companies across the country shut their offices and instructed employees to work from home. But even during the pandemic, it's not uncommon to see a sea of laptops at a given Soho House during the day. In an effort to give members a more dedicated workspace, the company launched its first shared workspace for creatives, Soho Works, in London in 2015.</p><p>Its first New York City outpost opened earlier this year, and a Los Angeles location is slated to open later this year. Existing Soho House members and non-member creatives alike can apply for a membership. Members have access to work amenities like printers, phone booths, meeting rooms, and podcast equipment that they might not have at home.</p><p>Zero Bond will also be a place to work, complete with quiet areas and phone booths to take calls without disturbing members.</p><p>\"I want to create a place where people can come to work, have a meeting, have an after-work cocktail or come on a date,\" Sartiano said, adding that many members' clubs in New York often feel overcrowded. \"There's always going to be space for people, and they're always going to know your name and who you are,\" he said.</p><h2><strong>Private clubs are also finding new ways to engage with members</strong></h2><p>With the pandemic limiting in-person meetings, some private clubs are turning to digital programming to keep guests entertained and connected.<strong>&#160;</strong></p><p>Soho House, which is known — in pre-pandemic times — for programming that includes off-site trips and mixology classes, is finding new ways to engage with members. Since April, Soho House has hosted digital events, including speakers, musical performances, meditations, and virtual screenings via its app.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f512d8a7ed0ee001e25d508?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Copyright Soho Works Water Street Lounge 202002 JI LR 001\" height=\"1666\" width=\"2222\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>One of the lounges at Soho Works Water Street.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Soho Works Water Street Lounge</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>CORE: Club in New York City is another club implementing digital events for members to access remotely. The club opened its doors in New York City in 2005. It has 1,600 members and doesn't come cheap: Initial members' fees cost $50,000 and annual dues are $17,000.</p><p>CORE: Club Founder Jennie Enterprise told Business Insider that membership is \"highly curated,\" and they search for those seeking \"intellectual challenges.\" While privacy is of the utmost importance, members include leaders, entrepreneurs, and CEOs. What differentiates CORE: from other clubs is the wide range of industries from which they select members, including science and academia, hospitality and culinary, and sports and technology, among others.</p><p>COVID-19 inspired Enterprise to launch CORE: Connects, a digital platform featuring cultural programming. Sessions are recorded, uploaded to the website, and made available for members only. One speaker series, called Minds &#38; Mavericks, includes sessions by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and Abigail Disney, documentary filmmaker, philanthropist and social activist. CORE: is slated to open its second location in Milan in 2021.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f513a69e6ff30001d4e6ee0?format=jpeg\" alt=\"CORE: Club Terrace\" height=\"922\" width=\"1229\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A terrace on CORE: Club.\n<p class=\"copyright\">CORE: Club</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h2><strong>A public hotel turned private members'-owned hotel</strong></h2><p>Hotels, too, are pivoting to a private membership model. Chateau Marmont, the historic Los Angeles hotel,&#160; first opened in 1927 and was bought by André Balazs Properties in 1990. It's known for glamorous parties that attract actors, writers, musicians, and artists. This summer, Balazs <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/hotelier-to-the-stars-plans-to-make-some-properties-private-clubs-11595928601\">announced</a> his plans to rebrand it as a members'-owned hotel, meaning members will own a piece of real estate at the hotel.</p><p>This decision stemmed from the fact that 70% of guests were repeat customers and the top 100 guests generated the majority of the room revenue. In addition to the investment, owners will be able to leave personal belongings, stay for extended periods of time, and have access to private dining areas.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f513bb6e6ff30001d4e6ef3?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Chateau Marmont\" height=\"1666\" width=\"2222\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Chateau Marmont is known for glamorous parties that attract actors, writers, musicians, and artists.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Chateau Marmont</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Only one restaurant and a few common areas will be available for public access. When owners aren't staying there, the hotel will only accept guests personally recommended by owners.</p><p>\"What's been amazingly surprising, but good, is how quickly clubs turn[ed] on a dime once COVID-19 hit,\" Wallmeyer of the National Club Association said. \"Historically, clubs have been notoriously slow in changing. A lot of it is because some are 100 years old.\"</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

change and more diversity in corporate America, it turns out that they're underrepresented among the leadership ranks of financial regulatory agencies in a big way.</p><p>Just 10 out of 327 people who've been appointed to US financial regulatory agencies, or 3% of all financial regulators, have been Black Americans over the past 90 years, a research paper <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ES-09.02.20-Brummer.pdf\">released on Wednesday</a> by the Brookings Institution said.&#160;</p><p>This includes federal financial regulatory agencies such as the Federal Reserve, the Securities and Exchange Commission as well as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.</p><p>Though Black Americans make up 13.4% of the population, there have only been 141 Black members of Congress dating back to 1900, with 98 of them being voted into office over the past two decades. In comparison, according to the study, 140 Black American judges serve across all levels of U.S. federal courts.</p><p>The paper showed that there has yet to be a single Black commissioner at the SEC or the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, for example. The paper's author also pointed out that there has never been a Black chairman at the FDIC, SEC or the CFTC.</p><p>\"This in effect means that African Americans have been, for the most part, shut out in any given year from representation on any given financial regulatory body,\" <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ES-09.02.20-Brummer.pdf\">said</a> Chris Brummer, the paper's author and faculty director at Georgetown University's Institute of International Economic Law. \"The consequence is that African Americans have had little, and usually no direct say in the very shape and operation of finance, the lifeblood of capitalism and the U.S. economy.\"</p><p>One policy that Brummer refers to as an example of Black Americans largely missing out on having an equal voice in corporate America is the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act enacted in July 2010. As the study concludes, Black Americans only entail 11% of new directors serving on the boards of S&#38;P 500 corporations.</p><p>Brummer added that the lack of diversity in financial regulation isn't necessarily a partisan problem, indicating that both Democrats and Republicans haven't done the best job at attracting diverse talent given the fact that neither party in the US Senate \"has sponsored an African American appointment in the absence of Executive political action since the first term of the Reagan administration.\"</p><p>The paper's publication comes after Jacob Blake, a 29 year-old Black man, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/video-shows-police-wisconsin-shoot-black-man-back-2020-8\">was shot 7 seven times</a> by police in Wisconsin, leaving him with <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/picture-details-jacob-blake-black-man-shot-by-police-kenosha-2020-8\">serious injuries,</a> sparking further <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/02/us/kenosha-curfew-lawsuit-protests-jacob-blake/index.html\">civil unrest</a> and protests across the US.&#160;</p><p>Gbenga Ajilore, a senior economist at Center for American Progress in Washington, D.C., <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gbenga_ajilore/status/1301862619796701184\">tweeted</a> on Friday that the Black-White unemployment ratio increased in August to a record-high since the coronavirus pandemic began.&#160;</p><p>Also on Friday, the <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm\">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> reported that the US economy <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/august-jobs-report-nonfarm-payrolls-unemployment-rate-us-economy-recovery-2020-9\">added</a> 1.37 million jobs in August, the fourth consecutive month of gains.

In other words, the monetary policies from the Fed will likely be the determining factor of how long the stock market rally can last.</p><p>According to Bannister, the S&#38;P 500 could soar if Powell is able to avoid the Bernanke taper tantrum of 2013 and suppress the real 10-year Treasury yield.

The real 10-year Treasury yield is the current interest rate of the 10-year Treasury less the current rate of inflation.</p><p>Still, market valuations are \"precariously high\" and investors should note that the decade following the dot-com&#160; bubble led to underperforming tech stocks relative to the S&#38;P 500 despite faster earnings growth, the note said.</p><p>Investors should take note of Bannister's call.

Hill Isn't a real person, but rather an invention of Farrah's designed to solicit customer feedback.</p><p>Blank recently <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/arthur-blank-home-depot-atlanta-falcons-good-company-book-2020-8\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"40\" data-uri=\"28012f888b8bf2b699738be60e859932\">spoke</a> with Business Insider about his new book \"Good Company,\" the creation of Ben Hill, and his stint handling negative customer calls for Home Depot. He spoke about how the fictitious figure played a roll in helping the founders foster customer-focused values within the company.&#160;</p><p>The Home Depot founders had always sought out consumer critiques, with Blank and Marcus donning orange aprons and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/home-depot-cofounder-customer-service-2019-4\">chasing down</a> customers leaving their stores empty-handed. But at a certain point, Home Depot had opened so many stores that the method became untenable. So the founders took a new approach.</p><p>In \"Good Company,\" Blank wrote: \"In every store, we hung a sign that read, 'Are you satisfied? If not, call Ben Hill,' followed by a phone number.\"</p><p>Farrah had thought up the fictitious executive after seeing the name on an exit sign off I-285 in Georgia. The California native \"thought it sounded friendly.\" Ben Hill is both the name of a county in Georgia, as well as a neighborhood in Home Depot's hometown of Atlanta. Ben Hill was also the name of a Georgia politician during the 1800s elected to the Confederate States Congress, the US House of Representatives, and the US Senate.</p><p>According to Blank, Home Depot's switchboard operators were told to patch calls for Ben Hill through to the founders.</p><p>\"So for the first number of years, myself, or Bernie, or, Pat Farrah would end up taking all of those calls,\" he told Business Insider. \"You'd tell the customer, \"This is Arthur Blank, I cofounded the company.

But despite the often-tense nature of the calls, the lessons gleaned from those conversations could be valuable.</p><p>\"Bernie, Pat, and I genuinely wanted to hear from those disgruntled customers ourselves, because we knew that their complaints were worth more than the advice of any retail expert we could hire,\" he wrote.</p><p>Still, Blank told Business Insider that the issues themselves usually didn't make much a difference to the founders.&#160;</p><p>\"We never viewed ourselves as a judge trying to decide which side of the scale is right or wrong,\" he said. \"The customer's always going to be right.\"</p><p>While \"Ben Hill calls\" could sometimes pinpoint merchandising or installation issues, callers frustrations typically went back to customer service. Blank said that after getting off the phone with the disgruntled customers, he, Marcus, or Farrah would follow-up with store managers.&#160;</p><p>This resulted in talks that were often \"not the most pleasant in the world,\" according to Blank. He said that store managers came to fear \"Ben Hill calls.\" In the wake of such a call, managers would gather the entire store workforce to talk about the importance of customer service.</p><p>\"We established Ben Hill because, at the end of the day, we wanted to make sure that the store manager really thought of the store as their store,\" he said. \"Our job is to make every single customer happy. And that means if they're not happy after step one, you go to step two and you make them happy.\"</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

The current sale price is the cheapest we've seen yet.</p><h3><a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/196318/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Flg-75-class-nanocell-99-series-led-8k-uhd-smart-webos-tv%2F6408025.p%3FskuId%3D6408025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\"><strong>LG 75-inch NanoCell 99 Series 8K TV (2020 model), $4,299.99 (originally $4,999.99) at Best Buy</strong></a><strong> [You save $700]</strong></h3><p>LG's NanoCell LCD TVs aren't on par with the company's OLED models when it comes to overall picture quality, but they offer solid performance in their own right.

With stats like those, it's clear that the fashion industry's reckoning has been a long time coming.</p><p>COVID-19 is that reckoning.</p><h2>Fashionably late</h2><p>In April, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/02/fashion-brands-cancellations-of-24bn-orders-catastrophic-for-bangladesh\">The Guardian</a> reported that major high street fashion brands, including Primark and Matalan, had cancelled or suspended orders for £2.4 billion worth of garments from factories in Bangladesh. Over 97% of suppliers surveyed by the WRC and Penn State University said that brands had offered \"no financial assistance\" to cover furlough or severance costs; the executive director of the WRC described the situation as a \"wholesale abandoning of workers and suppliers\" by brands.</p><p>Factory owners, who operate on low profit margins and lack access to cash reserves or credit, are <a href=\"https://labourbehindthelabel.org/covid-19-support-workers/\">unable to pay their workers</a> — who themselves aren't paid enough to accumulate the savings they would need to weather this pandemic. While brands scramble to minimize losses, factory owners and workers in Bangladesh are facing destitution.</p><p>Closer to home, the brands <a href=\"https://www.gmb.org.uk/news/asos-warehouse-suffers-suspected-coronavirus-outbreak\">ASOS</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jul/06/boohoo-leicester-factory-conditions-covid-19\">Boohoo</a> both made headlines for the unsanitary working conditions in their UK factories, leading directly to COVID-19 outbreaks in both locations. Boohoo in particular has been criticised for allegedly paying workers <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/boohoos-sweatshop-suppliers-they-only-exploit-us-they-make-huge-profits-and-pay-us-peanuts-lwj7d8fg2?wgu=270525_54264_15992424200592_a439613e96&wgexpiry=1607018420&utm_source=planit&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_content=22278tm_content=22278\">as little as £3.50 per hour</a> in a Leicester factory — less than half the UK legal minimum wage of £8.72 per hour. Although Boohoo has said the factory was run by a subcontractor and the bran dis investigating its supply chain, up until this point sales were booming and bosses were in line to make £150 million in bonuses.</p><p>ASOS, meanwhile, <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/news/asos-boycott-online-drivers-redundant-coronavirus-outbreak-417087\">fired 70 workers</a> at the beginning of the outbreak when they switched delivery suppliers (from Menzies to DPD). The administrators and drivers were originally told that their contracts would be transferred, only for DPD to U-turn on its commitment and announce that they would be dismissed on May 1.</p><h2>A new light on abuse</h2><p>Whether in the UK or farther afield, the effects of COVID-19 on the fashion industry are unmistakable. As the crisis has developed, it has thrown into sharp relief many of the systemic issues in the industry — obscure supply chains, worker exploitation, and extreme waste, to name a few — but we're yet to find sustainable solutions to these problems.</p><p>Initiatives like Mallzee's Lost Stock have sprung up to plug the gap left by brands abandoning their suppliers. Consumers can purchase a bag of clothes from Lost Stock, tailored to their size and preferences, at £35 — a 50% discount from the estimated £70 retail price. <a href=\"https://loststock.com/\">Lost Stock's website</a> claims that each bag supports a Bangladeshi worker and their family for one week.</p><p>Although an innovative solution to the dual problem of supporting workers and reducing waste, initiatives like this speak to our neoliberal, late-capitalist era by putting the onus on the consumer to fix the deep-seated problems in the fashion industry. While brands continue to profit from the exploitation of their workers, the burden of \"doing the right thing\" and bailing out these workers falls on individuals — many of whom are themselves suffering from COVID-related redundancies and reduced hours.</p><p>In asking individuals to contribute to ending systemic issues, initiatives like this also require the public to make difficult personal choices about what matters to them, as they are asked to split what disposable income they have between different causes — BLM, local food banks, queer fundraisers, etc. The focus is on individual consumers to make ethical choices for the greater good, rather than holding brands to account.</p><p>Mallzee's program appeals to consumers' self-interest: it's undeniably positive that the garments won't go to waste, but the 50% discount incentive speaks to a world in which we are consumers first and foremost; where everything is transactional, and doing a good deed comes with a material reward. It's also worth noting that focusing on poverty and exploitation in other countries leads to western consumers buying into the lie that it \"doesn't happen here\", and doing a disservice to the vulnerable, precarious, and exploited workers in our home countries.</p><h2>Accountability</h2><p>In a time when we should be reflecting on our relationship to fast fashion and our place in a deeply consumer-oriented society, the response to COVID-19 seems to be a focus on increased consumption. Rather than addressing the <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/news/asos-boycott-online-drivers-redundant-coronavirus-outbreak-417087\">#BoycottAsos campaign</a> which sprang up in response to ASOS' treatment of its workers, ASOS doubled down: in the week leading up to pubs reopening in England, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ASOS/status/1277899298924003329\">ASOS offered discounts to UK shoppers to get ready for \"Super Saturday.\"</a> In doing so they encouraged the public to see themselves as consumers, capitalizing on the reopening of pubs and bars as an opportunity to push sales — even while public health advice remained clear on staying at home and avoiding unnecessary travel.</p><p>In all of these instances, making ethical choices becomes individual consumers' responsibility, when what we need is corporate and governmental accountability. The COVID-19 crisis has precisely illuminated everything wrong with fast fashion: cramped unsanitary working conditions, precarious and exploitative employment, an opaque supply chain which enables brands to abandon their laborers.</p><p>It's evident that real systemic change is needed, and that calling on consumers to behave \"ethically\" will not be enough. Without organised collective action and a system which enables us to hold brands to account, these issues will continue, even right under our noses.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original

href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>Dr. Anthony Fauci delivered a grim warning ahead of the Labor Day weekend, saying that seven states should be on high alert for a potential spike in coronavirus cases.&#160;</p><p>\"There are several states that are at risk for surging, namely North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa, Arkansas, Missouri, Indiana, Illinois,\" Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the leading White House coronavirus expert, told <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-03/fauci-warns-seven-midwest-states-to-be-on-alert-over-labor-day\">Bloomberg News</a>.</p><p>\"Those states are starting to see an increase in the percent positive of their testing; that is generally predictive that there's going to be a problem.\"</p><p>The warning comes after at least one of those states engaged in large-scale events in recent weeks.&#160;</p><p>South Dakota held a <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/minnesota-man-died-of-covid-19-after-sturgis-motorcycle-rally-2020-9\">10-day motorcycle festival last month</a>, a spectacle that drew more than 400,000 people and led to hundreds of positive cases nationwide connected to the event. Most attendees had not worn a mask and did not adhere to social distancing guidelines.&#160;</p><p>Multiple states have reported surges in the number of confirmed coronavirus cases after a holiday weekend like <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-contact-tracer-cases-are-rising-after-memorial-day-2020-6\">Memorial Day</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/florida-texas-coronavirus-cases-record-high-fourth-of-july-2020-7\">Fourth of July</a>.</p><p>As many states enter the seventh month of mask-wearing and quarantine, the coronavirus continues to spread nationwide.&#160;</p><p>The disease has infected more than 6.2 million people in the United States, according to the latest data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Of that figure, more than 187,000 people have died.&#160;</p><p>Anticipating a surge over the holiday weekend, the White House doubled down on the message to practice social distancing and wear masks.&#160;</p><p>On a phone call earlier this week, Fauci and Vice President Mike Pence asked governors to continue to enforce mask-wearing and social distancing, Bloomberg reported.&#160;</p><p>Following Fauci's warnings, President Donald Trump on Friday <a href=\"https://fox2now.com/news/national/pres-trump-to-hold-white-house-news-conference/\">urged people to \"remain vigilant\"</a> and \"apply common sense.\"&#160;</p><p>\"As we begin Labor Day weekend, America's unprecedented economic recovery continues,\" Trump said, speaking at a White House briefing.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/seven-states-risk-coronavirus-surge-labor-day-weekend-fauci-warns-2020-9'>Business

near its Silicon Valley headquarters.&#160;</p><p>The company this month unveiled its proposal for Middlefield Park, a revamped 40-acre site in the city of Mountain View, California, where Google's main headquarters is currently based. The plan includes a parks network, retail space, office space, and even a public pool and sports field.&#160;</p><p>The tech giant also plans to add as many as 1,850 residential units, and the company says 20% of those units will be affordable housing.

None of the major tech companies has sent employees back to work in the US amid the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, and Google's itself isn't requiring companies to return to work <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/google-employees-working-from-home-summer-2021-report-2020-7\">until July 2021</a>.&#160;</p><p>But Google isn't alone in reaffirming its commitment to physical offices. Last month, Amazon announced that it plans to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-adds-jobs-new-office-hub-locations-2020-8\">expand its physical office space in six \"tech hubs\"</a> across the US, investing $1.4 billion to build out the offices and adding 3,500 jobs.&#160;</p><p>And Facebook in August <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-signs-730000-square-foot-office-lease-at-farley-building-2020-8\">signed a deal for a massive new office</a> in the Farley Building in New York City.

This is Fisher Island. Mel Brooks, Julia Roberts, and Oprah have all owned homes here. With an average income of $2.2 million, it's the richest zip code in the United States. And we got a chance to tour it. You may have heard of Fisher from reports that all the residents and staff got COVID-19 antibody tests, just three miles from Miami, where testing was rare. Yep, that's where we're headed. You actually have to take a ferry there. It's one of the only ways to get on the island. The other way to get on the island? Private yacht. Only the island's 800 families and their guests are allowed on Fisher. So security is pretty tight at the ferry terminal, but we got special access back in November 2019 thanks to Dora Puig, one of the island's real-estate agents.</p><p>Dora Puig: Fisher Island is a private island enclave with 216 acres.</p><p>Abby: Dora invited us to tour Fisher's newest developments, Palazzo del Sol and Palazzo della Luna, opened in 2019, which is how we ended up on the island's newest ferry, taking the seven-minute journey from Miami Beach. So, right now I'm on the ferry over to Fisher Island, and, as you can see, I'm the only one here in the passenger lounge. Most everyone is in their cars. We've got a Bentley, a Lamborghini, a Porsche, Ferrari, I think. You won't see these zooming around the island, though. To enforce strict speed limits, most people drive around in golf carts.</p><p>Dora: When you go to the beach club, you'll have a mini Rolls-Royce golf cart or you'll have a Range Rover golf cart, or I've seen even vintage old American cars in baby blue.</p><p>Abby: The median waterfront home here costs $2.9 million, but residents are not only splurging on million-dollar apartments. They're also paying a hefty membership fee. That covers unlimited use of the community pools, the 17 tennis courts, and the private beaches with sand imported from the Bahamas. But it doesn't include the golf course or the two marinas.</p><p>Dora: The original idea of Fisher Island was for everyone to live in the community and use the community amenities.</p><p>Abby: But even on a private island, some residents want even more exclusive perks. The newest condos, Palazzo del Sol and della Luna, don't have beachfront locations, but they do have a private gym, salon, theater, and pool and water transport that only condo residents can use.</p><p>Dora: Come step in with me.</p><p>Abby: Dora first showed us a $14.5 million unit in Palazzo della Luna. She says many of the island's current residents have been looking to trade up for a home like this one so they don't have to share amenities with the whole community. This unit has four bedrooms and five baths.</p><p>Dora: You walk in, you're at ground level, just like in a single-family home. You have your private pool, you're on the bay, and look at the size of the outdoor entertaining terraces. It wraps around the whole corner of the residence. You could have a dinner for 200 to 300 people here.</p><p>Abby: The selling point: the disappearing master suite.</p><p>Dora: You walk into a dressing room that looks like an Hermès shop. Walk-in dressing room for the lady and white-lacquered Italian closets. The custom bathroom by Boffi for us, with the floating island in white lacquer. The tub is custom made for us, and it's called the Fisher Island. And then enter into the master suite, with your 12-foot ceilings.</p><p>Abby: Because we were curious, we went to check out a second apartment, a supposedly more affordable unit up a couple floors. At $9 million, it's got three bedrooms and three and a half bathrooms.</p><p>Dora: Here you're walking into the wooded parlor with our little mini-library, all in blond oak. You have the main living room, dining room, kitchen areas to the bay, and the master suite is also to the bay. And then you have the two guest suites on the golf-course side.</p><p>Abby: You can keep all the furniture for an extra $2 million.</p><p>Dora: Look at how beautiful it is.</p><p>Abby: These two new developments have only made Fisher more untouchable, pushing home values across the island up by 20%. Today, you'll find price tags of over $40 million for a condo. That's only $10 million short of the most expensive home ever sold in Miami. And that was an entire mansion. The Palazzos were the first developments on Fisher in nearly a decade and are targeting a new generation of buyers.</p><p>Dora: Traditionally, we had a little bit older demographic because the island is so beautiful and it's expensive. We've really seen it switch to a much younger crowd. So we've seen a nice migration towards younger families. Some come from generations of family wealth; others come from selling oil companies, selling financial instruments, technology, hedge funds.</p><p>Abby: Even still, half of the residents are over 60, making them particularly vulnerable for COVID-19. The island has always been a place for the 1% to get away, ever since it was formed in 1906, when a canal was dredged so boats could go from the Port of Miami straight to the ocean.</p><p>Dora: The interesting part about this is that Fisher Island today would have been south of Fifth Street in Miami Beach, because it was actually connected to the tip of Miami Beach peninsula.</p><p>Abby: Miami's first Black billionaire, real-estate mogul Dana Dorsey, was one of the first owners of the new island. He wanted to build a Black resort here, but he had trouble getting workers out to the island to build it. So he sold it to billionaire developer Carl Fisher, who named it after himself. Next up, the Vanderbilt family.</p><p>Dora: Carl Fisher and William Vanderbilt were known to party and have a lot of fun here. And one very late night, I'm sure there were drinks involved, they traded the island. Carl Fisher traded his island with his winter home, which is today the club, to William Vanderbilt for his over-200-foot yacht. So, they did the trade, and then the Alva later on sunk and William Vanderbilt kept the island. So I think he was the better businessman.</p><p>Abby: After Vanderbilt's death, the island passed hands between millionaires. And then it was left vacant for 15 years. In the 1980s, Fisher's current developers started work on the community you see today. And now Fisher is a full-blown town. The old Vanderbilt mansion is a hotel with suites running for almost $1,500 a night. Vanderbilt's old airplane hangar is now a spa, and you can even rent a property here on Airbnb for about $700 a night. But this doesn't happen in a vacuum. It takes about 600 workers to run this island. They live off-island and have three separate ferries. During the day, they staff a school, post office, fire station, a security force, and a medical center. It was from that private health clinic that residents and workers got those infamous antibody tests. We're back on the ferry. We just finished our tour of Fisher Island. It's really hard to wrap your brain around just the amount of wealth squished into one place. How that exists so close to reality across the bay. As visitors pre-COVID, we got the sense that even with all its normal town functions, Fisher Island is anything but normal. It's like a live-in resort community. Manicured, eerily perfect, and as secluded as ever.</p><p>Hey, guys, my name's Abby. I'm the producer on this video. Obviously, things have changed a lot for Fisher since we visited back in November 2019. But I honestly wasn't that surprised when I heard that they were able to get antibody tests for everyone on the island. Not only did they have one of the first cases of COVID-19 in Miami-Dade County, they also have the means, the wealth to get them. But I wanna know what else you wanna see from us.

It is actively exporting this Orwellian vision by providing loans to the Chinese technology giant Huawei for its \"<a href=\"https://www.aspi.org.au/report/mapping-chinas-tech-giants\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Safe City</a>\" projects across more than 90 countries and by <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/2018/rise-digital-authoritarianism\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">providing training on internet policymaking for foreign leaders</a> from more than 30 countries.</p><p>But the way to counter China's digital agenda is not through a lack of regulation, as Zuckerberg and his fellow tech titans argue. In recent years, mounting concerns over violations of digital privacy at the hands of companies like Facebook and the rampant spread of disinformation online have undermined the notion that an open and free internet means an unregulated internet.</p><p>A better way to fight back against China's global technological ambitions would be for Washington to work together with its allies and build a broad coalition in favor of sensible regulations on the technology sector that strike a balance between free and open discourse online, on the one hand, and protecting privacy and democratic institutions, on the other.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5beddd2e0591f2301157289c?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Trump looking the wrong way NATO\" height=\"1080\" width=\"1637\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>President Donald Trump with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and other NATO leaders at the opening of the 2018 NATO Summit at NATO headquarters in Brussels, July 11, 2018.\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/german-chancellor-angela-merkel-belgian-prime-minister-news-photo/996209950\" target=\"_blank\">Sean Gallup/Getty Images</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>The US needs to work together with allies to offer an appealing alternative to the Chinese system.

It's about putting your ego aside, and working to understand the other person's perspective.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories</a>.</li>\n</ul><p dir=\"ltr\">\"He isn't doing his part, and he can't keep up with my work speed.\"&#160;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">I sat across from a&#160;<a href=\"https://www.inc.com/martin-zwilling/how-to-successfully-establish-a-board-of-advisors-directors.html?cid=search\">member of my board</a>&#160;while he expressed frustration around an employee on his team.&#160;This employee was doing quality work but&#160;wasn't the fastest or most efficient team member.</p><p>The words of the&#160;manager&#160;began to sink in, and I could sense his deep-seated need to be right and have his opinion validated.</p><p>Although he was correct about the employee's time management, that wasn't what was most important to me.&#160;What was most imperative&#160;was helping them build&#160;a&#160;healthy working relationship&#160;and work on efficiently completing their projects together.</p><p>It can be so tempting to believe you have all the answers and need to dish them out to people all day long. But that isn't necessarily getting you&#160;or your business&#160;to succeed.</p><p>As a leader, it isn't your job to be right;&#160;it's your job to do whatever you need to do&#160;in order to get the job done. At the end of the day, brushing aside the need to be right is possible.&#160;I was able to walk&#160;my board member through how to do this with three simple steps.</p><h2>1. Show up with excitement instead of frustration</h2><p>I started the conversation with my board member by asking, \"How is your frustration working out for you?\"&#160;He sat back&#160;and after a few moments he&#160;laughed at himself.&#160;He knew it wasn't working for him&#160;and&#160;if anything, it was detracting from his energy and effort to what mattered more.</p><p>Show up with excitement instead of frustration. Follow up with someone on a task or project need from a place of enthusiasm. This shifts the energy of the conversation and&#160;motivates the receiving party to become inspired to execute and get involved. When you are excited about something, other will follow suit.&#160;</p><h2>2. Speak the other person's language</h2><p>Most people are speaking their own language full of expressions and jargon expecting everyone else to understand them. True leadership is understanding what kind of language someone speaks and meeting them where they are. Show up with higher&#160;energy to inspire others to act and move in the direction you want.</p><p>Step into the other person's&#160;shoes to understand what motivates them and why they would be enticed to do what needs to be done.&#160;Once you have a grasp on this, you can then speak from their vantage point.</p><p>This also could mean shifting the vocabulary you use and the outcomes you speak to. Have you ever sat in a room where a highly technical expert gave a presentation so granular and detailed that the overall message was lost to those that didn't have the same background? Instead of bombarding a team member with metrics, try approaching it from the customer's emotional outcome or vice versa. Adjust how you speak to people in order to better grab their attention and their desire to get involved.</p><h2>3. Put your ego aside</h2><p>At the end of the day, as a leader, you need to do whatever it takes to get the job done. Sometimes this requires&#160;you to allow someone else to be right, to step into roles that aren't typically yours, and&#160;let your ego down to get your hands dirty right alongside your team.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.inc.com/matt-haber/simon-sinek-leadership-listening.html?cid=search\">Simon Sinek</a> wrote a book titled \"Leaders Eat Last,\" and that statement alone couldn't summarize the message better. A team expects the leader to mitigate threats, even at the expense of their personal well-being. The sooner you can understand this, the quicker you shift from being an authoritative boss to being a true leader.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-get-over-need-to-be-right-about-everything-2020-9'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=YXpsr_SK_20:haZv6IeaBII:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=YXpsr_SK_20:haZv6IeaBII:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=YXpsr_SK_20:haZv6IeaBII:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=YXpsr_SK_20:haZv6IeaBII:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=YXpsr_SK_20:haZv6IeaBII:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=YXpsr_SK_20:haZv6IeaBII:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=YXpsr_SK_20:haZv6IeaBII:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=YXpsr_SK_20:haZv6IeaBII:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/YXpsr_SK_20\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 05 Sep 2020 14:15:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f5294bde6ff30001d4e73b1?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"a14f138991f56175a86f7395f7e124fe","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn4@2020_3/2020/09/06/02-59-44-770_d55f5aaace398736.webp","destWidth":7697,"destHeight":5773,"sourceBytes":970196,"destBytes":970196,"author":"insider@insider.com (Raj Jana)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5e5feaa0fee23d451b3cd259?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn69@2020_5/2020/09/06/02-59-56-485_1993fd03f922aa9a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn78@2020_1/2020/09/06/02-59-58-308_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=YXpsr_SK_20:haZv6IeaBII:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn34@2020_1/2020/09/06/03-00-01-382_430e5edd980370fa.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=YXpsr_SK_20:haZv6IeaBII:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn73@2020_6/2020/09/06/02-59-56-347_225b41aeeefb2d23.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn60@2020_6/2020/09/06/02-59-52-353_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=YXpsr_SK_20:haZv6IeaBII:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn75@2020_2/2020/09/06/02-59-47-721_c050333715659470.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/YXpsr_SK_20":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn1@2020_6/2020/09/06/02-59-56-533_2e2595fad2916560.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599361164613},{"createdTime":"2020-09-06 10:59:24","updatedTime":"2020-09-06 10:59:24","title":"Trump Jr. joins Triller and lashes out against TikTok, claiming the app is 'something that could haunt your kids forever'","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-jr-joins-triller-tiktok-could-haunt-kids-forever-2020-9","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f53de3a7ed0ee001e25dbac?format=jpeg\" alt=\"donald trump jr misinformation\" height=\"497\" width=\"994\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Donald Trump Jr. in a video posted to Triller attacked TikTok and said it might &#34;weaponize&#34;
