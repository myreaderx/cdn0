While they originated as official government documents, companies, brands, and nonprofits of all types use them to establish topical authority. According to \n<a href=\"https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/subject_specific_writing/professional_technical_writing/white_papers/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Purdue Owl</a>: \n<blockquote>\n Typically, the purpose of a white paper is to advocate that a certain position is the best way to go or that a certain solution is best for a particular problem. When it is used for commercial purposes, it could influence the decision-making processes of current and prospective customers.\n</blockquote> \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-85365 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/white-paper-definition.png\" alt=\"The definition of a white paper.\" width=\"1361\" height=\"581\" /> \n<h3>Determine if a White Paper is Really the Best Content Format</h3> Before you get too far along, you might decide a different format would work better to reach your audience and achieve your goals. Follow this graphic to help decide if writing a white paper is the best approach: \n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-85416 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/white-paper-vs-ebook-vs-case-study.png\" alt=\"Decide whether to choose white papers, case studies, or an ebook.\" width=\"1361\" height=\"591\" /> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/?p=59497#top\">Back to the Top</a>\n</div> \n<a name=\"examples\"></a> \n<h2>10 Examples of Actual White Papers You Can Follow for Inspiration</h2> What does a white paper usually look like?

This involves several steps. \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Figure out who you're writing for</strong>. Who’s going to read your white paper? Ideally, your organization or agency should have an idea who your target audiences and customers are. If not, we’ve put together a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/how-to-find-your-target-audience/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">comprehensive guide that might help</a></span><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\">.</span></li> \n <li><strong>Identify problems you can solve for them</strong>. Once you’ve identified your audience, think about what kinds of information they need from you. Secondarily, you might also tie that back into your own products or services. That sets you up at the solution to that problem.</li> \n <li><strong>Align those problems with your product</strong>. When you know what problems to solve, you’ve got a purpose for your white paper. The next challenge, then, is to decide which ones to write about, and from which angle. A simple brainstorming session can help with this.</li> \n</ul> [Tweet \"Before you start writing, you need to understand what you'll be writing about.\"] \n<h3>Some Questions to Get Started</h3> Start by asking a few questions: \n<ul> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Which problems are top priority?</span>&nbsp;Consider starting with ones that are most pressing or timely.</li> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Which problems can I tie back into my business?</span> Say your organization wants to be known as an authority on an area you’re new to, or maybe you have a new product or service offering coming out, and want to position yourself as the best option. Find ideas that <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/marketing-strategy/marketing-goals/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">align your goals</a> with your audience’s.</li> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">What are we experts on? </span>If you have deep knowledge or expertise on an area you’re known for, a white paper can help reinforce that perception.</li> \n</ul> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/content-marketing-brainstorming-process/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Best 30-Minute Content Marketing Brainstorming Process</a>\n</div> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/?p=59497#toc\">Back to the Top</a></strong>\n</div> \n<a name=\"outline\"></a> \n<h2>Next, Write Your Outline</h2> White papers are usually fairly long. The same outlining process you’d use for a shorter piece, like a blog post, will work here. You might need to make it a bit longer or more detailed, though, to avoid getting lost in your thoughts partway through. An effective white paper outline should include: \n<ul> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Headline: </span>Start with a working version that describes your topic. CoSchedule's&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/headline-analyzer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Headline Analyzer</a></span>&nbsp;can help.</li> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">An executive summary</span>: This is essentially a brief (200 words or so) description of what your white paper will be about. Think of it like a short pitch for why someone should write what you’re about to write.</li> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Your introduction</span>: Which points will you touch on in your intro? These are what you’ll expand on in the body of your white paper.</li> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Section sub-headings</span>: Like your headline, these don’t need to be final yet, but you should have a clear idea of what you’ll discuss in each section. If your headline is the core problem you’ll solve, consider each sub-heading a sub-point or step toward resolving it.</li> \n</ul> Beneath each sub-heading, include further bullet points clarifying \n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">exactly what you’ll write about</span>. Know what you want to say before you try to say it. Consider the following elements: \n<ul> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Sidebars</span>: White papers often include sidebars or breakout boxes with additional information or data tables, like what you’d find in a magazine. In each section, list any possible sidebar ideas you might have. This could include any research or data you’ll need to find (more on this in a bit).</li> \n <li><strong>Images:</strong> Will you have data or ideas that would be best presented visually?</li> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Conclusion</span>: Summarize your key takeaways. If it’s appropriate, you might consider adding a call-to-action here, too.</li> \n</ul> Here’s what a hypothetical outline might look like. \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/?p=59497#toc\">Back to the Top</a></strong>\n</div> \n<a name=\"research\"></a> \n<h2>Do Your Research</h2> Good white papers are fact-based and research-driven. You’re not here to throw your opinions out to the world without data to back them up. Depending on what you’re covering, you might get by with nothing more than Google and your company’s own insights. If you want to take things to the next level, though, you’ll need to do deeper research. [Tweet \"If you want to take things to the next level, you'll need to do your research.\"] \n<h3>Do Your Own Original Research</h3> This is the most difficult option, but it can provide the most valuable results. If you have access to publically-available information, so does your competition. Original research you produced yourself, however, is uniquely powerful. Here are just a few benefits to original research: \n<ul> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">It establishes you and your organization as an authoritative source</span>. Wouldn’t it be awesome if your white paper became a highly-linked source of information for others?</li> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">It gives you something no one else has</span>. And that would make your white paper much more valuable than something anyone could have slapped together spending an afternoon with Google.</li> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">You’ll learn more about your audience and industry</span>. Last year, we did a survey of our blog audience. We were then able to turn our findings into a 5,000+ word blog post. That’s long enough that it could have been a white paper, had we decided to publish it as one. It taught us a lot about our audience, too, including things we wouldn’t have learned otherwise.</li> \n</ul> If you have the time and resources to do your own research study, Andy Crestodina of Orbit Media Studios has a \n<a href=\"https://www.orbitmedia.com/blog/research-best-form-of-content/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">f<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">antastic guide to get you started</span></a>. \n<h3>Dig Into Research Reports</h3> Industry research reports can provide an excellent data-backed foundation for your content. Here are some potential sources to consider: \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://go.forrester.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Forrester</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gartner</a></li> \n <li>Do a quick Google search for [YOUR INDUSTRY] + [research firm].</li> \n</ul> This can yield information and insight that will help you effectively build your case. \n<h3>Check Out Wolfram Alpha</h3> \n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://www.wolframalpha.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wolfram Alpha</a></span>&nbsp;calls itself a “computational knowledge engine.” What does that mean? It’s a search engine for facts and data with calculation functionality built in. It’s an extremely robust and powerful tool for research. They have plenty of \n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://www.wolframalpha.com/resources/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">help guides and resources</a></span>&nbsp;to get you on your way. While this video is a bit old, it provides a high-level overview of what you can do with the tool: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRGNS6z5bLY \n<h3>Make Use of Government Websites</h3> Depending on your industry, there are several government websites that might be helpful. Here’s a handful to consider: \n<ul> \n <li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://www.sba.gov/offices/headquarters/oee/resources/2836\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">U.S. Small Business Administration</a></span></li> \n <li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">American Fact Finder</a></span></li> \n <li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/bls/demographics.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a></span></li> \n</ul> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/?p=59497#toc\">Back to the Top</a></strong>\n</div> \n<a name=\"format\"></a> \n<h2>Now, You're Ready to Format and Write This White Paper</h2> We’ve done a lot of things so far. Some of it even involved a little bit of writing. Mostly, though, we’ve spent our time getting ready to write. Writing a white paper isn’t easy. You’re now staring down an intense and involved project. If you’re writing in an industry where you’re not a subject matter expert, then your preparation (outlining, researching, and working with internal or client SMEs) is going to be even more important. You’ve got this, though. Flex those fingers, tap into your inner Hemingway, and let’s knock this thing out. \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/marketing-skills/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The 50 Most Essential Marketing Skills You Need to Be Successful in 2020</a>\n</div> \n<h3>How Do White Papers Differ From Writing Other Types of Content?</h3> We’ve touched on this a little earlier, but it’s worth repeating here. While there are some similarities, writing a white paper isn’t quite like writing a blog post, case study, research report, grocery list… you get the point. It’s decidedly its own animal and should be treated as such. White papers should be: \n<ul> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Professional in tone: </span>This is formal, almost academic-style writing.</li> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Narrowly-focused: </span>Pick one topic and explore it thoroughly.</li> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Fact-based:</span>&nbsp;Unverified claims don’t belong here.</li> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Data-backed: </span>You don’t have to like math, but you have to love what numbers can do to make your writing stronger.</li> \n</ul> \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-85366 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/white-paper-purpose.png\" alt=\"The different qualities of a white paper.\" width=\"1361\" height=\"661\" /> [Tweet \"White papers should be professional in tone, narrowly-focused, fact-based, and data-backed.\"] \n<h3>Writing Your Title Or Headline</h3> \n<a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/how-to-write-the-best-headlines-that-will-increase-traffic/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Your headline</a> is the first thing that will sell your white paper to your audience. You want to write something that conveys clear value up front and gets them to click. However, you also want to avoid anything that could be perceived as click bait, or overly casual. Your headline should hit each of the following checkboxes: \n<ul> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Establish a clear benefit to your reader</span>: Why should they care? What’s in it for them to read past your title page? Including interesting stats or a strong action verb can help.</li> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Sound professional</span>: Even if your blog or social media content is fun and light-hearted, a white paper should strike a professional tone. It doesn’t need to be sterile and lifeless, per se, but use your best judgment here.</li> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Set realistic expectations for your reader</span>: If your headline reads, “Ten Ways Shipping Companies Can Deliver Faster Shipments,” you better go into detail on all ten tactics. You’d be surprised how many “white papers” throw a paragraph of text surrounded by images onto a page and call it good.</li> \n</ul> Let’s take a look at five hypothetical headline examples you can follow: \n<ol> \n <li><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">How SaaS Companies Can Onboard 53% More Customers In 2017</span></li> \n <li><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Why Are Content Calendars Important For Marketing Teams</span></li> \n <li><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">7 Ways Small Businesses Can Compete With Enterprise Corporations</span></li> \n <li><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Why Companies Should Use Agile Project Management</span></li> \n <li><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">How Nonprofits Can Do Better Fundraising</span></li> \n</ol> These examples aren’t wildly creative, but they all include at least one of the following: \n<ul> \n <li>A clear benefit</li> \n <li>A stat or action verb</li> \n <li>A professional tone</li> \n</ul> \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-85367 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/headline-contents.png\" alt=\"What a headline should include.\" width=\"1361\" height=\"624\" /> \n<h3>Writing Your Introduction</h3> \n<a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/blog-post-introductions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Your intro should quickly hook your audience</a> while covering the main points the rest of your document will cover. Here’s everything it should cover: \n<ul> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">State the problem your white paper intends to solve</span>. To create added urgency, it should also touch on the consequences for not taking action.</li> \n <li>&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Summarize the key areas your white paper will cover</span>. Give a high-level overview of what readers can expect from start to finish.</li> \n <li>&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Explain the benefits of reading your white paper</span>. What will your reader be equipped to do after reading what you have to say?</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Writing Each Subsection</h3> Once you’ve hooked a reader’s attention with your intro, you’ll want to keep it. Make sure each section delivers on the promises you made in your introduction. When you’re writing an extremely long-form piece, it can be easy to get lost. That’s why sticking to an outline is so important, and we do hope you spent some time putting one together. With thorough research and a strong outline in hand, you can make the actual writing exponentially easier. Let’s look at a hypothetical outline: \n<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">How to Select a Veterinarian </span> \n<ul> \n <li><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Find options in your area.</span></li> \n <li><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Research each one.</span></li> \n <li><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Make a call.</span></li> \n</ul> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/content-marketing-editorial-calendar-template/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Best Way to Get Organized With a Content Marketing Editorial Calendar (Template)</a>\n</div> If we were to write this section, we’d start with a paragraph about the importance of selecting a good veterinarian. We’d then dedicate a paragraph or two (or more) to each sub-point. Following this order will ensure your writing flows well from one point to the next in a logical order. When writing each section, consider using bulleted lists to make text easy to skim. For example: \n<ul> \n <li>This is an insightful point about your topic.</li> \n <li>Here’s another interesting piece of data.</li> \n <li>Finally, here is a third important takeaway.</li> \n</ul> Continue until you’ve worked through each portion of your outline. \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/?p=59497#toc\">Back to the Top</a></strong>\n</div> \n<a name=\"edit\"></a> \n<h2>Edit. Edit. Edit.</h2> Your first draft of a large document like this won’t be perfect, so it’s important to have a \n<a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/content-editing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sound editing process</a> in place. If your organization has another writer or editor on staff, then work together to polish your draft. \n<h3>Establish a Set Editing Process</h3> Know who your editor will be ahead of time and develop a set process. In our experience, it’s easiest to use tracked changes in Microsoft Word or Google Docs. \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-85368 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/establish-your-process.png\" alt=\"Establish your editing process.\" width=\"1361\" height=\"485\" /> If you don’t have access to an editor, and even if you do, tools like \n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http://grammarly.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Grammarly</a></span>&nbsp;and \n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http://www.hemingwayapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hemingway</a></span>&nbsp;can also be life-savers. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJ9_6ipZ6ws \n<h3>Edit for Content, Not Just Grammar</h3> While editing a white paper (or anything), it’s important to edit for content, and not just spelling and grammar. This entails asking the following questions: \n<ul> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Does this content answer all the questions a reader might have?</span>&nbsp;If something important is missing, note it for the writer.</li> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Is everything factually accurate?</span>&nbsp;Double-check facts, statistics, and sources.</li> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">How easy is your writing to understand?</span>&nbsp;If there is language or jargon your audience may not understand, note it and consider alternatives. This can be corrected with a simple search on <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http://www.thesaurus.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Thesaurus.com</a></span>.</li> \n</ul> This isn’t to say \n<a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/process-social-media-following-celeste-mora-grammarly-amp-025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">correcting grammatical and spelling errors</a> isn’t important. Far from it. However, it’s just as important (if not more so) to ensure the quality of your information is up to par as well. \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/?p=59497#toc\">Back to the Top</a></strong>\n</div> \n<a name=\"how-to\"></a> \n<h2>How to Format Your White Paper</h2> If you’re fortunate enough to have a designer on your team, they’ll likely handle design and formatting for you.

This is easy to do with Microsoft Word. All you have to do is edit your styles. Find the styles pane and right-click what you’d like to change. Let’s start with \n<strong>Normal</strong>: \n<img class=\"drop-shadow alignnone wp-image-74787 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/Blog-Ben-WhitePaper_Update-14.png\" alt=\"Formatting your headers on Microsoft Word.\" width=\"1541\" height=\"176\" /> Next, click \n<strong>Modify</strong>: \n<img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter wp-image-74754 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/update-match-style.png\" alt=\"Where to find Update to Match Style\" width=\"1360\" height=\"333\" /> Now, you can change your \n<strong>standard paragraph text</strong>: \n<img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter wp-image-74755 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/modify-style.png\" alt=\"Modify Style\" width=\"1360\" height=\"1294\" /> &nbsp; If you’d like to change your Heading 1, 2, and 3 styles, follow the same process. \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/?p=59497#toc\">Back to the Top</a></strong>\n</div> \n<a name=\"design\"></a> \n<h2>Handing Off for Design</h2> Unless you happen to be a skilled designer, it will be best to have a designer \n<a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/how-to-design-blog-graphics-with-free-tools/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">create graphics</a> for your white paper.

Two-Column Layout (Or Something More Creative)</h3> If your white paper is lengthy, you might want to consider a two-column layout. That’s because they’re easier to read and skim, thanks to shorter line length. If your designer is good, you can get creative with how a multi-column layout might look.

Now, how do you get people to actually read it? The answer is with a comprehensive promotion plan. \n<h3>Decide Where to Host Your White Paper</h3> The first thing you’ll need to decide is where your white paper is going to live. Do you host it on your website? Your blog? A landing page? There are pros and cons to each. Let’s cover each one: \n<ul> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Landing Pages</span>: <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/how-to-write-landing-pages/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Landing pages</a> are perfect for hosting your white paper on an attractively-designed page that’s optimized to convert. You can easily build landing pages with tools like <a href=\"https://unbounce.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Unbounce</a>, <a href=\"https://www.leadpages.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lead Pages</a>, or <a href=\"https://instapage.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Instapage</a>.</li> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Blog Posts</span>: This is a quick and simple option. <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/blog-writing-process/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Blog posts</a> also give you room to provide context for your white paper. Plus, being on your blog’s home page can also give it more visibility.</li> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Website Pages</span>: Resource libraries are a strong spot to put white papers. Consider creating something similar to <a href=\"https://mailchimp.com/resources/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MailChimp’s resource library</a>:</li> \n</ul> \n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-59699 size-full\" src=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/blog_white-papers-09.png\" alt=\"MailChimp resource page.\" width=\"770\" height=\"425\" /> It might be possible to combine approaches, too. For example, you could create a landing page for your white paper, link to it in a blog post, and then include the actual document in your resource library. That’s maximizing the exposure for your hard work. \n<div class=\"link-callout\"> \n <strong>Recommended Reading:&nbsp;</strong>\n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/best-times-to-post-on-social-media/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">What 23 Studies Say About the Best Times to Post on Social Media</a> \n</div> \n<h3>Use Your Email List</h3> If your email list is comprised primarily of professionals interested in the kind of research in your white paper, then send it to them.

Here are a few ways to do this. \n<h3>Spin Your Sub-Sections Into Blog Posts</h3> You can likely write an entire blog post based on each section of your white paper. This gives you the opportunity to drill deeper into each specific point. Plus, if you link back to your white paper in each post, you can direct more attention toward it. Follow this process to help turn one small point into a much deeper and valuable blog post: \n<ol> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Take a section of your white paper you think you could have expanded upon further</span>.</li> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Start writing hypothetical headlines that could work for a blog post</span>.</li> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Then, start building an outline</span>. Which points or information weren’t you able to include in your white paper? Go back to your research and dig deep to add more detail.</li> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Write your next blog post.</span></li> \n</ol> Do this for each piece of your white paper, and you’ll quickly have multiple pieces of content promoting your white paper. That’ll help you get the most mileage possible for your efforts. \n<h3>Leverage Your Research Elsewhere</h3> You probably dug up tons of interesting stats and pieces of information while doing your research. Use that information in other content you write. For example, you could easily: \n<ul> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Create new social media content sharing intriguing stats from your research.</span></li> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Include research findings in other reports or blog posts (with or without referencing your white paper, as appropriate)</span>.</li> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Pitch a speaking engagement based on your findings. </span>Dig up something your audience would be interested in? Do you belong to any professional groups or do any public speaking? Consider using part of your research as a topic for a speaking engagement or conference session.</li> \n</ul> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/?p=59497#toc\">Back to the Top</a></strong>\n</div> \n<a name=\"conclusion\"></a> \n<h2>Ready.

Lower-level marketing staff will report to them. They typically report to a CMO or CEO on behalf of the entire marketing department. This video, from \n<a href=\"https://www.informatica.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Informatica</a>, does an excellent job breaking down what their work entails. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azYKE6gX5yo \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/?p=77388#toc\">Back to the Top</a></strong>\n</div> \n<a name=\"important\"></a> \n<h2>Why is Marketing Operations Important?</h2> Now we’re clear on what marketing operations actually is, so let’s move on to the juicy part: why it’s important. We’ve already mentioned that a marketing operations manager wants to improve the output of their marketing team. That’s why one of their main priorities is to work on boosting staff productivity. [Tweet \"A main priority for a marketing operations manager is to boost staff productivity.\"] In practice, this could be a social media marketer complaining that they spend too much time doing a low-output task. That time-consuming task might be pulling their focus away from something more important or of higher value, which impacts how much work they get done. In turn, the marketing operations manager would look for tools to do it for them. Before you brush this off as a niche example, remember that modern technology could automate \n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/four-fundamentals-of-workplace-automation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">45% of the activities</a></span> people are paid to perform. There’s always a task you can cut; it’s a marketing operations manager’s job to spot it. \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-84273 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/dopson-quote.png\" alt=\"Quote from Elise Dopson about managers cutting tasks.\" width=\"1360\" height=\"580\" /> Marketing operations also keeps a marketing team on track to meet their goals. Let’s say that your monthly report shows you’re behind on your KPIs, and you aren’t predicted to meet your forecast of 500,000 website visitors by the end of Q1. Your marketing operations manager spots this, and plans a way to fix it — maybe with new assets, extra promotion of existing content, or budget for advertising. Either way, the problem is solved before it starts stunting growth even further. \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-84274 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/mo-process.png\" alt=\"The process behind how marketing operations functions.\" width=\"1360\" height=\"4386\" /> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/?p=77388#toc\">Back to the Top</a></strong>\n</div> \n<a name=\"five\"></a> \n<h2>5 Marketing Operations Processes You Need</h2> Now you know that marketing operations is a key part of any marketing department, you might be questioning which processes your manager will handle. Here are five processes you need to create from the get-go: \n<h3>1. Budget Management</h3> Did you know that the average company spends \n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://vtldesign.com/digital-marketing/content-marketing-strategy/percent-of-revenue-spent-on-marketing-sales/#:~:targetText=The%20average%20percentage%20of%20total,The%20least%20successful%20spend%2014%25.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">26% of their annual revenue</a></span>&nbsp;on marketing? Sure, your marketing operations manager will need a process to define how much of your revenue will be assigned to marketing efforts. They’ll also need to break down how that budget is proportioned to various channels or departments, such as: \n<ul> \n <li>Email marketing</li> \n <li>Social advertising</li> \n <li>Content creation</li> \n</ul> This process varies dramatically from company to company. You might decide to \n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-manage-marketing-budget-free-budget-templates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">split your budget</a></span> proportionally based on how important each channel is for your business, or you might be planning an advertising campaign that needs more budget at specific times of the year. Your marketing operations manager needs a plan of action of \n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/marketing-strategy/marketing-budget/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">how to set those budgets</a></span> — and, more importantly, make sure you’re not overspending. \n<h3>2. Lead Management</h3> Marketing teams shouldn’t work in silos. It’s your marketing operation manager’s job to make sure that the leads you’re driving from marketing are converting into sales-qualified leads. It’s harder than you might think; just \n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://www.geckoboard.com/learn/kpi-examples/sales-kpis/mql-to-sql-conversion-rate/#:~:targetText=Implisit%20analyzed%20the%20pipelines%20of,source%20of%20the%20lead%20was.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">13% of MQLs</a></span> convert to SQLs. \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-84275 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/mql-sql.png\" alt=\"13% of MQLs convert to SQLs.\" width=\"1360\" height=\"580\" /> Failing to convert your marketing leads could lead to your department wasting their time and budget. You’re attracting people who won’t buy — making your entire strategy pointless. However, a \n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/lead-generation-process/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">lead management process</a></span>&nbsp;constantly evaluates this conversion rate. It also allows marketing teams to collaborate with sales to identify your top customers, so you can rejig your strategy to attract them. That’ll work wonders on your marketing ROI. \n<h3>3. Reporting and Analytics</h3> Reporting has gained a reputation for being boring, but while your creative team might not want to digest data, you won’t know whether your strategy is working without them. A marketing operations manager needs a process for creating these reports, which includes: \n<ul> \n <li>Who creates the reports?</li> \n <li>How often?</li> \n <li>What should they report on?</li> \n <li>Who needs to read them?</li> \n <li>How are they made?</li> \n</ul> The good news? This process doesn’t have to be complex. Simply write up the answers to those points in a shared document and explain it to your team. Tell them to follow that process when they create a new marketing report. \n<h3>4. Asset management</h3> Every marketing team has assets. This usually includes content (i.e. blog posts, videos, and podcasts). [Tweet \"Every marketing team has assets. This usually includes content (i.e. blog posts, videos, and podcasts).\"] A marketing operations manager needs to control everything related to these assets, including their: \n<ul> \n <li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/content-creation-process/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Creation</a></span></li> \n <li>Licensing</li> \n <li>Usage</li> \n</ul> Without a process for this, your assets will be all over the place. It might lead to serious problems, like using a non-licensed image, then getting into trouble because you’ve used it without permission. That can be avoided with a marketing operations process that makes sure images are licensed before they’re passed onto marketing teams. Bonus: CoSchedule's&nbsp;\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/asset-organizer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Asset Organizer</a></span> is the ideal tool for this. You can store all of your assets in one place and organize them by usage — like conference slides, social media images, or business cards. \n<h3>5. Data Management</h3> It’s no secret that we have more data than ever before; 90% of the world’s data was created within \n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/291358/90-of-todays-data-created-in-two-years.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">two years</a></span>. With so much data available, it can quickly become overwhelming. Every dashboard has a set of metrics, and each new tool introduces you to a bunch of new metrics. That’s why your marketing operations team needs a process that defines: \n<ul> \n <li>How you’ll collect data.</li> \n <li>What you’ll collect.</li> \n <li>How you’ll use it.</li> \n</ul> A marketing operations team also needs to include how they’ll clean data — especially when cleaning up old, outdated, or inaccurate data can help you generate up to \n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/RingLead/the-cost-of-bad-and-clean-data\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">70% more revenue</a></span>. Remember, if you’re collecting your customer's data, you’ll need to tell them all of the above, too — usually through a disclaimer or privacy policy. Work with your \n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://digitalguardian.com/blog/what-data-protection-officer-dpo-learn-about-new-role-required-gdpr-compliance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Data Protection Officer</a></span> on this. \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/marketing-request-forms-template/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Marketing Request Forms: How to Create One Your Team Will Actually Use</a>\n</div> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/?p=77388#toc\">Back to the Top</a></strong>\n</div> \n<a name=\"implement\"></a> \n<h2>How to Implement a Marketing Operations Process</h2> Creating a marketing operations process sounds easier than it looks. You’ll need to think about how your team are involved, the frequency of each process, and the tools you’ll need to make them happen. \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong>\n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/marketing-operations-strategy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> The Best Marketing Operations Strategy to Help Overloaded Marketing Managers</a>\n</div> The best news? There is a simple process you can use to get started. \n<h3>1. Use a Team Management Dashboard</h3> Earlier, we discussed how a marketing operations manager will define tasks for their team. You don’t have to remember who is responsible for each, individual part of the process you’re creating, though. A team management dashboard allows your entire department to see who is responsible for what and check that tasks in the workflow are being completed. Let’s put that into practice using the asset management process. The following team members have different responsibilities: \n<ol> \n <li>Ellie takes photographs.</li> \n <li>Lucy will get them copyrighted.</li> \n <li>Matt will plan to use them in <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/social-media-content/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">social media content</a></span>.</li> \n <li>Jason will proof and publish them.</li> \n</ol> To find your team management dashboard inside CoSchedule, click the \n<strong>Team</strong> option from your dropdown menu. You’ll see a complete view of the jobs your team are working on each day, along with how many \"Unscheduled,\" \"Past Due,\" and \"Completed\" tasks are on their schedule. \n<img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/e7f467be-e7c6-4488-9781-5c0605e4d469_Screen20Shot202018-11-2320at202.14.4220PM.png\" alt=\"team management dashboard\" width=\"1098\" height=\"658\" /> A team management dashboard stops things from getting missed throughout the process. Each team member also knows what they need to do and when — helping with accountability. \n<h3>2. Create Templates For Each Task</h3> Think of how long you spend creating the same tasks. It’s a tedious job, right? Remember, a marketing operations manager needs to find smart ways to cut time and improve productivity — not just for their staff, but themselves, too! [Tweet \"A marketing operations manager needs to find smart ways to cut time and improve productivity — not just for their staff, but themselves, too!\"] You can do that by creating templates for each task in your process. If you’re using CoSchedule, create a new project to use as your template. Add the tasks that need to be completed to tick-off that entire project, and click \n<strong>Assign</strong> to give a team member control over that task. \n<img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/37b35054-879c-4d97-b25e-ad30a55d6922_Screenshot202020-01-1920at2014.53.09.png\" alt=\"assign tasks in coschedule\" width=\"1600\" height=\"624\" /> Simply duplicate this project when it’s time to run through the process again. Your entire department can see who is responsible for each step, and you’ll get a notification when each task is completed — which stops important things from getting missed. \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/marketing-tasks-checklist-template/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Best Way to Plan and Organize Marketing Tasks With Checklists</a>\n</div> \n<h3>3. Monitor Team Performance Reports</h3> We’ve already mentioned that a marketing operations manager's goal is to improve efficiency in their team. It’s their job to make sure they spend time on high-growth tasks and maximize your overall marketing ROI. How can you know whether or not you’re doing that? The simple answer: \n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/team-performance-reports-demo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Performance reports</a>,</span>&nbsp;which break down your team’s activities. They’ll show you answers to questions such as: \n<ul> \n <li>Are they meeting deadlines?</li> \n <li>How much time are they spending on each task?</li> \n <li>Is there a tool you can use to cut time/improve performance?</li> \n</ul> Find the answers for your team by heading to your CoSchedule dashboard and clicking \n<strong>Analytics</strong>. From there, select the \n<strong>Team Performance</strong> report option: \n<img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/29d95a08-3830-4965-933f-1f06c79bc898_pasted20image200.png\" alt=\"coschedule's team performance report\" width=\"1082\" height=\"821\" /> There are a bunch of interesting metrics in here, such as your average task completion rate, the percentage of tasks completed on time, and the number of tasks overdue. Scroll a little further, and you’ll see the same metrics broken down by marketing team member. \n<img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/811d8b2f-f379-446d-b28a-7f67cb526046_Screenshot202020-01-2220at2014.24.24.png\" alt=\"coschedule's team member performance report\" width=\"1600\" height=\"982\" /> Using the performance dashboard, you see that your social media team are spending three hours each week copying and pasting evergreen content that’s performed in the past. As a result, those tasks are often completed past their original due date. Instead of allowing them to waste time doing this task manually, why not use CoSchedule to \n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/social-media-automation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">automate their social posting</a></span>? The ReQueue feature allows you to share old content with one click — no faffing around or digging through your feed to find content to repost. That could give them an extra two hours every week to use elsewhere. \n<h3>4. Choose Tools That Integrate Well Together</h3> You don’t need to search for tools that wipe out complete tasks that your team does. Some tasks, like private messages with potential leads, need a human touch. That’s not to say you can’t use technology to cut down the time they spend writing them or do a better job at it. Take email subscriptions, for example. We all want more high-quality leads on our list, right? People who fit that bill might be those already engaging with your SMS marketing campaigns. Send a message asking whether they’d like to sign-up to your list, using an automation to get them added. There’s no waiting for your customer, nor extra admin work for your team. They’re on your email list within a matter of seconds. If you’re using CoSchedule to manage your marketing strategy, you have access to hundreds of similar automations for each channel, including: \n<ul> \n <li>WordPress</li> \n <li>Social media</li> \n <li>Email service providers (e.g. MailChimp, Constant Contact, Active Campaign, and Campaign Monitor)</li> \n</ul> [Tweet \"If you’re using CoSchedule to manage your marketing strategy, you have access to hundreds of similar automations for each channel.\"] Some \n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://www.emailmonday.com/marketing-automation-statistics-overview/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">63% of marketers</a></span> say they saw the benefits of using marketing automation within the first six months. It’s one of the easiest ways for a marketing operations manager to start maximizing their team’s time and focus on high-growth marketing tactics. \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-84277 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/marketing-automation.png\" alt=\"63% of marketers seeing the benefits of marketing operations.\" width=\"1360\" height=\"580\" /> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/?p=77388#toc\">Back to the Top</a></strong>\n</div> \n<a name=\"processes\"></a> \n<h2>Operationalizing Your Marketing Processes</h2> Efficient and effective processes are one of the key components of marketing operations. A successful marketing team doesn’t just set it and forget it, they are constantly improving and tailoring best practices. \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong>\n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/marketing-project-management-skills/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> 8 Marketing Project Management Skills You Need to Lead a Successful Team</a>\n</div> Start by planning and documenting your workflows. Documenting your workflows means that everyone knows the correct order of operations, when tasks are due, and where their contributions fit into the project’s timeline. They are essential for completing work on time, every time. A documented workflow also means that you can spend more time doing meaningful work and less time following-up with every person at every stage of a marketing project. Here’s how to do it: \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Step 1:</strong>&nbsp;Determine each team member’s role for each type of project you execute regularly.</li> \n <li><strong>Step 2:</strong>&nbsp;Map out each task that needs to be completed.</li> \n <li><strong>Step 3:</strong>&nbsp;Next, assign the task and determine the length of time needed to complete each task.</li> \n <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Work back from there to determine the necessary project length and attach task due dates for each step in the workflow.</li> \n</ul> For example, here’s what this might look like for a webinar: \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Generate ideas:</strong> Strategist – due 30 days before launch</li> \n <li><strong>Recruit guest:</strong> Strategist – Due 25 days before launch</li> \n <li><strong>Create talking points:</strong> Strategist – Due 18 days before launch</li> \n <li><strong>Design slide deck:</strong> Designer – Due 17 days before launch</li> \n <li><strong>Include in drip campaign:</strong> Marketing Automation – Due 14 days before launch</li> \n <li><strong>Approve slide deck:</strong> Strategist – Due 12 days before launch</li> \n <li><strong>Schedule social promotion:</strong> Writer/Social Strategist – 10 days before launch</li> \n <li><strong>Test run-through:</strong> Guest and Host – 1 day before launch</li> \n</ul> Let’s illustrate how this can be done with CoSchedule. In the top right-hand corner of your project, click the task template icon. Then, create a new task template. Name your workflow and add each task associated with the project. Next, you can add a due date for each task and assign it to the relevant team member. Now, your webinar workflow is documented and ready to be attached to every webinar project from here on out. \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/?p=77388#toc\">Back to the Top</a></strong>\n</div> \n<a name=\"agile\"></a> \n<h2>Consider Implementing an Agile Approach</h2> Agile refers to a flexible marketing approach in which teams identify high-value projects, break those project down into smaller deliverables, measure their impact, and then iterate on the results to incrementally improve. \n<a href=\"https://coschedule.com/agile-marketing-guide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Agile Marketing</a> provides marketing teams a set process for running most marketing campaigns. Here is a very high-level explanation of how to get started applying this methodology with your team: \n<h3>Step 1: Define the Project</h3> Before you get started, make sure that the project is a good fit for an Agile approach. Agile is best fit for big projects that can easily be divided up into smaller pieces. Think website redesigns and large marketing campaigns. \n<h3>Step 2: Sprint Planning Meeting</h3> Next, schedule the sprint planning meeting. Everyone who will be working on the project will attend this meeting. Discuss each task and deliverable for the project. \n<h3>Step 3: Task Breakdown</h3> Each task within the project needs to be broken down. This should be fairly granular. For example, writing, proofing, and approving the blog post could be separate tasks. At this time, the head of the project (most likely the marketing manager) will ask info regarding how much time each task will take to accomplish. These tasks could be visualized using a Kanban board. \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-84278 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/kanban-board-example-1.png\" alt=\"Visual representation of what the Kanban board looks like.\" width=\"1361\" height=\"777\" /> \n<h3>Step 4: Daily Scrums</h3> Once you have all your tasks planned, teams start working on their tasks. To keep track of your project, you will begin having daily check-in meetings. These are extremely short and should only take 5-10 minutes. \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-84279\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/daily-standup.png\" alt=\"Definition of daily standups.\" width=\"1360\" height=\"1395\" /> Each team member will answer three questions: \n<ul> \n <li>What did you do yesterday?</li> \n <li>What will you do today?</li> \n <li>Any roadblocks?</li> \n</ul> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/?p=77388#toc\">Back to the Top</a></strong>\n</div> \n<a name=\"conclusion\"></a> \n<h2>Ready to Get Started?</h2> Marketing operations is a key part of any company. Without it, you’ll spend time on the wrong things — focusing on low-growth activities that waste everyone’s time. The simplest way to get started is to list the processes your team follows. Then, create a marketing operations process for each task using the guide above. You’ll soon start to see how much work you get done when one-off tasks and confusion are gone! \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/marketing-request-forms-template/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Marketing Request Forms: How to Create One Your Team Will Actually Use</a>\n</div> \n<em>This post was originally published on Feb. 19, 2020.

Make Space to Fail and Learn</h3>\nThose who fail together, trust each other. Those who fail, have the opportunity to learn and produce better work in the future.\n\nMake your workplace a sacred place where failing is acceptable — as long as something is learned from it.\n\n[Tweet \"Make your workplace a sacred place where failing is acceptable.\"]\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Example:</span> One thing we do at <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://blackandwhitezebra.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">our company</a></span> is the monthly Hack Day. We set aside all other work and “jam” on something together.\n\nOur Hack Days look like this:\n<ol>\n \t<li>We set a day in advance. We clear our schedules of normal tasks during that day. Sometimes client-facing colleagues will set an <strong>Out of Office</strong> automated reply, just in case.</li>\n \t<li>On the Hack Day, our team lead chooses a project to work on and presents the project to the group in the morning. We break down tasks, decide on responsibilities, and then break away to complete the work.</li>\n \t<li>We have a team lunch, and we have a more casual chat about what we’re working on and what we’re learning.</li>\n \t<li>In the later half of the day, we see the pieces coming together. At the end of the day, we sit back and take a look at what’s been done.</li>\n \t<li>Most of our projects are web-based and take a few weeks to come fully to fruition, so we usually review Hack Day projects on a monthly or quarterly basis, rather than doing a full review on the day we make it.</li>\n</ol>\nSometimes Hack Day tanks, but sometimes it’s the prototype for a brand new product.\n\nHere are other ways to make space to fail:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Ask your team members to include one thing that <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">didn’t </span>work in your monthly review, and explain why it didn’t work.</li>\n \t<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/agile-marketing-guide/agile-retrospective/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hold retrospectives</a></span> where your team can talk openly about things that did and didn’t work in your projects.</li>\n \t<li>Model the behavior — show your team when something you tried didn’t work.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>4. Set Aside Time to Regularly Meet With the Team</h3>\nFar too many of us are overworked. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://thedigitalprojectmanager.com/video-how-motivate-overworked-team/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Motivating an overworked team</a></span> is tough, especially when you feel like you don’t have the extra time for personal check-ins.\n\nThe occasional team lunch or one-on-one coffee might seem like an unnecessary expense, but it can do wonders for your marketing team’s happiness and morale. Your team will be happier if there is a sense of friendship and trust within the group.\n<div class=\"link-callout\"><strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/content-marketing-strategy-template/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Complete Start to Finish Content Marketing Strategy Guide (Template)</a></div>\nThis also means being quick to address conflict, so it doesn’t bring everyone down by proxy. Give your marketing team a chance to forge a strong relationship. People don’t like to feel like they are just another cog in the machine.\n\nTake the time to get to know your team.\n\nWhat are their hobbies? Do they have family in the area? What do they do on the weekend?\n\nMeet with your team members, one on one, and ask about:\n\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-85037 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/1-1-meetings.png\" alt=\"Questions to ask during 1-1 meetings.\" width=\"1361\" height=\"802\" />\n<h3>5. Stop Moving the Goal Posts</h3>\nOur digital world moves quickly, and many of us are guilty of moving goal posts as we get more data about how a particular campaign is going. It’s tempting to set a goal, reach a goal, and then say, “Okay, what’s the next goal?” Maybe the previous one was just too low of a guess.\n\nWhen you’re laying out your goals, take your time to <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/marketing-strategy/marketing-goals/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">set realistic, business-driven marketing goals</a></span> that will be a good cause for celebration when you achieve them.\n\nYou can use a sophisticated <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://peoplemanagingpeople.com/tools/okr-software/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">OKR software</a></span> that’s designed to help you do this, but even if you do, I caution you against setting too many metrics-based goals.\n\nWorking with too many KPIs or working with goal posts that shift place every time you near them is demotivating. What you need is a clear, concrete, and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://venngage.com/blog/growth-strategy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">OKR-driven growth strategy</a></span> that’s ambitious yet realistic.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-85038 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/smart.png\" alt=\"What the S.M.A.R.T. acronym means.\" width=\"1361\" height=\"543\" />\n\nUse concrete, achievable goals, and use them sparingly.\n\nExamples of goals:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Increase conversion rate by 1% this month.</li>\n \t<li>Double the number of places we cross-sell our product this year.</li>\n \t<li>Maintain our client rating of 4.8 stars through the quarter.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>6. Take Time to Understand Each Team Member's Long-term Goals and Help Them Get There</h3>\nThis goes hand-in-hand with getting to know your team as individuals and taking the time to understand what really motivates each of your team members.\n\nFew of us were born with the desire to run really effective instagram campaigns for a local restaurant chain. We all have real life goals that have far more sway over our day to day choices (e.g. starting a family, helping a parent, starting a business, being in a local play, getting in shape, finding a partner, etc.).\n\nDo you know what your marketing team envisions for themselves this year? In five years? Ten?\n\n[Tweet \"Do you know what your marketing team envisions for themselves? Ask them.\"]\n\nTake the time to ask.\n\nHere are some questions to get you started.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-85039 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/professional-goals.png\" alt=\"Learning about your employee's professional goals.\" width=\"1361\" height=\"801\" />\n\nWhen the people on your marketing team feel valued on a personal level, this will invigorate a project and heighten your chances for success. That’s why it’s important to keep your marketing teams happy.\n<h2>Summary</h2>\nThere’s no golden set of rules for any team, but in our team, these are the things that work. Following these six rules helps us feel invigorated, motivated, and happy to be part of our team:\n<ol>\n \t<li>Play to people’s strengths.</li>\n \t<li>Provide resources they actually want.</li>\n \t<li>Make space to fail and learn.</li>\n \t<li>Set aside time to meet with the team regularly.</li>\n \t<li>Stop moving the goal posts.</li>\n \t<li>Take time to understand each team member's long-term goals, and help them get there.</li>\n</ol>\nWe know that <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http://tintin.hec.ca/pages/decio.coviello/research_files/MoodCallCenter.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">people do their best work when they are in a good mood</a></span>, and as a marketing team leader, you can follow these guidelines in order to set the stage for happy colleagues who do their best work.\n<div class=\"link-callout\"><strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/marketing-project-management-skills/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">8 Marketing Project Management Skills You Need to Lead a Successful Team</a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/marketing-leadership/\">Marketing Leadership: 6 Rules For Leading Happy Teams</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://coschedule.com\">CoSchedule Blog</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 10 Aug 2020 13:00:00 +0000","feedId":4227,"bgimg":"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/marketing-leadership-header.png","linkMd5":"caa33706565d41f2ed48e2a289af696a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn76@2020_4/2020/08/24/21-56-11-031_a36fb4dd1a83ac0e.webp","destWidth":1361,"destHeight":581,"sourceBytes":88115,"destBytes":42808,"author":"Sarah Tolle","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/marketing-leadership-header.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn76@2020_4/2020/08/24/21-56-11-031_a36fb4dd1a83ac0e.webp","https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/resource-questions.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn15@2020_6/2020/08/24/21-56-39-153_e39e3ae0cf32988f.webp","https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/1-1-meetings.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn12@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-56-40-204_59b7c07587649603.webp","https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/smart.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn67@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-56-27-164_4949e94139ea1bcb.webp","https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/professional-goals.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn83@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-56-36-226_1ae6752a5b281ff5.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598306169463},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 05:56:09","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 05:56:09","title":"52 Effective Social Media Post Ideas and Examples to Fill Your Calendar","link":"https://coschedule.com/blog/?p=55297","description":"<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-83905 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/06/social-media-post-ideas-examples.png\" alt=\"Social media post ideas and examples header.\" width=\"1361\" height=\"580\" /> For a marketer, there's nothing worse than struggling with a creative block.

Sometimes, you just don't feel like you have anything kicking around in your head.</li> \n <li><strong>Constant fire drills to find content to share</strong>.

Oftentimes, brands struggle to keep up with their social posting schedule because they're too reliant on one-off posts. This makes staying organized difficult. Plus, it's tough to always be writing posts on the fly without much thought ahead of time. Plan campaigns. These can be around: \n<ul> \n <li>Campaigns to promote events.</li> \n <li>A series of posts promoting a single piece of content.</li> \n <li>A string of branded posts carrying a consistent message or hashtag.</li> \n</ul> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/social-media-campaign-examples/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">24 Creative Social Media Campaign Examples to Boost Your Inspiration</a>\n</div> \n<h3>Schedule Ad Hoc Posts</h3> In addition to your planned campaigns, mix in some ad hoc posts. These are spontaneous one-off posts that aren't necessarily connected to a broader campaign, but they still reinforce your overall brand message. This leaves some flexibility in your schedule — making it easier to react to trending topics and hashtags, which you can capitalize on for added brand exposure. With these three tips and all of the following ideas, you should have no trouble staying inspired and keeping your posting schedule full. \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/?p=55297#toc\">Back to the Top</a></strong>\n</div> \n<a name=\"ideas\"></a> \n<h2>52 Content Ideas For Businesses to Post on Social Media</h2> There's an endless possibility of content to share on social media, but these are the types of content your audience will appreciate. \n<h3>1. Your Company's Blog Posts</h3> Does your business have a blog? The best way to get your blog&nbsp;seen is to share it on your own social media platforms. You know it's relevant to your business because&nbsp;\n<em>it came from your business.&nbsp;</em> \n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-55795 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/Blog-Halle-CreativeIdeas-New-2.png\" alt=\"Facebook post from CoSchedule.\" width=\"544\" height=\"606\" /> Be sure the content you're writing for your business blog is valuable and will connect with your audience. \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/blog-writing-process/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Ultimate Blog Writing Process to Create Killer Posts</a>\n</div> \n<h3>2.&nbsp;Posts Showing Your Company's Culture</h3> What better way to showcase your business than by sharing a culture post? A culture post is an image or article that highlights what your business is all about. It could be a behind-the-scenes image of your employees doing something quirky, or an article about how your business does something a certain way. \n<img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter wp-image-83469 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/06/culture-post-example.png\" alt=\"Culture post about CoSchedule on Instagram.\" width=\"1360\" height=\"874\" /> &nbsp; \n<h3>3. Industry News</h3> In raw numbers, news articles get more social shares than any other type of article. Most businesses that produce content are focusing on deep, \n<a href=\"http://neilpatel.com/2015/11/26/why-you-need-to-create-evergreen-long-form-content-and-how-to-produce-it/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">long-form content</a> rather than as-it-happens breaking news. Create a list of news sources in your industry. This could include trade publications or websites. Then, find those sources on Twitter and follow them. When they share something interesting, retweet it to your followers or share it on another social network, like Facebook or Google+. \n<h3>4. Curated Content</h3> Content curation is simply sharing the content of others in your niche. Sometimes, the things you want to share with your audience have already been written. Rather than spending the time crafting an in-depth post, you can quickly share one that's already been written (by giving them credit, of course). At CoSchedule, we use our handy-dandy \n<a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/social-curation-tool-chrome-extension/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chrome Extension</a> tool to help with our content curation. Here's an example of a post we shared from Kissmetrics: \n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-55799 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/Blog-Halle-CreativeIdeas-New-4.png\" alt=\"Shared post from Kissmetrics.\" width=\"613\" height=\"435\" /> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/social-media-content-curation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How to Schedule Your Social Media Content Curation For Massive Growth</a>\n</div> \n<h3>5. Question Posts</h3> Not everything you share on social media&nbsp;\n<em>has&nbsp;</em>to be a blog post or article. Get your audience talking and engaging with one another by asking a burning question. For example, you could ask, \"What sort of content should I blog about next?\" It's the best way to know what your audience \n<em>really&nbsp;</em>wants to read. Asking a fun question or creating a Twitter poll is a good way to get your audience's insights. \n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-55800 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/Blog-Halle-CreativeIdeas-New-6.png\" alt=\"Twitter poll about gifs.\" width=\"613\" height=\"347\" /> \n<h3>6. Product/Company Videos</h3> Visuals are eye-catching when your audience is&nbsp;scrolling through their news feed. It’s been proven time and time again that visuals help improve engagement, but what about videos? Research shows that videos have a \n<a href=\"http://wersm.com/5-stats-that-show-how-big-video-is-on-facebook/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">135% greater organic reach</a> compared to photos. That’s a crazy high number. Take advantage of this organic reach opportunity by sharing videos about your company or a new product you have. \n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-55801 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/Blog-Halle-CreativeIdeas-New-7.png\" alt=\"CoSchedule sharing a video about ReQueue.\" width=\"613\" height=\"525\" /> \n<h3>7. Customer Reviews and Testimonials</h3> Does your company have dedicated fans? Let their voices be heard and share their thoughts on your social media. You can do this by retweeting their kind words or creating a graphic with their testimonial directly on it. Don't forget to include their name/handle! \n<img class=\"drop-shadow wp-image-83883 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/06/melissa-flicks.png\" alt=\"Customer testimonial post.\" width=\"770\" height=\"404\" /> \n<h3>8. Quick Tips and Advice</h3> Aside from sharing an entire \"How to\" post giving in-depth tips and advice, you can share a few tips that you think are the MOST important. Sharing a simple tidbit is an easy way to share valuable information with your audience. Here at CoSchedule, we call them \"Pro Tips\". \n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-55802 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/Blog-Halle-CreativeIdeas-New-8.png\" alt=\"Pro Tip from CoSchedule.\" width=\"613\" height=\"163\" /> \n<h3>9. Memes or GIFs</h3> Aside from sharing images to your social media, you can use memes and GIFs when publishing your content. This adds a fun spin to your plain post and will be too irresistible for your audience to scroll past. \n<blockquote>\n GIFs are a great way to \n <a href=\"https://www.heyorca.com/blog/content-strategy/the-gift-of-gifs/\">showcase your brand’s personality</a>, stay trendy, and have fun. – HeyOrca\n</blockquote> Memes and GIFs are extremely \n<a href=\"http://www.convinceandconvert.com/social-media-case-studies/gifs-on-twitter/\">popular on social media, even among top companies.</a>&nbsp;At CoSchedule, we’ve recently started using memes and GIFs on Twitter and have found that they receive far more likes and retweets than regular images. \n<div class=\"SandboxRoot env-bp-350\" data-twitter-event-id=\"1\"> \n <div id=\"twitter-widget-1\" class=\"EmbeddedTweet EmbeddedTweet--mediaForward media-forward js-clickToOpenTarget js-tweetIdInfo\" lang=\"en\" data-click-to-open-target=\"https://twitter.com/CoSchedule/status/764174059831750656\" data-iframe-title=\"Twitter Tweet\" data-dt-full=\"%{hours12}:%{minutes} %{amPm} - %{day} %{month} %{year}\" data-dt-months=\"Jan|Feb|Mar|Apr|May|Jun|Jul|Aug|Sep|Oct|Nov|Dec\" data-dt-am=\"AM\" data-dt-pm=\"PM\" data-dt-now=\"now\" data-dt-s=\"s\" data-dt-m=\"m\" data-dt-h=\"h\" data-dt-second=\"second\" data-dt-seconds=\"seconds\" data-dt-minute=\"minute\" data-dt-minutes=\"minutes\" data-dt-hour=\"hour\" data-dt-hours=\"hours\" data-dt-abbr=\"%{number}%{symbol}\" data-dt-short=\"%{day} %{month}\" data-dt-long=\"%{day} %{month} %{year}\" data-scribe=\"page:tweet\" data-tweet-id=\"764174059831750656\" data-twitter-event-id=\"5\">\n  <article class=\"MediaCard MediaCard--mediaForward customisable-border\" dir=\"ltr\" data-scribe=\"component:card\"> \n   <div class=\"MediaCard-media\">\n    <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-55803 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/Blog-Halle-CreativeIdeas-New-9.png\" alt=\"Meme on Twitter.\" width=\"760\" height=\"796\" />\n   </div> \n   <div class=\"MediaCard-media\"></div> \n   <div class=\"MediaCard-media\">\n    Just remember to keep the meme or GIF relevant to your company and audience!\n   </div> \n   <h3 class=\"MediaCard-widthConstraint js-cspForcedStyle\" data-style=\"max-width: 1004px\">10. Contest Posts</h3> \n   <div class=\"MediaCard-widthConstraint js-cspForcedStyle\" data-style=\"max-width: 1004px\">\n    Encouraging people to participate in a social media contest related to your brand will boost engagement with those who are already followers. They can help you increase subscribers by requiring those who don’t follow or like your page to do so in order to participate.\n   </div> \n   <div class=\"MediaCard-widthConstraint js-cspForcedStyle\" data-style=\"max-width: 1004px\"></div> \n   <div class=\"MediaCard-widthConstraint js-cspForcedStyle\" data-style=\"max-width: 1004px\">\n    Be clear about your objectives and exactly how you want your audience to participate for the best outcome.

Holiday Posts</h3> No matter where you live, holidays are a big deal. Show your holiday spirit by sharing a holiday-related post on your business page. Whether it be an image, video, or article, your audience will appreciate that your business has real people that also get excited about holidays! Starbucks is known for getting exceptionally excited during Christmas season. \n  <img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter wp-image-38486 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/starbucks-christmas-post.png\" alt=\"Starbucks Christmas post.\" width=\"770\" height=\"762\" /> \n  <h3>12. Photos From Company Events</h3> We discussed sharing culture posts that showcase your company's personality, but you can take that a step further by sharing photos from a company event. If your business hosts a charity event or fundraiser, a great way to spread awareness is by sharing it on social media. \n  <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-55806 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/Blog-Halle-CreativeIdeas-New-11.png\" alt=\"TBT post from Border States Electric.\" width=\"760\" height=\"798\" /> \n  <h3>13. Post an Answer to a Commonly Asked Question</h3> Are you receiving the same question over and over again from your audience? Instead of constantly responding to this question one by one, solve it once and for all by sharing a post with the answer. \n </div> \n</div> Make sure to \"pin\" the answer to the top of your social media page, so your audience can easily see it. Here's how to \n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/235598533193464\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pin posts on Facebook</a> and \n<a href=\"https://socialmediaweek.org/blog/2015/02/60-second-tip-how-to-pin-a-tweet-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Twitter</a>. \n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-55807 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/Blog-Halle-CreativeIdeas-New-12.png\" alt=\"How to pin posts.\" width=\"760\" height=\"410\" /> \n<h3>14. Share Infographics</h3> Infographics are a fantastic way to show a step-by-step guide, especially on Pinterest (hello, DIY). Infographics allow you to share \n<em>a ton</em> of information with the use of visuals. They make boring statistics look appealing! Whether it be your own or a curated infographic, your audience will be drawn to the visual aspect and be sure to keep reading. \n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-55810 size-full\" src=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Blog-Halle-CreativeIdeas-New-13.png\" alt=\"Pinterest post about social media stats.\" width=\"325\" height=\"597\" /> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/social-media-images/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How to Make the Best Social Media Images the Easy Way (+84 Free Images)</a>\n</div> \n<h3>15. Start a Conversation With a Leader In Your Industry</h3> Cross-promote yourself by getting your name out there. The best way to do this is to start a conversation with somebody in your niche. Twitter is a great way to start up a conversation your audience will see. Find an industry leader's Twitter handle and make the first move! This presentation from Jay Baer explains the importance of connecting with influencers and how to find them. [slideshare id=37832657&amp;doc=8thingsonlineinfluencerscandoforyou-140809150058-phpapp01] \n<h3>16. Links to Free Resources</h3> Who doesn't love free stuff? Whether it be ebooks, white papers, or other downloadable content, your audience will appreciate the free resources. Put together a content bundle or a downloadable infographic, so your audience can use it for reference. You can get all of our bundles for FREE \n<a href=\"https://coschedule.com/resources\">here!</a> \n<img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter wp-image-55811 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/Blog-Halle-CreativeIdeas-New-14.png\" alt=\"National Give Something Away Day.\" width=\"770\" height=\"397\" /> \n<h3>17.&nbsp;Podcast Episodes</h3> Sometimes reading content can be time-consuming, so give your audience's eyes a break and share a podcast episode. Even better; start your own! We recently started our \n<a href=\"https://coschedule.com/podcast\">own podcast</a>&nbsp;and have had great success with it! We cover topics and challenges our audience faces. If you decide to start your own podcast, check out \n<a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/how-to-start-a-podcast/\">this post</a> to help get you started. \n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-55813 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/Blog-Halle-CreativeIdeas-New-15.png\" alt=\"Getting a podcast started.\" width=\"770\" height=\"604\" /> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/how-to-start-a-podcast/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How to Start a Podcast (Authentic Advice from Someone Who's Done It)</a>\n</div> \n<h3>18. New Job Listings</h3> Is your team expanding? Let your audience know! Who better to work for your company than a dedicated fan who's watched your company grow? Maybe they have a friend who would be interested in working for you. Be sure to list what positions are open, like Built Visible does in this example: \n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-55895 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/Blog-Halle-CreativeIdeas-New-25.png\" alt=\"Builtvisible posting about available positions.\" width=\"664\" height=\"675\" /> \n<h3>19. Hiring Announcements and New Team Members</h3> After posting your job listing, you're likely going to find the right candidate. Once you've found the right candidate(s), take it a step further and show them off to your audience. Let everyone know that you're excited to have them be part of your team. \n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-55814 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/Blog-Halle-CreativeIdeas-New-16.png\" alt=\"Introducing new members.\" width=\"770\" height=\"589\" /> \n<h3>20. \"On This Day In History\" Posts</h3> The Huffington Post shares \"\n<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/this-day-in-history/\">on this day in history</a>\" articles every day. Take this approach and use it in your own social media strategy. Find something interesting that happened in your town or city, and let your audience know! You can also share \"National Day\" posts. Check out \n<a href=\"http://www.nationaldaycalendar.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NationalCalendarDay.com</a> to find things like National Coffee Day — and tons of other days you probably never knew existed — and create some posts for ones relevant to that day. \n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-55877 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/Blog-Halle-CreativeIdeas-New-17.png\" alt=\"Sharing National Day posts.\" width=\"770\" height=\"808\" /> \n<h3>21. Event Promotion</h3> If an event happens and nobody hears about it, did it really happen? You can create an Event Page on Facebook to make your event feel more personable to your audience. Then \n<a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/event-marketing-plan/\">promote the heck out of it</a> on your social media channels! \n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-55878 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/Blog-Halle-CreativeIdeas-New-18.png\" alt=\"Creating events pages to help promotions.\" width=\"770\" height=\"559\" /> \n<h3>22. Live Videos</h3> Live videos have become huuuuge on social media recently. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, AND Snapchat have options for going live. Find the \n<a href=\"http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/how-to-choose-best-live-video-platform/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">right platform</a> that works best for you and where you will get the most views from your audience. Try to make it a weekly video. For instance, \"Tip Tuesday\" or \"Fun Fact Friday\". This way your audience will be sure to tune in on those days. \n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-55880 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/Blog-Halle-CreativeIdeas-New-19.png\" alt=\"Weekly live videos.\" width=\"322\" height=\"559\" /> \n<h3>23. Promote Email Sign-Ups</h3> If you want your audience to attend a webinar or demo,&nbsp; you'll need to let them know by promoting the sign-up link on social media. Promote signup forms for webinars, demos, email newsletters, and so forth. \n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-55881 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/Blog-Halle-CreativeIdeas-New-20.png\" alt=\"Promoting live webinars.\" width=\"770\" height=\"606\" /> \n<h3>24. Image Scrambles</h3> You'll have your audience scratching their heads in no time when you post image scrambles. Image scrambles can be posts where an image is scrambled up or zoomed in, so your audience has to guess what it is. This is a great way to \n<a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/social-media-engagement-tactics/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">get engagement from your audience</a>. What is this a picture of? \n<img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter wp-image-38497 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/image-scramble-post-example.jpg\" alt=\"Example of an image scramble.\" width=\"640\" height=\"457\" /> Answer: It's an orange crayon! \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/social-media-content/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The 6 Types of Social Media Content That Will Give You the Greatest Value</a>\n</div> \n<h3>25. Inspirational Quotes</h3> Okay, I know. Inspirational quotes can be&nbsp;\n<em>cheesy, </em>but if done correctly, they can be effective. At CoSchedule, we use quotes from industry leaders that we know our audience will find relatable. Find quotes from leaders in your industry or testimonials from your audience&nbsp;that will resonate with your target audience. \n<img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter wp-image-38498 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/inspirational-quotes.png\" alt=\"Inspirational quote post example from Ian Cleary.\" width=\"770\" height=\"403\" /> \n<h3>26. Company Accomplishments</h3> Believe it or not, your audience cares about you, and they want to see you succeed. Share your successes with them on social media and celebrate together! Whether it be awards you've won or reaching a certain number of customers, let your audience know! \n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-55882 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/Blog-Halle-CreativeIdeas-New-21.png\" alt=\"Viber sharing their successes.\" width=\"770\" height=\"856\" /> \n<h3>27. Host a Twitter Chat</h3> What is a Twitter chat?&nbsp;It’s a conversation around one unique hashtag. This hashtag allows you to follow the discussion and participate in it. Twitter chats are usually recurring and on specific topics to regularly connect people with these interests. When \n<a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/twitter-engagement-tactics/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hosting your own:</a> \n<ul> \n <li>Decide on a clear and brief hashtag that represents your brand.</li> \n <li>Choose a day and time that you can consistently hold Twitter chats.</li> \n <li>Come up with an appropriate topic and questions.</li> \n</ul> Plan and promote your chat via Twitter. \n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-55883 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/Blog-Halle-CreativeIdeas-New-22.png\" alt=\"Promoting chats via Twitter.\" width=\"770\" height=\"618\" /> \n<h3>28. Ask For Customer Feedback</h3> Not sure how your audience will respond to a new feature, event, or your next post? Find out how they will respond&nbsp;\n<em>before</em> it happens by getting customer feedback. \n<ul> \n <li>\"Would you be interested in a social media event?\"</li> \n <li>\"Would you like if we created a custom label feature?\"</li> \n <li>\"Would you like if we wrote a blog post about email marketing?\"</li> \n</ul> You can even do this \n<a href=\"https://support.twitter.com/articles/20174524\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">via Twitter poll</a> to get your answer. \n<h3>29. How-to Videos</h3> Aside from going live, you can create simple and short how-to videos explaining how a feature or tool works. These videos will give your audience an inside look, and make them more likely to try out your tool after seeing how it works. https://coschedule.wistia.com/medias/jflp6zjp18 \n<div class=\"link-callout\"> \n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/twitter-video-marketing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How to Get Started With Twitter Video Marketing</a></li> \n  <li><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/facebook-video-marketing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How to Do Facebook Video Marketing the Right Way</a></li> \n  <li><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/video-marketing-strategy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How to Make a Video Content Marketing Strategy to Boost Your New Series</a></li> \n </ul> \n</div> \n<h3>30. Product Reviews</h3> User reviews are proven sales drivers, and something the majority of customers will want to see before deciding to make a purchase. Many people read online reviews before deciding to buy something. I'm guilty of this, too! This is a great tactic if you're working in e-commerce. Try sharing reviews of products you carry. You could also review a tool that your company uses or integrates with to help drive sales. \n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-55885 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/Blog-Halle-CreativeIdeas-New-23.png\" alt=\"Sharing reviews of company products.\" width=\"770\" height=\"709\" /> \n<h3>31. Images or Videos of Your Product</h3> The best way to show how something works is through visual representations. You would never buy a car without test-driving it first, just like you wouldn't buy an online tool or product without seeing how it works first. Give your audience a firsthand look at how your product works, and maybe even throw in a cool tip they might not know if they didn't see the image or video. \n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-55801 size-full\" src=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Blog-Halle-CreativeIdeas-New-7.png\" alt=\"Short product demo for your audiences.\" width=\"613\" height=\"525\" /> \n<h3>32. Twitter Q&amp;A Sessions</h3> Sure, you could do a Twitter chat, but your topic has to be relevant, PLUS there's a great deal of planning involved. By simply hosting a Twitter Q&amp;A session, this allows your audience to ask a variety of questions. Your audience can finally get their burning questions answered, and you can interact with your audience in a new way. Check out \n<a href=\"https://passion.digital/blog/2013/12/10/how-to-run-a-successful-twitter-qa/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this post</a>&nbsp;from Passion Digital on how to host a Q&amp;A session. \n<h3>33. Spotify Playlists</h3> If you want to share music or whole playlists with friends, \n<a href=\"https://support.spotify.com/us/using_spotify/playlists/save-your-music-with-playlists/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">posting a Spotify playlist</a> is the way to go.&nbsp;Sharing music with friends is a time-honored way to discover new bands, talk over your music tastes, and learn a bit more about the bands that you love. Spotify has fun and useful playlist sharing features. You or a friend can build a playlist packed with your own music or music you’ve discovered through Spotify’s massive music library, and you have the option of sharing that playlist directly with others by passing around the playlist URL or Spotify link. Let your audience know what you're listening to and get them inspired! \n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-55887 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/Blog-Halle-CreativeIdeas-New-24.png\" alt=\"Sharing your playlists.\" width=\"770\" height=\"779\" /> [Tweet \"Get your audience pumped! Share a @Spotify playlist and let the world know what your office is jamming:\"] \n<h3>34. User-Generated Content</h3> We know you have super fans out there. Don't be afraid to show them off by posting fan-worthy content. Here at CoSchedule we send out 'swag' to those that grab our attention on social media or leave killer product reviews. Those people often share pictures of themselves decked out in our swag, and it's so awesome to see! https://twitter.com/AmandaHofland/status/785474494781546497 If a fan shares anything noteworthy about your company, give it a share! \n<h3>35. Posts Showing Off Your Company History</h3> Has your company been around longer than microwave popcorn? Then you have some history to share! It's always fun to see how far a business has come and where they started. Sharing a quick tidbit or piece of history is sure to intrigue your viewers. At CoSchedule, we are a start-up company, which means we're constantly changing, evolving, and even getting new space! https://twitter.com/ashtonhauff/status/845005165526749185 \n<h3>36. Company News Announcements</h3> Speaking of sharing your history and getting a new space, let your audience be in the loop. Getting a new space? Launching a new product? Just have big news in general? What better way to get the word out than by sharing the news with the people who care. Make it fun, and make it big. Get your audience as hyped about the news as you are. \n<h3>37. Create a Regular Series</h3> Here's a great way to use live video on social media: create a weekly series or show. There are a few ways you can do this. \n<ul> \n <li>Use a traditional talk show format.</li> \n <li>Have a guest each week.</li> \n</ul> Paste does this well, hosting musicians in their studio to perform on \n<div class=\"fb-video\" data-href=\"https://www.facebook.com/PasteMusicAndDaytrotter/videos/10156378216834529/\" data-width=\"770\" data-show-text=\"true\"> \n <blockquote class=\"fb-xfbml-parse-ignore\" cite=\"https://www.facebook.com/PasteMusicAndDaytrotter/videos/10156378216834529/\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/PasteMusicAndDaytrotter/videos/10156378216834529/\">Rainbow Kitten Surprise live at Paste Studio NYC</a>\n </blockquote> \n <h3>38. Repurpose Blog Graphics</h3> Creating new visual content for every social media post can be resource-intensive. Why not create blog graphics with social sharing in mind? To do this, create versions of your blog graphics correctly proportioned for your chosen social network: \n <img class=\"alignnone wp-image-83884 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/06/image-sizes.png\" alt=\"Guide to social media image sizing.\" width=\"1361\" height=\"8790\" /> Then, create social media posts or even entire campaigns around those posts, reusing their inline graphics. \n <h3>39. Share How-to Videos</h3> Social media is great for sharing quick videos showing people how to get something done. Here's a fun example from the DIY Network: \n <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-55897 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/Blog-Halle-CreativeIdeas-New-26.png\" alt=\"Sharing how-to videos.\" width=\"536\" height=\"767\" /> \n <h3>40. Share Your Company's Financial Earnings</h3> For large, publicly traded companies, your followers might be interested in knowing how you're performing financially. Consider creating an engaging GIF or video to accompany your earnings page on your website, or a blog post announcing your quarterly earnings. Here's an example from Home Depot: \n <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-55899 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/Blog-Halle-CreativeIdeas-New-27.png\" alt=\"Sharing company earnings.\" width=\"536\" height=\"385\" /> \n <h3>41. Share a Case Study On One of Your Customers</h3> Do you have a customer that you know has had success thanks to your company or product? Get them involved in a \n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/how-to-write-a-case-study/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">case study</a>! Then, share it on social media: \n <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-55900 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/Blog-Halle-CreativeIdeas-New-28.png\" alt=\"Sharing customer case study.\" width=\"536\" height=\"403\" /> \n <h3>42. Share a Survey</h3> Check out this example from Case Study Buddy: \n <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-55902 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/Blog-Halle-CreativeIdeas-New-29.png\" alt=\"Prompt to take survey.\" width=\"536\" height=\"343\" /> \n <h3>43. Promote a New Product or Event</h3> Here's another example from Case Study Buddy: \n <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-55905 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/Blog-Halle-CreativeIdeas-New-30.png\" alt=\"Promoting new products or events.\" width=\"529\" height=\"698\" /> \n <h3>44. Share a Fill-in-the-Blank Post</h3> Asking your audience to finish a sentence can be fun, and it definitely encourages engagement. Think something like this: \n <blockquote>\n  \"What's your favorite ___________________?\" \"Fill in the blank: my favorite thing about [YOUR BRAND] is [ANSWER].\" \"When I need to [SOLVE PROBLEM], I use [PRODUCT/TACTIC].\"\n </blockquote> Get creative with it, and see what you can come up with. \n <h3>45. Share a Statistic</h3> This tweet from the CoSchedule Twitter accounts shares a snippet about Starbuck's marketing strategy that people might not have known: \n <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-55906 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/Blog-Halle-CreativeIdeas-New-31.png\" alt=\"CoSchedule sharing stats through Twitter.\" width=\"655\" height=\"581\" /> \n <h3>46. Reshare Your Top Performing Posts</h3> You don't always have to reinvent the wheel. If a post did well once, what's to say it won't do well again? In fact, \n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/requeue-social-media-automation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">according to research from CoSchedule</a>, there's data backing up the idea that it might even do better the second time around. \n <img class=\"drop-shadow wp-image-83885 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/06/message-mileage.png\" alt=\"Get more mileage out of your messages.\" width=\"770\" height=\"493\" /> The easiest way to identify top performing posts and automatically reshare it is with CoSchedule. Use \n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/analytics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">social analytics</a> to discover your best-performing posts. Then, use \n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/requeue\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ReQueue</a> to create an intelligent queue of social posts to reshare automatically. \n <h3>47. Promote Your Partners</h3> Add some positivity to your audience's feed and shout out a company you work with that's killing it out there. \n <blockquote> \n  <p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Wow, what a lovely post to read. Thank you <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Sally_Newm?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Sally_Newm</a> for nominating me and for everything you said.

Share Some Interesting Industry Research</h3> In a lot of industries, having the latest knowledge and research is key to maintaining a competitive advantage. Tap into that by sharing stats and snippets of industry research reports, either ones you've created yourself or ones you've curated around the web. \n <h3>49. Use Paper.li to Share News Roundups</h3> Ever since Storify closed its doors, marketers have been searching for a replacement. \n <a href=\"https://paper.li/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Paper.li</a> is a great stand-in, making it possible to create custom social media-driven online newspapers. By creating an account, you can curate content from different social media networks and present it all in one place. Here's a look at how it works. \n <h3>50. Preview a New Product or Event</h3> Everyone loves being first to see new stuff. By consistently sharing previews of new products or features, your audience will know to go to your social channels to find your latest developments. This example from NAMM, a major musical instrument expo, uses a GIF to promote an exclusive events. \n <h3>51. Get Creative With Emojis</h3> Love them or hate them, emojis can add fun and flash to your social media posts. Make sure you're using them appropriately, and in conjunction with other guidelines, by following this infographic. \n <img class=\"alignnone wp-image-83886 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/06/how-to-write.png\" alt=\"How to write the best social media posts.\" width=\"1361\" height=\"7356\" /> \n <h3>52. Give Away Something Free</h3> Who doesn't like free stuff? By offering your audience an incentive to take action to get a freebie, you can drive some strong engagement and help promote your products. Here's an example from PlayStation. In exchange for pre-ordering a game, fans can get a free customized theme for their console, which the video demonstrates. \n <div class=\"link-callout\">\n  <strong><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/?p=55297#toc\">Back to the Top</a></strong>\n </div> \n <h2>What Will You Post on Social Media?</h2> Phew!

Welcome to the show!\n\nJim: Hey, Ben. Thank you, great to be here.\n\nBen: Yeah, absolutely. Would you mind taking a moment to introduce yourself to our audience and explain what you do at chorus.ai?\n\nJim: Jim Benton. CEO here at chorus.ai out here in the Bay Area. We’re the number one conversation intelligence platform. Our job is to help businesses to connect and create these brilliant experiences by living in the meetings, capturing these meetings, and bringing that truth back to the full sales stack.\n\nBen: Cool. I understand, recently with the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, you’ve been doing a lot of work analyzing the business impacts of the pandemic across a number of different areas of business and marketing and sharing that data, that information, and the things that you’ve been discovering so that others can benefit from seeing how the landscape is shaking out with everything that’s going on right now.\n\nOne thing that you’re doing with that, as I understand it, is this Daily Briefing of broadcast that I believe you’re hosting via Zoom call. Not unlike the one that we’re using to conduct this interview right now. To get more to the point, what kinds of business and sales data have you been sharing on those daily Zoom calls?\n\nJim: Happy to share. It’s interesting. The daily call is something new for me. I hadn’t had that experience before, and I just started and joined Chorus as CEO in March. I joined actually right when the offices were shut down. One of the first observations, in my first week, was we had data that was really empowering to other leaders out there where they were trying to get a sense of what can we still sell during this time and what’s changing?\n\nI remember the first data point I looked at was how can we analyze these calls and meetings we’re in and how is COVID coming up in the calls at that time? This is going back a few months. We saw February 23<sup>rd </sup>that 8% of the calls had a COVID-19 mention. A week later, it’s 29%, then 63%, and then 98% by early-March, mid-March.\n\nThat’s what set off how is productivity changing? Are people still able to move from an office to their homes and continue to sell? Our data was showing yes. They were absolutely maintaining incredible levels of productivity even when you might think I can’t see the team. I can’t see them, I can’t walk the halls, maybe they’re not selling. We were just the opposite.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-84350\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/192_Jim-Podcast-Graphics_quote-02.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1361\" height=\"630\" />\n\nThat is the data that we set out to share daily in kind of a wartime mode of hold on, we are seeing unique patterns [...], segments, and in different types. We set out to do that on March 26, and we ran that daily for several months.\n\nBen: Cool. Are you still running those daily, or it’s run its course at this point?\n\nJim: The spirit of all this is what does the world need right now? What we’re seeing today is now focused on reopening or adjusting to what the new norms are. How do we continue to bring rich data to the market? We’re going to be shifting it to weekly, but getting much richer in terms of some of the best practices that we’re seeing out in the marketplace. We interviewed about 60 different CROs, head of sales enablement, and CMOs during that two-month period. I would ask these questions and am happy to share some of the insights that we were learning.\n\nBy the way, one of the points that I found incredibly interesting in the last couple of weeks is that we saw a significant increase in CFOs showing up in the sales calls. 91% increase over baseline—baseline being pre-COVID. In the last week, a significant uptick. We’re seeing a trend where CFOs are the new buyer, essentially. How are teams presenting extreme ROI, how are teams messaging when we know that this CFO is in the room, and just how do you enable your team to be prepared for that? It’s just a small example of the type of ways that this data is unlocking deep insights.\n\nBen: Yeah, absolutely. I’d love to take some time to dig into some of those other trends in a moment, but for now, it’d be great to really focus on that one point you just mentioned about CFOs being brought into sales discussions more frequently. Because there could be all kinds of interesting ramifications from making the decision to bring your CFO into the sales call. Also, there’s got to be a lot of interesting reasoning behind why companies would want that person there.\n\nI imagine, you’ve alluded to this, when there’s a lot of belt-tightening going on, you probably want the numbers people in the room to make sure that you can rationalize that purchase. I’ll leave it to you though to explain. What do you see there? Why do you feel you’re seeing CFOs being brought in the sales calls? I guess as a corollary to that, what does that mean for a sales team? How do they brace themselves or prepare themselves for actually having to have that person in the room with them during the call? It’s maybe something that they’re totally not used to.\n\nJim: It’s right. One of the data points that lead to the 91% increase on the CFOs is we also saw 100% increase—doubling of director-level individuals joining the buying sales calls. You’re pitching other companies, they’re bringing a lot more leadership. 100% increase in directors, 104% increase in executives with CFOs. What we’re seeing is that there’s just friction in the system. Here’s one of the comments I heard from one of the guests that I just thought that it was a great point. It was that we’re on two sides. We’re also seeing it on the sales sides, that sales leadership is now 88% higher involvement in sales calls and executives are 72% higher.\n\nOn both sides, we have massive increases in executive-level here. But what we’re finding is that only business essential deals that really are necessary are getting off the wine. CFOs need to get closer to the action. Other execs need to really make sure that this is the program that needs to be funded versus the other ones. We can’t just fund the way the budget was laid out. We need to choose wisely.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-84352\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/192_Jim-Podcast-Graphics_quote-03.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1361\" height=\"630\" />\n\nI think friction is the right word, which is more people having to get involved, more people having to study it, which is both good. We can move incredibly fast on decision-making right now. If the deal is meant to happen, we’re hearing folks talk about these extremely fast sales cycles on large enterprise deals, and it’s because we have all the right people joining these calls upfront.\n\nThe question is what would make that call successful for a CFO? What do we need to do to be aligned going into that call so that we’re not [...] it, but we’re absolutely focused on making sure that we overcome any CFO objections. What I’ve been hearing from folks is just this concept of the extreme ROI, and just how do we present with more clarity and more rigor the absolute ROI or extreme—meaning many, many multiples—higher case that we have.\n\nWe basically need to beat out other options. Maybe a better way to say that is, identify that this really is one of the most important initiatives that needs to be tackled, because those are the only ones being funded right now.\n\nBen: Sure. That’s really interesting. I would be interested to get your opinion on this. Do you feel that that’s maybe that should have been happening anyway?\n\nJim: The entire sales motion right now, I’ve been very intrigued by. In life, sometimes what happens during a crisis, you see pure, the good, and you do sometimes see the best of people during the challenge. When you look back at the Great Recession or you look back at much more challenging events, 9/11, etc., you do see a massive change in the way people interact.\n\nRight now, what we saw with COVID was another time where we saw incredible authenticity, incredible empathy. It wasn’t trained, it wasn’t programmed in, that was people being real, people opening up their homes, and their interruptions, not just apologizing, but actually accepting them and bringing them into the conversation when their kids are speaking or their dog walks across on their desk.\n\nWhat we saw was the human side of problem-solving. I always think of sales as just problem-solving. Two people coming together to solve problems, but the human side is just incredibly special. It was less about a pre-scripted sequence that goes out and more about I’m reaching out for these reasons. What you’re hearing, Ben, is that people are actually thanking people for some of the outreach. Hey, thanks for doing your job right now.\n\nWe have our team doing our jobs and you’re clearly passionate about what you do where you’re coming to me and we recognize it’s hard. I thought that was incredibly powerful to hear those comments on it. You just also had people thinking more freely about—our messaging is literally changing day by day, week by week. What we did two weeks ago doesn’t make sense today.\n\nHow does the sales team be empowered to think more freely and to really deeply think about the true problems we’re solving versus the scripted, hey, we improved this 2% or 2x. It’s not enough. We need to really connect, and we need to connect in a really real way.\n\nBen: For sure. That’s a fantastic answer. There’s a lot of truth in all of that. What are some other trends you’ve been seeing, some other really high-level things that are just really at the front of your mind right now?\n\nJim: One that I’ve been really intrigued by, and it caught me off guard when I first saw the data in my first week of joining, was how many actions are managers taking on calls to support these deals and train rep? Basically, how much coaching are we giving to our teams? What we saw was that right when COVID started and basically right where we moved to shelter in place, there was a pretty significant dip. People stopped coaching, and it makes sense looking back.\n\nYou’re like, got it. The first week at home, it’s chaos. Everyone’s trying to keep their sanity. We saw a drop. That was March 16<sup>th</sup> that we dropped significantly, then it went up a little bit, March 23<sup>rd</sup>, up more March 30<sup>th</sup>, and by April 20<sup>th</sup>, it essentially was at pre-COVID levels, and then has just continually gone upward. 53% higher today, more coaching is happening than pre-COVID.\n\nTo me that is stunning. The people sitting in their living rooms, and garages, and kitchens are getting more coaching from their leadership than they were when they were side-by-side in the office, and it’s far more specific coaching. It isn’t just great job, I heard that went well. It’s hey, I was looking at this, the way you told a specific story at minute 20 was amazing; we could do this; hey, I am studying the sentiment of the call; or I’m studying how long was the monologue.\n\nWe’re giving really specific data-driven coaching. To me, I just think that’s how we grow people, and we need to continue to develop our teams and our people while we’re remote. Secondly, what I’m just super passionate about is how do we help companies to truly bring their best every interaction. Because if we do that, we solve a lot of problems.\n\nHow do we validate that our teams, when they’re working from home, from bedrooms, are continuing to represent brands in their own authentic way, but they’re bringing the best of the company, not just themselves? We need to ensure that is happening and that we’re capturing the voice of the customers. In those interactions, we’re capturing deep moments about how customers are feeling about the current environment and buying, how they’re feeling about competition, messaging, and pricing.\n\nHow do we get those real-time insights and bring it back to the rest of the companies so we can be making customer-driven decisions? That to me is critical, and we’re now doing that better working from home than we were in office environments. That’s fantastic. It’s incredibly inspiring.\n\nBen: Jim’s point about sales being about problem-solving sounds so simple, but maybe because it’s such an obvious element of being in sales, being in marketing, or being in business in general that it becomes really easy to forget. I just like to put a point of emphasis on that because no matter your role or your situation, approaching challenges with a problem-solving mindset, while putting others first, can go a really long way towards making those challenges feel more manageable.\n\nIf you can do that for someone, if you’re in a call with a prospect, if you can really make their challenges feel less overwhelming and more within their reach to overcome, maybe in that process you let your guard down slightly, you show your human side and lose some of the scripts a little bit, then you can really create an amazing experience for those prospects, even in tough times. Now, back to Jim.\n\nWhat is it about this specific set of circumstances that is not only driving businesses, driving sales teams, and driving marketing teams to shake up the status quo, but to actually maybe even outperform, in some ways, what they’re doing before? Maybe to actually start fixing problems that have been long-standing, that maybe just got overlooked before this current situation pushed things to the forefront.\n\nJim: Look, we were in an eight-year bowl market. Things are frothy, things have been very economically strong for many of these segments. There were motions that worked and were adequate in that environment. The environment changed dramatically—just dramatically for all of us about the human level, the family level, the personal level, and the work level. We didn’t quite know what the next few weeks or few months would look like.\n\nWe were told to shelter in place for two weeks. That has turned out to be far longer than two weeks. There’s a lot of uncertainty, but what that uncertainty brought was that the motions of how we connect with people had to dramatically change. That required coaching, that required enablement. Leaders suddenly went from being deeply connected to their teams whether their fine around and joining them in meetings or sitting them in the bullpens.\n\nNow we have leaders sitting at home completely unconnected from the entire sales motion, yet feel an incredible urgency, ability to forecast, and share learnings about what are we hearing in the market? Do we think Q2 is going to hold up, Q3? What decisions do we make in the company? Are we going to have to reduce the size of the team?\n\nWhat we found was they had to find a way to connect. That is where the conversation intelligence has seen the big tailwind is we need to be in the calls, we need to be able to give specific coaching, not just on salesmanship, but just what’s the new messaging? Is it working? What is the data showing? What’s driving higher effective rates right now? How do we onboard a new person that we’ve never even met and had them hear what’s working best?\n\nThat’s the message—leaders needed to connect. Coaching was a great way to say this was great; hey, let’s try this; or, I’ve seen this. That’s pushing the whole group forward.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-84353\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/192_Jim-Podcast-Graphics_quote-04.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1361\" height=\"630\" />\n\nBen: Bringing things down to a more tactical level, more down to the ground level. Say, I’m a marketer or I’m a sales professional. I’m either going into a sales call directly, if I’m a salesperson or maybe if I’m a marketer, I’m supporting that sales process in some way. Now we have the CFO or some other executive-level staff that I’m not used to having in the room with me during that interaction, what advice would have for that person to maybe make sure that they are sharing what the executive-level staff wants to see? In general, how do you include them in the conversation? That interaction could be really intimidating, potentially. In general, how would you handle it?\n\nJim: Our data would suggest that the NAE in that example should bring their sales leadership to these interactions. That is what’s happening in the industry right now, is it bringing leadership? Leaders, what we’re hearing from others, and my own thoughts on this, should be really thoughtful about what role they play in these interactions. A common theme that we heard, and this validates how I think about it, is you want a very empowered sales professional. That’s really the quarterback in these deals. They’re starting the calls, they’re ending the calls, but it’s also important that when leaders join, that they’re not sidelined into a non-role where they only chime in if there’s something to add. It’s a real miss to have a leader join a call who potentially doesn’t say anything.\n\nYou should not feel like they’re there to perform. It’s a team effort. What role should we play? How does the [...] show control, urgency, and access? Hey, I’ve brought my leader in to talk about this topic into how to be very natural at this time? Let me say that differently. How to think about the situations we’re in, think freely about things that are different? We do have a CFO, we have the Senior VP at the other company in the call, how do we make sure to not just follow the existing playbook to the T, but think more thoughtfully about what’s required to make this interaction successful?\n\nI always like the [deal] concept. What is the desired outcome of this interaction? What would make this time together wildly successful and how do we quickly align on those and make sure that we’re going to talk about that content.\n\nBen: Another thing that I’d be curious to get your thoughts on to, something that you mentioned is the only deals that are getting across the line at this point in time right now are the things that deliver just outsized ROI. If I’m on a marketing team, I’m on a sales team, I’m a business leader, or whatever the case may be, let’s say that we’re struggling right now. We’re struggling to communicate that kind of value to prospects.\n\nMaybe, we believe we offer that value or the person in this hypothetical example believes that they can provide that value, there’s a block somewhere between giving that message across and actually motivating the desired action. How would you recommend the team in that situation, maybe self-diagnose what’s going on and start turning that around?\n\nJim: The above the line selling is really important right now. We had skipped [...] and we were talking about below the line, above the line. It is difficult to get below the line deal done. It doesn’t mean they’re not happening, but just in general, we really do need stronger economic buyers playing key roles. That’s what the data shows, that they’re showing up in the calls on both sides, but they are the ones that need to be speaking to the CFO. The CFOs, typically, they’re peer or in a closer group to say, look, of all the things, I do need this. Whether we have extreme ROI or extreme conviction, it depends where the businesses are if they’re truly in a spend freeze or just in a being more thoughtful.\n\nThat championship, an above the line leader, is critical right now. Deals are getting done. Look, Q2, deals are getting done. I’m hearing from others, potentially, 40% longer, but we’re still seeing the deals get done, that’s the important aspect. We’re still seeing, by the way, that calls are being picked up. Although dials are down, when you do call people, the connect rates have held fairly steady. People are willing to answer the phone and engage. That’s the key message is business is happening. We just need to be really thoughtful about how we engage right now.\n\nBen: That’s fantastic advice. The last question I’ll throw your way, what advice would you have for marketing and sales teams to better collaborate together right now? You mentioned a lot of things in this area about how a lot of us have just gotten a lot more comfortable with our presentation on calls like this. Maybe being a little less perfect—people have their kids in the background, they have cats walking on their keyboards, and whatever. Maybe our guard has been let down a little bit from what it used to be or what it would be under normal circumstances.\n\nAt the same time, there are logistical challenges to collaborating effectively if you can’t be in the same space together. What would you recommend? What are the most important things in that area that you would say that those teams should be addressing?\n\nJim: That’s really interesting. A lot of us are going to think about this whole collaboration in many little pieces because there’s part of it. When you talk about sales, marketing, and collaborating, the first part I think about is how do we give each of those parties equal access to what’s happening? Rich data, rich ability to actually hear the conversations, and understand the relationships that are being built so that we’re removing that opinion, and more of, look, let’s watch these 12 interactions. What could we do differently? How would we build this and train the rest of the team on it? Let’s remove the assumptions.\n\nOne aspect is the group seems to come together, they need to understand what’s actually happening. It’s more than just the data, it’s not just close rates and conversion rates, but look at the human interactions. Study them and do that at scale. That’s one area. Because from there, we’ll find that certain segments right now are not buying at the same levels of other segments. Our data shows that. We saw HR Tech down 28% on medium productivity, whereas infrastructure companies are up 19%. How do you make sure your ABM accounts are aligned between sales and marketing on segments that are enamored of a growth pattern right now? That’s one area.\n\nThe last part is the other part of the collaboration as they're coming together to solve problems. That is where we’re all missing the human element or need richer ways to come together in making the time virtually, but to make sure that we can then talk about what are the action plans. I know from our side, it’s just about aligning the groups, having common plans. I’d say one last thing, Ben, aligning on that final objective.\n\nIf the goal of sales and marketing is about ultimately having revenue come in, I do think the simplicity of making sure we’re aligned on the end result and not just all the handoffs and the mini conversion rates. I’m sensing and seeing in the data and the folks I’ve talked to, there’s a lot of pain in all of this specialization where things are being handed off and not converting at the effectiveness that we should see.\n\nIt doesn’t mean that it’s going to go back, it just means that we need to be more thoughtful about how we partner and team up on the ultimate objectives and making sure that we’re wickedly efficient on that.\n\nBen: Yeah, absolutely. We’re all on the same team. Absolutely. This is fantastic, Jim. Thanks so much for sharing your insights with our audience. At this point, we’ve been living with the pandemic and with some pretty serious disruptions to our day to day lives and the business for a while now. It’s going to be another month or so after this conversation even before our audience gets to hear this. I guess I lied when I said that was the last question. This is the actual last question.\n\nGiven how unpredictable literally everything is right now and just the fact that it’s really difficult to predict what things will be like between our conversation right now and when our audience actually gets to hear this, are there any long term trends, or not even super long term but near term trends? Where do you see a lot of this stuff going? Just based on the data you’ve seen from March to now, what do you feel, maybe the next month, two, or three, is maybe going to look like in regards to how marketing and sales teams handle the way that the business landscape is changing right now?\n\nJim: As you mentioned, this will air in the future, and right now, in early June, we’re dealing with even more significant issues than COVID right now and these stats. I know with my all hands with my company today, talking about our support and standing with the Black Community, absolutely rejecting all forms of racism, hate, and intolerance. It’s even changed my perspective of sharing daily intelligence. There are bigger issues. There are a lot of issues that need to be tackled in really deep thought. I just want to put it out there that, yeah, balancing these different pieces.\n\nRight now, the thing that, Ben, we did today is I want our company to have the time, next Friday on June 19<sup>th</sup>, to be in the community to advocate, to get the right time to reflect. I think why I share this is we need our team and our folks to be at their best when we do our work. We need to make sure that we’re creating enough space for them to be dealing with all of the different things going on right now, to deeply think about it, and to put actions in place. Because if you don’t solve those things, you’re going to have people say why are we doing this sales deal? What are we doing? If we’re having these massive social issues that are just horrific.\n\nI share that just because even coming on today, the bottom of my mind space right now is on how do we play a bigger role in the community and helping on that. If we can do that well, then all of this stuff will go up into the right and we can solve great problems, but we need to come together beyond even these sales numbers and truly deal with these issues as a collective team. The same way that we work and solve other problems. I hope we’re in a much better spot when this airs and I think this is a much longer-term thing that we’re addressing, but it’s very important as well.\n\nBen:  Yeah, for sure. That was a fantastic insight. I appreciate the work you’re doing in that area and the work that all companies, all individuals, and entities that are working towards making progress in those areas I agree is very important.\n\nJim: Look, we’re kicking up our Q3 plan, and we’re going to make it a key initiative. How we really integrate this into our core business, not just a quick plan. I feel really passionate about—I was putting the same, really attacking and putting that effort there. Thank you for that.\n\nBen: Yeah, very cool. This was great. Before I let you go, is there anything else you would like to add, or anything that maybe you didn’t get a chance to mention earlier?\n\nJim: I’ve really enjoyed this. The data will continue to change. At the end of the day, sales is about solving problems. It’s about understanding the other side and bringing them something that’s going to help them to be successful. We just need to remember that we’re problem solvers, simple as that.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-84349\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/192_Jim-Podcast-Graphics_quote-01.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1361\" height=\"630\" />\n\nBen: Yeah, for sure.

The value of email marketing is undeniable, so it's not surprising that many departments within your organization want to leverage the platform. This results in lots of moving pieces to consider and many stakeholders to please. It also increases the chances of accidentally sending multiple emails to the same person in one day. Speaking from personal experience... the fallout of this isn't pretty. Here are just a few pieces of the puzzle you have to consider: \n<ul> \n <li>Managing your ever-growing subscriber list</li> \n <li>Overseeing the design and copy of every email</li> \n <li>Scheduling delivery times</li> \n <li>A/B testing</li> \n <li>Analyzing results</li> \n</ul> That's just scratching the surface. One thing is clear: if you're going to be successful at email marketing, you need a well-planned marketing strategy in place; one that clearly establishes goals and lays out the roadmap to achieve them. Something that can guide your team toward success. That's exactly what you'll get from this post.

Here are just a few ideas to get you started. \n<h3>Give Them Something Valuable in Return</h3> One of the most common ways to get your audience to join your email subscriber list is to gate content upgrades behind an opt-in form. What is valuable to your customers? A downloadable template or ebook that shows them how to solve a problem or answer a question they might be having. If you gate something that doesn’t provide value, you might end up losing that subscriber. \n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-55239 size-full\" src=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/opt-in-form-example.png\" alt=\"Example of an opt-in form.\" width=\"770\" height=\"642\" /> \n<h3>Go For the Direct Ask</h3> Another way to gain subscribers is to go for the direct ask. Explain to them why they should opt into your email list and entice them with personalized information, like this pop-up from \n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://www.fargo3dprinting.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fargo 3D Printing</a></span>. Gathering information like this will also help you segment your list. \n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-55240 \" src=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/example-opt-in-form-2.png\" alt=\"Second example of an opt-in form\" width=\"518\" height=\"579\" /> Here's another pop-up example from \n<a href=\"https://www.nanit.com/products/nanit-plus?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI-eLUmuvl6QIVEPDACh1LVg1GEAAYASAAEgL_6PD_BwE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nanit</a>, encouraging visitors to sign up for their newsletter. The company asks for the ages of the visitor's children, which would indicate the company does some segmenting based on developmental stages of the child's age. \n<img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter wp-image-70161\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/Screenshot-2019-05-20-15.06.44.png\" alt=\"Email subscription prompt form nanit\" width=\"534\" height=\"307\" /> \n<h3>Use the Header and Footer of Your Website</h3> Another place you can put an email opt-in button is on your website’s header and footer. \n<strong>Recommended Reading:&nbsp;</strong>\n<a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/inbound-marketing-strategy-process-templates/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Conquer Your Inbound Marketing Strategy with this Process (+ 4 Templates)</a> Why not meet your audience halfway and make it easy to remind them that they can get more information about your products by joining your email list?

What does that mean and how can that help you? Here's a quick email segmentation definition: \n<blockquote>\n The process of grouping like individuals on an email list based on their behavior or characteristics to send specifically targeted emails that address that particular group of users' needs or problems.\n</blockquote> You can just blast out your emails to everyone on your list and hope that it resonates with someone and convince them to convert. However, today we can use data and information to go further and serve content to the right people, at the right time, to help guide them through your marketing funnel. In fact, segmenting your list can have a positive effect on your email list. \n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://mailchimp.com/resources/research/effects-of-list-segmentation-on-email-marketing-stats/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MailChimp conducted an internal study</a></span>&nbsp;and found that segmented campaigns had: \n<ul> \n <li>14.31% higher open rates</li> \n <li>100.95% more clicks</li> \n <li>9.37% lower unsubscribe rates than their non-segmented campaigns</li> \n</ul> \n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://zapier.com/learn/email-marketing/email-list-segmentation-guide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">You can segment your list</a></span>&nbsp;based on a variety of things, including: \n<ul> \n <li>Company size</li> \n <li>Location</li> \n <li>Activity on your website</li> \n <li>How long they’ve been on your email list</li> \n</ul> In order to accurately segment your list, you need to gather this data about your customers when they first sign up. Add options for subscribers to choose from before they complete their signup. List potential ways your team will try and grow your email list in your template and email list segments. \n<img class=\"drop-shadow alignnone wp-image-83741 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/06/email-list-segments-1.png\" alt=\"Email list segments table\" width=\"1361\" height=\"768\" /> \n<div class=\"link-callout\"> \n <strong>Action Items:</strong> \n <ol> \n  <li>Brainstorm email list growth strategies.</li> \n  <li>Record strategies in your template.</li> \n  <li>Update strategies every three months — based on what’s working well and what isn’t.</li> \n  <li>List out what criteria you will use to segment your list.</li> \n </ol> \n</div> \n<h2>Step Four: Choose the Types of Emails to Send</h2> There are many different types of emails you can send to your list. You can choose one, or change it up, based on the various segments you have in your list. Here are three different types of emails to get started with. \n<h3>Newsletters</h3> Newsletters are a popular email format. They come to your subscriber’s inbox at the same time at recurring intervals. They allow you to show them a variety of content and information your subscribers might have missed if they haven’t visited your website lately. \n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/guide-creating-email-newsletters-ht\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">According to Hubspot,</a></span>&nbsp;successful email newsletters contain 90% educational content and 10% product or promotional content. The same post from Hubspot says newsletters should contain a single theme or idea. That way you can prevent yourself from randomly throwing content into your newsletter just to get it out there. You might even send out different newsletters on different topics based on who you’re sending each newsletter to on your list. What does an excellent newsletter look like? Take this example from \n<a href=\"https://www.theskimm.com/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=paidmedia&amp;utm_campaign=DS_SEM_ADW_SNT_BRAND_Core_Exact&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI-dnL-eTl6QIVAb7ACh2CPQz0EAAYASAAEgJxVPD_BwE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Skimm</a>: \n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-55243 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/email-newsletter-example.png\" alt=\"Example of an email newsletter from the Skimm\" width=\"770\" height=\"1696\" /> \n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/email-newsletter-examples-list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Photo from Hubspot</a></span> \n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://www.theskimm.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Skimm newsletter</a></span>&nbsp;is specific in the fact that it rounds up the latest news from the day before and quickly summarizes it for readers. It provides the benefit of not having to read long news stories and allows subscribers to quickly catch up on the news from the day before. [Tweet \"Round up your most recent content into an informative email newsletter.\"] Here's another awesome newsletter round-up from \n<a href=\"https://www.spotify.com/us/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Spotify</a>: \n<img class=\"drop-shadow alignnone wp-image-83560 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/06/Spotify-min_2019.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"2681\" /> &nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://www.airbnb.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Airbnb</a> also has a great newsletter that mixes both content and promotional elements. \n<img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter wp-image-67438 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/airbnb.png\" alt=\"Another email newsletter from airbnb\" width=\"508\" height=\"961\" /> \n<h3>Automated Drip Emails</h3> Automated drip campaigns are emails that are sent to users based on their interactions with your website, or content that is sent on a schedule, to help move customers down your marketing funnel. Once your subscriber takes action, emails are slowly dripped into their email inbox to help convince them to convert. These emails change based on the action that your list members take. For example, say you had a subscriber who clicked on your product page, added things to their cart, but didn’t make a purchase. The automated emails could be sent to your subscriber that gently remind them to head back to their cart or learn more about their products. Take a look at this example from \n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://www.doggyloot.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DoggyLoot</a></span>:\n<a href=\"https://www.shopify.com/blog/12522201-13-amazing-abandoned-cart-emails-and-what-you-can-learn-from-them\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-55244 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/doggy-loot-email.png\" alt=\"Email from Doggy Loot for promotions and shopping cart reminders\" width=\"770\" height=\"959\" /></a> This is a great example because of the sense of urgency the copy creates. If your customer doesn’t buy these items now, they might miss out on them altogether. \n<a href=\"https://www.asos.com/us/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Asos</a> uses a similar tactic — encouraging people not to forget about the items in their abandoned cart. \n<img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter wp-image-67439 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/asos-abandoned-cart-email.png\" alt=\"Email from asos about items left in your cart\" width=\"619\" height=\"928\" /> This video shows how to create a drip campaign in \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/gHUoUnmUqlg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MailChimp</a>. \n<h3>Seasonal and Promotional Emails</h3> We all know the holiday emails that end up in our inboxes each year. They contain all those great deals, so you can get your shopping done and out of the way. Seasonal and promotional emails are timed emails that help entice your readers to purchase from your website. Here’s a typical example of a holiday promotional email: &nbsp; &nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://blogs.constantcontact.com/holiday-email-examples/\"><img class=\"wp-image-55245 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/seasonal-email-example.png\" alt=\"Example of a seasonal email\" width=\"770\" height=\"1122\" /></a> Each email may vary and contain different, timely information that you want to get to your audience. Here's another promo email example from \n<a href=\"https://www.westelm.com/?Kenshoo=_k_EAIaIQobChMIiI243-nl6QIVhobACh241g9bEAAYASAAEgK-aPD_BwE_k_&amp;cm_ven=BrandSearch&amp;cm_cat=Google&amp;cm_pla=Brand_Search_Exact&amp;cm_ite=west%20elm&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIiI243-nl6QIVhobACh241g9bEAAYASAAEgK-aPD_BwE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">West Elm</a>. \n<img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter wp-image-67440 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/Screenshot-2019-02-11-14.52.35.png\" alt=\"Promotion from west elm about markdowns for the next few hours\" width=\"615\" height=\"818\" /> Here's another promo email example from \n<a href=\"https://ngmdomsubs.nationalgeographic.com/pubs/NG/NGM/ngm_direct_COM_232353.jsp?cds_page_id=232353&amp;cds_mag_code=NGM&amp;id=1591193622798&amp;lsid=31550912356045256&amp;vid=2&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;cds_response_key=I0BSR1MA0&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIvZfMkerl6QIV0MDACh3BZwiiEAAYASAAEgLIcPD_BwE&amp;cmpid=org%3Dngp%3A%3Amc%3Dcpc%3A%3Asrc%3Dgoogle%3A%3Acmp%3Dbrand-us-google-national-geographic-keyword-only-exact%3A%3Aadd%3Dnational-geographic&amp;ds_rl=1265457\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">National Geographic</a> that helps promote its Black Friday Sale. \n<img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter wp-image-70171 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/Screenshot-2019-05-21-14.47.02.png\" alt=\"Black Friday promotion from National Geographic website for saving 70%\" width=\"390\" height=\"572\" /> In the strategy template, choose which types of emails you want to send to your email list and record it in your template. \n<img class=\"drop-shadow alignnone wp-image-83742 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/06/email-content-type-1.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of the slide for email content type\" width=\"1361\" height=\"761\" /> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Action Item:&nbsp;</strong>Decide which types of emails you want to send to your list.

How can you ensure that your emails are being seen? Well, sending them during the most strategic days and times can help. \n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/best-time-to-send-email/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">According to ten different studies</a>,</span>&nbsp;the best times to send emails are: \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-83743 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/06/email-time.png\" alt=\"The best time to send an email\" width=\"1361\" height=\"1182\" /> Your best times will vary a bit depending on your subscribers, so experiment to see what times your audience is the most engaged. You can’t just send your email at the best time; you also need to send it on the best day. \n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/best-time-to-send-email/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">According to those same ten studies</a></span> the best days to send emails are: \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-83744 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/06/email-day.png\" alt=\"The best day to send an email\" width=\"1361\" height=\"1182\" /> Does this mean that these are the best days for your list? Not necessarily. Each audience is unique and may require a little testing to find your best day to send email. To find your best times and days to send an email, try testing the following times: \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-83745 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/06/test-email.png\" alt=\"Test your emails to find the best time for you\" width=\"1360\" height=\"868\" /> Remember, these are suggested times. Use the analytics in your email marketing platform to fine-tune&nbsp;your send times and understand what works best for your audience. Then record those winning times in your template. \n<img class=\"drop-shadow alignnone wp-image-83746 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/06/sending-schedule.png\" alt=\"Email sending schedule slide\" width=\"1361\" height=\"779\" /> \n<div class=\"link-callout\"> \n <strong>Action Items:</strong> \n <ol> \n  <li>Experiment with the time you send your emails.</li> \n  <li>Track open rates, unsubscribes, click-throughs, and more for each email sent.

Goal-setting is critical for your email marketing program because it gives each email you send a specific purpose. You need to know where you're heading before you can strategize a route to get there. Setting strategic goals helps you show your boss and other stakeholders in your organization that your email marketing strategy is having the right effect on your bottom line. How do you create a solid email marketing goal? By ensuring they’re S.M.A.R.T.: \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-83747 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/06/smart-goals.png\" alt=\"What are SMART goals?\" width=\"1361\" height=\"542\" /> Each goal you create should be measurable, so you have a way to track your results, and specific to your campaign. Make sure that they're ambitious, but not so high they’re impossible to reach. Every goal should be relevant to the campaign in which it has been created. In other words, you don’t necessarily want to track the number of purchases an email drove if it isn’t directly selling something. For example, a promo email's goal could be total sales attributed to said email, while a simple newsletter could be CTR on an article included. Plus, each goal needs to be time-bound — meaning you should meet your goal within a set time limit. What kind of goals can you set for your email marketing program? \n<ul> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Increasing click-through rates:</span> Click-through rates mean that your audience has read your email, and they have followed through to click the link to your website, which could increase your conversions.</li> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Increasing your ROI:</span>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/email-marketing/2016/01/70-email-marketing-stats-you-need-to-know/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">For every dollar you spend</span></a> on email marketing, you see an average $44 return.

Trying to increase your open rates is a solid goal to set for your email marketing strategy.</li> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Increasing the number of subscribers:&nbsp;</span>The more people you can reach with your emails, the better. Set a series of goals that help increase your total subscribers.</li> \n</ul> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:&nbsp;</strong>\n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/marketing-strategy/marketing-goals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How To Set SMART Marketing Goals</a>\n</div> Use the following template to create each one of your goals: \n<blockquote>\n By {insert day, month, year}, the {insert your organization’s name} marketing team will reach {insert number} {insert metric} every {insert time frame}.\n</blockquote> Enter those goals into your template: \n<img class=\"drop-shadow alignnone wp-image-83748 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/06/annual-goals.png\" alt=\"Annual email marketing goals\" width=\"1361\" height=\"772\" /> \n<div class=\"link-callout\"> \n <strong>Action Items:</strong> \n <ol> \n  <li>For each campaign, set a series of S.M.A.R.T. goals that will help prove the success or failure of your campaign.</li> \n  <li>Track each goal and record results in your template.</li> \n  <li>Report back to your boss on progress.</li> \n </ol> \n</div> \n<a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/?p=54247#toc\">Back to the Top</a> \n<a name=\"format\"></a> \n<h2>Step Seven: Determine How You’re Going to Craft Your Content</h2> You have your email types selected, your goals are complete, and now you need to write email copy that encourages your reader to take action. The following categories will help ensure that your copywriters create content that makes your next email stand out. \n<h3>What Writing Style Does Your Team Use</h3> Emails can be written in all sorts of formats and styles. Depending on what type of email you’re creating, you could have larger blocks of text, or a list of links email readers can click on. Take CoSchedule, for example. We approach our email copy by writing single-sentence paragraphs: \n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-54584 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/SS-01-3.png\" alt=\"Example of how CoSchedule formats blog posts to be easily readable\" width=\"770\" height=\"737\" /> This format makes skimming plain-text email easy. \n<h3>Optimizing For Mobile Readers</h3> Another essential part of crafting your email content is to make sure that it is optimized for viewing across multiple devices. The fact is, \n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/304735/majority-of-emails-read-on-mobile-devices.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">55% of emails are read</a></span>&nbsp;on mobile devices, which means your copy should transfer easily. \n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://www.copyblogger.com/mobile-friendly-emails/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">According to CopyBlogger</a></span>, there are ten ways you can ensure that your emails are mobile friendly. \n<ol> \n <li>Create short subject lines</li> \n <li>Use a single column template</li> \n <li>Keep your email under 600px wide</li> \n <li>Use a large font size — between 13 to 14 pixels is recommended</li> \n <li>Display small images</li> \n <li>Provide a distinct call to action</li> \n <li>Don’t make your CTA an image. If you do use an image, add ALT text that tells a person what the image is if it doesn’t load.</li> \n <li>Avoid menu bars</li> \n <li>Don’t stack links</li> \n <li>Test on multiple devices</li> \n</ol> \n<h3>Personalizing Your Email Content</h3> Another way to create killer email copy is by finding ways to personalize your emails to your subscribers.

What is A/B testing? A/B testing is a series of tests that allow email marketing teams to swap out different parts of their email, like a subject line, to see what kinds of copy performs best with their audience. You can A/B test a lot of different parts of your email including: \n<ul> \n <li>Your subject line (popular)</li> \n <li>Calls to action</li> \n <li>Testimonials</li> \n <li>Images</li> \n <li>Headlines</li> \n <li>Specific offers</li> \n</ul> Depending on the type of email tool you’re using, you may be able to A/B test some aspects of your email over others. \n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://mailchimp.com/features/ab-testing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MailChimp</a></span>, \n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://help.campaignmonitor.com/ab-test-your-email-campaigns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Campaign Monitor</a></span>, and \n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/email-user-guide-v2/how-to-utilize-ab-testing-in-email\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hubspot</a></span>&nbsp;are just a few of the programs that allow you to A/B test parts of your emails. Decide which parts of your email you’d like to A/B test and record them in your template. \n<img class=\"drop-shadow alignnone wp-image-83749 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/06/test-elements.png\" alt=\"Email A/B test elements\" width=\"1361\" height=\"771\" /> \n<div class=\"link-callout\"> \n <strong>Action Items:</strong> \n <ol> \n  <li>Choose which parts of your email campaign you want to A/B test.</li> \n  <li>Create copy or images for your test.</li> \n  <li>Record your results and adjust copy or images based on what performed best with your audience.</li> \n </ol> \n</div> \n<a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/?p=54247#toc\">Back to the Top</a> \n<a name=\"reports\"></a> \n<h2>Step Nine: Record Your Results and Adjust According to Performance</h2> The last step in your email marketing strategy will be to record your results and adjust based on the feedback you’ve gathered. Each email marketing platform should contain its own set of analytics where you can gather your data. You can look for and record results on: \n<ul> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Email opens:</span>&nbsp;How many emails were opened vs. the number of emails that were sent.</li> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Email deliveries:</span> How many emails from your send list were delivered?</li> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Unsubscribers:</span>&nbsp;How many people unsubscribed from your email list?</li> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">New subscribers:</span>&nbsp;How many new subscribers have you gained?</li> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Click through rates:</span>&nbsp;How many people clicked on the links in your email?</li> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">A/B test results:</span>&nbsp;What version of your A/B test won out?</li> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">ROI:</span>&nbsp;How much revenue has your email generated compared to how much you’ve spent?</li> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">The time they spent with the email open:</span>&nbsp;How long did a subscriber spend looking at your email?</li> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Email bounces:</span> How many emails reached an inbox but were bounced back, unopened?</li> \n</ul> \n<h2>How to Manage Your Email With CoSchedule</h2> Once you have your strategy in place, you can move on to your execution. However, you have a lot of work to do, which can quickly become disorganized. Our new email integration allows you to plan, create, and send your emails at the best times and days for your audience. Managing your email schedule is easy.

How's it going?\n\nDavid: I'm doing well, Ben. How are you?\n\nBen: I'm doing fantastic. It's Friday, so I'm looking forward to the weekend.\n\nDavid: Yeah, we've earned it.\n\nBen: Yeah, I would say so. Would you mind introducing yourself to our audience and explain what you do at Retail Voodoo?\n\nDavid: Sure. My name is David Lemley. I am a brand strategist who came up through the system. I've been doing this for about 30 years back before branding had a capital B, which means that it used to be all about making marks and doing things similarly to scouring cattle. Now, it is much more about the promise you should make, the way you keep them, and have people feel about it.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-85224\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/196_David-Podcast-Graphics_quote-01.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1361\" height=\"630\" />\n\nAt Retail Voodoo, we work in the food and beverage, wellness, and fitness spaces. We help brands with their unfair share of the market.\n\nBen: Would you mind mentioning a few of the brands you've worked with. I know from seeing the pitch that your team had sent over, there are a number of companies in that list that our audience might be familiar with.\n\nDavid: Sure. The ones that come to mind are recent favorites are Essentia Water, which is one that may or may not be known. Another one that I'm really pleased with is the way LesserEvil healthy snacks have turned out. Of course, we've worked with KIND, Pepsi, Walmart, and Starbucks, and many many well-known ones, but the ones that are really exciting right now are the ones that are doing new things in food and beverage. They’re really pushing those ingredients.\n\nBen: For sure. You're deep in the branding world, and what we're really going to be diving into deep over the course of this conversation is how to future proof your brand. Just briefly, would you mind explaining (your way of thinking), why should brands and companies be concerned with the concept of future-proofing their brand?\n\nDavid: It's a really good question. The pandemic is a great example of things that can happen in the world that you cannot expect. Having that future-proofing plan gives your brand a higher likelihood of not just surviving, but potentially thriving or increasing long term relevance through unforeseen circumstances.\n\nBen: Absolutely. What would you say are the potential consequences for neglecting this area or for just coasting on autopilot rather than putting appropriate investment into your branding?\n\nDavid: The consequences are the loss of market share to hungrier competitors (first and foremost). I think that it also has an impact on your distribution relationship, your key ingredients supplier relationships, your OEMs, and all of those people. If you are on autopilot and other people or brands are connecting with consumers better in your space, then ultimately, you will lose the sale and do it significantly repeatedly.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-85226\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/196_David-Podcast-Graphics_quote-02.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1361\" height=\"630\" />\n\nBen: Yeah, and I think what's interesting about that is it sounds as though branding really impacts every area of the business and every area of your relationships with all of your partners. Would you say that’s accurate?\n\nDavid: Yeah, I think it is. I'm so glad you said it that way because that is something that a lot of people don't necessarily understand. It's that when you have a brand, and that is your North Star (if you will). It defines your value system. It decides what you will or what you will not make, who you will or will not do business with, and how you will or will not treat humans—your consumers. Those are things that brand, and graphic design, or marketing systems don't typically think about when [...] something unless they have those guard rails in place ahead of time.\n\nBen: Yeah. You work with lots of awesome brands. I'm assuming those are very often brands that—at least are the base level—understand the value of branding. Thus, they are making an investment. But if I'm a listener to this episode, let's say I'm in a company where conversations about branding are essentially just like marketing—trying to convince the CEO that branding is not just their logo. It's not just these surface-level elements.\n\nWhat advice would you have for a marketer in that position to help them make a case for really investing and branding? Because if they can't get past that basic tumbling block, then everything else that we're going to talk about (I imagine) would be very difficult for them to duplicate.\n\nDavid: Sure. The best advice you can give is to have them understand it's a long term conversation, and there is a business case for everything. What I do whenever I encounter that, which I have not for quite a number of years now. I don't frequently run into that C-suite that thinks that way, but we would come up frequently before. I would just bring in the heavy hitters. I would bring in David Maister, who wrote the book Managing The Professional Service Firm, who is a prof at Harvard, and who wrote a book that said the brand is the only sustainable business asset in the world.\n\nI would pull from all of these experts and say, don't trust me, here's what the brightest minds in the world think about this. Bringing that data and research to the conversation will, over time, erode that wall of resistance to the idea that brand is an essential component in a business.\n\nBen: Absolutely. Let's say this hypothetical marketer. They’ve gotten past those initial hurdles. What would you say are some of the essential components of building a brand that is effectively future-proofed? Or maybe a better way of putting it is, how do you begin that process of future-proofing a brand?\n\nDavid: It's complicated, and one could argue that because we don't know the future, there are so many facets that it's an ongoing process. But if you start with and maintain a commitment to understanding your core audience, understanding who they are, and what they need. Therefore, if you know who they are, you're going to be able to anticipate their changing preferences as consumers and their changing needs as people.\n\nIf you are journeying with them rather than trying to sell them stuff, you are going to maintain a dialogue, which will keep you relevant for the long term.\n\nBen: David's thoughts on bringing data and research in the conversations with executive stakeholders and their C-suite is spot on. And it's applicable in so many areas anytime you're trying to build a case for taking a certain course of action or making an investment in a particular area of marketing or your business.\n\nSometimes, decision-makers just really want to see some outside validation, that your ideas are data-backed. They are supported by research. They are championed by industry experts. And you're not just pulling something out of your imagination before they are willing to sign-off on a budget and the resources that you need to really get things done.\n\nThat opens a whole other discussion around trust. If executives didn’t trust you as a marketer, why did they hire you? That's a very valid frustration, but if you can look at things from their perspective and give them the things they want to see, they can feel confident in really throwing their full support behind your ideas and just really showing that you've done your homework that way.\n\nYou'll find that those conversations around increasing your investment and branding, increasing your investment in really anything. Those conversations are going to grow much more successfully. Now, back to David.\n\nLet's say a company, let's say they have a strong brand right now. They feel pretty good about where their brand is at. But let's say that this concept of proactively trying to think long term, to think about it like it’s an ongoing conversation, or to really do those things to future proof the brand. What would you recommend they do? Say they’re advanced with branding, but maybe this is a new concept to them.\n\nDavid: If they're strong and want to think about the future, understanding that people today are looking to brands to have morals and values the way that previous generations looked to schools, churches, and social clubs. They are now using brands as building blocks of their own personal identity, so they want you to have a value system that allows them to look good or be good by association.\n\nWe call that citizen brandhood. For brands that want future proof, deciding what kind of citizen you are, and going out, picking a fight, and tackling society’s enemies is a great way to maintain long-term relevance.\n\nBen: That's a super interesting point. The CMO—or whoever in the marketing department is responsible for making these kinds of decisions—really wants to become a more values-driven type brand (like what you're describing). How would you recommend that they begin identifying what their own values are authentically rather than just trying to latch onto whatever thing seems to be the issue of the day they need to attach themselves to, whether it makes sense or not?\n\nDavid: The key thing is to have a cultural assessment of the organization and enroll all of the people who are going to have a stake in the decisions you are making. That might be the rest of the C-suite, it might be the entire marketing team, it might be the finance team and the procurement team. Everyone who can have an opinion needs to participate in that cultural assessment.\n\nFrom there, there will be clues. Oh, we all care about this. We're all here this way. We care about children. We care about social justice. We care about equality. Or we care about making sure there's food for the next generation. Something will come up.\n\nI'm using my food and beverage lens right now today (for whatever reason it's showing up), but it helps paint the picture. I think when we work with organizations who “don't have a value system in place,” we always promise them that it's there and our duty to help them unearth it and to do it in a way that is credible, authentic, and nobody is going to want to jump out a window.\n\nBen: Yeah. No jumping out the window. I'm just speaking anecdotally. This is something I feel like I see a lot. You can see a lot of brands on social media getting criticized when they do this wrong. Or if they try to attach themselves to a cause, to a value, or to an ethic that they just transparently don't embody beyond a tweet or an Instagram post here and there (or something like that).\n\nWhat do you see are the consequences of not being thoughtful with the way that you try to convey or communicate your brand's values?\n\nDavid: The consequences of trying to have values du jour—that is high risk because we live in a world where anything that can have ever said, thought, felt, or done can be weaponized through the web by people who want to prove that you're wrong. That is the risk. You will get a huge backlash.\n\nThe way to be mindful and not have that happen is to take your time and do not let social media or your social media team try and drive your brand. It is a tool and a tactic, and it's an amazing thing. However, if you don't know who you are, it's better to keep your mouth shut.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-85228\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/196_David-Podcast-Graphics_quote-04.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1361\" height=\"630\" />\n\nBen: Right. Switching back a little bit toward what does this actually look like? Brand building and future-proofing, what does it actually look like in terms of the actual tasks or tactics that a marketer might carry out? How would you recommend our listeners start assessing or auditing their brand in order to make sure that they are keeping themselves forward-focused and looking towards the future?\n\nDavid: You know, I read a book about this exact subject.\n\nBen: I thought it might come up.\n\nDavid: It’s called Beloved and Dominant Brands. My copy is covered in sticky notes right now, but Beloved and Dominant Brands, which is an ecosystem to help organizations think this through as individuals and as management teams. What it does is it gives the entrepreneur, the executive team, the marketing team, and the investment team all on the same page. It gives them the common vocabulary and helps them benchmark their organization as a brand against a competitive set or a future set.\n\nBen: Very cool. I would say, for anybody listening, I would definitely recommend checking out that book to get some of that more tactical guidance in this area. The last question that I’ll throw your way is what tips you might share with our listeners to ensure that their entire company plays? Everyone in the company who has a stake in embodying the company's brand, how do you manage to help the entire organization do its part to keep that brand consistent for the long haul?\n\nDavid: I'm a huge fan of having a playbook that is widely distributed, shared to, and co-authored by all. But that doesn't happen weekly. It happens in seasons. This is what we're doing now. We're going to collect and we're going to reimagine this in two years, in three years, or in five years. Doing it in that way is really important, but as they are thinking about tactics to employ, the one that I like to think about the most is getting organizations to start thinking about vectors.\n\nLet's say you make a product, and right now, you are the only one who has that ingredient supply, but you know that in two years, yours is going to be gone, so the entire pricing model is going to change. You can take that vector and crosshatch it with changing consumer preferences. Maybe you can say, oh, it's going to become international. Then there are three vectors. You start to say, what would the world look like then? What do I need to price it as? What does it need to be called? Do I need a different ingredient or a different technology?\n\nYou can start going after that based on your value system as an organization. Then you have that as a fourth vector. Now you start to say the sandbox is [...] rather than the world is my oyster, and you stay relevant over the long term.\n\nBen: Cool. That's great advice. Like I said, that's the last question that I had. But before I let you go, is there anything about this topic that you feel is really important for our listeners to take away from this conversation that you haven't had the opportunity to touch on yet?\n\nDavid: The thing that I would like listeners to know is brand building is a long term sport with no finish line.\n<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/actionable-marketing-podcast/id1162659795?mt=2\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-85166 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/196_David-Podcast-Graphics_CTA.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1361\" height=\"550\" /></a><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/future-proofing-your-brand-for-sustained-success-with-david-lemley-from-retail-voodoo-amp-196/\">Future-Proofing Your Brand For Sustained Success With David Lemley From Retail Voodoo [AMP 196]</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://coschedule.com\">CoSchedule Blog</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 05 Aug 2020 14:20:50 +0000","feedId":4227,"bgimg":"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/196_David-Podcast-Graphics_header.png","linkMd5":"e0202272eaefdef3d5d0a54d8923f8f9","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn31@2020_2/2020/08/24/21-56-10-798_2eaf2dadf5f49a12.webp","destWidth":1361,"destHeight":581,"sourceBytes":106167,"destBytes":33962,"author":"Ben Sailer","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/196_David-Podcast-Graphics_header.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn31@2020_2/2020/08/24/21-56-10-798_2eaf2dadf5f49a12.webp","https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/196_David-Podcast-Graphics_quote-01.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn27@2020_2/2020/08/24/21-56-27-897_ce86de4170eccb71.webp","https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/196_David-Podcast-Graphics_quote-02.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn27@2020_2/2020/08/24/21-56-25-634_752d523a0bba9ba2.webp","https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/196_David-Podcast-Graphics_quote-04.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn76@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-56-39-703_46dc499c61b32537.webp","https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/196_David-Podcast-Graphics_CTA.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn16@2020_4/2020/08/24/21-56-30-187_7886fbc2de250856.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598306169463},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 05:56:09","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 05:56:09","title":"Harnessing the Power of Relationships to Transform Your Influencer Marketing With Magda Houalla From AspireIQ [AMP 191]","link":"https://coschedule.com/?p=83066","description":"<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-84126\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/06/191_Magda-Podcast-Graphics_header.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1361\" height=\"581\" />\nHow do you build long-lasting, mutually beneficial relationships with your best customers?

Thanks for coming on the show.\n\nMagda: Thank you so much for having me.\n\nBen: Absolutely. Would you mind taking a moment to introduce yourself to our audience and explain what you do at AspireIQ?\n\nMagda: Yes, absolutely. My name is Magda. I'm the Director of Marketing Strategy at AspireIQ. A quick brief on who AspireIQ is. We started in 2013 as an influencer marketing platform, so very much focused on helping brands find influencers to work with, manage their relationships, and analyze the results. Over the past, I would say, 1 ½-2 years, we actually have shifted or more so evolved the way we think about what it means to be influential.\n\nWith that, we have recently created our second product offering, which is a product-focused on basically community-building initiative. Expanding who is considered to be influential to allow brands to work with their customers, their enthusiasts, subject matter experts even activate their own employees. Really, the new product offering is designed to be a more flexible workflow. Instead of just having these transactional influencer relationships. They can have very, very personalized in meaningful relationships with anyone who is considered “influential” to their brand.\n\nWhat I do at AspireIQ is I work with our clients to help ensure that once they have access to our tool, they have a really strong strategy in place to hit their key business objectives. One thing that we noticed is for our self-serve offering, so basically giving people access to the technology, a lot of times, the biggest question that we're coming up is okay now that I have this, what actually do I do? How do I reach out to influencers? How do I start to build my community? How do I find my enthusiasts and subject matter experts?\n\nThat's where my team was born. We basically work with our clients during the first a few months of them being on the platform to make sure that they have a super solid strategy in place that is laddering up to broader business objectives. In addition to that, I do a lot of work with our own marketing team around what's going on in the space. Influencer is such a buzzy word. Community is such a buzzy word. How can we help our clients understand what information is actually the most relevant to their goals?\n\nBen: Very cool. It's great stuff. Let's say I'm a marketer, I'm listening to this show, and I've got some questions about influencer marketing or maybe I've identified it as a potential area of opportunity for my company, but I maybe don't know enough about it to get started. There are a billion questions a person can have. When you're dealing with that sort of ambiguity, it can be hard to know where to start with something. Especially with something like influencer marketing where, like you said, it's very buzzy right now. If I'm in that position, how would you recommend that I begin approaching starting an influencer program and really building those initial relationships with influencers in my space?\n\nMagda: Totally, yeah. This is a really good question. We find that sometimes brands are overwhelmed with the possibilities. The most important piece is really focusing on personalization. You could find someone who's influential just by looking at their social media follower count, but really, what it means to create a super meaningful program right out of the gate is finding someone that actually aligns with your personal brand values and someone that is ideally a fan of your brand to begin with.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-84129\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/06/191_Magda-Podcast-Graphics_quote-01.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1361\" height=\"630\" />\n\nOne thing that I do a lot with my clients when they're just getting started, if they have no program whatsoever, is start by looking at your different customer personas. Almost all brands have an idea of who their target customer is and what those different personas look like. Then work to map that back to what an influencer could look like.\n\nJust a very generalized example. Let's say you're a product that is targeting moms. There is a huge community of mom influencers that you can find. Through a tool like AspireIQ, we have a very robust search database, so you can find people through our tool, but it can even be easier than that. Just looking at hashtags on Instagram scrolling through your phone, that's an easy way to get started. When it comes to actually building the initial relationships with these people, once you've identified them, it's really important to have a values first approach.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-84130\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/06/191_Magda-Podcast-Graphics_quote-02.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1361\" height=\"630\" />\n\nWhat I mean by that is instead of just coming right out of the gate and saying we'll give you $200 to post about our brand, start with a story about who you are, how you got there, why you are looking to build a community of influencers, and really what your brand values are that you hope and assume are aligned with the influencer’s own brand values. That's just going to have such a stronger long-term payoff than treating it more transactional.\n\nBen: Yeah, for sure. I think that, stereotypically, that's the way a lot of people conceive of influencer marketing. It's like you paid somebody to post the product or something. Obviously, there's much, much more to it than that. I love this idea though of treating influencer marketing more like relationship building and less like a cash transaction, basically. On a tactical level, how would you recommend that marketers begin to form actual relationships with influencers or with their community versus the stereotypical just one-off transactional kind of thing?\n\nMagda: This is another really good question. You don't have to go into every influencer relationship with we're going to be partners for a year, we're in this together. It is important to test the waters to begin with. I'll start by speaking about influencers then I can speak about the broader community.\n\nWhen it comes to influencers, usually what I recommend is start with, again, the value-focused pitch. Start by saying this is who we are, all of that, and then work with them on something of a trial basis. It could be something like we want to work with you to do four posts on Instagram and three Instagram stories. Throughout the time that they are doing these posts, that's where communication is key. You don't really want to just send them out to work, approve their content, and not really have a dialogue.\n\nIn my past life, I was actually an influencer manager myself. That was where I saw the biggest success is while they were creating the content, have a consistent dialogue with them. Ask them for feedback around what do you think of the product? Do you like it? Is it actually providing value? Be honest with us. We want to make sure that this is something that's very mutually beneficial. The payoff there is you're going to truly get people that are more invested in your brand, and that's going to come through in the content they create.\n\nI'm sure you've seen massive influencers that are posting just them holding a product, the caption is very generic—use my code Magda20 for 20% off. If you're building a stronger relationship and you're really getting to know these people, you can encourage them to infuse their own personal story in the caption and even face the sponsorship head-on. Say things like I'm so excited to be working with X brand. I'm very grateful for this partnership. Here's why I am working with them.\n\nI think that it's really about the value first approach, continuing to have conversations with them, asking them for feedback, and really making them feel like they're a partner in this to you versus just doing work on your behalf. The same thing extends to other people within a brand's community. Say you want to build a program that is rewarding your top customers who are consistently talking about you on social media, it's the same thing.\n\nInstead of just creating some sort of generic email template that goes out to everyone thanking them for being a customer, focus on personalization. Let them know that you recognize that they are frequent buyers of X product and you really appreciate that. You want to understand, again, more about how they like the product, what feedback they have. Personalization is key. That's something that consumers crave. They don't want to be shouted at, they to be engaged with. That transcends beyond the influencer and goes to just really anyone who is interacting with a brand in any capacity.\n\nBen: A great point that Magda makes is that the people who are most influential to your customers might not be the kinds of people that we so often think of when we think about the term influencers. Really, anyone in your space that your customers and potential customers follow as a source of information or inspiration could very well be influential in their purchasing decisions.\n\nIf you're not quite sure who might be an influencer in your space because you're not really aware of anyone who fits the typical vibe or the typical aesthetic as what pop culture understands an influencer to be, it might be time for us all to expand our own understanding from an influencer explicitly being someone's job title or explicitly being a role that they assume on say Instagram to just conceive who is influential and who was a real thought leader that your customers already know and love that you could partner with.\n\nCombine that with a more story-based approach to making your pitch as to why those folks should want to partner with you and you can really turn influencer marketing from a simple, one-off transaction into a relationship that yields powerful results for both parties.\n\nNow, back to Magda.\n\nLet's say that I'm a marketer, I want to really start applying this philosophy to how I engage with other professionals, other people in my industry. Whether that's who you would traditionally think of as an influencer or if it's just experts, affiliates, customers, or potential brand partners. When you think about it, really, any of those people could be an influencer if they're willing to promote your brand to their own audiences.\n\nWhat's the first thing that you would recommend I do to change the way that I engage with those people as well so that the way that I'm approaching them is not just hey could you do this thing for me, or if I do this for you will you do this for me? How do I just begin approaching people with more of a relationship building-type mindset?\n\nMagda: It's really about the value you're providing to those individuals, first and foremost. I think that it is really, really tempting to basically say this is everything I need. I need high-quality content, I need social posts, I need product reviews, and I need my customers to tell me they love me. Of course, that's what is needed, but ultimately by flipping the script and really thinking about okay, let me take a step back and let me think about how I can invest in these individuals as individuals with the idea that this is going to have a long-term payoff.\n\nWhat I mean by that is perhaps it is less about approaching a customer and saying we are so happy you love our product. We’d love for you to fill out this review. Instead, approaching them and saying we're so happy that you've been a customer since 2015. We would love to invite you to be a part of an online event that we're hosting. Something like that where you're providing them with something is going to be valuable because ultimately that is what's going to make them inclined to engage with your brand in a more meaningful way.\n\nWhen it comes to an influencer it is a little bit different because influencers are in the business of content creation. They understand that there is a transaction involved there, but I still think that even when it comes to influencers having this idea like story-based selling where you're telling your story, you're offering up that value initially, and you're even letting them know that you take it very seriously—what it means to be an influencer for a brand. It's not something that you are writing off as just something that's a box you're checking. You really appreciate the content they create.\n\nThe value add is the biggest piece that I've seen some of the top brands that really are on the bleeding edge of community efforts. Brands like Revolve, Glossier, and Lululemon. That's something that we see them doing a lot of thinking about the value add first.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-84131\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/06/191_Magda-Podcast-Graphics_quote-03.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1361\" height=\"630\" />\n\nBen: Sure. Maybe a simple way that I'm summarizing all of that in my mind right now is you're providing value for the influencer so the influencer can help tell your brand story rather than you're just like here's a check, here’s our product, and will you wear my yoga pants in your Instagram story? Whatever the case may be. That makes so much sense. Because I imagine that when you do that, the ROI of your investment is going to be exponentially greater over the long-term than it would be if you went for the easy thing of just waving money in front of someone's face.\n\nMagda: Absolutely. The piece about storytelling is so critical because this is something that marketers talk about all the time, but brands are really built in the minds of their consumers. It's really important to have different people outside of your brand telling your brand story through their unique lens.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-84132\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/06/191_Magda-Podcast-Graphics_quote-04.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1361\" height=\"630\" />\n\nInfluencers come from all walks of life. If you're an athletic brand and you're selling yoga pants, you could get 10 different people that have 10 wildly different stories about how they interact with your brand, their fitness journey, or whatever it may be. That personalization is so powerful because that's something that, as a consumer, I can look at and say oh, I see myself in one of these 10 people, and I see myself in one of these 10 stories. Not only are you getting really great stories, but a lot of the times when influencers feel invested in, they're just going to produce better work.\n\nAssets are really something that no brand is ever going to say we have enough content. They always need more content. Influencers can create that really high-quality, beautiful, and socially-optimized content that brands can use across their entire marketing stack. That's really where, to your earlier point, you're going to see a massive increase in the ROI from the work that you're doing.\n\nBen: Absolutely. Say I'm that same marketer in our hypothetical example we've been creating here. Once I've learned the basics of trying to apply a more story-driven, relationship-based approach to influencer marketing, what can I do strategically to kick things up to the next level? Once I’ve got the basics of this concept down and I've started to change my thinking about how I approach this a little bit, what's the next step beyond that?\n\nMagda: The next step is really around providing value beyond money and products. Really focusing on what experiences you can create for these individuals to make them feel even more invested. I'll give you an example. In the pre-COVID world, a lot of brands would do things like retreats with their influencers and their community. Again, going back to the Lululemon example, they will take their influencers on these incredible retreats where they're really focused on health, wellness, and all things that are values of Lululemon’s brand but very separate from the product.\n\nIn these posts, the influencers aren't talking about the products at all, it's just about the experience. In a post-COVID world, a lot of these experiences are moving online. If you really want to ramp up building better relationships with your influencers or with your community, you can do things like hosting webinars, going on Instagram live, or even just picking up the phone and calling these individuals to check-in. It's ultimately more work, of course, to run this program but the payoff is going to be so much greater because you'll have people that are invested in your brand for the long term.\n\nI would say providing experiences, events, online events, and co-creating products alongside your influencers. I'm sure you've seen different brands that have like a brand X influencer’s name product line. One that comes to mind and I'm obsessed with is the brand Billabong. They have a partnership with the influencer Sincerely Jules to create really, really beautiful beachwear. Things like that just to get these influencers more ingrained into your brand is going to turn the dial up on the quality of the output that you're going to get from them.\n\nThe last thing here is not being afraid to amicably end a partnership with people that don't make sense. If there is someone where you're trying to build that relationship, but it seems like it just keeps coming back to this transaction—you're not really connecting, it's okay to do an audit of everyone you're working with and really lean into those people that are super engaged, are super excited and part ways with some of the influencers that perhaps aren't as great of a fit.\n\nBen: Got you. That makes sense. The last question that I'll throw your way, are there any common mistakes that you see marketers make when it comes to influencer marketing or just community building in general? If so, what are they and what would you recommend that marketers do instead?\n\nMagda: Totally, yeah. A big one that I'm seeing right now is a narrow view of what it means to be influential. Traditionally, we think of influencers as people that are on social media, have a high following, and have a high engagement rate, but that's really just one form of influence. Influence can mean a number of different things. Another example is I, as a brand, could want to find people that can influence the creation of my product. I actually want them to be hands-on in co-creating it with me. Those individuals will have a huge influence on your business because they're helping you create your product, but they might not have a social media presence.\n\nReally, what I talk to a lot of our brand partners about is expanding who they consider to be influential to include people like those enthusiasts, subject matter experts, fans, and customers, of course, and evolve the way they work with these individuals. It might not be that a subject matter expert is posting on social media about your brand. It could be instead they're coming into your offices and creating really detailed subject matter expert videos that you guys are then using for your email marketing campaign.\n\nIt really is just about shaking up the way you think about influence and having a program that is really multifaceted and supports a number of different business objectives.\n\nBen: It makes sense. That's all I've got. Is there anything else that you think is really important to add that you maybe didn't get a chance to mention in there?\n\nMagda: Just as a key takeaway, the most important thing that we see is treating everyone in your community—whether it's an influencer, a fan, or a customer—as really an extension of your business. If I can leave everyone with a point to drive home that really is the most critical piece because when you have that built-in loyalty, that really allows you to have this super-engaged group of people that are going to support you in good times and in tough times. I think a lot of brands are seeing that, especially right now where they're leaning into their communities more than ever. I would say incorporating those people into your brand as much as possible.\n\nJust as a last, last take away, we have more resources that we create at AspireIQ that could be helpful for anyone that's interested in learning more about influences, community building, or any of the things that we're talking about today.

Welcome to the show.\n\nDave: Good to be here. Thanks for having me. Thanks, everyone for listening.\n\nBen: Yeah, absolutely. Would you mind taking a moment to introduce yourself and explain what you do at Shortlist?\n\nDave: Yeah, absolutely. My name is Dave Schneider. I live in Philadelphia with my wife and newborn child, Leila. I am the CEO of Shortlist. Shortlist is a digital marketing agency. I also formerly ran NinjaOutreach. That was an influencer marketing software that I sold two years ago. As far as business endeavors, those are the two that stand above the rest. As for what I do there because you mentioned, it is my agency. Mostly I interpret the position of CEO to be everybody else's servant. Anything that ever anybody else needs to get done needs to have done. I just fill those gaps.\n\nBen: Absolutely. Everyone's facing a lot of challenges right now as we continue to work our way through the COVID-19 pandemic. I imagine that being in an agency, you see a lot of changes happening and a lot of challenges that companies are facing, not only for your own company but for your clients as well and maybe even your clients’ customers too. What are some of the top challenges or the most common challenges that you see companies facing right now?\n\nDave: Yeah, you're absolutely right. We have the benefit (so to speak) of our business being involved in many other businesses. We get to get some line of sight into what's going on COVID-related kinds of activities. There are some businesses that have not seen too many problems at all. Even some that are actually having a spike in their sales–certain ecommerce sites. People are buying more things online now than going into retail, for example.\n\nThere is a positive side to this for some, but for the majority, they're definitely struggling with people that are just not really ready to confidently spend money because they are uncertain about the future. When people are uncertain, they don't spend as much money typically.\n\nIn particular niches, I've had a client that was in the social networking space, which was about developing confidence, about being better—I wouldn't say public speaker but just kind of socializer. That's the worst place to be right now because nobody's going on being social. They have had to totally reposition the way in which they market themselves, they market their products, and to make it more relevant to what is on everybody's mind—which is uncertainty, my job, money, and things like that.\n\nFor example, their approach has been to talk about networking. Networking as a great way to build yourself a bit of a buffer against any issues, if you lose your job or something. So many jobs are found through networking and everything. That's a lot of their course has been how to be a better networker. With that angle, that spin on hey this is going to help you find another job in the event that you lose yours. That's something people are willing to invest in right now.\n\nBen: That's a really interesting point. I feel like for anybody, networking is something you should be doing anyway. Let's say I'm a marketer, maybe I'm an entrepreneur, or I'm some someone who is working in either marketing or something marketing adjacent (we’ll say). Let’s say that maybe networking is not something that I had ever really proactively thought about. Now I'm finding myself in a position where, hypothetically, of course, I'm really wishing that I would have built that network so I did have those connections to fall back on.\n\nWhat would you recommend someone start doing in that position? If you're finding yourself in freefall, how could networking help you? And what's the first thing you would recommend that person does?\n\nDave: Certainly, with networking difficult and I circle with it as well. But definitely, if you're a marketer, and you mentioned being a marketer and being an entrepreneur, I feel like networking is particularly valuable. Because the people that you meet which are business owners, other entrepreneurs are always starting businesses. They're always in need of services. And they're often talking and sharing with other people about the services of people that they've met in need. I feel like the network has to particularly pull in effect in the market entrepreneur niche. As much as we might not all love to go out and check-ins this and that, it is super valuable.\n\nStep one is recognizing the importance of it because if we don't actually internally believe it, we're never actually going to excel or commit ourselves to it. But then, beyond the belief mindset aspect of things, the first thing before trying to meet somebody totally new is to cultivate the relationships that you currently have because I think we all have them. We just often have not reached out to Craig who we met at the podcast convention last year or whoever it was.\n\nMaking that list of people saying hey there are 10, 20, 30, or whatever people that I think would be good to check in with. Say hey, say how they're doing, what are you working on these days, do you need help with anything, or that type of stuff. Certainly, the ice is broken because with everything going on with the pandemic, it’s so easy to be like hey how are you holding up? Because there's this natural conversation icebreaker into why you might be reaching out and saying hey and stuff like that. Hey, I'm just checking in with my friends. I’m making sure everybody's happy and healthy and stuff like that.\n\nThat would be my step one. At some point, you do want to start to meet some more people, get yourself out there. If it's online—Zoom calls, conferences, and stuff like that.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-84731\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/194_Dave-Podcast-Graphics_quote-03.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1361\" height=\"630\" />\n\nBen: Yeah, absolutely. Bringing things up to a company level. That's a great tip for individuals and entrepreneurs in particular. This is going to be a little bit of a vague question. I feel like the challenges that different companies are facing, as a result of COVID-19, can be wildly different just depending on what type of business they are and what their circumstances are like you had touched on earlier.\n\nIn general, let's say that my company is facing some sort of negative consequence as a result of people just not going out as often or people just having less disposable income and things of that nature. What would be the first thing that you would recommend that I do to diagnose that situation and then start devising solutions or start finding ways to pivot in order to ride out the storm (so to speak)?\n\nDave: It's super tough, obviously. For some businesses, in particular, more than others. If you run a restaurant or something like that, to some extent, I hate to say you're along for the ride but there are certain cases where it's just going to be hard no matter what you do. That said, in terms of basically how to approach this, the first thing would be if you really are in some serious situation where you're worried about not being able to pay the bills and stuff like that, then top of mind needs to be getting the financial aid or the loans that have been made available.\n\nFor example, in the US in the government—I know that not everyone listening is American and stuff like that, but if you are or [inaudible 00:13:38] in your country, there are those types of things available. Definitely take advantage of them. That's just keeping lights and food on the table type of priority number one stuff. After that, increasing your runway—cutting spending and things like that, where it's necessary. I don't like to cut spending. I don't think anybody likes to cut spending.\n\nDepending on your situation, I wouldn't slash everything. I wouldn't slash everything that would be growth-oriented because if and when we do come out of this some months from now—and things are starting to look a little better. It's hard to tell which direction they're going to go from here, but I do feel it's better than one or two months ago right now. You don't want to have just halted all of your growth projects and then you’re not really in a good space there.\n\nThat doesn't mean that you can't go through your accounting. Take a look at what you're spending money on. Surely, there are some things. Usually, there's a couple of corners that we can cut off. That's important as well.\n\nBut more longer-term, it's always the responsibility of the business owner to provide their target audience with products and services that they're interested in, whether you're in COVID or not. If COVID just happens to be like a large situation that needs to be addressed, but it doesn't really change the fact that people's minds change, trends and fads change as well.\n\nYou need to be communicating with your target audience. You need to create that circle where feedback is coming to you so that what is important to them right now. I give the example of the company that I have as a client who is trying to focus more on networking as a means of being more recession-proof versus being a more confident socializer or something like that.\n\nJust changing the angle. That might mean changing the angle and current of services and products. It might mean creating something totally new that just the other stuff doesn't offer. There are so many different scenarios with where the business is at. Like I said, it's a big question because it’s generally things that could be used here. But those are the types of things that we should be thinking about.\n\nBen: When it comes to talking about cutting spending and the belt-tightening that just happens as a natural byproduct of the type of situation we're in right now, I imagine that something that marketers are going to be really concerned about is their budgets getting cut or potentially losing their jobs. Because as we all know, a lot of times when things get tough, a lot of companies will start going after the marketing budgets first because they see it as a cost center and not a revenue driver.\n\nIf a marketer finds themselves in that situation or if they think that they might find themselves in that situation, how would you recommend that they make the case for marketing as really being a growth driver that you don't want to lose right now?\n\nDave: Totally right. Marketing is associated with spending and with growth (so to speak). Those are the types of things that people might be cutting back on because they said what are we doing marketing for?\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-84732\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/194_Dave-Podcast-Graphics_quote-04.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1361\" height=\"630\" />\n\nFirst of all, marketing could be tied to something like retention. In that sense, you may want to position your job or your role as maintaining the current customers that you have, for example. That's just one way to think about it. In other cases, just making the point that if we stop on the different activities that we're working on, that the long-term effect that that's going to have if we're not constantly producing whether it's content, the newsletter, or things like that. That's going to kind of hurt the company long-term if we don't pursue that.\n\nPositioning towards what the business might need at the very moment, which may be retaining customers depending on the business model. If it's a software subscription or something like that. Just also finding the middle ground between okay look, we think of marketing as this whole big thing, but within marketing, there are activities that are extremely growth-oriented.\n\nThey're like something we don't really know how it's going to do, but we have some spare money, so we're going to spend money and see what happens. That's a project that maybe we're going to cut versus these types of things really need to be done. They're just part of the business operations—constant production of content, putting on a newsletter, social media, or whatever it is.\n\nJust distinguishing that marketing is not all the same, that not all marketing activities are the same. Just reminding the internal team that okay let's make sure that these are the core functionalities that we never stop.\n\nBen: I love that advice to really make sure you're focusing on your most profitable activities, projects, campaigns, and things that you can be working on. That's excellent advice. To get a little bit more granular and a little bit more tactical as it pertains to messaging right now, anybody who has turned on a TV in the last three months has seen an ad for a car company or something saying in these uncertain times…\n\nThat's the clichéd tagline that just seems to keep coming up, and it comes up for good reason. These are uncertain times, but it does start to feel as though the messaging is playing it safe in some ways and maybe getting a little bit tired or just looking at what other brands are doing and parroting the same talking points.\n\nI'm curious then, do you have any advice for our listeners around how you can pivot your messaging toward something that is authentic and that does speak genuinely to the struggles that people are going through right now without relying on those safe yet tired clichés that we see so often?\n\nDave: Copy is so delicate because one of my experiences as a marketer is just that sometimes you never know what copy is going to work and what copy is going to convert. Sometimes it can be something that you want to really just blatantly spell it out there. Something a little bit more (I wouldn’t say) alarmist but very clear, I guess. Other times you want a more nuanced approach and either/or could potentially provide some benefits to the extent that anybody can.\n\nAlways testing copies—split testing and things like that—is going to be your friend because it allows you to take multiple approaches and then know statistically which one is actually providing better results. But I realize that split testing is not practical for every single business out there.\n\nWhen it comes to addressing the situation currently, certainly nowadays, maybe airing a bit more on the side of subtlety and nuance because obviously, there's a lot of negative association with COVID. Immediately arising that negative feeling with someone when they're on your brand and looking at your products and services might not be ideal for creating a sale. Also, things are a little bit farther removed from where they were on day one or day two. We can also dial it back. It's fair to talk about networking being great for recession proofing, finding work, and things like that without saying hey you're probably going to lose your job in the next two weeks or something like that. You don't need to be so blatant about it.\n\nPeople can fill in the gaps. Or hey this is the perfect equipment for the person who wants to work out at home. We don't need to say hey all gyms are closed, so why don't you try this. The implied is there so we just want to write the copy that addresses the current situation people are in without reminding them of all the negativity that's around.\n\nBen: The last question I'd like to throw your way—this is getting back to a point we made earlier about budget constraints. But maybe bringing it down closer to the level of a marketing practitioner who has to get their work done maybe with a smaller budget than what they thought they were going to have going into the year. If they're like most marketers, they probably started 2020 with their goals, metrics, KPIs, and things that they had laid out.\n\nNow that that's all up in the air, if I'm just a marketer working within the purview of whatever discipline I'm in or whatever things I'm responsible for, how would you advise that person really manage to find ways to make the most out of what they do have?\n\nDave: Firstly, I just want to mention that if you're talking about, for example, marketers who are servicing clients or have a boss, then probably the first thing you can do is try to set some expectations. I know not everybody wants to hear about hey this might not be as big of a growth year as we were expecting or something like that, but it's better to bring it up now than to wait until the end of the year when everybody reviews KPIs. Then to say oh but then we had COVID and this and that.\n\nBe proactive and put it upfront. That's in the event that you're a marketer and you’re maybe servicing some clients and stuff like that. The budget has become smaller and you had promised some results earlier that may not be applicable now.\n\nIn the event that it’s just you and you are your own entrepreneur or something like that, you're just thinking about how to get the most out of the least that I have. First of all, (I would say) it's probably a little bit of a fallacy to assume that when we have more budget (or things like that) that we're going to grow more because we're likely to be less efficient. We’ve mentioned earlier on the call focusing on the activities that are going to be the most profitable, which is going to provide you with the most ROI.\n\nThe more budget, the more available resources we have, we tend to throw out things that we might not think are going to be as good. But we said well we might as well try it because we have the time we have the money. Now is not that time. It's really looking at the activities and saying is this really going to move the needle? This is a simple question but I ask it all the time when I think about the quarterly tasks.\n\nIn the agency, we have a 90-day plan. This is like what in each department do people want to get done in the next 90 days? It's usually a long list. That's usually fine because hey why not? Why not throw a bunch of stuff in there? But in today's day, when we have to really cut down in terms of what we are going to put on our plate in the next quarter, we can ask ourselves, is this really going to move the needle?\n\nYou'll find that many things won't. If you actually ask that question, you'll probably find that actually this really isn't going to do what I really need to happen. This is just some work that I'm going to do. Those are the ones that should be on the chopping block to really get rid of. As an example, when I used to run NinjaOutreach, we had a problem with customer retention and engagement. We were thinking about all these little tweaks, these little features, and stuff like that.\n\nThe more I looked at those the more I realized that this wasn't going to change anything at all. The fact that this little navigation menu was now vertical instead of horizontal or something like that, that was not going to change somebody's mind about whether or not they wanted to continue to use the software. We had to get at the heart of the issue about the usage and what they were trying to get out of it. Think about that, 80-20 and those types of things. You'll find that you don't necessarily have to sacrifice a ton of growth by just working more efficiently.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-84733\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/194_Dave-Podcast-Graphics_quote-05.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1361\" height=\"630\" />\n\nBen: Yeah, absolutely. If people are able to find ways to work more efficiently and more effectively, then maybe that's at least one upside as they're going through this entire experience. That's fantastic advice. That does it for all the questions that I had. But before I let you go, I would just like to ask, pertaining to this topic, that you think is really important to throw out there that we haven't touched on yet.\n\nDave: The couple of times I've had on podcasts I’ve talked about this topic. I always like to try to end with a little bit of optimism because I know it's a downer. Personally, I haven't run a business in a recession. At least when I think 2008, 2009, those [inaudible 00:28:32] years. I wasn't running a business at the time. I started NinjaOutreach in 2014.\n\nFor me and many other people, this is new territory. I know it's not for sure that we're in a recession or who knows. We don't know what we're in but we know it's a little bit shaky. I do think that if you take the advice that you hear on this show, from other guests and myself talking about being more efficient, being a bit more budget-minded, and thinking about what the target audience wants, that you'll be prepared.\n\nThat combined with maybe a little bit of extra work is going to get you through this and then you're going to come out even better on the other end because you're going to have a better understanding of your target market. You might have improved products and services. You'll have an improved balance sheet from having cut out useless junk that you were spending money on. You might end up in a better spot. You got to get through it obviously to make it worth it, but I think there's something waiting on the other end that would be better.\n\nBen: Absolutely. I really appreciate you leaving us on a hopeful note.\n\nDave: That’s the least I could do.\n\nBen: Genuinely though, that's fantastic advice. I imagine a lot of folks out in our audience will really benefit from hearing at least a little bit of positivity right now. All right. Cool. Thanks again, Dave, for coming on the show. I wish you and your team the best of luck over at Shortlist.\n\nDave: Thank you so much.

Holiday gift guides.\n\nShoppers usually don't start thinking about or reading them until November, but PR and marketing departments are working on them as early as spring or summer. You need time to put together your plan, pitch media outlets, and get them everything they need to put together their gift guide by the time holiday shopping starts.\n\nWhich is why successful PR pros, like you, deserve a high five for making it work.\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">How can you stay on top of trends, seasons, what media outlets are doing, what your company has going on, and make it all work together?</span>\n\nIf you're like any of the PR pros I know, a meticulous calendar sure helps — <strong>a</strong><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"> master calendar that combines the seasonal calendar with your brand's marketing calendar and the editorial calendars of media you want coverage from.</span>\n\nThis kind of PR content calendar is more than a big list of dates.

It can also map them in relation to your other important marketing campaigns and business events, so you can see how your PR schedule aligns with the rest of the business plan.\n\nAn important note about your PR calendar is that it's not just a calendar of publish dates or final deadlines. It actually breaks down the different steps of the process and all the tasks associated with them into a manageable timeline.\n\nAll the minor deadlines, campaign-related meetings and appointments, and requests for assets from the design team and quotes from the executives. All the to-dos you can think of in advance required to land great coverage.\n\nOf course, which to-dos are required will vary based on your company's individual<a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/pr-plan-template/\"> </a><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/pr-plan-template/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PR strategy</a></span>. A sampling of what might go on a PR calendar includes:\n<ul>\n \t<li>The dates articles or other media coverage go live.</li>\n \t<li>Publish dates for your brand's content around the campaign (i.e. an award announcement, press release, or sharing news on social media).</li>\n \t<li>Deadlines for quotes you, your team, or your executives are giving to journalists.</li>\n \t<li>Shipping dates for sending product samples to reviewers and influencers.</li>\n \t<li>Deadlines for pitches and award submissions.</li>\n</ul>\nAnything you need to do or remember in order to land coverage is fair game.\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Why Do PR and Marketing Teams Need a PR Calendar?</span></h2>\nThere are already business calendars, marketing calendars, content calendars, and more. Why do PR calendars need to exist as well, and why should your team have one? Is it just for the sake of feeling organized?\n<div class=\"link-callout\"><strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/marketing-calendar-template/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How to Plan a Marketing Calendar That Actually Works (Template)</a></div>\nWell, yes and no.\n\nDon't discount the impact on performance and productivity that overwhelm can have on your marketing team. If anyone doesn't know what's going on or what needs to get done, it can create confusion that results in project delays and errors.\n\nThat's why having a PR calendar is about more than just the organization and color coding. It's about:\n\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Aligning Public Relations With Other Business Activities</span></h3>\nThink of the different calendars in your Google Calendar as different layers of your PR and marketing. They each show a separate view, but all together, you get the whole picture.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-84221 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/aligning-pr.png\" alt=\"Aligning PR with other business activities.\" width=\"1361\" height=\"976\" />\n\nThe overall business calendar is the core that everything else should be based on. The marketing calendar is the second layer — how you communicate your main calendar to your customers through things like launches and campaigns. The content calendar can be a third layer that shows what content you'll use to implement those campaigns.\n\nConsider your PR calendar a final layer; showing how you'll use publicity and visibility to amplify your marketing messages. By looking at them all, you get a full understanding of how public relations ties in with other business and marketing activities.\n\n[Tweet \"Having a PR calendar is about more than just the organization and color coding.\"]\n\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Planning PR Around Holidays and Trends</span></h3>\nAnother way a PR calendar will make your whole team's work easier is through the ability to plan in advance for any seasonal holidays or trends your brand might want to join for publicity. For example, the gift guides we talked about earlier.\n\nThose important, time-sensitive campaigns can sneak up on you quickly when you don't have them — and the prep work they require — mapped out in advance.\n\nWith a calendar, you can presently block off seasonal trends or events relevant to your industry and add them to your calendar as yearly recurring items — they'll never sneak up again.\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Easier Internal and External Collaboration</span></h3>\nFinally, when you're collaborating as much as public relations requires, you have a lot of different people of which you are accountable — external collaborators, like journalists and publishers, colleagues and co-workers, and freelancers working with your company.\n\n[Tweet \"When you're collaborating as much as public relations requires, you have a lot of different people of which you are accountable.\"]\n\nA PR calendar can be shared with everyone involved in the projects, and it will help you in working together and communicate more easily without missing external deadlines that could sacrifice coverage.\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">How to Create and Manage a PR Calendar</span></h2>\nSo you're ready to get organized for your team, the contacts you work with, and yourself. Where do you get started?\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">1. Choose your format</span></h3>\nFirst, you need to decide where your PR calendar will live. As much as I love paper calendars and markers, I don't recommend them for entire marketing and PR plans. That means your options are a good old spreadsheet, a basic digital calendar, or<a href=\"https://coschedule.com/marketing-calendar\"> </a><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/marketing-calendar\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a dedicated editorial calendar tool</a></span>.\n\nThere are some pros and cons for each option, so consider your own team's needs.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-84222 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/build-pr-calendar.png\" alt=\"Three ways to build a PR calendar.\" width=\"1361\" height=\"3136\" />\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">2. Decide On Your Content Types</span></h3>\nOnce you've decided where the PR calendar will live, it's time to start building out your campaigns and processes inside it.

You also want to leave enough blank space or free time to respond to timelier trends and events as they pop up.\n\nSecond, what seasonal trends or campaigns will have the most impact?\n\nYou want to stay top of mind for your target audience as much as possible, but it's also worth spacing out content during \"quieter\" times while your team is working behind the scenes on a big project where the company pulls out all the PR and marketing stops for a short period of time.\n\nOnce you know the constraints you're working with, you can set goals for your content cadence, like monthly videos, weekly blog posts and press coverage, and daily social posts.\n\n<div class=\"link-callout\"><strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/marketing-calendar-drag-and-drop/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How Your Marketing Calendar Helps You Be Flexible When Project Dates Change</a></div>\n\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Brainstorm and Add Content Ideas</span></h3>\nOnce you've laid out the structure and cadence of your calendar, you can start<a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/creative-ideation-workshop/\"> </a><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/creative-ideation-workshop/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">brainstorming content</a></span> and PR ideas and adding them into the calendar's empty slots.\n\nYou'll want to brainstorm things like:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Story angles to pitch media</li>\n \t<li>Guest content and thought leadership</li>\n \t<li>Content for your company blog</li>\n \t<li>Social media and email campaigns</li>\n \t<li>Content promoting events, awards, and other PR</li>\n</ul>\nYou'll also want to try to organize things around relevant themes or seasonal trends as much as possible, too.\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Keep Moving Parts Organized</span></h3>\nFinally, you need to actually use and maintain your new calendar.

Thanks for coming on the show.</span>\n\nRuss: Thank you so much for having me. Excited to be here. I think we might be clients soon, that's kind of cool too.\n\nBen: Yeah, yeah. Very cool, very cool. Always loving the opportunity to talk to CoSchedule customers or soon to be customers. Can I get some insights from your areas of expertise and things that you're working on that you can share with our audience? With that in mind, would you mind just introducing yourself briefly and explaining what you do at Design Pickle?\n\nRuss: Right. I'm the CEO of Design Pickle. We are a flatrate creative services platform. That sounds fancy but really, what we do is we help businesses, marketers, actually a lot of other creatives find the dedicated help when they need to design. We do graphic design, we do custom illustrations. The cool part about our model is you just pay one price every month like a gym membership and you use it as much as you need. You never have to pay anything more than that subscription fee.\n\nBen: I think the marketers in general have a pretty good understanding of why design is important and why investing in design and creative is important. In your own words since you're online, how would you summarize the value of investing in quality design. Not just design but in investing in design that is high quality.\n\nRuss: I think it really comes down to a bigger concept which we probably don't have enough time to go so deep on, and that is around your brand. The thing about branding, it's a big term. It's a mysterious term. Some people think oh, we'll. My logo. Other people understand that it's more than that. Ultimately, regardless of the definition of brand, it's your unique competitive advantage. Pretty much anything anyone's doing can be done and copied. It has been done before in some form of fashion.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-83895\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/06/190_Russ-Podcast-Graphics_quote-03.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1361\" height=\"630\" />\n\nThe brand is really your secret sauce. When you talk about visuals and creativity, that's how most people communicate their brand. Atleast, initially. It's what you see first. It's what you experience in an ad. It's the website. It's those emotions that are invoked. If you're not paying attention to that, you're missing a huge opportunity as well as you're not being competitive if you're not actually thinking about okay, we have our whole course service of what we do. How else do we relate to the marketplace? What are we doing that is unique in that way? That to me is something that when done right, cannot be copied.\n\nBen: To follow that up, just given how important branding is in design, creativity, and how those things point into building a strong brand that goes beyond just like my brand is my logo. Kind of how the cliche goes. What factors do you see that hold companies back from sufficiently investing in design creativity? I feel like the value is obvious. What's preventing companies from really allocating the resources they should be in this area?\n\nRuss: First, a couple things come to mind. One is they've tried before and it was a disaster. They said you know what? We're going to make this investment. We're going to hire somebody. We're going to hire an agency or a firm. We're going to hire a freelancer or uncle Joe's niece that's going to do some stuff for us. It didn't work out. They lose a lot of money. They lose a lot of time. They felt almost like they got taken. Then, they just say screw it. We don't want to make that investment. It's not that important.\n\nThe other thing I see is they overcomplicate it in their mind. That can be true. They think about how am I going to find someone? How do I know if they're good or not? Buying creativity in creating content and investing in those resources, it's not a common thing. It's not like giong to buy milk. You're going to buy milk, you know what milk should cost. You know where to find milk. You know if the milk's good or bad because you can taste it. You have all of these references for milk purchases but in design and creativity, you don't.\n\nYou're really venturing into the unknown sometimes, often for the first time. People think oh, it's complicated. I don't know. How do I do it? Then, that much choice and that much openness just says screw it. I'm not going to do it.\n\nThe other thing that I think is just really practical time and money. They think they don't have enough time or it's too expensive to invest in it. It's a luxury. That then prevents them from it. A lot of things that go on in the mind prior to making it, that's really why I started Design Pickle. I wanted to just shatter all of those preconceived notions and just say look, it's easy. It's reliable. It's affordable. It's good. Guess what? If you don't like it, you can take it back. Just like if you open the milk and it's spoiled, you can take the milk back. It's like hey, I don't like this milk. Almond milk, not for me. I'm bringing it back, or whatever you choose.\n\nBen: Sure, yeah. I think that makes so much sense, especially since so many things with design, with creativity, with branding—say, if someone is a marketer, they're business owner, maybe they know that they need design but they maybe don't necessarily recognize what good design looks like, they don't really know what they're buying or what they're shopping for.\n\nIf I'm a marketer or if I'm a business owner or someone of that nature and I'm listening to this episode, that's kind of how I'm feeling. I understand that design's important but I don't feel like I would know the difference between the good design or bad design. I don't have time or money to waste making mistakes in this area. What would you recommend that I look for? What should I be looking for when I look for a creative partner? When I look to a higher designer and things like that?\n\nRuss: It's important to me when I'm working with clients—and I don't work with clients directly, I'm talking to clients and I'm coaching them. You do have to have some idea of the direction you're headed. The great part is it's so easy to figure that out from an emotional level without any experience. You can find them on Pinterest. You can find them on Instagram. You can just go look around your house and see the brands that are represented in your home that you're attracted to and found.\n\nYou don't need to be able to dissect that. You don't need to have a three page thesis on why your Sonos speaker or your Fitbit wristband vibes with you. You just need to vibe with it. Then, what you can do is you pass that data onto your designer, your creative, and the team that you're working with to say hey, I like this. These are the things that make me feel warm and fuzzy inside. You go figure this out. That's what an expert creative will do.\n\nThe creatives at Design Pickle expect people to be busy. They expect people to be moving in a lot of directions. If you just give them a cardinal direction, you just say hey, let's just go north. Here's what that looks like to me. Here's a collection of inspiration and examples. A professional designer whether it's a Design Pickle designer or not, but if they're professional, they can unpack that for you. That's where people get mixed up. You don't need a long ass brief. You don't need to have tons of details, you just give them the vibe. That's it. That's my professional advice. Give them the vibe. They'll take it from there.\n\nWhen the work comes back, it comes back in a relatively reasonable amount of time, you give them feedback again. Is this on track or not? You just work through it with examples, with visuals, and make it like boiling down balsamic vinegar. You get that reduction. Finally, you'll get it, and you're like yes, this is it! This is what I've been looking for.\n\nBen: Sure, yeah. I love that way of describing it. Just figuring out what you like and just starting there. Even if you don't know anything about design, everybody knows what they like. You see something and you're like yeah, that's awesome. I like that. I like that it speaks to me in some ways. I love that advice. I think that makes so much sense.\n\nLet's say I'm not seeing marketer, business owner, marketing manager, type of person looking to either build out a design team or I'm hiring out my design. I'm making that investment and I've gotten this far. I've got to start. Maybe we're starting to put more effort in that area. We're starting to hit a ceiling where our needs for design are outphased in available resources. What tips would you have for that person who is looking to really scale their design production and really looking to maximize just trying to get as much as they can on that investment?\n\nRuss: The larger your design or creative means—this goes for any content, this could be video, this could be all sorts of stuff, the best thing is you first specialize and really put those things into buckets. When you start looking for volume plays, or the most value for growing, where you'll waste a lot of money is when you try to find a generalist who can do it all. The people who can do it all are not cheap. They're usually not very available and usually they don't work very fast because they have tons of stuff.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-83896\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/06/190_Russ-Podcast-Graphics_quote-04.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1361\" height=\"630\" />\n\nFirst step is segmenting out your needs. What do you actually need? Do you need just visual graphics? Are you producing tons of blogs everyday or every week and you need these unique graphics and visuals for each blog and starting to really stack up? Are you doing podcasts just like this one? Are you doing a daily podcast now and you need graphics everyday? Whatever. Figure out the buckets in which this content goes into and then seek out specialists for that.\n\nAt Design Pickle, currently, we have to work, we don't do motion graphics. We don't do video editing. We're not going to be able to help you scale those areas yet but we can do the visual graphics. We can do the illustrations and unique stuff that are 100% custom original things. We'll just stay in that lane. You can stack different services. Right now, there's a Design Pickle for anything imaginable. You can find the Design Pickle for jingles, practically. It's out there, I bet. You can find it.\n\nThere are these models that really exist in our niche. They operate on a global scale using global talents. The costs are a lot different. They've been around in their experience. They'll do exactly what they say they're going to do. That's the key. Frankly, that's one of the funniest things we see. We get a lot of trolls online that really knock us and attack us. Most of them are creatives and then they realize they can get a helpful hand doing creativity in the price and the rate that we do. All of a sudden, they love us. They were like oh my gosh! I'm stressed. I'm strapped. I have too much Facebook ads to do for my clients. I just want to focus on these stuff. They end up signing up. We've got a lot of troll reversals in our time with that.\n\nBack to your question, I think the reality is get really specific, find what it is that you're trying to grow, and find an expert for that. Find an expert for that. Don't try to find a generalist.\n\nBen: I love Russ's thoughts around design and branding being a competitive advantage that another company cannot easily copy. Good design and branding are reflections of who you are as a business. When that's done well, the message that it shares and communicates to your customers is something that no one else can truly copy, because no one else can really replicate the exact DNA of your company, your culture, your values, or just why you do what you do uniquely the way you do it.\n\nDesign, when it's really good, it can communicate all of those things to potential customers in ways that are just not possible without it. If you're struggling to build a case for design within your own organization, maybe to your CMO, your CEO, just to another decision maker, or whoever it is in your company who's holding the per strings and is responsible in making decisions in this area, that just might be the best place for you to start. Now, back to Russ.\n\nSomething else that you mentioned that I thought was interesting, this might be varying a little bit off topic but you mentioned that you've been able to trigger some troll reversals. You've turned some haters into believers. Do you have any advice?\n\nThis is outside the scope of our initial discussion. This is something that I'm curious about. I think it's probably relevant for a lot of marketers and in a lot of spaces because everybody's got their detractors for one reason or another. How do you show your value to people who don't get it? How do you get someone who's not onboard with what you're doing and show them what your real value is? Kind of like switching that lightbulb in their heads so they go from not really getting what you're all about to actually becoming a customer that way.\n\nRuss: Here's the thing. Your value is based on your confidence and your certainty. The higher that is internally of what you do and how certain you are you’re going to help somebody, then the easier it is to find people to help. Is someone having a hard time or are they unsure they can't see the value themselves? It's going to be really challenging to convince other people to pay you money for that as well.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-83897\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/06/190_Russ-Podcast-Graphics_quote-02.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1361\" height=\"630\" />\n\nI look at my career prior to Design Pickle. I have eight and a half years running a creative agency—branding, design. I fought tooth and nail for every client. It wasn't easy to get them. When I look back at who I was at that time, if I'm really truthful with myself, I wasn't 100% confident even in my own company. It made the sales process really challenging. It made the sales process something that I will look at and say no wonder I lost a lot of clients and we couldn't keep them. We're a revolving door. We have some good projects and some bad projects. Just because my business I wasn't certain about, today, I don't even sweat, I shamelessly sell Design Pickle. Simply because of the value, my certainty, and confidence in it. I know it.\n\nWith you out there, marketing, communicating, and having a hard time connecting on that, the thing you need to realize and look up first is what is my own value that I need to get confident around? Sometimes that's doing less, narrowing, being more specific, focusing on a target audience. You might do marketing services for everyone and anyone. If you narrow the marketing services—I'm just going to go back to milk analogy—you're going to market the milk farmers or producers. Now, you're certain, all of a sudden, it goes up because you can build momentum in that industry, get referrals, and sell it to other people.\n\nOften, the confidence isn't the product or the service. It's that you're trying to be too broad, too big, too general. When you narrow in your niche and you bring that back down, that's the key. Then, it's finding those people. It's like a filter. Then, all of a sudden, you don't need to worry about trying to convince anyone because you're so narrow and specific that only the people you're going after will vibe with you. Back to the word, vibe, that's the keyword there.\n\nWe don't worry about people. If you've never spent a dollar on creative services before, you spent $0, I say our price is $400 a month, you're going to be like oh my gosh! That is so much. That is crazy. I can't imagine spending $400. If you've hired someone before and you spent $3000, $4000, $5000, $6000, a month, you know the median value. We've niched in terms of our price and our products. I don't waste time trying to convince the people who don't get it. I just focus on the people who automatically get it.\n\nBen: Are there any specific ways that you feel that strong branding and design—say you are confident in your company, in your service offerings, your products, are there any specific ways that really good branding and design can help you not only feel that confidence but communicate that confidence so you bring in those people that do vibe with what you're about?\n\nRuss: Absolutely. Being able to just create. Create and update. Have the content that reflects the niche, that reflects the target audience, that reflects that value. That's like painting such a broad picture. It takes resources, time, and money to do all of that. When you have that complete package with your visuals, with your brand, with your content, I get an email and it looks in a certain way, then I go to your website and I see a graphic. Then, someone from the sales team messages me and their email footer’s dialed in. Then, I get a PDF review of what you do. It's all synced up together. That builds trust and confidence subconsciously. For a guy like me, consciously because I'm obviously already knowing it.\n\nIf the target person you're talking to isn't versed in branding, subconsciously, you're building trust. The touchpoints and the connections aren't jolting them around. If you've ever seen an ad in a restaurant or a hotel and you're like oh my gosh. There's this restaurant in Southern California. It's in the ocean and it's cool. I saw this ad. My wife and I went out there. I walked in and it's like a carpeted floor, dim lights, a weird drink menu like pina coladas. It's like where are we? The brand and the ad didn't match up with the reality. All of the sudden, your spidey sense goes off. The same happens with online businesses, professional services, and businesses.\n\nBeing able to connect all that together, that then enhances your ability to connect with those people. At the end of the day, it just acts like a magnet. Magnets are only going to attract things that can be magnetized. You put up a plumb, it's not going to connect with the magnet. Don't worry about it. You're not trying to attract plumbs. You're trying to attract metals and specific tons of metals. Just tons of analogies today.\n\nThat's the part about your brand. When it's done right in the creative content and everything you're putting out there, it then becomes the magnet. You don't even need to worry about finding the right people because they will automatically be attracted with what you're doing. They'll be shared with people that are the right fit. That momentum builds and builds the more years that you focus on it.\n\nBen: The last question I've got for you, do you have any parting advice for marketers on how they can collaborate with designers more effectively? A lot of our audience are marketers whether they're marketing managers or individual contributors, or people that are doing the work. How can those folks just have better working relationships with designers and not make themselves frustrating to deal with?\n\nRuss: All right, I'm going to definitely give a shameless plug here but not for Design Pickle. I'm going to share something else. First is just to communicate visually. That's it. It's the easiest thing I can say. Communicate visually. Find stuff visually and then send it to them that that is what you're looking for. That does take a little bit of homework. If you expect your designer to be creative to read your mind or not there yet but it can happen. You have to be able to pass it on.\n\nMy shameless plug is next month, you can sign up just for the sample of it, we're launching our own stock asset library called FreshStock. Go to freshstock.com. Right now, we're giving away free assets. Every week you get 5-10 templates, design templates—everything. Our hope is this side is going to be flatrate $5-$50 a month. You can download unlimited, whatever you need that we can give marketers using it to then find the things they want, they like, and send that to their creatives, say hey, this is what I'm thinking our brand should go. This is the direction we should need. Spend $50 a month to be able to save that much time, typing, revisions, back and forth, emotional energy. When it comes back and it's wrong, you just save that and send them visuals of what you're looking for.\n\nWe're creating the tool to help. There's obviously the free stuff—Pinterest and all of that. That's all out there too.\n\nBen: Very cool. This is a great conversation. I just want to thank you again for coming on the show. Before I let you go, I'm sure there's lots of stuff in this topic we can spend hours talking about. Is there anything in particular that's just right on the tip of your tongue that you're wanting to get out there but didn't get an opportunity to?\n\nRuss: Aside from my shameless FreshStock plug which I just did, we're good there. Actually, yes. There is one thing—just create. There's nothing that's going to break in the world if you just start creating. It's not like you are building the SpaceX rockets that we're all tracking right now. If one part breaks, that's a big deal. In your creation world, just create. If it's not perfect, it's not the end of the world. You can fix it, you can revise it. You grow. That's my words of encouragement.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-83898\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/06/190_Russ-Podcast-Graphics_quote-01.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1361\" height=\"630\" />\n\nI hope people, whether you use a service like us or something else, you'll just be able to create more because ultimately that's when you discover the magic and you figure out the things that work better.\n\nJust a sample case study, we redesigned all our ebook covers one month and our leads quadruple. We didn't even redesign the content titles or anything. We just said this looks a little old. Let's update the look and feel of them. We got a 4x increase in downloads just because they looked nicer. Have we not just created and just said hey, let's try it, we wouldn't have discovered that. There's all of those things hidden inside people's businesses with their brand, with their content. Just get out there and create.\n\n<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/actionable-marketing-podcast/id1162659795?mt=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-83894 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/06/190_Russ-Podcast-Graphics_CTA.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1361\" height=\"550\" /></a><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/scaling-a-brand-competitors-cant-copy-with-awesome-design-and-without-breaking-the-bank-with-russ-perry-from-design-pickle-amp-190/\">Scaling a Brand Competitors Can’t Copy With Awesome Design (and Without Breaking the Bank) With Russ Perry From Design Pickle [AMP 190]</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://coschedule.com\">CoSchedule Blog</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 23 Jun 2020 17:00:00 +0000","feedId":4227,"bgimg":"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/06/190_Russ-Podcast-Graphics_header.png","linkMd5":"c50d9ea766336f38391db9a075faec8d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn11@2020_4/2020/08/24/21-56-11-191_c3d2df8c27c36651.webp","destWidth":1361,"destHeight":581,"sourceBytes":127876,"destBytes":43298,"author":"Ben Sailer","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/06/190_Russ-Podcast-Graphics_header.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn11@2020_4/2020/08/24/21-56-11-191_c3d2df8c27c36651.webp","https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/06/190_Russ-Podcast-Graphics_quote-03.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn3@2020_2/2020/08/24/21-56-35-382_213dbd596c91f84b.webp","https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/06/190_Russ-Podcast-Graphics_quote-04.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn12@2020_3/2020/08/24/21-56-36-442_eedbfb67dd65bf5b.webp","https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/06/190_Russ-Podcast-Graphics_quote-02.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn75@2020_2/2020/08/24/21-56-34-287_f10aa487b2512c93.webp","https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/06/190_Russ-Podcast-Graphics_quote-01.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn92@2020_2/2020/08/24/21-56-33-402_54a0f1e84b40ec96.webp","https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/06/190_Russ-Podcast-Graphics_CTA.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn15@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-56-33-078_1da46e0018760b83.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598306169509},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 05:56:09","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 05:56:09","title":"The Best Way to Write a Creative Brief (With Templates)","link":"https://coschedule.com/?p=65620","description":"<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-85613 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/creative-brief-template-header.png\" alt=\"The best way to write a creative brief with templates (header)\" width=\"1361\" height=\"585\" /> Marketing projects can sometimes be a challenge to \n<a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/smash-creative-ruts-by-building-a-rock-solid-collaborative-ideation-process-with-sean-ironside-from-egym-amp-187/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">get off the ground</a>. Everyone has a different vision for what the campaign should be, what the creative will look like and what the objectives are.

Not having one increases the likelihood of missed deadlines and means a heck of a lot more time wasted on making sure everyone is on the right track. The creative brief serves as the documentation for the project’s objectives and how you’re going to achieve success — the “what” and “how”, essentially. Marketing teams need to focus carefully on ROI to prove our worth. Creativity is often overlooked in this equation. As evidenced by the thrown together creative briefs copied and pasted from old campaigns. \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-85614 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/creativity-quote.png\" alt=\"The purpose and impact of creativity\" width=\"1361\" height=\"584\" /> Doesn’t it seem odd that you’re willing to spending a bunch of money on a project, but not spend more than 5 minutes making sure your project is set up for success? \n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-65741 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/creative-brief-slide-deck-08.png\" alt=\"Rejecting a creative brief\" width=\"770\" height=\"484\" /> \n<h3>Reason 1: Define the Scope and Help Avoid Scope-creep</h3> The creative brief says a lot about what the project is, but it also provides insight into what the project isn’t. For example, let’s say your creative brief outlines a project to redesign your website’s blog. &nbsp;The scope of this project is clear; you’re not setting out to re-design any other area of the site. This avoids what we call \n<a href=\"https://www.wrike.com/project-management-guide/faq/what-is-scope-creep-in-project-management/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">scope-creep</a>. Scope-creep can be compared to the “might as-wells”. “If we’re redesigning the blog, we ‘might as-well’ redesign the about us pages, too.” This can be especially difficult if your project is on behalf of a client. You, as the project manager, need to make hard decisions about whether you need to adjust the cost and risk the client getting upset, or eat the cost and hurt your profitability. Your creative brief can help you avoid this conundrum. Collaborating with your client or team at the beginning helps prevent misunderstandings about deliverables and gives you a document to reference if scope-creep arises. \n<h3>Reason 2: Clarify the Project’s Timeline</h3> Most projects have a definitive delivery date, so it’s a good idea to include a timeline in your creative brief. Marketing teams juggle multiple projects at once, which means it can be a challenge for individuals to manage everything on their plate. It’s important for Marketing Managers to value their team member’s opinions regarding realistic timelines and workloads. Gain input while formulating the creative brief or use something, like \n<a href=\"https://coschedule.com/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=paid-ppc&amp;utm_campaign=coschedule-success&amp;utm_content=brand-coschedule-known-v2&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI6_fer4WC6wIVD9vACh0HBAJYEAAYASAAEgLNH_D_BwE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CoSchedule’s Team Management Dashboard</a>, to make sure timelines are realistic. \n<h3>Reason 3: Mitigate Confusion and Answer Questions</h3> Have you ever been pulled into a project and felt confused about the who, what, where, when, and why? Or maybe those questions have lingered in your mind throughout the duration of the project? Let’s be honest, we’ve all been a part of a marketing project that has felt a little half-baked. The process of writing the creative brief itself helps you work through strategic questions that may otherwise go unanswered. Likewise, everyone involved in the project will have a clear idea of what’s going on and can understand the project’s reason for existence. Which makes your job as the de facto project manager a lot easier. \n<ul> \n <li>Questions about timeline? Check out the creative brief.</li> \n <li>Questions about target audience? Creative brief.</li> \n <li>Questions about process? You guessed it... creative brief.</li> \n</ul> BOOM. You’ve just saved some time by not having to re-answer the same questions over and over again. \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/marketing-plan-samples-and-templates/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">34 Marketing Plan Samples and 7 Templates to Build Your Strategy</a>\n</div> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/?p=65620#toc\">Back to the Top</a></strong>\n</div> \n<a name=\"elements\"></a> \n<h2>Elements of a Great Creative Brief</h2> Creative briefs can vary slightly in what they actually contain. Some opt for more information; others are more condensed. Here’s a running list of items you may consider including in your brief. \n<h3>Project Summary</h3> Describe the project in one or two sentences. Boil it down to the basics. This gives everyone who might come into the project (at any point in time) a high-level understanding of what the project is. It also makes it easier to iterate on the project down the road. \n<blockquote>\n “E-commerce research project intended to attract small business owners wanting to launch their own e-shop.”\n</blockquote> \n<h3>Target Audience</h3> Outline who you’re trying to reach with the campaign. This can be simply a certain user persona or it can be a demographic outline. This is important as it gives the project member an idea of who they’re talking to/ designing for. \n<blockquote>\n “Small business owners and ‘makers’ that are currently selling on \n <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_term=etsy_e&amp;utm_campaign=Search_US_Brand_GGL_General-Brand_Core_All_HP_Exact&amp;utm_ag=A1&amp;utm_custom1=_kenshoo_clickid_&amp;utm_content=go_227553629_16342445429_310396601160_kwd-1818581752_c_&amp;utm_custom2=227553629&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI1JPU4YeC6wIVTL7ACh36yARWEAAYASAAEgL4lfD_BwE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Etsy</a>, farmer’s markets, etc.”\n</blockquote> \n<h3>Problem</h3> What problem is the project trying to solve? Why do you need to do *this* project? This narrows down why the project exists and why the company needs to do this particular project. \n<blockquote>\n “{Insert company name} is finding it difficult to convince designers, makers, small business owners etc. of the benefits of creating their own webshops rather than selling via Etsy. This report will provide {the company} with original data to use throughout the year and will highlight the benefits of setting up an e-commerce site.”\n</blockquote> \n<h3>Goal<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">&nbsp;</span></h3> Why are we doing this project? Make sure your goals are measurable and avoid setting too many. Stick to your one metric that matters. \n<blockquote>\n “The primary goal is to increase interest in using {company platform} as the go-to e-commerce platform. This will help position {company name} &nbsp;as the best solution for setting up an e-commerce website. We will create a comprehensive research report that aims to convert 5,000 new paid users by the end of 2019.”\n</blockquote> \n<h3>KPI</h3> How will success be measured? This sets the stage for how you will know if your project was successful or not. It also helps you understand if the project should be repeated. \n<blockquote>\n “This report will be measured based on the number of new accounts generated from gated downloads.”\n</blockquote> \n<h3>Process</h3> What are the general steps we must follow to finish the project? This is a good outline that can become a task template once the project kicks off. It also is a good way for each team member to visualize where they fit into the project. \n<ul> \n <li>Write survey questions</li> \n <li>Distribute survey</li> \n <li>Analyze data</li> \n <li>Write content for the report</li> \n <li>Design PDF</li> \n <li>Prepare promotion strategy</li> \n <li>Measure</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Individuals/Teams Involved</h3> Who do you need to get this project done? This serves as a reminder to everyone that they need to be involved in order for the project to get off the ground. \n<blockquote>\n “PR, Graphic Design, Social Media, Analytics, Content Marketing, Email Marketing”\n</blockquote> \n<h3>Timeline</h3> What is the due date for this project? Every project needs to have a start and end date… they can’t drag on in perpetuity. This makes it easier for people to plan their workloads and get things finished on time. \n<blockquote>\n “End of Q2 2019”\n</blockquote> \n<h3>Budget</h3> How much can you spend on this project? This can either be a client’s budget or internal resources that are dedicated. You can also think of this in terms of hours devoted to this project. \n<blockquote>\n $25,000\n</blockquote> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/?p=65620#toc\">Back to the Top</a></strong>\n</div> \n<a name=\"how\"></a> \n<h2>How to Write a Great Creative Brief</h2> Aside from including the right information, there are a couple things you should also think about when compiling a creative brief. \n<h3>Be Specific</h3> You want your creative brief to clear enough that anyone can understand the project. A vague creative brief will often produce results that fall far short of expectations. When a creative brief misses the necessary specifics, significant revisions often arise which makes for a frustrating process for all involved. \n<h3>Set S.M.A.R.T Goals</h3> Setting S.M.A.R.T goals help put your project on the fast track to success. \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-85615 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/creative-brief-smart-goals.png\" alt=\"SMART goals in relation to creative briefs\" width=\"1361\" height=\"689\" /> An example of a S.M.A.R.T goal might be: \n<blockquote>\n We will create a comprehensive research report that aims to convert 5,000 new paid users by the end of 2019.\n</blockquote> The goal is specific by identifying that you want to help drive new paid users. It’s measurable because your team will be able to tell if you hit your 5,000 increase paid users or not. It’s attainable based on previous benchmarking for similar campaigns. The task is relevant because it’s contributing to the company’s bottom line. Finally, the task has a time limit to see if the project was successful or not. \n<h3>The Operative Word is Brief</h3> The creative brief is exactly what it says… brief. It doesn’t need everything and the kitchen sink. Offer an abridged summary that can be easily digested. It shouldn’t be TL;DR. You don’t need to link to a dozen planning spreadsheets, email chains, and related documents. Chances are, those supporting documents won’t even be looked at, so don’t waste your time. \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-85616 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/leah-dekrey-brief-quote.png\" alt=\"Leah Dekrey quote about creative briefs\" width=\"1361\" height=\"549\" /> [Tweet \"Creative brief examples to help guide your next project.\"] \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/?p=65620#toc\">Back to the Top</a></strong>\n</div> \n<a name=\"irl\"></a> \n<h2>Show Me an “IRL” Creative Brief Example</h2> Now that some of the best practice issues have been discussed, let’s jump into a real-life creative brief example.

It’s a nice Friday afternoon where I'm at, how are things on your end?\n\nRegina: It's beautiful, sunny, and in the '70s, so it’s a perfect Friday.\n\nBen: Yeah, it sounds flawless. Would you mind taking a moment to introduce yourself to our audience and explain your role at First National Bank of Omaha?\n\nRegina: Great. Yes, I'm Regina Demars. I'm the director of content marketing and social media strategy at FNBO. In my role, I really focus on developing content that adds value to our audiences and elevates our brand reputation. My team works tirelessly on creating a lot of content in different formats that customers and potential customers are really seeking and focuses heavily on financial advice and guidance.\n\nBen: Very cool. I think you're in an interesting space, because anything to do with financial services and banking is going to be caught up in regulation, compliance, and things of that nature. I'm curious, in your opinion, from your perspective, or from what you've seen, what are some of the most common problems that marketers in financial services and banking face when it comes to things like regulation, compliance, and those sorts of things?\n\nRegina: I would say the main problem would be the ever-changing regulatory environment and the timeline. Everything that highlights products we need to run after compliance and sometimes the turnaround time is much longer than the turning hour or minute on social media. Social media trending topics come and go very quickly, so to make sure that we remain relevant in the space, time is of the essence.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-85667\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/198_Regina-Podcast-Graphics_quote-01.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1361\" height=\"630\" />\n\nAnd our compliance team typically would like a week to 10 days, and we try to follow those time frames ideally, but we also have a really good relationship with our compliance team. They know that sometimes we need to email or call them with an urgent request, especially if something's trending that we want to leverage on our social media channels.\n\nBen: I suppose beyond maybe just the occasional emergency requests to compliance, what are some other top tactics or strategies that you found to be really effective at FNBO to get around some of the issues that you face with lag time? If you're trying to get something out that's timely but you might have to wait up to a week-and-a-half, how do you deal with that?\n\nRegina: We have a lot of specific procedures in place to help alleviate any of those potential issues. We have a monthly social media governance meeting where we present ideas to a core group that includes compliance and legal representatives. They have an opportunity to provide us feedback on our efforts. We have a lot of internal audits that we go through throughout the year, just to ensure we’re following outlined procedures and make any necessary recommendations to help enhance those efforts.\n\nBefore we engage with influencers, bloggers, or small businesses, we work with our legal team to conduct negative news searches and can do background checks. That helps limit any risk or potential negative brand reputation concerns.\n\nWe also make it a point to try to understand all the regulations on an ongoing basis because they are changing, and these monthly meetings help us with the compliance team to let us know what things have changed, so we can work as far in advance as possible. We have very detailed and up-to-date social media policies that outline rules, regulations, roles, and responsibilities.\n\nWe keep all of our social accounts secure. We monitor our brand online, but some good advice too is not only should you monitor your brand, but since social media for financial institutions is very regulated, it's important to archive the content. All of our channels are archived in case we ever need to go back and report on past communication. A very close relationship with the compliance department just really helps make that more of a seamless process.\n\nBen: Yeah, absolutely. It really sounds as though that relationship you've built with your compliance staff is really what enables you to move as quickly as you need to without upsetting anybody on that side of the company.\n\nBut say if I'm a marketer, and I'm listening to this conversation. Say, I'm at a bank or I'm working at some sort of financial services organization.  And let's say that company doesn't have a positive relationship with compliance or with legal, or maybe they don't really have a relationship at all. How would you recommend that that marketer begin to build that bridge with that team in order to make it a mutually beneficial arrangement?\n\nRegina: Our social media governance team has evolved, and we work with compliance and the rest of the participants in that group to help identify people who are interested in social media and who are more active, so they better understand the channel. We found that when we first started the group, we identified certain people to be a part of it. And as our monthly meetings happened, we’re like, wait, we really need people who understand the channels better.\n\nThat was a really good first step to say, who even wants to understand the social media channels more in-depth, and who is active because they really do have your best interests in mind. They just may not understand the channel and what you're trying to accomplish. It may just need some additional education.\n\nWe also found that showing things visually really helps, because sometimes when you try to explain it on paper, and people don't know the channels as much. It was a little more complicated, and they weren't really understanding our strategy. Now, as part of that group, we have people who are invested in social, and we share our overall strategy with them. We have regular training with compliance, which also helps them be able to give us recommendations on how best to accomplish our goal, while staying compliant.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-85669\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/198_Regina-Podcast-Graphics_quote-02.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1361\" height=\"630\" />\n\nBen: Sure. From what you're describing, that sounds like that's a very collaborative relationship between your team and compliance rather than compliance just being like a big brother, or maybe a more appropriate analogy would be they're not like a disciplinary team that’s looking over your shoulder and making sure you're doing what they say. It sounds like you're really working together to make sure you're doing the right things.\n\nRegina: Yes, it has definitely helped to have a strong working relationship. And we talk in our meetings—instead of saying no, how can we mitigate the risks and still move forward?\n\nBen: Something that seems so simple and yet is so essential for marketing teams—getting things done with other departments within a company, not only in financial services, but in general—is to work at building better relationships with those teams. In the case of banking and finance, your compliance and your legal teams are probably not out to get you. They just need to know that they can trust you to let them do their jobs, and that they can trust you to do yours.\n\nThe more that you can communicate the value of marketing to them, the more that you can communicate the necessity for those approval processes being expedited, then the better able you'll be to achieve mutual understanding of one another’s goals, and just the better you'll be able to create timely social media content, and work through those approval processes more quickly and effectively. Now, back to Regina.\n\nLet's say the same hypothetical marketer who works at this financial services organization. Let's say they've gotten themselves up to a point where they're in a position like the one that you're in now where they have a good relationship with compliance, everybody is working together, things are great, and now they've got some breathing room to maybe do more creative things than what they could do in the past. Or maybe they now finally have the freedom to do anything at all with social (potentially). This person really could be working from scratch.\n\nWhat are some types of content or some types of messaging that you found work really well for financial services companies that you might suggest they start experimenting with?\n\nRegina: Yeah, from an organic perspective, we know that people are looking for educational, inspirational, and entertaining content. From a paid perspective, we focused there more on awareness, consideration, and conversion. We know sometimes the topic of banking can be a little boring, so we make sure to switch up our content.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-85670\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/198_Regina-Podcast-Graphics_quote-03.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1361\" height=\"630\" />\n\nWe have blogs, photos, videos, motion graphics, infographics, and that’s worked really well for us. We found early on that stock photography doesn't always work, so we've been working on creating our own photo library of real photos with real employees, and often leverage our own employee photos. Because that helps drive a lot of engagement. It's really authentic.\n\nWe work closely with our SEO experts. They help us determine the content that consumers are interested in, and we build content from there. But our strategy, honestly, is always evolving to meet our customers’ needs, and we know people are looking for advice and guidance, which we push on our branded channel, so we are active on all of them—Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-85671\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/198_Regina-Podcast-Graphics_quote-04.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1361\" height=\"630\" />\n\nThis year, we actually launched Cashology Facebook group, which was really designed to create a supportive, approachable community around personal finance. We create content on a variety of financial topics, whether it's saving, creating a budget, investing, or frugal travel.\n\nWe also created, this year, a YouTube video series that features our own employees called the Dollar Belles. Because from research, we found out too, that women are really seeking financial advice, but they want to hear from people like them, they want content that's approachable. We created a more light-hearted series. It’s educational, fun, and engaging. Again it really does strengthening our brand’s authenticity by featuring real employees in their 20s, 30s, and 40s.\n\nA few other components that I think are key to a content strategy for financial institutions—social selling, influencer marketing, employee brand ambassador programs. That has been a great way for us to show how FNBO is a great place to work and also a great place that you want to bank with. We create products and services that are relevant to younger audiences because you want to create that relationship early on, because that's when they're looking for a new banking relationship.\n\nDebit cards aren't unique to a financial institution, but we've had a really focused effort on creating debit cards that have meaning behind them, so there's a stronger connection to our brand.\n\nThis year we launched a Be Kind Debit Card series with different designs like Girls Support Girls, there’s a card that’s focused on mental health awareness where we partnered with Boys Town to give a donation to their national suicide prevention hotline as part of their effort. Really everything we do, we're looking out there to see what topics are trending and how can we create a deeper emotional connection between our brands, potential customers, and our current customers.\n\nBen: Yeah, and that all sounds like awesome stuff. In particular, that debit card initiative really sounds incredible. I feel inspired hearing that as a marketer, but if I were to put myself in the shoes—just going back to this hypothetical banking financial services marketer who’s maybe approaching a lot of this more from the ground up. It sounds as though a lot of these things that you're talking about doing are things you have to build up toward, and they require staff, they require resources to really execute well.\n\nBut if someone is approaching this—maybe their department just isn't that robust yet, or their marketing maturity maybe just isn't there to be able to support all those activities yet, how would you recommend that marketer make the case for themselves to get the resources they need to really do work that's going to matter?\n\nI imagine if they're going to go into a conversation with any kind of decision-making stakeholder, they're going to need a really good argument in their corner for—in a lot of cases—anything. To hire another person, to add software, or anything like that. If someone is in that position, what would be your best advice for them?\n\nRegina: Yes, I've been in that position several times at different companies, and it is really important to educate people on content marketing and how it can have an impact on revenue growth. Show how content can build relationships, and relationships obviously are built on trust, and trust can help drive revenue. Anytime you can, honestly, do Google search to show the impact that reviews, referrals, and recommendations can have on your business, it's pretty powerful to show that's the type of content people are seeking.\n\nThey want education, advice, and guidance. If you do a Google search and you have a presence on social media channels, you have a blog, you have organic content, your name's going to come up more likely in the first age when people are seeking a new relationship and looking for a bank.\n\nAny time that you can show how adding a person, creating a team can help you achieve your business goals, and have all the content tied back to those business goals at your company. I started out really with developing content pillars to show here are the messages we want to get out to customers and prospects, here are tactics we can do that, and here are our results that we've seen.\n\nA lot of times, it comes down to testing things and making a case. Testing, we definitely did not launch all this at once. A lot of these tactics that I just talked about, they could've taken a year or two years to build up to being able to execute them, continuing to build a case for resources, and why we need to be in those spaces.\n\nWe always talk about, at FNBO, we want to have our messages where our customers are seeking them, so we have to have a presence. We also present a lot of competitors’ case studies and show the results that they're getting, and how they're executing in the social media space to help us be able to get more resources.\n\nI guess the main thing, too, is you can't execute social strategy in a vacuum, and the more that you can engage the entire organization on how you can reach those business goals that are set by your company.\n\nBen: Yeah, absolutely. That's fantastic advice. The last question I’ll throw your way, let's say the same marketer, they've gotten themselves into a good place. They’ve got a lot of trust with compliance, they're starting to get more resources to do more things, do work that makes a bigger impact for the organization, for their customers, and they’ve put a lot of work into getting to that place.\n\nAnd then they committed a compliance, a regulatory violation, or otherwise accidentally take some sort of action that puts all that trust and goodwill that they've generated in jeopardy. What would be the best way, in your opinion, for them to begin to recover from that mistake?\n\nRegina: Mistakes do happen and they will happen, but it is definitely wise to invest in some sort of regular training, so everyone is on the same page. Working closely with your compliance team to determine what the issues were, have compliance host additional training. If it's the marketing team or the overall organization, just to ensure that everyone’s following the process, and procedures, documentation that’s on file to ideally avoid future mistakes.\n\nAnd then kind of what we're talking about in the beginning, the better relationships you have with compliance upfront and putting together procedures, processes, meetings, or whatever works best for your company to help ideally avoid those future mistakes.\n\nBen: Yeah, for sure. I think that's sound advice. Like I said, that was the last question I had.

That means you need to understand your audience, what motivates them, and what they need to hear to make a connection with your brand. A content marketing editorial calendar is essentially a planning document that gives your team a plan of attack. Like a traditional editorial calendar, it gives you a bird's-eye view of what is going on. However, it should be expanded to fit all the different marketing team channels. Overall, it should: \n<ul> \n <li>Provide a place to generate post ideas and key topics.</li> \n <li>Assign writing and other editorial tasks to key members of your team.</li> \n <li>Create a publishing schedule that helps you maintain a consistent presence.</li> \n <li>Allow you to make in-process adjustments with drag-and-drop ease.</li> \n <li>Visualize your marketing strategy in a way that everyone can understand.</li> \n <li>Act as a communication point to team members.</li> \n</ul> A content marketing editorial calendar gives you and your team a framework for building trust with your audience.

They’re essential tools for planning ahead and sticking to deadlines. Without them, it’s extremely difficult to plan content around centralized themes (think how magazines target themes each issue), or to even know who’s doing what, and when. In other words, \n<a href=\"http://coschedule.com/blog/remarkable-content/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">creating content consistently</a> without a calendar is like driving a car without a steering wheel. It doesn’t work. Smart content marketers understand this, too. However, even if you know why you need editorial calendar software, it’s possible your boss is tougher to convince. This may be especially true if the person holding the credit card isn’t actually a marketer. If this situation sounds familiar, stick with us through this post. We’re going to show exactly what you can accomplish with editorial calendar software. If you want to create great content consistently, it pays to know what you’re going to do before you do it. As we like to say at CoSchedule, “Plan your work, then work your plan.” \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-84691 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/plan-quote.png\" alt=\"Plan your work, then work your plan.\" width=\"1361\" height=\"763\" /> When it comes to planning, too many content marketers just wing it. “Winging it” isn’t a real editorial strategy, though. It leads to creating directionless content that doesn’t produce results. Deadlines get missed, projects get planned haphazardly, and teams waste time spinning their wheels. [Tweet \"Winging it is not a real editorial strategy.\"] An editorial calendar helps create order out of chaos. It provides a simple planning tool for laying out: \n<ul> \n <li>What content you’ll create.</li> \n <li>Why you’re creating that content.</li> \n <li>Who will create each piece of content.</li> \n <li>When that content will be due.</li> \n</ul> That sums up the basic functionality of a content calendar. Take things a step further with editorial calendar software like CoSchedule, and you can also achieve the following: \n<ul> \n <li>Successfully plan out coordinated content campaigns and themes.</li> \n <li>Lay out your content publishing schedule alongside your social media promotion.</li> \n <li>Manage your team member’s workflow.</li> \n</ul> That’s just scratching the surface. Let’s dig deeper and see what an editorial calendar app can do for you. \n<h3>Keep All Your Content Ideas and Projects Organized</h3> Having a great idea, only to forget it later, is frustrating. Having a great idea and simply not executing on it may be even worse. At CoSchedule, when we have a great content idea, it goes straight on our editorial calendar. That way, nothing gets forgotten, and those ideas get turned directly into actionable content that helps our audience and makes us more successful. \n<h3>Stop Missing Deadlines and Get More Stuff Done</h3> According to Parkinson’s Law, “Work expands to fill the time available for its completion.” Without constraints, people take as much time as they have to get their work done. This isn’t necessarily because they’re lazy, but because it’s built into the way humans operate. \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-84692 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/work-quote.png\" alt=\"Work expands to fill the time available for it's completion.\" width=\"1361\" height=\"763\" /> This is why we also often feel like we get more done under pressure. When deadlines are fast approaching, we’re more motivated to get the work done. With a clear content calendar to keep track of your deadlines, it’s a lot harder to forget when things are due. Clear deadlines, combined with a tool for ensuring they’re enforced, results in more content getting created. It’s as simple as that. \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/?p=55538#toc\">Back to the Top</a></strong>\n</div> \n<a name=\"software-vs-spreadsheets\"></a> \n<h2>Two Types of Editorial Calendars: Spreadsheets Vs. Software</h2> Spreadsheets are a common editorial calendar solution, and they're flexible. If you're just getting started, they're better than using nothing. \n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-57286 size-full\" src=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/calendar-spreadsheet.png\" alt=\"Example of a content marketing calendar spreadsheet\" width=\"770\" height=\"309\" /> However, they do have some downsides: \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Lack of automation</strong>. There's no way to automate publishing or content promotion via spreadsheet.</li> \n <li><strong>Disconnected workflows</strong>. The calendar is separate from social networks and email platforms used to promote content.</li> \n <li><strong>Communication is missing</strong>. Without commenting functionality, teams must rely on outside communication tools.</li> \n</ul> Fortunately, there's a solution. \n<h2>Why Use Editorial Calendar Software?</h2> Technically, you can use spreadsheets to build editorial calendars. They work well enough, and they’re cost-effective. However, their functionality is fairly limited, they can be time-consuming to maintain, and ultimately, they aren’t a ton of fun to use. Using an app instead can turn your content calendar from something you have to use, to something you actually want to use. \n<h3>See Everything in One Place</h3> The value of seeing your entire editorial strategy in one place can’t be overstated. With CoSchedule, you can see all your content in one place. This includes blog posts, social media messages (which can be toggled on/off), and anything else you're working on. You can also \n<a href=\"http://help.coschedule.com/hc/en-us/articles/215281457-Connecting-CoSchedule-To-Google-Calendar\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">connect your Google Calendar</a>, so events and meeting times can be synced on your CoSchedule calendar. \n<img class=\"drop-shadow alignnone wp-image-84601 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-14-at-1.15.32-PM.png\" alt=\"Connect your Google calendar with your CoSchedule Marketing Calendar.\" width=\"2868\" height=\"1634\" /> [Tweet \"See your entire editorial strategy in one place with @CoSchedule\"] \n<h3>Drag-and-Drop Convenience</h3> If you want to move something on a spreadsheet, you have to copy and paste it. When you have a lot of stuff on your content calendar, this can be a pain. With CoSchedule, you can drag-and-drop content anywhere you want on the calendar. This makes adjusting your calendar to reflect shifting priorities easy. \n<img class=\"drop-shadow alignnone wp-image-84618 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/blog-REBPUBLISH-Content-Marketing-Editorial-Calender-Template-32.png\" alt=\"Drag and drop feature in CoSchedule.\" width=\"1363\" height=\"687\" /> \n<h3>Collaborate in One Place</h3> With spreadsheets, your calendar and communication tools are separate. As a result, discussion around projects can easily get lost. That’s why collaboration features are built directly into CoSchedule. \n<img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter wp-image-84761 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/discussion-thread-files.png\" alt=\"Discussion thread example\" width=\"1360\" height=\"402\" /> \n<h3></h3> \n<h3>Integrate With All Your Other Tools</h3> \n<a href=\"https://coschedule.com/integrations\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CoSchedule connects with other tools</a> you’re likely using to help you get more organized and save more time. Its integrations include: \n<ul> \n <li>WordPress</li> \n <li>Social Networks (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Tumblr, and Instagram)</li> \n <li>Email Service Providers (MailChimp, Active Campaign, Campaign Monitor, and Constant Contact)</li> \n <li>Evernote</li> \n <li>Google Docs / Office 365</li> \n <li>Google Drive / Dropbox / OneDrive</li> \n</ul> And more. \n<h3>Convenient Color-Coding</h3> It seems like a small detail. However, if you’re used to planning content in spreadsheets, you probably have elaborate color-coding schemes set up to make them easier to understand. You don’t have to lose this when moving up to CoSchedule. Every item you place on your calendar can easily be color-coded for quick recognition. \n<img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter wp-image-84759 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/color-coded-calendar-1.png\" alt=\"Example of a color-coded calendar\" width=\"1360\" height=\"278\" /> \n<h3></h3> \n<h3>Store Drafts for Later and Never Lose an Idea Again</h3> Have an idea for a post you don't want to lose, or do you have something in progress you won't be able to finish until a later date? No problem. Just add it to the Idea Board: \n<img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter wp-image-84760 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/idea-board-example.png\" alt=\"Example of the Idea Board\" width=\"1360\" height=\"516\" /> &nbsp; \n<h2>Plan How You'll Actually Do This</h2> Once you know why you're doing content marketing and how you're going to be successful, you can finally start \n<a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/blog-planning-saves-time/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">planning your actual content</a> schedule. Though we're really talking about content marketing editorial calendars here and only just getting started, skipping to this point without understanding how you'll be successful in the first place is kind of a waste of time. You need to have awesome ideas to plan awesome content, and that comes from knowing your goals and your audience. \n<h3>Find the Best Ideas For Your Content</h3> Start by simply finding the best ideas to plan them as content with your editorial calendar. The challenge is to find ideas that you already know are going to \n<a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/how-to-start-a-blog-with-no-audience/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">connect with your audience</a>. You can do that by searching for socially-inspired ideas, planning them in your editorial calendar, and writing to connect with your audience. By socially-inspired content, I mean \n<strong>really listening to your audience</strong>. These content ideas are based on what your audience actually needs help with, then writing content to help them out — building the trust you set out to create in the first place. This way, you start planning content that revolves around a problem or challenge your audience is facing. \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/how-to-start-a-blog-with-no-audience/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How To Start A Blog When You Have Absolutely No Audience</a>\n</div> Easy, right? Here are some quick things you can look into to find your audience's biggest problems: \n<div class=\"alert alert-info\"> \n <ul> \n  <li>Look through your latest support tickets.</li> \n  <li>Read, respond, and ask questions in blog post comments.</li> \n  <li>Stick around for event Q&amp;As (think about when people ask questions after people present webinars, conferences, etc.).</li> \n  <li>Check out what's going on with social media, and use it to ask your audience questions.</li> \n  <li>Interview them — just chat with your customers!</li> \n </ul> \n</div> I'm sure you could think of dozens of other ways to understand your audience's biggest challenges. \n<h3>Figure Out How You'll Tell Your Story</h3> By this point, you probably have a bajillion ideas you could write about. Now is the best time to plan the best way to write those ideas, so one piece of content carries on the story where another left off. \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-84766 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/blog-REBPUBLISH-Content-Marketing-Editorial-Calender-Template-09-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1361\" height=\"763\" /> Your blog posts are like chapters in a book. They should make sense together, so you can build your audience around a central topic — the biggest challenge they face. You need to find patterns to plan them in an ideal chronological order. That'll help you publish your content in the best order possible for your unique story. \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/content-marketing-story/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">An Easier Way To Tell Your Story Using Content Marketing</a>\n</div> \n<h3>Get the Entire Marketing Team On Board</h3> Let me be clear on this from the get-go, you just need to get the \n<em>right</em> people on board. Sure, getting buy-in from the higher-ups is something that definitely needs to happen, but you only need to understand what resources you have available to you to create the content you're planning. You need to know who can help you out with strategy, text, graphics, editing, and social media. Maybe that's all up to you, or maybe there are some other awesome folks who can help you out. \n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-84774\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/blog-REBPUBLISH-Content-Marketing-Editorial-Calender-Template-10-1-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1361\" height=\"737\" /> These are the main roles you'll need to fill to \n<a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/team-blog/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">build a successful team</a> that creates awesome content, and one very busy person could do a ton of these on their own: \n<div class=\"alert alert-info\"> \n <ul> \n  <li><strong>Project manager:</strong> The person who helps the team understand your audience, goals, and the stories you're going to tell. This is more high-level stuff.</li> \n  <li><strong>Content writer:</strong> Think of the folks actually writing your awesome content. They take the project manager's vision and make it reality.</li> \n  <li><strong>Proofreader:</strong> These people proofread and make sure the content will connect with your audience the way your project manager dreamed up.</li> \n  <li><strong>Content designer:</strong> This person adds tons of value to the post to help your audience consume the hard-to-understand information at a glance (actually, 60,000 times faster than text alone).</li> \n  <li><strong>Social promoter:</strong> These are your friends who spread the word. If your content is a party, these folks send the invites to your attendees.</li> \n </ul> \n</div> You could probably think of a dozen more roles that might work better for your business. The point is, find out what works for you and plan how your team will work together to publish the content you need to create. Once you know how many hands you have to help you out, you can plan a realistic publishing frequency the entire team can handle. \n<div class=\"link-callout\"> \n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/content-marketing-team-structure/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How To Structure Your Marketing Team To Create The Best Content</a></li> \n  <li><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/team-blog/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How To Assemble A Content Marketing Team For Your Blog</a></li> \n </ul> \n</div> \n<h3>Plan a Realistic Publishing Schedule.</h3> You have a ton of ideas; you could try to publish a new blog post every day of the week to tell your story. Is that really possible with the resources you have available? Is that much content in a week really necessary? People don't wake up one day and run a marathon. Runners build up their ability to run long distances over time. They \n<strong>start small and plan</strong> for the large races. Content marketers and bloggers have to do the same thing. For someone brand new to the game, \n<a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/how-to-start-a-blog-from-nothing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this is a great plan for your first six months</a> to help you build up your content marketing endurance. \n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-84775\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/blog-REBPUBLISH-Content-Marketing-Editorial-Calender-Template-11-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1361\" height=\"1127\" /> Your \n<a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/publish-more-consistent-content/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">publishing frequency</a> is really dependent on the resources you can dedicate to content marketing objectives. Use your editorial calendar to set up a content schedule that you and your team can handle. Follow it. Decide how many blog posts you’ll publish each week, your social media post frequency, and how many larger pieces of content you’ll do each month/year (i.e. videos, ebooks, white papers, etc.). Schedules do a couple of amazing things. They force you to not let \n<a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/writers-block/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">writers block</a> win, and they guard against content gaps. \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/publish-more-consistent-content/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How To Publish More Consistent Content That Will Help You Grow A Successful Blog</a>\n</div> \n<h3>Your Organization’s Email Marketing Schedule</h3> You’re most likely sending marketing emails either daily or weekly per list segment. Here are the best times to send those emails (according to 10 studies): \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-84702 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/email-timing.png\" alt=\"Finding the best time to send an email.\" width=\"1361\" height=\"1127\" /> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/?p=55538#toc\">Back to the Top</a></strong>\n</div> \n<a name=\"getting-started\"></a> \n<h2>Getting Started With Your Editorial Calendar Strategy</h2> If you're going to try and implement an editorial calendar with your team, you will need to express how it will help you grow your traffic and improve your business. This will take you right back to some of the things we discussed earlier in the guide about the business value of content marketing as a whole. Here are some key benefits to communicate: \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Better visibility across projects and campaigns</strong>. Everyone knows when each piece is publishing and who is responsible for it.</li> \n <li><strong>Ability to finally get organized</strong>. Disorganization leads to frustration and lack of productivity.</li> \n <li><strong>Reducing the number of missed deadlines</strong>. No one likes missing deadlines; without a calendar to track them, it happens.</li> \n <li><strong>Spending less time planning and more time executing</strong>. Spending time planning and getting organized eventually saves time.</li> \n</ul> Those are some strong benefits that any marketing team could get behind. \n<h3>Understand Who You're Talking to With Personas</h3> It's cliché to say that you need to understand who your audience is, but it couldn't be more true. Not only do you need to make sure that you understand your audience, but so does your team. A good place to get started would be with some \n<a title=\"Find The Right Target Audience, And Make Writing Easy\" href=\"http://coschedule.com/blog/target-audience/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">basic customer profiles</a>&nbsp;or audience personas. \n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-84776\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/blog-REBPUBLISH-Content-Marketing-Editorial-Calender-Template-13-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1361\" height=\"1096\" /> \n<h3>Take an Inventory of Your Team</h3> Who's on your team, and how will each of them be contributing to the end product? This may sound simple, but it's an important question. If there is only one of you on your team, this step may be better spent writing down some of the required tasks, in the order in which you will do them. Here are some roles that'll likely be working off your calendar: \n<ul> \n <li>Writers</li> \n <li>Designers</li> \n <li>Project Managers</li> \n <li>Social Media Managers</li> \n <li>SEO Specialists</li> \n <li>Content Strategists</li> \n</ul> If they're on your marketing team, they can get value from your editorial calendar. \n<h3>Develop a Basic Channel Strategy</h3> Not all content is equal, so you should decide what yours will look like. The basic starting point is usually a WordPress blog, but you might have other channels, like: \n<ul> \n <li>Social media (broken down by network)</li> \n <li>Email marketing</li> \n <li>Video platforms</li> \n <li>Landing pages</li> \n <li>Webinars</li> \n <li>Courses</li> \n</ul> The world of content marketing is vast, and all of it can be planned on your calendar. \n<h3>Find Your Content Core</h3> The content core is the intersection between your brand's purpose and your customer's interests. \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-84706 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/what-to-cover.png\" alt=\"What to cover in your content core.\" width=\"1361\" height=\"912\" /> Understanding this will help you plan content that's both: \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Relevant to your audience</strong>. What do they want from you?</li> \n <li><strong>Delivers results for your business</strong>. How will it attract the right audience to your company?</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>How Will You Plan?</h3> Most teams that use content marketing editorial calendars like to have regularly scheduled meetings to plan out their content. Decide if you'll do one of the following: \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Run group brainstorming meetings</strong>. Great ideas can come from anywhere.</li> \n <li><strong>Leave content planning to an editor or strategist</strong>. These folks are closest to the data that will guide you to success.</li> \n <li><strong>A mix of both</strong>. This way, you can take advantage of the pros for each approach.</li> \n</ul> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/coschedule-buyers-guide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How to Overcome Makeshift Marketing: The CoSchedule Buyer's Guide</a>\n</div> \n<div> \n <h3>Map Content to Marketing Funnel Stages</h3> Next, \n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/marketing-funnel/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">map each topic to a marketing funnel stage</a>. You'll need content that fits each of the following stages: \n <ul> \n  <li><strong>Top of funnel</strong>. This is content that broadly interests your audience, but is only loosely connected to your brand. People looking for this content are likely not aware of your company or product yet.</li> \n  <li><strong>Middle of the funnel</strong>. This is content that speaks to potential customers who are considering buying the type of product or service you offer.</li> \n  <li><strong>Bottom of the funnel</strong>. This is content that converts shoppers into customers.</li> \n </ul> Here's what a basic marketing funnel looks like: \n <img class=\"alignnone wp-image-84707 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/marketing-funnel.png\" alt=\"What does the marketing funnel look like?\" width=\"1361\" height=\"1055\" /> The majority of your content will likely be top of the funnel, since these topics typically generate the most interest. However, content increases in value, even as it decreases in volume, the further down the funnel you go. \n <h3><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-84708 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/content-quantity.png\" alt=\"How much content should be at the end of the funnel?\" width=\"1361\" height=\"1198\" /></h3> \n</div> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/?p=55538#toc\">Back to the Top</a></strong>\n</div> \n<a name=\"execute\"></a> \n<h2>Execute Your Plan With Your Content Marketing Editorial Calendar</h2> One of the hardest things to do is change. Really, humans are inherently adverse to change. \n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-84768\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/blog-REBPUBLISH-Content-Marketing-Editorial-Calender-Template-16-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1361\" height=\"972\" /> One of the first things you need to do is develop effective habits with your content marketing editorial calendar. You — and I really mean you since you're the one who looked up this post and is reading it — can't be the only one on your team who uses your editorial calendar. These things are a million times better when everyone who's involved uses the same tool to create your content. You need to be the person who helps your team use your editorial calendar. Here's a look at how you can help them develop effective habits: \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-84769 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/blog-REBPUBLISH-Content-Marketing-Editorial-Calender-Template-17-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1357\" height=\"889\" /> A great way to develop effective habits is with a recommended-reading-defined workflow. \n<h3>Use a Workflow That Actually Works</h3> It's one thing to throw a post on your editorial calendar. It's another to \n<a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/content-marketing-workflow/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">assign specific tasks</a> that need to be completed to make sure that post gets published. Remember, content marketing is a team effort. \n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-84777\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/blog-REBPUBLISH-Content-Marketing-Editorial-Calender-Template-18-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1361\" height=\"1629\" /> That's your workflow, and your entire team needs to pitch in to help make it a reality. A clearly defined workflow will help your team communicate more efficiently, and it gives everyone something to be accountable for. You'll all know exactly what you need to do to create awesome content. Sounds complex, right? Thankfully, your marketing team’s workflow doesn’t have to be super difficult. A solid workflow helps you and your entire team: \n<div class=\"alert alert-info\"> \n <ul> \n  <li>Understand the big vision behind what you're doing.</li> \n  <li>Know what each person's role and responsibilities are.</li> \n  <li>Complete specific tasks to create content as a team.</li> \n  <li>Stick to one communication channel.</li> \n  <li>Focus on your own tasks instead of herding cats to get stuff done.</li> \n </ul> \n</div> To implement a workflow that actually works, you and your team need to: \n<div class=\"alert alert-info\"> \n <ul> \n  <li>Figure out exactly what tasks need to be completed for every piece of content you produce.</li> \n  <li>Understand what role would be the best for knocking out each task.</li> \n  <li>Assign those tasks to the people who fill those roles.</li> \n  <li>Assign due dates based on what needs to be done first, second, third, and so on.</li> \n  <li>Hold everyone accountable for getting their stuff done on time.</li> \n </ul> \n</div> Remember that you need to start with a \n<a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/publish-more-consistent-content/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">realistic publishing frequency</a>. If someone messes up the first couple of times, that's fine! That's why you're there to help them build effective habits for creating content. Work slow to begin with, then ramp up your \n<a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/content-creation-process/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">content creation</a> machine. \n<div class=\"link-callout\"> \n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/content-marketing-workflow/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Try This Breakthrough Content Marketing Workflow For Your Team</a></li> \n  <li><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/blogging-workflow/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Finding The Best Blogging Workflow For You And Your Team</a></li> \n </ul> \n</div> \n<h3>Start By Brainstorming Topics and Campaigns</h3> Before you can use your calendar, it needs content. One simple process that's worked well at CoSchedule is to run a \n<a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/content-marketing-brainstorming-process/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">30-minute content planning session</a>. Here's how the process works: \n<ol> \n <li><strong>Spend ten minutes writing down ideas</strong>. Have each team member jot down ideas on Post-It notes (one idea per note).</li> \n <li><strong>Spend ten minutes scoring those ideas</strong>. Put those ideas up on a board. Read each one out loud. Then, have each team member score them on a three-point scale (3 = Awesome, 2 = Meh, 1 = Dud). You'll end up with ideas that fall into all three categories, and that's okay. This isn't about shaming anyone.</li> \n <li><strong>Spend ten minutes selecting the very best topics</strong>. Take all your ideas that scored mostly 3's, and decide which are the very best. These will go on your calendar.</li> \n</ol> This video offers a more detailed breakdown on how this process works: https://coschedule.wistia.com/medias/awf6gqfh31?embedType=async&amp;videoFoam=true&amp;videoWidth=770 \n<h3>Then, Establish Clear Checklist-Based Workflows to Execute Your Ideas</h3> Figure out which steps are required to create a single piece of content. Then, determine how long each step should take. You can do this easily by first figuring out what needs to be done. Create a list: \n<div class=\"callout\"> \n <ul> \n  <li>Generate an idea.</li> \n  <li>Determine deadline.</li> \n  <li>Do keyword research.</li> \n  <li>Write an outline.</li> \n  <li>Write content.</li> \n  <li>Handoff for graphic design.</li> \n  <li>Review and content.</li> \n  <li>Ensure content is optimized.</li> \n  <li>Write social media posts to promote content.</li> \n  <li>Draft email copy to promote content to your list.</li> \n  <li>Schedule publish date and time.</li> \n </ul> \n</div> That's a hypothetical checklist for a single piece. Next, figure out who is responsible for each step. Now, this list might look like this: \n<div class=\"callout\"> \n <ul> \n  <li>Ideation (team/strategist).</li> \n  <li>Determine deadline (editor/manager).</li> \n  <li>Keyword research (strategist/SEO specialist).</li> \n  <li>Write outline (content writer).</li> \n  <li>Write content (content writer).</li> \n  <li>Design graphics (graphic designer).</li> \n  <li>Review content (content writer/editor/manager).</li> \n  <li>Ensure content is optimized (editor/SEO specialist).</li> \n  <li>Write social media posts (content writer/social media manager).</li> \n  <li>Draft email copy (content writer).</li> \n  <li>Schedule publish date and time (editor/manager).</li> \n </ul> \n</div> These don't necessarily need to be assigned to specific job titles; just tasks or roles different team members may fill, depending on your team size and structure. Now, figure out how long each step should take. Having your team use a time tracking app, like Toggl, can help you estimate this more accurately. To get started, determine how long each task usually takes right now, per step. At this point, the list might look like this: \n<div class=\"callout\"> \n <ul> \n  <li>Ideation (team/strategist – 30 minutes).</li> \n  <li>Determine deadline (editor/manager – 5 minutes).</li> \n  <li>Keyword research (strategist/SEO specialist – 2 hours).</li> \n  <li>Write outline (content writer – 2 hours).</li> \n  <li>Write content (content writer – 8 hours).</li> \n  <li>Design graphics (designer – 4 hours).</li> \n  <li>Review content (writer/editor/manager – 1 hour).</li> \n  <li>Write social media posts (writer/social manager – 1 hour).</li> \n  <li>Draft email copy (content writer – 1 hour).</li> \n  <li>Schedule publish date and time (editor/manager – 5 minutes).</li> \n </ul> \n</div> These times are completely hypothetical, for example purposes only. Next, determine how many work days this entire workflow will fill. Then, add two weeks. That's how far out in advance your content should be placed on your calendar. Finally, map this all out to a checklist your team can use. If you're a CoSchedule customer, this can be done with \n<a href=\"https://help.coschedule.com/hc/en-us/articles/215075408-Create-Task-Templates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Task Templates</a>. These are reusable checklist templates that can be added to each piece of content on the calendar. \n<img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter wp-image-84756 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/task-template-example.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1360\" height=\"645\" /> &nbsp; When you click each task, it'll show the whole team that step is complete. This will be reflected by the completion percentage on the calendar. \n<img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter wp-image-84757 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/task-completion.png\" alt=\"Example of task completion\" width=\"1360\" height=\"255\" /> &nbsp; \n<h2>Write, Design, and Edit Your Content</h2> There are some things your content writer, designer, and proofreader should keep in mind when they create and publish your content. \n<h3>1. Talk About Your Expertise.</h3> What you know best is your expertise. You don’t have to be the expert, but it’s likely you know more than the average person about your niche topic — otherwise you wouldn’t be in business. Therefore, you’re an expert. Let’s put feelings of inferiority aside, or you’ll never write a sentence worth anything to your customers. The beauty of you talking about what you know best is that you create value around your product or service. Would you rather hire a plumber who confidently talks about all things plumbing on his blog, or the guy who just has a website that says, “I’m a plumber. Hire me.”? \n<h3>2. Speak Your Customer’s Language</h3> If you have any empathy for your fellow human beings, leave the jargon at the door, please! If you’re selling light bulbs, you don’t talk about ohms and electrical resistance and how many electric trade associations in which you are a member; you talk about how long the lightbulb will last. Remember, no more corporate voice, meet your audience’s needs — these core concepts ought to prevent you from using jargon or purposefully trying to shame, confuse, or impress a customer with industry language, but it’s so easy to forget! You rattle off features when you could be telling them about the benefits. You’re not looking to be the industry expert — unless your audience is business-to-business — but an expert for your customer. \n<h3>3. Just Focus on the Bennies</h3> People don’t buy a toaster based on how hot the heating elements can get, but that it gets their toast done pretty fast in the morning, so they aren’t late for work. Heating element = feature, fast toast = benefit. When you write your content, talk about benefits, not features. People connect to benefits, because they tell them how your product meets their needs. Features only interest the sellers because they make an impressive list for those in the industry. The content you create has to find a way to translate those awesome features into real-world benefits so your audience can say, “Oh, yes, that would be helpful for me.” \n<h3>4. Yes, You Can Talk About That</h3> There’s a lot of peripheral content connected to what you think is your main focus. Yes, you can talk about that. Let’s say you sell running shoes. You could blog all day about the new shoe styles, shoe sales, shoe trends — you could be very shoe-centric. After all, that’s your gig, but think about your customer. The guy buying those shoes is... a runner. As a runner, he is interested in more than just shoes. He wants to know about running events, training options, the latest running mobile apps, outdoor trails, hydration, knee health… Wouldn’t you sell more shoes if you wrote about all of the things runners are interested in? Your content should definitely include your core content (in this case, the shoes), but also write about connected content (that other stuff). That’s what your audience wants. \n<div class=\"link-callout\"> \n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/how-to-write-a-blog-post-checklist/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How To Write A Blog Post: Your 5-Point Checklist To Rock A Perfect Post</a></li> \n  <li><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/fun-to-read/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">14 Ways To Make Your Blog Content More Fun To Read</a></li> \n  <li><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/non-designers-blog-graphics-guide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How To Make The Best Blog Graphics (For Non-Designers)</a></li> \n  <li><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/create-great-images-blog-posts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">5 Super Easy Ways To Create Images for Your Blog Posts</a></li> \n  <li><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/editing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How Much Editing Is Too Much?</a></li> \n </ul> \n</div> \n<h3>Promote Your Content on Social Media</h3> “\n<a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/social-media-calendar/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Complete social media content marketing in just an hour a day!</a>” Sounds gimmicky, but it’s not off. Do you really want to be spending more than an hour on tweets and Facebook posts? No. This plan is a tricky one, but returns great results when you get it right. Start by figuring out what your audience wants on each network. For example, five tweets an hour might be too much, and no tweeting after 6 p.m. Don’t give them an excuse to unfollow you. Know your audience, \n<a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/how-to-quadruple-your-traffic-with-a-social-media-editorial-calendar/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">know the social network’s unwritten etiquette</a>, and use that as your guide. Then, find social media marketing tools that shave time off of your plan. Time is money. Use one or two scheduling tools instead of five and an extra hour. Find good tools and spend the money. They’re going to be a workhorse for you, and you won’t regret an excellent tool that makes this easier. With your plan in place, you now know what happens when a blog post is published. It might go something like this: \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-84712 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/timeline.png\" alt=\"Social sharing schedule timeline\" width=\"1361\" height=\"1508\" /> \n<div class=\"link-callout\"> \n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <ul> \n  <li><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/how-to-quadruple-your-traffic-with-a-social-media-editorial-calendar/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How To Quadruple Your Traffic With A Social Media Editorial Calendar</a></li> \n  <li><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/promote-your-blog-with-social-media/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How To Promote Your Blog With Social Media</a></li> \n </ul> \n</div> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/?p=55538#toc\">Back to the Top</a></strong>\n</div> \n<a name=\"workflow\"></a> \n<h3>Publish</h3> If you're using CoSchedule with the WordPress integration, your post will automatically publish at your specified date and time. If you have social media campaigns and email newsletters promoting your content, you can create and manage those in CoSchedule, too. For those using spreadsheets, you'll need to make sure everything is lined up in your Excel or Google Sheets calendar, your social scheduling tool, and email platform. \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/marketing-workflow-management/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Marketing Workflow Management: How to Prevent Last-Minute Emergencies</a>\n</div> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/?p=55538#toc\">Back to the Top</a></strong>\n</div> \n<a name=\"management\"></a> \n<h2>Managing Your Content Marketing Editorial Calendar</h2> You've decided to take the plunge and start using an editorial calendar for your content marketing. You've made the right call. Not only will you find yourself producing better content, but you'll also become more consistent with your publishing. In turn, it should lead to a steady increase in traffic. As you go, there are six things that you are going to need to keep an eye on at all times. \n<h3>1. What's Happening This Week? What's Happening Next Week?</h3> If you are doing it right, you should have an answer to these questions at all times. How does your calendar make this easier? \n<h3>2. Does Your Team Know What to Do?</h3> Tools like CoSchedule allow you to assign tasks to each member on your team, making communication easier than ever. \n<a href=\"http://coschedule.com/blog/cross-functional-team/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Everyone should know what they are supposed to do</a>&nbsp;and when they are supposed to do it. \n<h3>3. Is There Healthy Communication?</h3> Discussion about a new piece of content and how to make it better should be a normal part of the process. You should have something in place that allows you to have discussions and share thoughts with your team. \n<h3>4. What About the Assets?</h3> Images and graphics can be important elements for great content marketing. Who will be responsible for them, and how will they be assigned? Again, CoSchedule makes this pretty easy with simple tasks that can be assigned to each team member. \n<h3>5. Implementing Editorial Review</h3> At our office, we use a peer review process to improve the quality of our work. Gathering feedback from our peers is a low-cost way to constantly improve the content that we create. Your calendar and editorial plan should accommodate for a step like this. \n<h3>6. Reschedule as Needed</h3> One tip for users of a paper editorial calendar is to use colored sticky-notes rather that just writing on the paper calendar itself. This gives you the same drag-and-drop flexibility that you will find in a tool like CoSchedule. \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/social-media-posting-schedule/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Social Media Schedule That Will Boost Your Traffic By 192%</a>\n</div> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/?p=55538#toc\">Back to the Top</a></strong>\n</div> \n<h2>Start Creating More Consistent Content Now</h2> Content marketing editorial calendars aren't necessarily new, but you might be surprised at how many people choose to not use them.

Everyone has a different vision for what the campaign should be, what the creative will look like and what the objectives are. Not doing your prep work on the front-end can mean you might go too far down the wrong path, which means wasted time, lost money, and disgruntled clients. What’s a marketer to do? Create a clear creative brief before the work begins, of course. If this leaves you scratching your head, have no fear. You’ll find everything you need in this post, including a step-by-step process for completing a brief, several examples to follow, and templates to make getting started easy. \n<h2>Three Creative Brief Templates + Your Projects = Success</h2> Start off by downloading our creative brief templates.

Not having one increases the likelihood of missed deadlines and means a heck of a lot more time wasted on making sure everyone is on the right track. The creative brief serves as the documentation for the project’s objectives and how you’re going to achieve success — the “what” and “how”, essentially. Marketing teams need to focus carefully on ROI to prove our worth. Creativity is often overlooked in this equation. As evidenced by the thrown together creative briefs copied and pasted from old campaigns. \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-85614 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/creativity-quote.png\" alt=\"The purpose and impact of creativity\" width=\"1361\" height=\"584\" /> Doesn’t it seem odd that you’re willing to spending a bunch of money on a project, but not spend more than 5 minutes making sure your project is set up for success? \n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-65741 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/creative-brief-slide-deck-08.png\" alt=\"Rejecting a creative brief\" width=\"770\" height=\"484\" /> \n<h3>Reason 1: Define the Scope and Help Avoid Scope-creep</h3> The creative brief says a lot about what the project is, but it also provides insight into what the project isn’t. For example, let’s say your creative brief outlines a project to redesign your website’s blog. &nbsp;The scope of this project is clear; you’re not setting out to re-design any other area of the site. This avoids what we call \n<a href=\"https://www.wrike.com/project-management-guide/faq/what-is-scope-creep-in-project-management/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">scope-creep</a>. Scope-creep can be compared to the “might as-wells”. “If we’re redesigning the blog, we ‘might as-well’ redesign the about us pages, too.” This can be especially difficult if your project is on behalf of a client. You, as the project manager, need to make hard decisions about whether you need to adjust the cost and risk the client getting upset, or eat the cost and hurt your profitability. Your creative brief can help you avoid this conundrum. Collaborating with your client or team at the beginning helps prevent misunderstandings about deliverables and gives you a document to reference if scope-creep arises. \n<h3>Reason 2: Clarify the Project’s Timeline</h3> Most projects have a definitive delivery date, so it’s a good idea to include a timeline in your creative brief. Marketing teams juggle multiple projects at once, which means it can be a challenge for individuals to manage everything on their plate. It’s important for Marketing Managers to value their team member’s opinions regarding realistic timelines and workloads. Gain input while formulating the creative brief or use something, like \n<a href=\"https://coschedule.com/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=paid-ppc&amp;utm_campaign=coschedule-success&amp;utm_content=brand-coschedule-known-v2&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI6_fer4WC6wIVD9vACh0HBAJYEAAYASAAEgLNH_D_BwE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CoSchedule’s Team Management Dashboard</a>, to make sure timelines are realistic. \n<h3>Reason 3: Mitigate Confusion and Answer Questions</h3> Have you ever been pulled into a project and felt confused about the who, what, where, when, and why? Or maybe those questions have lingered in your mind throughout the duration of the project? Let’s be honest, we’ve all been a part of a marketing project that has felt a little half-baked. The process of writing the creative brief itself helps you work through strategic questions that may otherwise go unanswered. Likewise, everyone involved in the project will have a clear idea of what’s going on and can understand the project’s reason for existence. Which makes your job as the de facto project manager a lot easier. \n<ul> \n <li>Questions about timeline? Check out the creative brief.</li> \n <li>Questions about target audience? Creative brief.</li> \n <li>Questions about process? You guessed it... creative brief.</li> \n</ul> BOOM. You’ve just saved some time by not having to re-answer the same questions over and over again. \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/marketing-plan-samples-and-templates/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">34 Marketing Plan Samples and 7 Templates to Build Your Strategy</a>\n</div> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/?p=47240#toc\">Back to the Top</a></strong>\n</div> \n<a name=\"elements\"></a> \n<h2>Elements of a Great Creative Brief</h2> Creative briefs can vary slightly in what they actually contain. Some opt for more information; others are more condensed. Here’s a running list of items you may consider including in your brief. \n<h3>Project Summary</h3> Describe the project in one or two sentences. Boil it down to the basics. This gives everyone who might come into the project (at any point in time) a high-level understanding of what the project is. It also makes it easier to iterate on the project down the road. \n<blockquote>\n “E-commerce research project intended to attract small business owners wanting to launch their own e-shop.”\n</blockquote> \n<h3>Target Audience</h3> Outline who you’re trying to reach with the campaign. This can be simply a certain user persona or it can be a demographic outline. This is important as it gives the project member an idea of who they’re talking to/ designing for. \n<blockquote>\n “Small business owners and ‘makers’ that are currently selling on \n <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_term=etsy_e&amp;utm_campaign=Search_US_Brand_GGL_General-Brand_Core_All_HP_Exact&amp;utm_ag=A1&amp;utm_custom1=_kenshoo_clickid_&amp;utm_content=go_227553629_16342445429_310396601160_kwd-1818581752_c_&amp;utm_custom2=227553629&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI1JPU4YeC6wIVTL7ACh36yARWEAAYASAAEgL4lfD_BwE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Etsy</a>, farmer’s markets, etc.”\n</blockquote> \n<h3>Problem</h3> What problem is the project trying to solve? Why do you need to do *this* project? This narrows down why the project exists and why the company needs to do this particular project. \n<blockquote>\n “{Insert company name} is finding it difficult to convince designers, makers, small business owners etc. of the benefits of creating their own webshops rather than selling via Etsy. This report will provide {the company} with original data to use throughout the year and will highlight the benefits of setting up an e-commerce site.”\n</blockquote> \n<h3>Goal<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">&nbsp;</span></h3> Why are we doing this project? Make sure your goals are measurable and avoid setting too many. Stick to your one metric that matters. \n<blockquote>\n “The primary goal is to increase interest in using {company platform} as the go-to e-commerce platform. This will help position {company name} &nbsp;as the best solution for setting up an e-commerce website. We will create a comprehensive research report that aims to convert 5,000 new paid users by the end of 2019.”\n</blockquote> \n<h3>KPI</h3> How will success be measured? This sets the stage for how you will know if your project was successful or not. It also helps you understand if the project should be repeated. \n<blockquote>\n “This report will be measured based on the number of new accounts generated from gated downloads.”\n</blockquote> \n<h3>Process</h3> What are the general steps we must follow to finish the project? This is a good outline that can become a task template once the project kicks off. It also is a good way for each team member to visualize where they fit into the project. \n<ul> \n <li>Write survey questions</li> \n <li>Distribute survey</li> \n <li>Analyze data</li> \n <li>Write content for the report</li> \n <li>Design PDF</li> \n <li>Prepare promotion strategy</li> \n <li>Measure</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Individuals/Teams Involved</h3> Who do you need to get this project done? This serves as a reminder to everyone that they need to be involved in order for the project to get off the ground. \n<blockquote>\n “PR, Graphic Design, Social Media, Analytics, Content Marketing, Email Marketing”\n</blockquote> \n<h3>Timeline</h3> What is the due date for this project? Every project needs to have a start and end date… they can’t drag on in perpetuity. This makes it easier for people to plan their workloads and get things finished on time. \n<blockquote>\n “End of Q2 2019”\n</blockquote> \n<h3>Budget</h3> How much can you spend on this project? This can either be a client’s budget or internal resources that are dedicated. You can also think of this in terms of hours devoted to this project. \n<blockquote>\n $25,000\n</blockquote> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/?p=47240#toc\">Back to the Top</a></strong>\n</div> \n<a name=\"how\"></a> \n<h2>How to Write a Great Creative Brief</h2> Aside from including the right information, there are a couple things you should also think about when compiling a creative brief. \n<h3>Be Specific</h3> You want your creative brief to clear enough that anyone can understand the project. A vague creative brief will often produce results that fall far short of expectations. When a creative brief misses the necessary specifics, significant revisions often arise which makes for a frustrating process for all involved. \n<h3>Set S.M.A.R.T Goals</h3> Setting S.M.A.R.T goals help put your project on the fast track to success. \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-85615 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/creative-brief-smart-goals.png\" alt=\"SMART goals in relation to creative briefs\" width=\"1361\" height=\"689\" /> An example of a S.M.A.R.T goal might be: \n<blockquote>\n We will create a comprehensive research report that aims to convert 5,000 new paid users by the end of 2019.\n</blockquote> The goal is specific by identifying that you want to help drive new paid users. It’s measurable because your team will be able to tell if you hit your 5,000 increase paid users or not. It’s attainable based on previous benchmarking for similar campaigns. The task is relevant because it’s contributing to the company’s bottom line. Finally, the task has a time limit to see if the project was successful or not. \n<h3>The Operative Word is Brief</h3> The creative brief is exactly what it says… brief. It doesn’t need everything and the kitchen sink. Offer an abridged summary that can be easily digested. It shouldn’t be TL;DR. You don’t need to link to a dozen planning spreadsheets, email chains, and related documents. Chances are, those supporting documents won’t even be looked at, so don’t waste your time. \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-85616 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/leah-dekrey-brief-quote.png\" alt=\"Leah Dekrey quote about creative briefs\" width=\"1361\" height=\"549\" /> [Tweet \"Creative brief examples to help guide your next project.\"] \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/?p=47240#toc\">Back to the Top</a></strong>\n</div> \n<a name=\"irl\"></a> \n<h2>Show Me an “IRL” Creative Brief Example</h2> Now that some of the best practice issues have been discussed, let’s jump into a real-life creative brief example.

This post contains a comprehensive list of the best free and paid marketing courses to help your team hone their marketing skills. [Tweet \"Check out this awesome list of the best free and paid marketing training resources.\"] \n<h2>Help Your Team Develop Agile Marketing Skills</h2> Before we dive into all the marketing training opportunities, let’s talk about a much-needed marketing skill — project management. You know the feeling; the one where you’re drowning in work, chasing endless status updates, and barely keeping a handle on all the things your team is working on. We’ve all been there, but it doesn’t have to be this way. Check out how implementing an Agile approach to your marketing can change your life. [Cookie \"Get The Agile Marketing Guide || https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/Agile-Guide-MU-01.png || Download Guide || https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/CoSchedule-Agile-Marketing-Guide.pdf\"] \n<h2>Table of Contents</h2> \n<ol> \n <li><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/?p=67304#content-marketing\">Content Marketing</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/?p=67304#seo\">SEO</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/?p=67304#programming\">Programming</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/?p=67304#analytics\">Analytics</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/?p=67304#social-media\">Social Media</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/?p=67304#ppc\">PPC</a></li> \n</ol> \n<h2>Why Training is Important for Marketing Teams</h2> There is arguably no department at an organization that should prioritize training more than the marketing department. Hear me out on this one… Can you think of anything within an organization that moves faster than marketing? Marketers are beholden to changing social media rules, search engine algorithm updates, email privacy regulations… The list goes on. Marketers need consistent training to stay in-the-know. \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-84928 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/training-regularly.png\" alt=\"Reasons why marketers should attend training regularly.\" width=\"1361\" height=\"560\" /> Marketers are also often expected to wear multiple hats. How many times have you had to create a quick graphic for social media when you’re not even a graphic designer? \n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">OR… </span> How many times have you had to jump into Google Analytics to check the health of your content marketing efforts, despite your limited analytics knowledge? Quite a few times, I bet. These are great examples of why marketers can, and should, take a course or two to brush up on skills outside of their expertise. \n<h2>Organizational Benefits of Training and Development</h2> Increasing employee motivation and decreasing turnover is something every company strives for. Turns out, a simple way to do this is to offer your employees a great training and development program. Here are all the statistics about the organizational benefits of training and development: \n<ul> \n <li>Companies have a&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http://businesstrainingexperts.com/knowledge-center/training-roi/profiting-from-learning/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">218%</a></span>&nbsp;higher income per employee than those without formalized training.</li> \n <li>There’s a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http://businesstrainingexperts.com/knowledge-center/training-roi/profiting-from-learning/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">24%</a></span>&nbsp;higher profit margin for companies that prioritize training than those who don’t.</li> \n <li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://www.shiftelearning.com/blog/statistics-value-of-employee-training-and-development\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">40%</a></span>&nbsp;of employees who don’t receive training will leave their positions within the first year.</li> \n <li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://www.shiftelearning.com/blog/statistics-value-of-employee-training-and-development\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">87%</a></span>&nbsp;of Millennials say that professional development is significant to them.</li> \n <li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://www.shiftelearning.com/blog/statistics-on-corporate-training-and-what-they-mean-for-your-companys-future\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">70%</a></span>&nbsp;of individuals say training and development opportunities influence their decision to stay at a company.</li> \n</ul> [Tweet \"87% of Millennials say professional development is a significant motivator at work.\"] \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-84929 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/benefits-of-training.png\" alt=\"Organizational benefits of training and development stats.\" width=\"1361\" height=\"2641\" /> \n<h2>Training Opportunities for Your Marketing Team</h2> Here’s what we know… Providing staff training is important for both the profitability of the organization and employee happiness, but maybe you don’t know where to start.

It’d be easy to make the mistake that 80% of a marketing manager’s role is focused on marketing and 20% on management. However, most marketing managers find the opposite is true. \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-84208 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/expectations-vs-reality.png\" alt=\"Expectations vs. reality of marketing managers.\" width=\"1361\" height=\"912\" /> Your team is focused on marketing, but you’re the one fitting all the puzzle pieces together, managing timelines, and shuffling workloads. Not to mention, most of your campaigns require the skills of a certified project manager. If your marketing degree is anything like mine, there wasn’t a single aspect that focused on project management. You’ve probably had to cobble something together that looks vaguely like project management while trying to keep your cool — even when it feels like you’re missing things, and balls are getting dropped. You’re a proverbial duck. Calm on the surface, but paddling like hell underneath to stay afloat. That ends today. Here are two different project management models you can start implementing right now. \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/?p=66017#toc\">Back to the Top</a></strong>\n</div> \n<a name=\"agile\"></a> \n<h2>The Agile Methodology</h2> \n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/agile-project-management-scrum-6269\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Agile Project Management</a></span>&nbsp;was initially formulated for software development projects, but more and more marketing teams are finding it useful for managing their own projects. The key to managing an \n<a href=\"https://coschedule.com/agile-marketing-guide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Agile project</a> is that large marketing campaigns are broken into smaller, more manageable sections. These sections are called \"iterations\" or \"sprints\". Sprints are generally short, running over a few days or weeks. For instance, if you have a marketing campaign that will run the entire duration of Q1, this campaign will be broken down into small iterations. \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-84209 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/agile-methodology.png\" alt=\"Visual of agile marketing.\" width=\"1361\" height=\"997\" /> \n<h3>Here’s an Example of How to Run a Marketing Project Adhering to Agile Principles:</h3> Your lawn care company is running an early bird promo through the winter to increase business during a slow time. You’ll run the campaign through Q1. The campaign will consist of email marketing, direct mail, tv commercials, radio spots, and social media advertising. \n<h3>Step 1: Set the Vision</h3> To start, the project or marketing manager manager will create a project brief to outline the details of the campaign. \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/creative-brief-template/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Best Way to Write a Creative Brief (Plus Free Templates)</a></span>\n</div> \n<h3>Step 2: Sprint Planning</h3> The team will come together to start \n<a href=\"https://coschedule.com/agile-marketing-guide/sprint-planning/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">spring planning</a>. For our example project, the team would consist of an email marketer, graphic designer, social media advertiser, and perhaps an agency that would be responsible for the TV and radio spots. During this step, team members will be asked about how long each element will take to complete — working backward from the campaign completion date. These timings and individual elements will make up the sprint backlog. \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/agile-sprint-planning-for-marketers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How To Use Agile Sprint Planning To Implement Efficient Marketing Processes</a></span>\n</div> \n<h3>Step 3: Daily Scrums</h3> Production of the campaign begins, and the manager hosts daily standup meetings to track progress and roadblocks. CoSchedule’s team management dashboard is made to facilitate \n<a href=\"https://coschedule.com/agile-marketing-guide/agile-scrum-framework-methodology/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">daily scrums</a>.

[Tweet \"CoSchedule’s team management dashboard is made to facilitate daily scrums. You’ll see complete visibility into your team’s daily activities.\"] Shifting priorities? No problem. You can easily use the dashboard to reshuffle workloads. Simply drag and drop the task to reassign it. The individual will see the new task pop-up on their daily to-do list. Now, your whole team can turn to CoSchedule first thing in the morning to see what needs to be accomplished for the day.

This feedback is then used to improve future projects. \n<h3>What are the Benefits of Choosing Agile?</h3> Now that you know what Agile looks like, here are a few benefits to determine if this project management style is right for your \n<a href=\"https://coschedule.com/agile-marketing-guide/cross-functional-marketing-teams/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">team</a>. \n<ol> \n <li>Parts of the campaign can be developed at the same time.

No phase begins until the prior phase is complete, and the completion of each phase is final — meaning the Waterfall approach does not allow you to return to a previous phase. Think of it like a real waterfall — the water can’t flow upward. The only way to revisit a phase is to start over at phase one. \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-84210 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/waterfall-methodology.png\" alt=\"Visual of the waterfall methodology.\" width=\"1361\" height=\"608\" /> \n<h3>Here’s an Example of How to Run a Marketing Project Adhering to Waterfall Principles:</h3> Let’s go back to our lawn care marketing example. The campaign will still consist of email marketing, direct mail, tv commercials, radio spots, and social media advertising, but before anything can begin, graphics must be designed. The copy must then be written for the direct mail flyers, which will serve as the creative direction for all the other items. \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/marketing-project-management-skills/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">8 Marketing Project Management Skills You Need to Lead a Successful Team</a>\n</div> Only after that can the emails be strategized; each item must be completed in a specific order. Should there be changes to the creative direction, you have to return to the graphics phase and start again. \n<h3>What Are the Benefits of Choosing Waterfall?</h3> Why would you want to choose the Waterfall technique? Here’s a short list of some benefits: \n<ol> \n <li>It is simple and straightforward.</li> \n <li>Everything has a start and end, so budgets are easy to follow.</li> \n <li>Team members are less involved and can work on other things until their phase begins.</li> \n</ol> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/?p=66017#toc\">Back to the Top</a></strong>\n</div> \n<a name=\"compare\"></a> \n<h2>Waterfall vs Agile Methodologies</h2> If you’re still confused about whether you should adhere to Waterfall or Agile, here is a guide to help. \n<h3>Choosing Between Agile and Waterfall</h3> \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-84211 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/agile-vs-waterfall.png\" alt=\"Comparison between agile and waterfall marketing.\" width=\"1360\" height=\"1291\" /> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/?p=66017#toc\">Back to the Top</a></strong>\n</div> \n<a name=\"kanban\"></a> \n<h2>Kanban Project View in CoSchedule</h2> Most marketing managers deal with projects that involve&nbsp;both strategy and execution. Marketers often spend so much time thinking about the strategy, that when it comes to execution, it's easy to resort to a \"just get it done\" mentality. The execution always feels a lot messier and more opaque than it should. You don't know what phase projects are in, nor how close they are to completion... until now. \n<h3>See All Your Project Statuses in One Place With CoSchedule's Kanban View</h3> To get started with the Kanban view, navigate over to the left-hand menu on your CoSchedule calendar.

Who would have thought that you would need to book a meeting with yourself just to get your work done? \n<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/f3bf9489-545c-4fbb-a62f-0b182f8a9c55_calendar.gif\" alt=\"Gif of calendar.\" width=\"325\" height=\"244\" /> This is the life of a marketing manager, so&nbsp;blocking off time in your calendar means you can devote a few hours a week to focus on nothing else but the task at hand. Whether that’s a slide deck for your CMO, next year’s budget planning, or breaking down last quarter’s results. One tip about this strategy: be transparent with your team. Tell them what you're working on and that you’ll be unavailable for parts of the day. If they know you’re knocking something out, they’ll be more likely to respect your time. \n<h3>Quit Chasing Down Status Updates</h3> No one tells you when you become a marketing manager how challenging it is to get all members of your team on the same page. [Tweet \"No one tells you when you become a marketing manager how challenging it is to get all members of your team on the same page.\"] Not to mention getting people from other marketing departments on the same page. Forget it; that’s an impossible task… or&nbsp;is it? Using a suite of agile marketing software products, like CoSchedule, gives you better visibility into your \"entire\" strategy execution. Every sub-department (like social media, product marketing, demand gen, content marketing, PR, email marketing, etc.) knows what campaigns each other are working on, so you never duplicate work or waste time again. \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/marketing-asset-management/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Marketing Asset Management: How to Find Everything You Need (Quickly)</a>\n</div> Imagine how much time you would save if you could simply glance at the calendar and know what’s going on daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly. Here’s an example calendar to get a feeling for what ultimate marketing strategy visibility can look like. \n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-66119\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/Artboard-16.jpg\" alt=\"Example of the ultimate marketing strategy visibility.\" width=\"1360\" height=\"669\" /> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/?p=66017#toc\">Back to the Top</a></strong>\n</div> \n<a name=\"three\"></a> \n<h2>Lesson 3: You Don’t Have to Measure Everything</h2> The world of analytics can be overwhelming. There are hundreds of things you are or could be measuring. It’s hard to tell vanity metrics apart from the things that drive \"real\" business value — activity ≠ results. Just because you’re shipping marketing campaigns doesn’t mean you’re driving business results. [Tweet “Marketers often mistake activity with results. Here’s how to fix it.”] Here’s how to fix it. \n<h3>Find Your One Metric That Matters (1MTM)</h3> The 1MTM framework comes down to relentlessly focusing on growing the metric most closely related to growth. It’s your north star, but how do you know \n<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">what</span>&nbsp;\n<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">that</span>&nbsp;\n<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">is</span>? Well, what is your company’s ultimate goal? Let’s say it’s leads… because more leads result in more sales. If you set your sights on 500 leads/month, you have to reverse engineer how to do this and find your 1MTM. What results in more leads? Website traffic. If you only have 2,500 visitors each month, that’s a 20% conversion rate. Probably a little high for most teams to achieve, but you could probably convert 5%, right? That said, you’ll need 10,000 visitors/month to get the 500 leads you’re after, so your 1MTM is website visitors. Your goal is to increase your traffic from 2,500 users to 10,000. Everything your team does should be focused on increasing website visitors. \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-84212 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/leads-goals.png\" alt=\"Table of goals to increase leads.\" width=\"1360\" height=\"723\" /> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/?p=66017#toc\">Back to the Top</a></strong>\n</div> \n<a name=\"four\"></a> \n<h2>Lesson 4: Marketing Plans Are a Big Lie</h2> There, I said it. Marketing plans are the worst. They take forever to create, they don’t help you achieve real results, and they promote blind execution. They offer the illusion of due diligence while never contributing much in the way of creativity. If the project were to go pear-shaped, the marketing plan offers binders upon binders of materials to prove you did your homework (i.e. materials to cover your own butt). This means we spend a lot of our time as marketing managers pursuing non-failure rather than results. [Tweet “Is your marketing plan focused on pursuing results or just avoiding failure?”] \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-84213 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/moon-quote.png\" alt=\"Quote from Garrett Moon about the unspoken goal of failure.\" width=\"1360\" height=\"646\" /> That plan spells out how often you’re going to blog, publish to social media, and push ad campaigns. It proves all the activities you’re going to do, but&nbsp;activity doesn’t equal results. Marketers are too caught up in bureaucracy. Writing it down feels safe, but the problem with feeling safe is it becomes the goal. The marketing plan in and of itself is the goal, not the \"actual\" results. \n<h3>The Formula to Replace Your Marketing Plan</h3> All you need to start are the three constraints: \n<ol> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">One Metric that Matters</span><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">:</span> The first constraint is laser-beam focus on the one metric that will accelerate your business, like website visitors in the example above.</li> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Goal</span><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">:</span> The second constraint is specificity. Be dead-set on the driver that influenced your 1MTM, like obtaining 500 leads/month in our earlier example.</li> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Timeline</span><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">:</span> The third constraint is speed. Define a clear timeline for when the goal becomes reality. It should give you butterflies (i.e. it’s much shorter than what sounds safe or comfortable).</li> \n</ol> There you have it. The three constraints of your new documented marketing strategy. The tactics remain fluid, so you can #failfast. A combination of both terrifying and refreshing with a dash of agile thinking to top it off. \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/?p=66017#toc\">Back to the Top</a></strong>\n</div> \n<a name=\"five\"></a> \n<h2>Lesson 5: Embrace Failure</h2> Failure isn’t necessarily a bad thing. What’s the best part about failure? It teaches you a valuable lesson about what works and what doesn’t. [Tweet \"What’s the best part about failure? It teaches you a valuable lesson about what works and what doesn’t.\"] Failure means that you’re pushing yourself, taking risks, trying new things, and it gives you the opportunity to improve and try again. Colleges don’t teach you about failure. You’re meant \n<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">not</span>&nbsp;to fail. In the real world, failure is inevitable. That Facebook live video series you thought would push \n<em>x</em> number of visitors to your site flopped, or maybe that holiday sale campaign didn’t bring in as many customers as you wanted. That. Is. Okay. You’ve tried something new, learned it didn’t work, and you can adjust for next time. \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-84214 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/embrace-failure.png\" alt=\"The cycle of embracing failure.\" width=\"1360\" height=\"1064\" /> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/?p=66017#toc\">Back to the Top</a></strong>\n</div> \n<a name=\"six\"></a> \n<h2>Lesson 6: There’s No “Correct” Answer</h2> In a lot of industries, there’s a “correct” answer. In medicine, if you have a broken arm, the correct answer is to set the bone and cast it. In school, there’s a correct answer. That scan-tron form expects you&nbsp;to fill out the “correct” bubble to get the answer right. In IRL marketing, however, there’s more than one way to skin a cat. For example, a colleague and I were just discussing whether or not to release a podcast over the holiday break. At first blush, you may think, “Don’t do it; people are with their families and won’t be listening to podcasts,” but some people might be traveling — the perfect time to tune into a podcast. They might even be taking advantage of some extra time off by heading to the gym (also, not a bad time to listen to a podcast). You see, in marketing, there are plenty of creative and useful answers. You might just find that holiday episode of your podcast crushed it, or you might find that it tanked. Either way, you’ll know for next year. \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-84215 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/godin-quote.png\" alt=\"Quote from Seth Godin about right and wrong answers.\" width=\"1360\" height=\"646\" /> If you hold out waiting for the “correct” answer, you’ll become paralyzed and will never move forward. Stop waiting for the correct answer to show itself; it likely doesn’t exist. \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/?p=66017#toc\">Back to the Top</a></strong>\n</div> \n<a name=\"conclusion\"></a> \n<h2>You're All Set</h2> Now that you have your templates, ebook, and other tactics on how to tidy up the mess marketing management can make, it's time to take action.

They help establish your brand as a topical authority, demonstrate how your product solved a real problem for a customer, and help leads see how they could experience similar success with your services. What makes this such an effective content format? Consider the following points: \n<ul> \n <li><strong>They directly position your product as the best solution</strong>. There's a lot of debate around whether or not content should directly sell products. In this case, the answer is \"yes\".</li> \n <li><strong>Your claims are backed up by real results</strong>. Who can argue with data from a real-life scenario?</li> \n <li><strong>Not everyone is creating them</strong>. While blog posts are a dime a dozen, an effective customer story is much harder to duplicate.</li> \n</ul> However, they take time and effort to put together.

an \n<a href=\"https://coschedule.com/customer-stories/laerdal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">example of a case study CoSchedule created for Laerdal</a>, a customer whose industry focuses on the creation of medical equipment and helping save lives.

However, by streamlining your workflow from start to finish, you can ensure no steps get missed.&nbsp;Here are the seven steps this post will cover to get the job done. \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-85697 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/case-study-steps.png\" alt=\"Seven steps to writing a strong case study\" width=\"1361\" height=\"1485\" /> [Tweet \"Writing a #marketing case study?

It could be your organization, a client or a customer. Here are three criteria to consider: \n<ul> \n <li>How much does the customer use your product or service?</li> \n <li>Have they experienced dramatic positive results that would make a good story?</li> \n <li>Did they switch to your product from a competitor?</li> \n</ul> To find this information, consider: \n<ul> \n <li>Talking to your sales team to see if there are any prospects who may be willing to participate.</li> \n <li>Asking your customer support department if they have any exceptional customers.</li> \n <li>Review recent new customers to see if any prospective candidates have bought from you.</li> \n</ul> [Tweet \"Writing a marketing case study? Do this first.\"] \n<div class=\"callout\">\n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/?p=60603#top\">Back to the Top</a>\n</div> \n<a name=\"step-2\"></a> \n<h2>Step Two: Ask for Permission to Use Their Story in Your Case Study</h2> It’s one thing if you’re writing about your organization, it’s another if you’re writing about customers or clients. Don’t just pull information about them and throw it into a case study. Ask them before you start. \n<h3>Create a Permission Letter</h3> If you are creating multiple case studies, design a pre-written permission letter. It will help move your writing process along. Your letter should include: \n<ul> \n <li>What the case study undertaking is going to look like.</li> \n <li>What they get out of the case study.</li> \n</ul> Here's a copy-and-paste template you can tailor to your needs: \n<blockquote>\n Hi [Name of person], Our team is conducting a case study, and we would love to tell the story of [company]. Would you be interested in working with us to create a case study around the use of our product? Here's a description of our process and what we would need from you. What we’d like from you: \n <ul> \n  <li>High-resolution company logo (as big as possible).</li> \n  <li>High-resolution images of your team, company office, etc — stories with photos of your team will drive more traffic; people like seeing that there are humans behind a story.</li> \n  <li>Stats: before/after [Company].</li> \n </ul> What does the process look like? \n <ul> \n  <li>One [phone/video call/coffee] interview with [person].</li> \n  <li>Our team will then take your interview, and build a story out of it.</li> \n </ul> \n <ul> \n  <li>Two to three email conversations may be necessary to gather extra information.</li> \n </ul> \n <ul> \n  <li>Once final draft is complete, we’ll send it over to your team for review.</li> \n  <li>We’ll then finalize the story, create a landing page, and build a campaign around it.</li> \n  <li>Once live, we’ll share the final story with you, for your marketing efforts.</li> \n </ul> Average Turnaround Time: one month — subject to change based on response times and edits. What’s in it for you? \n <ul> \n  <li>Perk One</li> \n  <li>Perk Two</li> \n  <li>Perk Three</li> \n  <li>Perk Four</li> \n  <li>Perk Five</li> \n </ul> Best regards, [SIGNATURE]\n</blockquote> \n<h3>Consider Using&nbsp;a Legal Release Form</h3> Another potential step in the process is asking your case study subjects to sign a legal release form so you can use their information. You do not have to take this step in your case study creation process. If you do decide to have your subjects sign a form, consult with your legal team first. \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Listening:</strong> \n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/how-to-craft-customer-case-studies-that-convince-and-convert-with-whitney-deterding-from-coschedule-amp-104/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How to Craft Customer Case Studies That Convince And Convert With Whitney Deterding From CoSchedule [AMP 104]</a>\n</div> \n<div class=\"callout\">\n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/?p=60603#top\">Back to the Top</a>\n</div> \n<a name=\"step-3\"></a> \n<h2>Step Three: Send Them an Introductory Questionnaire<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">&nbsp;</span></h2> Once your client or customer has agreed to participate, you should begin to format your introductory questionnaire. This questionnaire will help you get the information you need to shape the story of your case study. Some potential questions to include could be: \n<ul> \n <li>What problem did you experience before using our product/service?</li> \n <li>Why did you select our product/service instead of a competitor?</li> \n <li>How did our product/service solve a problem you were experiencing?</li> \n <li>What are your goals as a business or organization?</li> \n <li>Are you comfortable sharing data and metrics demonstrating your success?</li> \n</ul> You can adjust your questions based on how your customer uses your product to get specific answers or quotes that can be highlighted in your study. \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/content-writing-tips/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">40 Content Writing Tips to Make You a Better Marketer Now</a>\n</div> \n<div class=\"callout\">\n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/?p=60603#top\">Back to the Top</a>\n</div> \n<a name=\"step-4\"></a> \n<h2>Step Four: Format Your Case Study Interview Questions</h2> Once your client or customer has completed your initial questionnaire, it’s time to draft your interview questions. Asking quality interview questions is critical to ensure that you get the information you need to write a full case study. Remember your clients or customers are busy,&nbsp;so&nbsp;you don’t want to have to ask for more details multiple times. Based on the responses that you&nbsp;received from your initial questionnaire, you can adjust questions to get any additional information you need. Here are 25 case study questions to add to your interview. \n<h3>Getting to Know Your Subject</h3> These questions should be similar to the ones you sent in your questionnaire. These should help you gather any information you may have missed. Potential examples are: \n<ol> \n <li>What industry is your company in?</li> \n <li>How long have you been using our product or service?</li> \n <li>What is your work process like?</li> \n <li>How many members are on your team?</li> \n <li>What goals do you set for your team?</li> \n</ol> [Tweet \"Here are five questions to ask when getting a know a new client for a case study project.\"] \n<h3>What Problems Were They Experiencing?</h3> Your case study participants were obviously experiencing some problem before they turned to your organization for a solution. Give the readers of your case study even more context by getting as much information about their problem as possible. Some possible questions to include in your interview are: \n<ol> \n <li>When did your team first realize there was a problem?</li> \n <li>What solutions did you try before you came to us?</li> \n <li>Did your problem happen suddenly or did it occur over time?</li> \n <li>How did the team come to the decision that outside assistance was required?</li> \n <li>What factors led to the problem developing?</li> \n</ol> [Tweet \"Writing a case study? Here are five questions to ask when identifying your subject's core problems.\" \n<h3>What Helped Them Make Their Decision?</h3> Finding out what helped your client or customer decide to work with your company is not only informative for potential new business, but it can help your organization determine what materials to publish. Try these questions out during your interview: \n<ol> \n <li>What materials did you read or watch that influenced your decision?</li> \n <li>What criteria did you have when you were looking for a solution?</li> \n <li>What competitors did you look at (if any)?</li> \n <li>How did you convince your team to make a change?</li> \n <li>What sealed the deal for you when you choose to work with our organization?</li> \n</ol> [Tweet \"Why do your customers choose you, anyway? Get the answer by asking these five case study interview questions.\"] \n<h3>How Does Your Solution Help?</h3> Talk to your customer or client and find out how your solution is helped them fix the problem that they were previously experiencing. Add these questions to your interview list: \n<ol> \n <li>What [product/service] helped solve your problem?</li> \n <li>What did our product or service replace in your current work process?</li> \n <li>What tasks did our [product/service] simplify for you?</li> \n <li>How much time do you save?</li> \n <li>What tasks did our [product/service] eliminate?</li> \n</ol> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/sales-case-study/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Best Way to Write Sales Case Studies That Get Leads</a>\n</div> \n<h3>How Did They Implement Your Product?</h3> Another relevant question to ask during your interview process is how your subject implemented your solution into their work process. This could help eliminate nerves from other potential new customers. Here are some questions to ask during your interview: \n<ol> \n <li>How easily did your team adapt our product into their routine?</li> \n <li>How was your onboarding process?</li> \n <li>What process did you use to switch over to using our product?</li> \n <li>What difficulties did you face in the transition process?</li> \n <li>What advice do you have for anyone implementing our product into their work process?</li> \n</ol> [Tweet \"How are your customers using your product? Find out with these five questions.\"] \n<h3>What Results Did They See?</h3> Results speak volumes so why not let your customer or client data do the talking for you?

Now comes the fun part; putting it all together into the case study template you downloaded earlier. \n<h3>Writing&nbsp;Your Title</h3> The first part of any good case study is a catchy title. Your title should include the name of your client or customer as well as their logo. Your subhead should also be short and include information on what product or service they used that helped them solve their problem. \n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">In your template, add your title and your subject's logo.</span> \n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-61545\" src=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/case-study-title.png\" alt=\"Example case study title in template.\" width=\"1360\" height=\"313\" /> What does a quality title look like? Well, it doesn't have to be complicated. It should: \n<ul> \n <li>State who it's about.</li> \n <li>Explain what was done.</li> \n <li>Communicate a clear result.</li> \n</ul> Take a look at this example from bit.ly: \n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-61546\" src=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/bitly-headline.png\" alt=\"Example headline from a bit.ly case study\" width=\"1360\" height=\"844\" /> This title works because of it explains: \n<ul> \n <li>The problem the company faced.</li> \n <li>What type of company is involved in the case study?</li> \n <li>How bit.ly helped them tackle the challenge.</li> \n</ul> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Do This With CoSchedule:</strong> Did you know that CoSchedule’s Headline Analyzer&nbsp;can help you write better headlines? \n <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/headline-analyzer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Try it now</a></span>.\n</div> \n<h3>Executive Summary</h3> Your executive summary should be a two to three sentence paragraph that describes the story of your client/customer. You can also include a statistic or two to help illustrate the success of your case study subject. Here's what this section looks like in your template. \n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-61121\" src=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/blog_case-study-V2-12.png\" alt=\"What makes up an executive summary\" width=\"1360\" height=\"429\" /> Check out this executive summary example about Patagonia. \n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-61113\" src=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/blog_case-study-V2-16.png\" alt=\"Patagonia executive summary example\" width=\"1360\" height=\"523\" /> This works because... \n<ul> \n <li>The company's mission is clearly explained.</li> \n <li>It highlights the problem the company was experiencing.</li> \n <li>In the last sentence, the reader is told how the company solved that problem.</li> \n</ul> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/how-to-write-white-papers-templates-examples/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How to Write White Papers People Actually Want to Read (Template)</a>\n</div> \n<h3>Who is the Case Study About?</h3> The next part of your case study should explain who your case study is about. This is where the information that you gathered from your initial questionnaire would go. Here's what this section looks like in your template. \n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-61109\" src=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/blog_case-study-V2-09.png\" alt=\"Who is your case study about?\" width=\"1360\" height=\"455\" /> To see what this section could look like, here is an example from Adobe and LinkedIn. \n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-61114\" src=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/blog_case-study-V2-17.png\" alt=\"Adobe example of the &quot;who&quot; in a case study\" width=\"1360\" height=\"548\" /> This works because... \n<ul> \n <li>Adobe's purpose is clearly established.</li> \n <li>The reader is told exactly how Adobe used a LinkedIn service to solve a problem.</li> \n <li>It illustrates clear benefits of using LinkedIn's Sponsored Content.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Problems They’ve Faced</h3> In this part of the study, write about the top two to three issues that your case study participant was experiencing. You should summarize what challenges they faced, as well as their previous \n<a href=\"https://coschedule.com/marketing-strategy/marketing-goals/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">goals</a>. \n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-61122\" src=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/blog_case-study-V2-13.png\" alt=\"The challenges listed in the case study\" width=\"1360\" height=\"576\" /> Cirque de Soleil’s case study is a great example of address problems a company faces in a case study. \n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-61115\" src=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/blog_case-study-V2-18.png\" alt=\"Challenges in translation case study\" width=\"1360\" height=\"518\" /> This works because... \n<ol> \n <li>The study cuts right to the heart of the problem.</li> \n <li>It mentions the specific part of the company that helped Cirque.</li> \n <li>There's no fluff. This copy gets to the point.</li> \n</ol> \n<h3>How Did You Help?</h3> This section of your case study is going to show off the solutions that your customers and clients use. It should highlight the changes that you’ve brought to their team. \n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-61110\" src=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/blog_case-study-V2-10.png\" alt=\"How did you help solve the problem?\" width=\"1360\" height=\"592\" /> Callaway Golf is another great example of a case study that explains how its researcher helped solve their problem. \n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-61116\" src=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/blog_case-study-V2-19.png\" alt=\"Callaway Golf solution example\" width=\"1360\" height=\"821\" /> This works because... \n<ul> \n <li>It shows people how LinkedIn has access to Callaway’s target demographic.</li> \n <li>The case study also explains how they created an app to help solve Callaway’s problem.</li> \n <li>While data can be challenging to understand, this example clearly explains relevant insights into Callaway’s target audience.</li> \n</ul> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/how-to-create-website-content/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How to Create Website Content That Converts Leads Into Customers</a>\n</div> \n<h3>Progress and Results</h3> The final section of your case study should feature the progress that has been made since your customer or client began to use your services. This could be shown through progress towards their goals, changes in metrics they track, and more. Here's what this section looks like in your template. \n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-61120\" src=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/blog_case-study-V2-11.png\" alt=\"What makes up the results section?\" width=\"1360\" height=\"579\" /> Take a look at the results section of a case study from Contently on Weebly. \n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-61117\" src=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/blog_case-study-V2-20.png\" alt=\"Results section to the Weebly case study\" width=\"1360\" height=\"623\" /> This works because... \n<ul> \n <li>The results are one of the most visuals aspects of the case study.</li> \n <li>They are easy to skim.</li> \n <li>You can easily tell what type of growth or improvement they experienced.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Using Visuals in Your Case Study</h3> Visuals can help add the extra oomph you need to make a great case study.

What matters most is finding the best technology solutions to solve the right problems at the right times for you, your team, and your organization. Today’s guest is Sean Doyle, co-founder, principal, and director of strategy at FitzMartin. Sean applies the science of behavior change to the art of sales and marketing.

Welcome to the show. Sean: All right, Ben. Been looking forward to this. Ben: Yeah, it's great to have you on. Would you mind taking a moment to introduce yourself to our audience and explain what you and your team are working on at FitzMartin? Sean: Absolutely. I'm Sean Doyle or Sean M. Doyle—if you want to buy that shameless book promotion plug. I am proud that we recently republished. I was published by RockBench out of Nashville. Authoring is really only a way to introduce myself. I wrote a book because I’m so frustrated with the way most marketers are respected or not respected in this B2B marketing space, and I want to change that. My vision for the rest of my career—I'm an old guy, 55—is I want to help marketers be respected, make an impact in their roles, whatever those roles are. Whether they're middle management, CMO, but they've got to have a seed at the board table. How did I get to the point where I felt like I could help those people? That's a good question, too. Thanks for asking, Ben. FitzMartin is the company I've worked at just under 30 years. We would call ourselves—sales first. We're scientifically inspired, and we have two things that we do. We have a marketing consultancy, and we have advisory services that help with strategic work and thinking. We work, typically, also with operations. That could either be revenue operations or what you think about traditionally with creative operations. If you're going to work with us on revenue operations or creative operations, then you need to come through the advisory strategic thinking. We've been really successful with science, actually. If I were going to give one tip to any marketer, I would tell you if you were in college or talking to you today in this podcast, I'd say, have a point of view. And our point of view comes from science—behavioral science. The behavioral science of how people change. Modern marketing and sales—to demonstrate its ability and really harness the full capabilities of a business to provide products or services it needs to have a point of view, it needs to understand how behavior changes. I'm getting excited. If I get going on this, you're never going to stop me. Ben: That's great. The great thing about podcasts is we're not limited by page links or word count or really anything. There are no physical limitations here beyond the patience of our listeners. I'm sure you've got good stuff to share so that won’t be an issue. Sean: I’m a speaker on a vestige in Convene CEO circuits. I can do a three-hour talk on the science of behavioral change if you want that. Ben: Actually, in that case, I do have some other meetings today. Sean: Okay, okay. Ben: Maybe some other time. Some other time. Let's table that for now. Something we're going to spend a lot of time talking about over the course of this conversation is marketers and technology. The technology they use to manage their teams, to do their work. I think if most marketers actually counted up how many tools they use and actually illustrated what their martech stack looks like, all would be surprised just how many different things we use to make our jobs possible. Now we're in an era where marketing teams have more software tools at their disposal than ever before. There are always new players entering the market and new things for us to use. What do you believe personally? What do you believe contributes to that? What is the marketing SaaS space just continuing to accelerate? And why is it seeming to not hit this point of market saturation? Sean: That's a great question. Most of our work—as a company—professionally has been in two spaces. One is the industrial manufacturing space. We have clients in oil and gas. We have clients in occupational health—just interesting little niches in that B2B space. Then, we have a lot of financial services clients. I share that to say that the financial services clients really led my journey in understanding marketing technology. It does tie back into the cognitive marketing—that science that I'm referring to. Back in 2002, I experienced a personal crisis—a healthcare crisis. When you go through those times, you just get rude around, question everything, and think through everything. At that time, I was given this book to read called Changing for Good. Changing for Good is the popular title of the transtheoretical theory of behavioral science. What that did is gave me a framework to understand how it was we were successful in the past with some clients, and why sometimes we weren't successful, which if your agency helps doesn't ever admit they weren't successful, they're either lying. Please don't trust them because everybody fails, right? But I didn't know why, and that concerned me. In this pivot of life when I was really rethinking things—by the way that was 14 years ago or 16 years ago—it was a long time ago. I’m healthy, doing great. It gave us a framework to work inside of. What’s that have to do with marketing tech? Working at the bank at a large Southeast sunbelt regional bank, they had the capital and the commitment to measurement. They wanted measurement—bankers, right? They want measurement. They want to know what they're spending and what they get back. We applied the cognitive marketing model to a business problem they had. They gave us 1500 names. They said two agencies have tried to solve this sales problem before and couldn't close enough deals. At that time, they were 60% of my company's revenue. After I learned two other agencies had failed and had been fired, they asked if we would like to try. I was like, yes, we're going to try this. We mapped out what sales were doing in the process of behavioral change and what marketing was doing. We had this aha moment. We moved the investment of money further back in the sales cycle. Agencies tend to spend their money early getting more awareness. Awareness wasn't the problem. These 1500 prospects knew the bank. The bank knew these 1500 prospects. Everybody knew each other. We moved and pushed those tools, those resources, farther back in the sales process. They were able to report. Because of marketing technology, they closed $380 million in a period of six weeks. That was astonishing. They did that program with us for the next 13 years with two exceptions. One, there was a hot agency in Texas they had to try. We got the job after they failed. Two, there was a local guy on the board who owned an agency, and he said, \"I should be doing this work.\" Then, we got the job back after him too. We don't have the better creative or the best creative in the world. We don't have the best people. The thing that makes us good that anybody can have is a point of view and a framework that's based on science. Marketing technology is the thing that lets you know it works. I don't allow my staff, my team—we can never say I think, which sounds crazy, right? You've got to give people a reason why. \n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-85395\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/197_Sean-Podcast-Graphics_quote-01.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1361\" height=\"630\" /> Instead of going to that bank and saying, I think this will work. We went to the bank and said, we used this framework of behavioral change. We see these processes that science teaches us will work, and you're not leveraging these three. We want you to spend less money here and more money there and leverage these later stage sales tools. Would you like to try that? That’s so much better than I think this will work. So have that point of view. Marketing technology—my belief, my point about martech is why is it expanding? Because it's giving us a look into things that we never were able to effectively measure before. Closed-loop reporting is still not easy, but it’s a lot more able to. We spend a lot of time—the lower middle market, emerging middle-market space—and we do a lot of work helping those people do closed-loop reporting for the first time. It's still pretty complicated. There are more ERP systems that allow those lower middle market systems to give that closed loop reporting. But until you have that, then most marketing teams are saying, I like something or I think something. And the executive table doesn't have any reason to trust that. One of my favorite clients has a CFO in the oil and gas space. He used to be a Fortune 500 CFO. You can imagine the level of sophistication that Doug has. Doug doesn't put up with I think or I like. He knows what happened, and he can connect those dots. He likes us because we've equipped him to prove that investment marketing work. That's it. That's a high-level view. Right now, worldwide spending on marketing is $120 billion. That's amazing. Ben: I believe that sounds right. It's an enormous number. Sean: Ben, you look at the martech 8000, 7000, 6000, right? Everybody does. Ben: Yeah. There are various different lists, awards, and things of that nature out there. Sean: But you could assume maybe 8000 choices exist in the marketing technology space? Ben: Yeah. I guess depending on how far you stretch that definition of martech. It's probably five digits. Sean: That's probably fair. The question with marketing tech is not if you should but it's how, what you should be doing. Your organization has some amazing (I would call it) martech ability to look into, see, track, measure, and make it easier for a customer to buy. That's ultimately what marketing technology does. Why is it exploding? (1) Because it's measurable, and (2) it's customer-focused. In the past, in the business-to-business space—and still today—manufacturers, people who do stuff, and even banks or professional services firms, they tend to talk about themselves. Their focus is on what they do. Marketing technology is not focused on those businesses. Marketing technology's focus is on making the buyer's journey easier or simpler. \n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-85396\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/197_Sean-Podcast-Graphics_quote-02.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1361\" height=\"630\" /> Ben: Sure. There's a few really interesting points in there that we can spend a little bit of time unpacking. It sounds like the crux for why martech is expanding, it sounds like a lot of it (in your mind) focuses around the idea that markets really like to make decisions and argue from emotion—I think, I like, or I have some intuitive sense that something will maybe work. But what a lot of martech does at its core—depending on the product category, the specific tool, generally speaking at a high level—it gives us data about people that is irrefutable. Obviously, you can use that data to tell different stories. There's a component of analysis that's involved, but the numbers don't lie. It sounds like you're marrying that with this behavioral science. If you understand your numbers and you understand just how people, how human brains operate, you can go into a meeting with a potential client and have a lot more confidence about what you would propose they do than someone coming into that conversation being like the old mad man kind of thing. You’d see Don Draper walk into the meeting of the client and give this pitch that was all bluster and 10% whiskey. Sean: Maybe more whiskey. Ben: That's a conservative estimate. I personally never really thought about it that way. I think that's super interesting. Sean: Yeah. I can give you some stories that'll support that comment, that thinking. You said so many things. One, you said numbers don't lie. I immediately thought about my accountant telling the joke of what's one plus one… I’m not going to tell the joke. Numbers can say what can be made to say what they want. You're right. Marketing data evidence is powerful. We deal with a lot of vanity metrics in marketing. Even if what you're showing is vanity metrics—I'm not recommending that, by the way. I want you to be authentic, real, and meaningful. Even if all you’re showing is vanity metrics, the executive team, often that's what they understand. And that's what their peers are talking about when they're talking with somebody over lunch. Hey, we've got this many clicks. I’ll just pick on that word. Isn’t that a stupid word, clicks? I think the world has gotten over the word hit. These many hits on my server. That's good. That's a good word to get rid of. These vanity metrics—how many shares, how many likes, or how many whatever—when they're talking to their peers, those vanity metrics have meaning because that's an understood metric. Then, there's some more sophistication that you can move into. Again, that oil and gas client has blown pass these vanity metrics. They're looking at serious metrics now that are meaningful because of the martech structure. That platform, that text stack allows them to look at really important metrics. There's still how many Facebook views, likes, or whatever. That's fine. I just would say—to add this to the second thing you said is your customers going to a client—my view of the client, if it's an agency, it's easy. Some external party that's writing us a check. If you run a marketing department, if you're in the marketing department, then you've got internal clients. This kind of data matters internally perhaps even more than externally. One advantage of being an external organization is we're given credibility because we're external. If we flew in, we'd be really good. There's truth to that, actually.&nbsp; If you’re willing to pay somebody to fly in, then they must be better than the local guys. You're not local, right? You're sitting there in the next cube over. I've been married for about 30 years. My wife is not as nearly as impressed with me because she knows the details. If you don't know me, I flew in and I look pretty good. Local marketers, internal in house marketers, do have respect problems at the board table, at the executive team table. Data is the way to go. Technology is the way to support the reasons to respect you. \n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-85397\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/197_Sean-Podcast-Graphics_quote-03.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1361\" height=\"630\" /> The third thing I would respond with is marketing has a talent problem. I think marketing has a talent problem, which may sound odd because most of the time when we think about talent, we're thinking about craft. We're thinking art directors, writers. In fact, I'd say there's never been more talent. I think adults coming out of college have more talent, more versatility. Just the other day, one of our team members who are in the revenue operations department fixed some code on the website just because it was easier to fix it than to actually hand it over to the person whose job it was—to the developer. I'm just like, how do you do that? We just do it. Okay. The level of talent is really high. On the craft side, there's more access to talent (even globally) creatively. I think meaningful talent is the word that you've got to look for. I think marketing technology, the talent of reading data, the talent of looking at analytics, the talent of communicating that to a board, to a shareholder, or even to your own department. Avinash Kaushik one day wrote a book a million years ago called Web Analytics. I guess it was 1.0 and I've got 2.0 on my desk. It's a really old book. I think Google is his background. He has the ability to help parse data and understand. I think marketing has a talent problem in that space. To communicate in an effective manner internally is huge. But also, effective communications through an entire buying cycle is the second aspect of talent that's remiss. I feel like I'm rambling a little bit here, Ben. Ben: No, it's all good stuff. It's all good stuff. We've established that marketing technology is fantastic because it enables us to do so many things that we would not have been able to do maybe as recently as 10 years ago. Sean: Absolutely. Ben: It also sounds like maybe it's unspoken value and how it forces us to stop relying solely on emotion to either make a pitch or make decisions, try to show something is working or to even know what we're doing in the first place. Sean: Get rid of I like. I think, I like. No more I think, no more I like. Ben: Yes, absolutely. Also, because we have so many choices, we have so many different tools—there's a tool for every niche, every need. Not even every niche or every need because there's more that keep coming out. Obviously, people are finding more market spaces to move into. As things become more complex and as marketers struggle to really get their heads around how to use data, how to crunch numbers, and all these things, I really think this is what you're saying where the talent gap is. The talent gap isn't really on the production side. It's on the more analytical data-driven side. It's really new to a lot of us. As a result, there's this tendency that marketers get into their head, if I've got a problem I don't know how to solve, I need to get a new tool. Do you believe that is a fallacy? If so, why or why not? Sean: I'm tempted to quote Dug from Up. Remember Dug? Ben: Yeah. Sean: Squirrel. Dug was great. I do think there's a shiny object problem because it's just so exciting when you see new capabilities. I would say it comes back to a framework of understanding what your point of view is going to be as a marketer. What we've chosen is to have the point of view of representing the buyer. It's too easy to live as a marketer and represent marketing. As an outcome of that, you represent technology. As an outcome of that, you get excited by these shiny objects. I get excited by shiny objects too. But after I say, squirrel, I then look at this framework. I don't know how you handle this with your guests and listeners, I'll be glad to share with you this framework. As I've said, my mission in life is to progress in my career as a marketer and share what I know. I'll be glad to give you this framework. If your listeners want to ask you for it, that's great. I'll be glad to. If you want to read more about it, a shameless promotion on Amazon, Sean M. Doyle, the book is called Shift. Its subtitle is 19 ideas for executives who are tasked with marketing but are not trained for the job. I think that might be a good book for you to read this conversion methodology, this science. But then, give it to your boss. Heck, why not? It's a cheap book. It's a good book. Let me give you some examples of tools and the way we look at it. It's easy to talk about it. Let me talk about it in terms of what we would call revenue operations. I think the lack of talent points to this role of revenue operations. The lack of talent points to the need for somebody who can sit in between marketing and sales, deal with both people in a serious manner, and understand both people in a serious manner. The behavioral science points to the six steps that lead from precontemplation. I've never even thought about buying your product or service, all the way to advocacy. That sounds like a consumer decision journey. Most of us get a consumer decision journey of some sort. I promise you any CDJs, from McKinsey’s to maybe one that you’ve put together, is going to fit in this framework. I actually would argue they're all from this framework. What we've done is look at these processes. An easy process to look at tech is consciousness-raising. How do we raise our consciousness? Well, Google, ads. We've seen clients grow 20% in a flat market purely by consciousness-raising, advertising. Everybody gets that one. Let's get to more interesting ones. When you get somebody to your website, one of the tools that behavioral science offers—as an insightful tool—is rational reevaluation. You mentioned something earlier where marketers can tend to get excitable, what science would call emotional reevaluation. That emotional arousal is a lean on a tool that we see on consumer marketing. And B2B is an often forgotten tool mostly because the executive team is very comfortable sharing rational, less comfortable doing anything emotional. Plus, I sell something, occupational health for firemen to make sure their masks fit. What a great emotional opportunity to share the story of how you might die if your mask doesn't fit. That's pretty powerful, right? Actually, that particular client is a marketing automation system. They increase their marketing qualified leads by 76% by implementing that technology. The reason was we emphasized rational reevaluation because that was missing. They were using only—unusually for B2B—the emotional. There's a lot of sales enablement tools that are coming out right now. The first two I would categorize demand generation. These next two stories will be sales enablement stories. One of the processes behavioral science points to is something called commitment. People want to make a private commitment. Ben, you at some point evaluated whether I was safe to look at and put on this podcast. Once you determine that was the case, then you went public. You told your boss, your peers, and you're willing to put me out in a public way. You moved from private commitment to look and study based probably on other people's reputation—an agent or third party. Then you moved to a public commitment. Although it's not on the air yet, so maybe, we'll see. This is a commitment idea. We have a client who used commitment, early, late stage tools, and got over 3000% ROI from an account-based marketing tool. Account-based marketing is incredibly powerful. That was actually a list that we used, that was a dead list. Sales thought they were going to throw them away. We said, give that to us. Let's see what we can do. We applied late stage sales tools and commitment—make a private commitment then make a public commitment. It was a taste and see kind of product. Helping relationships is another one—late stage sales support. Most marketers are not thinking about when the deal is getting ready to happen. We got a client who's looking at buying. They've got a proposal in front of them. They've got sales, it’s getting ready to close the deal. Marketing typically doesn't think about itself being involved. Technology gives us an amazing opportunity to be present for all the influencers. Consumers can be a one-to-one sale. But B2B typically has multiple decision-makers, multiple influencers. We can use technology now to give late stage sales support that delivers messaging only to the people who are looking at the deal. Incredibly powerful. We had a client who, last year, closed a $500,000 deal with somebody they've been pursuing for five or six years. That’s sales enablement. We did not close the deal, marketing did not close the deal. Sales closed the deal, but we supported them. That salesperson even said it was smooth. It was like grease lightning. It was just easy to get that deal through because people knew who they were, they knew the value props, they understood. And they weren't generic ads. They were ads for that one deal. It's probably going to be a $20 million lifetime value client. Is it worth doing marketing on a one-to-one marketing tool? It's amazing. Last, I would just talk about customer success as a third category. We were able to help a company—B2B space—who was doing their parts, reorder, and servicing of their equipment in a very manual way. We were able to Shopify (literally)—to name the client, to name the technology—to do an ecommerce integration that was only with their current customers. They were able to get a return of $585,000 of lifetime value on about $50,000 investment with us and that technology. Technology can support the entire sales cycle. Go back to where we were. 8000 technology, maybe 10,000, maybe 12,000 technologies—how do you do this? What do you think through it? I just named five different types. Those case studies represent five different software technologies. The way we got there was looking at it in three categories: demand generation, sales enablement, and customer success. I'd say if you're overwhelmed, look at it from a buyer's point of view and understand that demand generation has a certain set of technology that's really strong. Late stage demand generation, sales enablement, and things like marketing automation are really great. Then, sales enablement is really a great tactical tool. Then customer success is an easily defined customer tool. You can look at these tools, break it down. When we do an audit of technology, we're going to break it down into making sure there's technology to support the buyer at every step of the journey all the way through becoming an advocate. Ben: Take a breath. A key takeaway from this conversation—which admittedly goes in a lot of different directions,is that while martech makes more data available to us than ever before, you really need to have processes for analyzing that data and putting it into actual use. That's really true of any tool you might choose to use. Software should support strategies that are driven by data. And as long as you follow that idea, you should be able to make better decisions around, not only which martech you choose, but how you use it. Now, back to Sean. I really like the way you broke down martech into those three buckets that are aligned with the customer journey and the sales process would look like. It's a great way to visualize or mentally imagine the different areas where you're going to need technology to support a specific part of the process rather than, well, I think I need this. I think I need that. It seems to me to make way more sense if you start the process and you start plugging tools that enable actions to be taken rather than thinking the other way around. Sean: I always heard it said—and actually, I'm the one who says it—if something doesn't get sold, nothing else really matters. Our job as marketers is to help something get sold. That's why we take that sales first point of view. That's why we look at marketing technology. We look at creative. We look at sales presentations. We look at this all. If something doesn't get sold, if lifetime value doesn't occur, then none of these really matter. I hope the journey there for you, to point to the science, was you never thought about breaking this down. You contemplate it as I'm rambling through it. Maybe you're preparing. Maybe in the back of your head, you're thinking, I need to learn more about this so I can use it. Your next step would be to put this to action. What would it cost? What are my costs personally? What are the out of pocket costs? And then you might actually buy some of these technologies and become an advocate. That is the journey that we all go through in any kind of behavioral change whether we want to lose weight, or we want to buy a martech stack for our company. It's amazing. You've got to have a way to break it down. If you just do a Google search for martech, you're going to find something like 50 categories of technology. I can't even get that through my head. That's why we have three. Ben: Yeah. I feel like as marketers, we have enough three-letter acronyms, enough different product categories, and enough of everything. I think for our listeners, that's really a great way to think about it because you've taken all of the stuff and you broke it down to three buckets. Say I'm a marketer and I'm listening to this conversation. Let's say I'm starting to think or rethink what my martech stack looks like right now versus where it needs to be in order to actually help myself, my department, and my company actually do marketing successfully. How would you recommend that listeners begin to audit what they have right now in order to best determine which things they should keep, which they should get rid of, and maybe which areas where they should explore adding something new? Sean: That's such a great question and a complex question. So much of the current state depends on what your scale is, what the size of your firm is. In other words, if you're an SMB versus an enterprise system versus a lower middle market or a middle-market, I'll share most of my career. Every marketer, every guy like me, likes to talk about—I worked for Georgia-Pacific. I did. And it was cool. That's not most of my career. Most of my career has been in that $5 million company up to about $200 million company. I would say if you're under that $5 million scale size, then the tendency to have a really fragmented marketing tech stack is a common one. Simplifying, because you start looking at two, three, four, five, six, seven, or eight tech. Even understanding it gets complicated. I would say, for that type of company, there's some really great products that exist. I know we're not here to endorse specific types of products. But I will, on this one. I think a company like HubSpot has demonstrated two things. One, a full funnel point of view. I hate the word funnel. A full cognitive marketing point of view from pre-contemplating all the way through advocacy. If you had Google ads and HubSpot, you would be able to have a full tech stack. I would say if you're a smaller company, start with two. And then start plugging in other supporting technology that most likely is going to be late stage technologies. Things like an AdRoll, an Ignitium, or a sales enablement oriented type of technology. But again, coming back to HubSpot, they even have a great customer success technology. You can do ticketing. It's a great, great product. The second reason HubSpot is a great product is it is easy to use. You can just plug it in. The roots of your company are the same thing. It's easy to plugin—WordPress plugins, the history, and the basis. I would just emphasize companies like yours, companies like HubSpot, if they are very easy to use, you win. Because there's so much technology that gets bought and unused. Ease of use (to me) always wins over powerful, sophisticated organizations. Earlier, I talked about closed-loop reporting. Let's move up to your $50 million company. Now, you should probably have some more powerful tools. The most common one talked about that I hear is Salesforce. Salesforce is incredibly powerful because it's a white sheet of paper versus some of these other tools that are pre-programmed, which is why their usability is high. HubSpot is pre-programmed. High-user interface, great user interface design, and easy to use. It probably does not serve—I'm going to get in trouble with somebody for this—that $100 million company. One of our clients just got purchased by a private equity out of Chicago. They standardized all of their investments on Salesforce because it all rolls up. There are 50 different entities that they own. It all rolls up into one platform—one enterprise platform ERP system. They can watch all the different aspects of their investments in a simple way. That's a really sophisticated model—one that’s needed I would say larger companies might want a little bit more of a white sheet paper. You just have to realize you're going to spend a lot of money. You'll probably have a full-time administrator to run that system, and getting it set up is going to be complicated. But that's where that closed-loop reporting can happen. It's easier to do that closed-loop reporting with that sophisticated system. I wish there was an easy answer. Even on those larger enterprises, we still look at demand gen technology, sales enablement technology, and customer success technology. We had that red ops role, that guide that sits in the middle. The individual that sits in the middle between sales and marketing. Because technology without people is also worthless. &nbsp; \n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-85398\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/197_Sean-Podcast-Graphics_quote-04.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1361\" height=\"630\" />Ben: Yeah, for sure. I imagine that too. Something interesting to know is if your company wasn't even thinking about say customer success, for example, or late stage sales. Say that hasn't really been an area of emphasis for your company, you're probably not going to buy a tool that you don't have a person there to use. Sean: Yeah. That's a great question. Our firm, if you were to start, if you hired us to come up to work with you guys, we would start with what we call a sales barrier analysis. The sales barrier analysis is an audit of everything your sales team is doing and everything your marketing team is doing. And we place it in a cognitive marketing framework. Just like what we did with that bank in the beginning of the podcast, when we do that, what we're able to do is identify where there are gaps and where there are barriers. A barrier would be, for example, in the case of public commitment I shared that had 3000% ROI from that dead email list, if we saw that being used early, then that's the wrong thing. That would actually become a barrier to somebody getting into this deal. If you looked at the opposite of a barrier would be a gap. A gap is most commonly found (to your point) with late stage. Most companies do a pretty good job and over-invest in early stage marketing. I would say 80% of all the sales barrier analysis that we do, we see way too many resources being spent early stage, getting a lot of consciousness-raising, maybe some rational reevaluation, maybe some emotional arousal. The late stage sales support—that sales enablement—is just usually missing. And there's usually very little sales on marketing alignment at that stage either. There are two reasons. One, sales, they are compensated by what they sell. Ben, if you're a marketer at my company and I've got the big deal getting ready to happen, I'm just going to [...] you, man. I don't want nobody messing up my deal. Even if I respect you, I just want control. Salespeople are ultimately really confident people. They can go out, they get abused, and beaten out every single day. Their goal is simply the paycheck. That may be an overstatement but pretty close. They tend to [...] marketing because marketing hasn't earned respect from sales. The nature of that then allows marketing to not want to work late stage because the sales guys don't like the marketing guys. Or maybe it’s just they don't trust each other. They haven't seen the value in each other. For example, when we can do that late stage sales support deal, that one-to-one pursuit of one deal, and we get one salesperson to say, God, a marketing work y’all did to get to the CFO, the CEO, the engineering department, and the six influencers in the deals. That really helped me. Now, we've got the respect of that salesperson. I think you would see most companies need to invest more in sales enablement technology, late stage work. The key is to have a role. If somebody on your existing marketing team or you can outsource it. Have somebody who sits between the two—seats between marketing and sales. It's kind of like a counselor. If you and your significant other have gone to get counseling, the reason the counselor is there isn't that you didn't know the answers. I've been to counseling. My wife and I have been. We knew the answers. We just needed a third party to come in, help us see them, and see each other's point of view. I think that revenue ops, that sales enablement person enables the technology to matter. Otherwise, you've got another investment and another technology that's siloed, unused, and misunderstood. That would be the approach I would take. Start with looking where you're spending your money and I bet you're going to discover you need to spend more money, more time, more effort with sales, and more effort in money and time on sales technology late stage. Ben: Got you. Sean: Am I preaching? It sounds like I’m like ah. Ben: This wouldn't be much of a conversation if you didn't (as you say) have a point of view. Sean: I have a point of view, man. Ben: Yeah. That's something that all of us should really take to heart especially as marketers. As soon as you take a point of view in anything, you're inevitably doing alienation to someone who disagrees. Sean: Yeah, absolutely. in the battle of resources inside of a company, the two really well-positioned people—if there are three people, there's marketing, sales, the CFO, and the executive team, whose position in a typical B2B to get resources? Sales can show people how, Hey, I closed x dollars of deals last year. Okay. Manufacturing or whatever your services—they can show, we did x amount of work last year. The CFO can measure all of that, they see it, and then you come to the table as a marketer going, can I have some resources? What would you do? We don't know really what you would do, honestly. You said it involves sales. This may sound odd, but if you're a marketer, you need technology, and you need to help—I do believe most marketers get their job to produce revenue. If you believe that, start the conversation with sales. And start the conversation with the CFO. Go to lunch, talk, or have a Zoom meeting. Just start that dialogue. Find out what they care about. Because in the battle of resources, that's a real thing in every company—small company, large company. Have those relationships. From there, they may learn that you are a serious businessman. Going back to my 80% number, I don’t know why I’m stuck on that today. But I'd say 80% of the people I talked to—the executives—I'm able to say with integrity, you've done a great job with your product, service, manufacturing, distribution, salesforce, accounting force, and all the different people in the executive table—HR, it’s all looking great. Why are you not pulling the marketing lever? It's like this great opportunity for most businesses to pull that lever. The thing that gets neglected is eventually the thing that you have the most opportunity to make the most revenue even in a down market or a flat market. If you'll just do marketing well, take it seriously, you would never hire. Okay, I'm getting fired up now. You would never hire the kid coming out of college with an accounting degree and then put them in charge of your finances. You would never, ever, ever, do it. Why do you hire the kid that graduated with a marketing degree and expect results? It's ridiculous. If you want results, go for it and invest in that area. I promise I’m not pimping my book. If you send me an email, I'll send this chapter to you for free. It's sean@fitzmartin.com. I will send you a chapter of the book that has four questions you should ask and an interview with a marketing person. Not one of those questions has anything to do with craftwork. If you can determine the person is a serious business person and knows how to pull that marketing lever, the outcome of all of that will be the technology that's effective, opens the door into what marketing does, and is measurable. Yeah, okay. I'm off my high horse. I promise, Ben. Ben: No, it's all good. Now that you're back on solid grounds, the last question I'll throw your way. Say that a marketer or a marketing team or someone in the marketing team has identified an area where they legitimately do need to get a new tool or potentially consolidate several tools or upgrade over some kind of makeshift software they're using right now. Whatever the case may be, they need to make a technology purchase. Something you touched on there is because marketers have often, not always, but often [...] to be a thing, have a difficult time with getting the respect that they need to get the resources they need to be successful. How would you recommend that marketers enter that conversation if they are in a position where they just cannot get whoever's holding the credit card or whoever's parenting their decisions (so to speak)? If they can't get those people—I don't mean those people as in the [...] kind of thing. They can't get their colleagues to understand why they need to make this purchase. If it’s a low trust kind of environment—they don't have the trust of sales, they don't have the trust of the executive team, how do you get the deal done? How do you break down that barrier? Sean: The subjective theory of value states there are three ways to do that. Boy, you want to go off into another angle of science? We can do a whole show of the subjective theory of value if you want someday. Ben: Let's get the condensed version to carry us out here. Sean: We will. Without being a broken record, I'll say, the subjective theory of value states there are three ways people buy. One is they're looking for revenue gain. That's a value. If I'm going to buy something, if I'm going to buy marketing technology, you need to show me how to make more money. The second thing is the cost reduction. You need to show me how we're going to reduce the cost. We just moved a client into a customer success tool. One of the ways we did it was we found a piece of marketing technology that had a ticketing, had all the one-on-one communications, had all the tracking metrics, had a knowledge-based FAQ, and it had chat all in one platform for less than they were paying for just their chat platform. That was an easy one. Cost reduction. The third angle of that theory of value says, there's an emotional and a strategic contribution that has to be made that your executive team is looking for. I would frame my technology purchases in those three frameworks or those three pieces of that framework. If we buy this technology, we’re going to project we're going to gain this much revenue, we're going to reduce our internal operating cost, and here's the strategic contribution that this technology will have. I would add to that the cognitive marketing framework and say this is a gap. We have a gap in our sales cycle. I would say sales cycle. I would not say, we have a gap in our marketing approach. Inherently, people pay attention to sales. They get sales. As human beings, we love a hero. Everybody who has been in the room when the sales guy walked in and said, I closed this deal, and it's worth a million dollars. Everyone applauds. Everybody gets the endorphin rush. It's exciting. We love that hero. Sales is that hero. If you go in talking about how sales first methodology, sales first thinking is the way we believe and think. If you go in with that framework and say, we have a gap in our technology stack that can help support sales enablement, late stage sales, and here's the revenue game we're going to get from it, the cost reduction we're going to get from it, and the strategic contribution we’re going to get from it.\" What was the one thing I didn't talk about there? I didn't talk about the technology, did I? I didn't talk about it at all. I didn't say that account-based marketing works like this. It delivers an ad, it uses this platform and third-party data, and blah blah blah blah. They expect us to know that. If you were on the manufacturing plant floor, you came to the executive table, and said, we need a new piece of equipment. Those guys don't come in and say, well, it's made of this type of steel and has this tensile strength. They just want to know are we going to make more money, are we going to reduce our cost, and what's the strategic contribution to the company? Quit talking about technology. Just Google subjective theory of value. It breaks it down so simply, and we all buy that value. It comes back to where you started, Ben, so smartly. Your customer is an internal customer in this case. The marketing of marketing, I think it’s called. Ben: It's pretty meta kind of marketing inception (so to speak). Sean: I always wanted to be meta. That's kind of cool. Ben: I think that boils things down to just a matter of value. I think it's extremely smart. There are words like I think, I like. Sean: I’ll even give you the evidence for it. Everybody knows Komatsu. Everyone knows Caterpillar. I did a study recently in terms of value—trying to help B2B understand why value. Caterpillar has a tight brand. They control that brand to the point where you can go buy a ball cap as a retail buyer. It's part of the identity. They each sell one of those big, long-reach excavator things. I don't even know what they're called. Similar specs, virtually the same thing. Komatsu has a lower lifetime value cost of operations. Why then can Caterpillar charge a 25% premium for their product? Because they understood the value triad, and that's what they're selling. They understand how to sell those three components. Komatsu is only saying it's going to work less or it’s going to work cheaper. You can look at great stories of Nike paying $200 to Carolyn Davidson for a logo a million years ago. Pepsi branded for a million dollars. What's the difference there? It’s just the value proposition. Understanding value and who you're selling to always adds value. Is one logo really worth that much more? It's value. It was the situation of what they were selling. There was no risk there. It was a startup. Pepsi is a multibillion-dollar corporation so the value is different. In the marketing of marketing, we've got to understand value and use that story internally to get the technology we need and externally to sell our own products and services. \n<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/actionable-marketing-podcast/id1162659795?mt=2\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-85399 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/197_Sean-Podcast-Graphics_CTA.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1361\" height=\"550\" /></a>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/building-a-better-martech-stack-by-understanding-data-and-the-science-of-behavioral-change-with-sean-doyle-from-fitzmartin-amp-197/\">Building a Better Martech Stack By Understanding Data and the Science of Behavioral Change With Sean Doyle From FitzMartin [AMP 197]</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://coschedule.com\">CoSchedule Blog</a>.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 19:16:08 +0000","feedId":4227,"bgimg":"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/197_Sean-Podcast-Graphics_header.png","linkMd5":"41cb4ab975a696ccabaf909689414864","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn59@2020_6/2020/08/24/21-56-11-042_cf490b8531d84379.webp","destWidth":1361,"destHeight":581,"sourceBytes":88936,"destBytes":42138,"author":"Ben Sailer","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/197_Sean-Podcast-Graphics_header.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn59@2020_6/2020/08/24/21-56-11-042_cf490b8531d84379.webp","https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/197_Sean-Podcast-Graphics_quote-01.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn60@2020_2/2020/08/24/21-56-37-787_68a5fc6ced7392f6.webp","https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/197_Sean-Podcast-Graphics_quote-02.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn79@2020_3/2020/08/24/21-56-40-793_2d207c55edc0cb26.webp","https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/197_Sean-Podcast-Graphics_quote-03.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn3@2020_2/2020/08/24/21-56-40-084_f1d70726d799ade1.webp","https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/197_Sean-Podcast-Graphics_quote-04.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn11@2020_3/2020/08/24/21-56-34-693_efbdf25b57a4f1a2.webp","https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/197_Sean-Podcast-Graphics_CTA.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn15@2020_3/2020/08/24/21-56-27-959_291dedb4ec5baa8b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598306169546},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 05:56:09","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 05:56:09","title":"How to Effectively Organize Your Social Media Editorial Calendar (Template)","link":"http://coschedule.com/blog/?p=25836","description":"<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-85728 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/social-media-editorial-calendar-header-template.png\" alt=\"How to effectively organize your social media editorial calendar header (template)\" width=\"1360\" height=\"580\" /> The best social media marketers keep organized with editorial calendars.

They’re also used to plan when and which content will be shared, manage campaigns, and track deadlines.\n</blockquote> They’re typically built using one of three different formats: printed paper, spreadsheets, or software services. \n<ul> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Paper Calendars</span>: The old-school approach for those who prefer hand-written organization.</li> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Spreadsheets</span>: A cost-effective route for planning posts ahead of time.</li> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Software Services</span>: The professional option with powerful automation and time-saving capabilities.</li> \n</ul> Spreadsheets are workable solutions at first and are a great option when you’re starting out.

Before you invest the time into building one though, you probably want to know what the real benefits are. Here are four key things to consider: \n<ul> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Turning chaos into harmony</span>. Managing multiple social media accounts can turn messy fast. That kind of disorganization will kill your efficiency.</li> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Holding teams accountable</span>. Calendars are great for setting deadlines. It’s easy to procrastinate when deadlines are flexible or nonexistent. Laying out a clear plan eliminates excuses for not knowing what content to publish on your social channels.</li> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Saving time that you can use to get real work done</span>. No one ever has enough time. However, planning your social media outreach with a calendar lets you make the most of the time you have.</li> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Measurably improving your results</span>. This is the benefit that supersedes all other benefits. After all, efficiency without effectiveness really just means doing things poorly, quickly.</li> \n</ul> Those are some anecdotal benefits, but what about some hard numbers on the benefits of getting organized in general? In the company’s early days, Nathan Ellering, our Head of Marketing, gathered data on what happened when he used a calendar to schedule multiple social posts promoting a single piece of content. Here are the results: \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-85729 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/social-media-calendar-example.png\" alt=\"Real-life examples of social media calendars\" width=\"1360\" height=\"3838\" /> 3,150% increase in clicks. Best of all, there’s no reason you can’t replicate similar success, too. What does this mean for you? Getting organized and proactively planning your work are shown to improve results, and calendars are one of the best tools available to support both of those aims. \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong><a href=\"http://coschedule.com/blog/?p=25836#toc\">Back to the Top</a></strong>\n</div> \n<a name=\"who\"></a> \n<h2>Who Can Use a Social Calendar?</h2> Anyone creating social content — whether for a business, media company, or a serious blog — should consider using a calendar. \n<ul> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Marketing teams</span>: Marketing campaigns often have a lot of moving parts, including social components. Keeping teams organized and making sure everyone involved in a project understands the social promotion schedule is key.</li> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Small businesses</span>: Staying organized with a calendar makes it much easier to save time and maintain consistency.

Both this template and CoSchedule will be used as examples throughout the instruction here. \n<h3>1. The Broad and General Calendar</h3> You’ll need an overarching calendar to help you focus on topics that matter to your audience. For content marketers, it would be perfect to schedule your broad topic calendar four to six months out. That gives you the opportunity to plan new content based your audience’s reactions. To build your broad and general calendar, start by downloading the social media calendar bundle included in this post. Then, open up the Social Media Calendar Excel file. You’ll find the “Broad and General Calendar” section at the top of the first tab. \n<img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter wp-image-72675 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/general-content-calendar-example.png\" alt=\"Example of the general content calendar template\" width=\"1360\" height=\"301\" /> Use the \"Main Theme\" row to map out your primary content themes for each month. Then, fill in sub-topics for content you’ll want to create and share that support those themes. You can base your general calendar on the model from traditional magazines. They typically offer these sorts of editorial calendars for an entire year to attract advertisers for specific magazine issues. \n<h3>2. The Content Calendar</h3> \n<img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter wp-image-72676 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/social-media-content-promotion-calendar-example.png\" alt=\"Example of the social media promotion calendar\" width=\"1360\" height=\"541\" /> The content calendar provides a lot more detail. This is when you look at your topics and plan the actual content types best suited to tell your specific stories — blog posts, e-books, videos, webinars, events, and what-have-you. Let’s look back at the social media calendar you downloaded from this post. Beneath the Broad and General calendar, you’ll find the Content Calendar. This is where you can map out all the content you’ll create, and later share and promote on social media. At this point, you assign the specific dates on which each piece will publish. Typically, you can work two to three months out with this calendar. \n<h3>3. The Promotion Calendar</h3> The promotion calendar is your plan to share all of the content you create. This is when you’ll schedule your social media messages. Using your Social Media Calendar, click into any of the month tabs along the bottom. Here’s what you’ll see: \n<img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter wp-image-72457 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/promotion-calendar-example.png\" alt=\"Example of the promotion calendar\" width=\"1360\" height=\"417\" /> This is where you’ll create and store all your social media promotion content. Here’s what you should put in each field: \n<ul> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Content</span>: This is your social media post copy.</li> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Image Link</span>: If your post will have an image or video, upload it to a cloud storage service (such as Google Drive or Dropbox). Then, drop a link to the image here. This will give you easy access to your images when you’re ready to create your posts.</li> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">URL</span>: If a post will include a link, drop it in here.</li> \n</ul> You can then assign dates when you’ll share each of these messages, which usually takes place immediately after you’re done creating the content you’ll share, but you can plan ahead of schedule with the right tools. \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong><a href=\"http://coschedule.com/blog/?p=25836#toc\">Back to the Top</a></strong>\n</div> \n<a name=\"good\"></a> \n<h2>What Makes Up a Good Social Media Calendar?</h2> It seems like a lot of content marketers&nbsp;create great content, share it when it goes live, and then they&nbsp;call it good.&nbsp;\n<em>They’re all missing out</em>&nbsp;on their own 3,150% more click-throughs. Instead of taking this minimalist approach, a great social media calendar maximizes exposure of your content on the social networks your audience uses — without being spammy. As you plan your content, these eight&nbsp;things can make or break your social media calendar. \n<h3>1. Understand Why Your Audience Shares Your Content</h3> Once you understand the&nbsp;\n<a href=\"http://coschedule.com/blog/why-people-share/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">psychology of why your audience shares</a>, you can create content in ways that are most likely to connect with them. This will help you plan awesome content from the get-go, and help you interact/socialize with your audience using social media. A report from&nbsp;\n<em>The New York Times</em>&nbsp;Customer Insight Group found five major reasons why people share content with their networks: \n<ol> \n <li>84% share to support a cause.</li> \n <li>78% share to&nbsp;stay connected with those they know.</li> \n <li>69% share to feel involved in the world.</li> \n <li>68% share to define&nbsp;themselves.</li> \n <li>49% share for entertainment or to provide valuable content to others.</li> \n</ol> \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-85730 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/5-sharing-lessons.png\" alt=\"5 lessons sharing can teach you\" width=\"1360\" height=\"2645\" /> The study also found that 73% of the survey takers shared content to understand the information more thoughtfully. As you can imagine, there are a lot of lessons to learn from this knowledge. As you plan your social media calendar, keep this in mind. \n<h3>Help Them Define Themselves</h3> Create content about your different&nbsp;\n<a href=\"http://coschedule.com/blog/google-analytics-reports/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">customer types</a> and help them self-identify. That will help you — and help them — connect with your content. \n<h3>Help Them Connect With Others</h3> Imagine the possibilities a forum — or even a larger brand ambassador program — could present for your customers to ask each other questions and learn from one another. You could even start as simple as a \n<a href=\"http://coschedule.com/blog/twitter-chat/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Twitter chat</a>. \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong>&nbsp;\n <a href=\"http://coschedule.com/blog/social-media-engagement-tactics/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">21 Social Media Engagement Tactics That Will Grow Your Audience</a>\n</div> \n<h3>Value Them, and Let Them Know It</h3> If someone sends you a message, leaves you a comment, responds to a tweet — whatever it is — let them know that you valued their contribution. \n<a href=\"http://coschedule.com/blog/social-media-listening/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Listen</a>&nbsp;and respond. \n<h3>Help Them Believe in Something</h3> Again, let your advocates know you appreciate their respect. They’re your rock stars, and almost&nbsp;nothing is better than social proof. While some of this is more about creating awesome content in the first place,&nbsp;\n<em>this is the backbone on which you’ll build your social media calendar.</em> However, without sharing good content in the first place, why would anyone want to interact with you? \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong><a href=\"http://coschedule.com/blog/?p=25836#toc\">Back to the Top</a></strong>\n</div> \n<a name=\"planning\"></a> \n<h2>Planning Your Content Strategy</h2> Before you can start sharing content, you need to know what you’ll be creating, and why you’ll be creating it. To do this, start with developing a basic content strategy. Planning a content strategy can get complex, but you can keep it simple when you’re starting out. At a very basic level, this process entails determining a few things: \n<ul> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Core topical focus areas</span>.

Where will you create and share content?</li> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Content types you’ll create</span>.

One way to generate tons of ideas quickly is to hold a 30-minute brainstorming meeting. The goal is to get as many solid ideas out of your head and onto the calendar as quickly as possible. Here’s how it works: \n<ul> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Spend ten minutes writing down ideas on Post-It notes</span>. As many ideas as you can come up with.</li> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Spend another ten minutes scoring those ideas on a three-point scale</span>. 3’s are surefire hits, 2’s are maybe’s, and 1’s are duds. You’ll likely have several ideas in all three categories, and that’s normal.</li> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Finally, wrap up the meeting with ten minutes of sorting through your 3’s</span>. These are your best ideas that are most likely to succeed.</li> \n</ul> By the time you’re done, you’ll have plenty of ideas to fill up a month or two on your calendar. \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/content-marketing-brainstorming-process/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Best 30-Minute Content Marketing Brainstorming Process</a></span>\n</div> \n<h3>Develop a Blog Publishing Cadence</h3> The odds are strong that at least some of your social media content will be sourced from your blog, and if you have a blog at all, integrating your blogging and social strategies is crucial for ensuring the success of each. Blogging is core to your overall content strategy, start here. \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-85731 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/beginner-blog-schedule.png\" alt=\"Example of a beginner blog schedule\" width=\"1360\" height=\"2645\" /> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/plan-a-blog-schedule/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How to Plan a Blog Schedule That Will Crush Your Goals</a></span>\n</div> \n<h3>Next, Figure Out How Often You’ll Share Each Post</h3> For each blog post you create, establish a basic publishing schedule to ensure it gets some social traction. While constraints on organic reach have made sharing blog content more difficult, it isn’t impossible to succeed with some smart strategy and creative messaging. Here’s a sample schedule to start with, and it has proven successful for CoSchedule. \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-85732 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/sm-posting-schedule.png\" alt=\"Posting schedule example for social media\" width=\"1360\" height=\"3671\" /> \n<h3>Establishing a Social Media Publishing Cadence</h3> You’ll likely be creating social media posts to promote content other than blog posts too. You’ll probably be creating content exclusively for social media too, with no outbound links; just awareness-driven content. Now, “How often should I post on social media?” is one of the most common questions we at CoSchedule. It’s a fundamental problem that everyone faces when they’re starting out, and one that has a tendency to nag at even experience marketers and bloggers. There isn’t a single correct answer to that question either. The best approach, then, is to use some research-backed starting points, and then adjust according to your own results from there. Here’s a quick visual reference to begin with. \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-85733 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/how-often-sm.png\" alt=\"How often you should post on your social media\" width=\"1360\" height=\"8364\" /> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/how-often-to-post-on-social-media/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How Often to Post on Social Media [Proven Research From 14 Studies]</a></span>\n</div> \n<h3>Aligning Messaging With Appropriate Social Channels</h3> Different types of messaging and content do better on different social networks. This means you might not need to be everywhere or include every channel possible on your calendar. It also means you’ll need to consider which content to share on which platforms. What this looks like specifically will depend on what types of content you create, what topics you’re focused on, where your audience is most active, and myriad other factors. As a starting point, consider these strengths, and use cases for each popular social network. \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-85734 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/what-content-works.png\" alt=\"Figuring out what content works for social networks\" width=\"1360\" height=\"1225\" /> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong><a href=\"http://coschedule.com/blog/?p=25836#toc\">Back to the Top</a></strong>\n</div> \n<a name=\"plan\"></a> \n<h2>Plan Your Social Media Content Creation Workflow</h2> Now, let's explore how to use the calendar step-by-step. Follow along to plan out an entire social media marketing workflow for your team or yourself, all based around\n<span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 16px;\"> your calendar.</span> \n<h3>Step 1: Determine What You'll Be Creating or Sharing</h3> Let's begin with a hypothetical social media campaign. Maybe you're promoting: \n<ul> \n <li><strong>A <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/blog-post-templates/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">blog post</a> or article</strong></li> \n <li><strong>A <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/how-to-write-landing-pages/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">landing page</a></strong></li> \n <li><strong>An event</strong></li> \n <li><strong>A contest</strong></li> \n <li><strong>A brand or product, in general</strong></li> \n</ul> Whatever the case may be, knowing what you'll be promoting, creating, or sharing is likely where your process will start. \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/social-media-campaign-ideas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How to Generate Better Social Media Campaign Ideas Like a Creative Genius</a>\n</div> \n<h3>Step 2: Write Your Post Copy</h3> As our own Nathan Ellering recently said on our blog: \n<blockquote>\n Think of each message as a&nbsp;\n <a href=\"http://coschedule.com/blog/how-to-write-a-call-to-action-template/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">call to action</a>: \n <ul> \n  <li>Sell your followers on <em>the value they’ll get</em> if they just click through to read your blog post.</li> \n  <li>Or make them <em>question a current belief</em> with the promise of a better solution to a problem.</li> \n  <li>Or make them feel like <em>they’re missing out</em> on something amazing.</li> \n </ul> \n</blockquote> In short, \n<em>words have power</em>. Wield them intentionally to invoke the emotional response you want. Getting this right is key to driving engagement and traffic. W\n<span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\">hat are some of the specific types of messaging that you can try out?</span> \n<div class=\"callout\"> \n <ul> \n  <li><strong>Questions</strong>. Close-ended questions drive more clickthroughs. However, open-ended questions may drive more engagement, since you're asking for a response.</li> \n  <li><strong>Benefits</strong>. Hint at what's in it for your audience to click through on your link.</li> \n  <li><strong>FOMO</strong>. Otherwise known as \"the fear of missing out.\"&nbsp;This angle can work well if&nbsp;you're giving your audience a deadline to act.</li> \n  <li><strong>Stats</strong>. Numbers that seem hard-to-believe (but are accurate), can be a great way to stoke interest.</li> \n  <li><strong>Facts</strong>. Again, the harder to believe, the better.</li> \n  <li><strong>Controversy</strong>. This doesn't mean to be offensive. It means don't be afraid of questioning status quo. If you have a contrary opinion on a topic, put it out there. You just might spark a discussion that changes what folks consider common wisdom, which isn't always wise.</li> \n </ul> \n</div> [Tweet \"Wield your words intentionally to invoke the emotional response that you want.\"] If you don't want to write your posts directly into your spreadsheet, use in a word processor (Word, Google Docs, or anything else you prefer will work). Lay out your document like this: \n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Network:</strong> [INSERT NETWORK] <strong>Post 1 Copy:</strong> [ENTER POST] <strong>Post 1 Image:</strong> [INSERT IMAGE DIRECTION] <strong>Post 1 Link:</strong> [INSERT URL]</p> \n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Post 2 Copy:</strong> [ENTER POST] <strong>Post 2 Image:</strong> [INSERT IMAGE DIRECTION] <strong>Post 2 Link:</strong> [INSERT URL]</p> Continue until you've completed a full campaign's worth of posts. To make sure each post is the best it can be before publishing, run your copy through the&nbsp;\n<a href=\"https://coschedule.com/social-message-optimizer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Social Media Optimizer.</a> Start by typing in your post copy. \n<img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter wp-image-72447 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/enter-social-post-copy.png\" alt=\"Writing a social media post in the Social Message Optimizer\" width=\"1360\" height=\"747\" /> Select&nbsp;\n<strong>Score My Message</strong>, and your score for each social channel will appear.

You'll find tips to improve your post, including recommendations for character counts, hashtags, emotional sentiment, and emojis. \n<img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter wp-image-72449 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/smo-score.png\" alt=\"Social Media Optimizer Score\" width=\"1360\" height=\"781\" /> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/how-to-write-for-social-media/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How to Write for Social Media to Create the Best Posts</a>\n</div> \n<h3>Step 3: Hand Off Your Campaign for Design</h3> Next, hand off your image ideas to your designer. You'll likely need to discuss your ideas with them and get their creative input before they begin design. For the sake of example, let's say this is an image we'll use for our campaign: \n<img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter wp-image-72422 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/example-social-photo-dog.jpg\" alt=\"Example photo for blog post\" width=\"1360\" height=\"906\" /> Now that you've got a graphic, upload them to a folder in a cloud-based storage service of your choice (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.). Give the folder a name specific to this campaign. Then, upload all your images. \n<img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter wp-image-72435 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/create-new-folder-1.png\" alt=\"Create a New Folder\" width=\"1360\" height=\"552\" /> Do this for each photo in your campaign. That way, you'll have easy access to all your campaign's assets when you're ready to post them. Alternately, CoSchedule customers can use the \n<a href=\"https://coschedule.com/marketing-suite/asset-organizer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Asset Organizer</a>. It's a digital asset management system built specifically for marketers that makes it easy to keep visual assets organized. \n<img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter wp-image-72438 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/asset-organizer-example.png\" alt=\"Example of CoSchedule's Asset Organizer\" width=\"1360\" height=\"738\" /> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/social-media-images/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How to Make the Best Social Media Images the Easy Way</a>\n</div> \n<h3>Step 4: Add All Your Campaign Content Onto Your Calendar</h3> Now, you have all the content for your campaign ready. It's time to place it all on the calendar. Start by pasting in your post copy. \n<img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter wp-image-72439 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/write-post-copy-template.png\" alt=\"Writing social post copy\" width=\"1360\" height=\"214\" /> Then, grab the URL for the image from your image storage service and paste that in, too. If you're using Google Drive, click the \"Get Shareable Link\" button below. Then, paste that URL into your calendar. This will make the image easily accessible later. \n<img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter wp-image-72440 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/share-image-example.png\" alt=\"Example of sharing an image from Google Drive\" width=\"1360\" height=\"754\" /> Finally, add in the time for your post: \n<img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter wp-image-72442 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/add-time.png\" alt=\"Add social media post time\" width=\"1360\" height=\"169\" /> Repeat as necessary until you've entered all your content. Follow this same process for every post you create. Use the text wrap settings in Google Sheets or Excel to control how content fills each cell in your calendar. \n<img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter wp-image-72446 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/use-text-wrap-google-sheets.png\" alt=\"Using Text Wrap in Google Sheets\" width=\"1360\" height=\"235\" /> \n<span style=\"color: #ff9900;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Alternately, you can do this all in CoSchedule, too.</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"color: #000000;\">With the Social Organizer, you can easily create single posts or entire campaigns. Plus, you can keep all your copy and images neatly organized, reshare top-performing posts automatically with ReQueue, and optimize post timing with Best Time Scheduling.</span></span> https://coschedule.wistia.com/medias/uszpz02w5v?embedType=async&amp;videoFoam=true&amp;videoWidth=770 \n<h3>Step 5: Measure Your Results</h3> Once you start using your calendar, you'll want to see results, right? One way to do that is to measure referral traffic to your blog or website using Google Analytics. On the first tab of the calendar template included in this post, you'll see this link to a Custom Report template for Google Analytics: \n<img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter wp-image-72450 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/where-to-find-ga-custom-report-link.png\" alt=\"Where to find your Google Analytics custom report link\" width=\"1360\" height=\"123\" /> Copy and paste this URL into your browser.

Instead, we’ll show you how to learn marketing yourself, with 50+ incredible resources to get you going.

Regardless of how you get them, most employers will need some \n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/marketing-skills/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">marketing skills</a></span>, experience, and education when hiring for a role. \n<img class=\"drop-shadow alignnone wp-image-85175 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/marketing-skills.png\" alt=\"50 marketing skills you need to succeed in 2020.\" width=\"1361\" height=\"5114\" /> \n<h2>Do I Need a College Degree to Work in Marketing?</h2> The traditional route to getting a job is to go to college for qualifications. Unlike training for other job roles, like a doctor, you don’t always need a qualification to \n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/how-to-get-a-marketing-job/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">get a marketing job</a></span>. There are plenty of companies that hire marketers based on their practical skills, rather than an official qualification.

While a course can teach you the foundations, you should also look to other resources to stay updated. A superb way to do that is through reading marketing books. Experts in the industry write books as a way to share which strategies work and don't work. You can also get a solid insight into how a company actually does their marketing, making your own education less theoretical and more practical. \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-85178 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/10x-cta.png\" alt=\"CTA for Garrett's 10x book.\" width=\"1361\" height=\"593\" /> Below are some of our favorites: \n<ul> \n <li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/10x-Marketing-Formula-Blueprint-Competition-Free-ebook/dp/B0793FQ6DD/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&amp;keywords=10x+marketing+formula&amp;qid=1592333919&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sr=1-3\">10x Marketing Formula</a></span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/10x-Marketing-Formula-Blueprint-Competition-Free-ebook/dp/B0793FQ6DD/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&amp;keywords=10x+marketing+formula&amp;qid=1592333919&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sr=1-3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">&nbsp;by Garrett Moon</a></span>: The entire concept of this book is to make big moves that get 10x growth, rather than small, marketing tactics that only improve your results by 10%.

It’s not uncommon to hear advice suggesting you need a dozen roles for one team, and multiple teams spread across your entire marketing department.\n\nThat might make sense for large enterprises with tons of resources, but for the majority of companies, that may not be realistic.\n\nTo simplify things, here are some theoretical examples for companies of different sizes.\n<div class=\"link-callout\"><strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/marketing-file-folder-structure-organizational-system-template/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Best Way to Organize Marketing Assets With Simple Folder Structures</a></div>\n<h3>Small Business Marketing Team Structure: Lean and Scrappy.</h3>\nIn a small business, odds are you’re hiring one or two people to tackle marketing.

HubSpot did an excellent job <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/team-structure-diagrams\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">breaking down seven common org structures</a>,</span> along with their respective pros and cons, getting a bit more granular into each one.\n<h3>Functional Org Chart</h3>\nThis example is broken down across business functions. One can assume each spoke under marketing leads to more sub-teams (e.g. content, social, analytics, and so forth). It’s also interesting to note how marketing and sales operate side-by-side. After all, someone has to close deals on the leads marketing generates.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_84890\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1361\"]<img class=\"wp-image-84890 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/functional-chart.png\" alt=\"Functional org chart.\" width=\"1361\" height=\"642\" /> Source: <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/team-structure-diagrams\">HubSpot</a>[/caption]\n\n[Tweet \"How can you construct a functional marketing org chart?\"]\n<h3>Divisional Org Chart</h3>\nIn this next example, the company is organized based on product-category departments. Each department could presumably have its own marketing team. This type of structure is common at large enterprises that make lots of different types of products. For example, consider a company like Samsung, which produces everything from phones to refrigerators.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_84891\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1361\"]<img class=\"wp-image-84891 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/product-based-1.png\" alt=\"Divisional org chart: product-based.\" width=\"1361\" height=\"714\" /> Source: <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/team-structure-diagrams\">HubSpot</a>[/caption]\n<h3>Market-Based Org Chart</h3>\nThis example is similar to the previous one, except teams are split up based on customer-centric divisions instead of product-based ones.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_84892\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1361\"]<img class=\"wp-image-84892 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/market-based-1.png\" alt=\"Divisional org chart: market-based.\" width=\"1361\" height=\"710\" /> Source: <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/team-structure-diagrams\">HubSpot</a>[/caption]\n<h3>Geographical Org Chart</h3>\nFor extremely large enterprises or companies with offices around the world, a geographic org chart, like this one, may make sense.

In this example, however, it’s unclear exactly where marketing may fit — though content can certainly support all initiatives shown.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_84894\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1361\"]<img class=\"wp-image-84894 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/process-based-1.png\" alt=\"Process-based org chart.\" width=\"1361\" height=\"769\" /> Source: <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/team-structure-diagrams\">HubSpot</a>[/caption]\n<h3>Matrix Org Chart</h3>\nIf this one reminds you of a certain early 2000s movie series, you’re not alone.\n\nThis example illustrates a different kind of matrix though. It’s similar to some of the examples above, but instead of different divisions having their own marketing teams, the marketing, sales, and service functions all answer to one department head. From there, smaller sub-teams work with each division. It’s a subtle, but important, distinction.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_84895\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1361\"]<img class=\"wp-image-84895 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/matrix-1.png\" alt=\"Matrix org chart.\" width=\"1361\" height=\"969\" /> Source: <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/team-structure-diagrams\">HubSpot</a>[/caption]\n<h3>Circular Org Chart</h3>\nIn a circular organizational structure, a marketing services department responds to work requests from other areas.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_84896\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1361\"]<img class=\"wp-image-84896 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/circular.png\" alt=\"Circular org chart.\" width=\"1361\" height=\"1105\" /> Source: <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/team-structure-diagrams\">HubSpot</a>[/caption]\n\n[Tweet \"Have you tried using a circular marketing org structure?\"]\n<h2>Team-Based Org Charts</h2>\nNext, let’s look at what individual teams could look like when mapped out.\n<h3>Content Marketing Team</h3>\nYou don’t need an enormous team to start content marketing, but the work requires lots of different tactics and disciplines, and the more help you have, the better.\n\nWhat can this type of team look like at a large organization?

Content might be created by a content team or a separate marketing department — although, SEO should be aligned with marketing. A PR team or specialist might help with link acquisition and other off-site strategies, even if the terms a link builder and a PR pro use may differ according to their goals. Analysts often measure all aspects of a company’s marketing efforts.

While CEO and co-founder, Garrett Moon, contributed content and guidance, all things marketing were owned by a single staffer.\n\nTalk about a high-pressure environment.\n\nThe upside? Nathan had total creative control and free reign to test what worked and what didn’t. He’d learn a new tactic or get started with a new channel. Then, once he figured it out, another team member would be brought on board to take it over.\n\nEventually, more teams were added to tackle new tasks, each strategically selected to support business growth for a fast-moving startup.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-84904 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/demand-generation.png\" alt=\"The &#34;hierarchy&#34; of a content marketing team.\" width=\"1361\" height=\"540\" />\n\nProduct Marketing promotes the CoSchedule product itself:\n\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-84905 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/product-marketing.png\" alt=\"The different roles that make up a product marketing team.\" width=\"1361\" height=\"539\" />\n\nWhile Branding and PR helps tell CoSchedule's story to the world:\n\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-84906 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/branding.png\" alt=\"The different roles that make up a branding and pr team.\" width=\"1361\" height=\"539\" />\n\n[Tweet \"Is it time to rethink your marketing org chart?

The results speak for themselves, and they might not have been attained as easily — had the company followed a traditional hiring pattern.\n\nIn the early days (and even now), CoSchedule leaned heavily on inbound marketing; creating top-notch blog content to attract leads. The strategy was simple:\n<ul>\n \t<li><em>Do basic keyword research.</em></li>\n \t<li><em>Create content answering those queries.</em></li>\n \t<li><em>Promote it via social media and email.</em></li>\n</ul>\nThat’s effective for bringing in an audience, and eventually converting that audience into a paid customer base. It then added product marketers to help sell the product once an audience had been built. Next, a PR team was built out to help manage key relationships, 10X the buzz around the product, and more.\n<div class=\"link-callout\"><strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/10x-marketing-growth-formula/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Best Formula for 10X Marketing Growth is Here</a></div>\n<h3>Research Your Industry</h3>\nYour competition got where they are somehow.

Now, who will own which tasks?\n\nThis ties back into your \"Jobs to be Done\". For each job or task, list the steps required to complete it. Here’s an example of what this might look like for creating a blog post:\n<ol>\n \t<li><em>Generate an idea.</em></li>\n \t<li><em>Do keyword research.</em></li>\n \t<li><em>Write an outline.</em></li>\n \t<li><em>Execute post based on outline.</em></li>\n \t<li><em>Design visual content.</em></li>\n \t<li><em>Editing and review.</em></li>\n \t<li><em>Schedule on editorial calendar.</em></li>\n \t<li><em>Measure performance.</em></li>\n</ol>\nEach of these tasks could fall onto different team members:\n<ul>\n \t<li><em>Ideation and writing execution might fall onto content marketing.</em></li>\n \t<li><em>Keyword research might, too, if the organization doesn’t have a dedicated SEO specialist.</em></li>\n \t<li><em>A graphic designer would be best for creating stunning visual content.</em></li>\n \t<li><em>An editor or manager would need to review and schedule content.</em></li>\n \t<li><em>If a team has a dedicated analyst or analytics team, they’d own measuring performance and extracting actionable insights from data.</em></li>\n</ul>\nBeyond knowing what you need done, understand what it will take to complete the work effectively.

This means that regardless of current talent gaps on their roster, they’ll take the best overall players they can find. Then, they’ll strategize on how to make the best use of those players. It’s all about doubling down on strengths and finding ways to mitigate weaknesses, if they can’t be eliminated completely.\n\nBusinesses often do something similar, where they’ll make room for talented team members, even if they weren’t initially hiring for their role.\n\nWhere can you find these folks?

Welcome to the show.\n\nLars: Thanks for having me, Ben.\n\nBen: Absolutely. Would you mind taking a moment to introduce yourself and explain what your team does over at GreenRope?\n\nLars: Sure. We are a CRM and marketing automation software platform. We help customers of all sizes, businesses of all sizes, non-profits, government, organizations with sales, marketing, customer service, project management, event management, knowledge management, and learning management all in a single unified platform.\n\nWe've been around for about 20 years and have grown organically. We've never taken any seed funding. Currently, we have about 1000 customers in 40 countries and are slowly growing organically. Just happy to be here, shed some light on remote work, and how the right software tools can help businesses scale.\n\nBen: Absolutely. Are you 100% remote or do you have some office location?\n\nLars: We have been 100% remote since the very beginning.\n\nBen: Very cool. Having been all remote for two decades now, I feel like you're a bit ahead of the curve relative to the development of remote work becoming more common, certainly in the technology industry. What would you say are some of the benefits of working remotely and having a fully distributed team?\n\nLars: I came out of the military and am working in the government. Back in those days, which was a long time ago, there were a lot of cubicle farms there. I'm sure that at some point, some of us have been in the prairie doggie thing where somebody says let’s dance up in a cubicle.\n\nI think one of the big advantages of working remotely is that you have the freedom and the flexibility to work when and where you want. The key is not everybody can do it. There are some people who love to go into an office and they want to be in a cubicle. They want their space. Sometimes, it's because they want to get away from their home or their family. Sometimes, they need the structure. So, remote work isn't for everybody.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-84984\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/195_Lars-Podcast-Graphics_quote-03.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1361\" height=\"630\" />\n\nI think for those who want that freedom, who want that flexibility, the freedom to be able to work from anywhere is so liberating in how you can choose to live your life. If you can do your job remotely, that means that you can be on the road somewhere. You can travel. You can be in another country. Or you can just be home and be with your dogs or your family if that's what you want.\n\nUsually, the biggest requirement is that you have a good internet connection and you have a quiet workspace. As long as you can get those things, you can be working in the back of your car at a campsite somewhere. You can be working in a coffee shop somewhere, in some foreign country. You can be anywhere. As I said, it's not for everybody but if you can embrace that, that freedom, schedule your life around that, have the freedom and the self-discipline to do it, it's life-changing.\n\nI could not go back to working in a cubicle. I couldn't do it. Once you have the taste of freedom, how could anyone go back to that? I'm sure there are people who do, but I have a hard time identifying that. I really enjoy the freedom.\n\nBen: Yeah, just getting out of the office space-esque cubicle farm-type environment. Something that you touched on that's really important is that it's not for everyone. But with the advent of the pandemic, a lot of people are forced to work remotely. They are forced to work remotely whether or not they feel that's how they work best. It's not a choice for a lot of people. It's also forced a lot of companies to have to very quickly readapt the way that they work in order to facilitate an entire mode of operating that they were (maybe) never prepared for before.\n\nWith that in mind, let's say that if I'm a marketing manager and I'm in a situation where, as of three months ago, I've had to manage a marketing team remotely, and we were previously in an office location, what would be the single most important thing that you would advise that person to focus on in order for them to help their teams stay focused?\n\nLars: Whenever I talk to any business about how to use technology, how to manage what needs to be done, the thing that I always come back to is understanding the requirements, knowing what has to get done. Most marketing departments, you've got some creative that needs to get done. You have some account management work that has to get done. You have to deploy whether you're posting in social media, whether you’re launching your website, landing pages, ads, whatever. You have to have the tools to have all that together.\n\nI think the main thing comes down to what are your requirements and understanding that there are tools to do all of those things. You just have to find the right tools. You have to figure out what they are.\n\nOne of the important things from a marketing manager's perspective is how the data gets created and distributed. You have to know if you're going to be using different pieces of software. Where does that data go? How was it used? How was it reported? What are the metrics? How are you holding people accountable in what they're actually doing?\n\nUsually, the big part is the integration of that data. If you have no disciplined process to do that, you're going to end up with a spaghetti mess of chaos. Nobody wants that. Nobody wants that uncontrolled hope that a person does their job kind of thing. That's not how businesses operate. That's not how you scale. It's not how you create a consistent brand experience. Everything has to be in some sort of a process, some sort of a documented way of understanding how people do things. Otherwise, it's the wild west.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-84985\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/195_Lars-Podcast-Graphics_quote-01.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1361\" height=\"630\" />\n\nOne of the common phrases that I've heard before and I'll say it again is having the inmates run the asylum. If you're a marketing manager and you have people who work for you, maybe they use a particular piece of software that they really like but nobody else uses it, they really like it and they really own it, there's going to be a little bit of this battle back and forth because the end-user—the junior person—is going to say I'd really love to do this this way. I really like the software. I want to do this. The manager doesn't want to upset the apple cart, doesn't want to upset this person who works for them and says that's okay. You can use that. We'll do whatever makes you feel most comfortable.\n\nAfterward, they're starting to accumulate this data on this platform. This person may be the only person who knows how to get that data, how to access the platform, how to use that, how you transfer that data into the rest of the information that you're trying to use. If you have inmates running into the asylum, that problem gets magnified by every time someone does that. The complexity of the system with that many degrees of freedom turns into a nightmare.\n\nIt's funny because we talked about the freedom of being remote. The freedom of how you manage data has to be controlled. You can't have one without the other. Often, that's what usually happens. In an office, you can really control the environment. You can walk over to somebody's cubicle and say you better go and do this for me right now. I need this data right now in Excel or upload it in a CSV or whatever. Then, the person will be like, okay. I'll go do that. You can't do that if the person is working a thousand miles away, they're at home, or whatever. You have to rely on controls. If you're going to give people personal freedom, you have to have control over the way that data is generated and manipulated.\n\nBen: That's a very interesting point. Without that, nothing else works. That's great insight. I think on the flip side of that, as an individual contributor on a team, say, I'm someone with the boss, essentially, and I'm suddenly finding myself having to work remotely. I've never worked remotely before. No one else in the team has worked remotely before. What is the single most important thing that you think someone in that position can do to make that transition as successful as it possibly can be, both for themselves and for their organization?\n\nLars: I'm a little biased in this because I own a CRM company. I think the key to the success of any business—it doesn't matter if you're remote or if you're working in the office—is a solid CRM. A CRM that has all the data fully integrated, built into the platform.\n\nIf you have a marketing person that's working somewhere else and they're sending emails out, that data instantaneously gets back to the CRM and is used by other people in the marketing team, other people in the sales department, people doing customer service. You can call the contact and you can see a history of every interaction with that contact, every relationship, everything that's associated with that relationship.\n\nIf you're working in project development, you have to have a good project management system. If you're managing events, you have to have a good events management system. If you're an HR compliance or if you're trying to onboard and train new employees or even train existing customers or new customers, you need to have a learning management system that (again) is tied into the CRM. All of these components work together. If you have any of them that are off playing in the lead just doing their own thing, you've lost control of that data. Part of that is from a usability perspective.\n\nAs a senior manager or a boss, you have to see what's happening, but you also have to see how the other pieces play with each other. So, to define customer service, I can access all that other data. But then, you also have the IT department and how important it is to control your data, to know where it is, and from a privacy perspective, to know that your customers, that you're a good steward of your customer’s data because they trust you.\n\nSomeone is going to write you some amount of information about who they are. We do this all the time. We sign up for a product or service and we give them our email address, our phone number, maybe our social media information, our name, whatever it is. All that data is now held in that system. If that data then gets shared because you have inmates from the asylum or whatever, you've got a complicated system, you have other pieces of software, now you have to control the data, not only in one system but in 10. What happens if somebody leaves? What happens if somebody exports the data and you don't know if they exported that data? The more splits in the data, the more places that your data sits, the more vectors there are for the loss of that data.\n\nAs a business owner, as a boss, as a manager, C-level executive, wherever you are in the work corporate structure, even if you're a startup, you have to understand where that data is being stored. You have to understand how it's being used. You have to share it with the people who need to have it so that if you need someone to look up a contact record, you can see the history of every phone call that you ever had, every email they've ever opened, every meeting you ever had with them, every product demo, every video they've watched, every webpage, every project they've been associated with, all of that needs to be in one place so you can access it when you need it, and also to limit the ability of that data to just go flying off on its own if someone were to go walk in that data. That's where companies lose customers. They lose trust. In the longer run, that's one of those things that truly does impact both of your top and bottom line.\n\nAdding another tool to your marketing stack isn't always the solution to every problem, but I think in this case Lars is spot-on. If you don't have the right technology to facilitate effective remote work, then nothing else that you do is really going to matter. That's true no matter what tool or what type of software it is. If there's a gap, if there's something you really need and it's missing, that pain point is going to be felt much more sharply in a remote work environment that it would've been if you're all in a shared office space.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-84986\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/195_Lars-Podcast-Graphics_quote-04.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1361\" height=\"630\" />\n\nIt's equally important to have documented processes in place to make sure that your team can make the most of that technology. I think that believing that you can have one or the other but not both together in conjunction is a potentially ruinous mistake. Find the technology you need. Absolutely do that. But make sure that you are also helping your team understand how to use it. Now, back to Lars.\n\nIf someone was new to working remotely, they were just having to adapt everything with the way that they work and the way that they interact with their coworkers, maybe if they're feeling kind of lost in the sea of all that change, what would be the single most important thing that you would recommend that person do in order for them to be able to work from home successfully?\n\nLars: I think a lot of it comes down to structure. Again, it’s tied to the CRM, it's all connected. It doesn't matter at what level you are. You're part of a team that's generating information. You're generating content. Maybe you're generating statistics. Like you're saying, if you're developing content, maybe that content is for print. Maybe it's for email. Maybe it's for websites. Maybe it's for social media. Whatever you're doing, someone is managing the development of that content.\n\nPeople need to have structure to work. We all need to know what we are working towards. What's the overall goal? [...], why are we here? We need to know the why and we need to know the how. It depends on what kind of project, what kind of person, what kind of company. There may be varying degrees of directiveness that a manager has to have over their employees or their subordinates. If there needs to be a lot of direction to people, then you have a project management system put in place where there are many tasks that are laid out for them with deadlines. You can create your codependent tasks. You can do all the things that you need to build a liquid project management.\n\nIf there's a way to take other data that is related to that, that relates back to the CRM, make that part of that whole structure. It really comes down to providing structure. I think that's one of the things when people go to the office, they feel like there's a sense of structure. They feel like I'm walking into my office on this day. I'm clocking in. I'm going to be giving these tasks. I'm going to be told what to do. At the end of the day, I'll be done and I'll go home.\n\nWhen you work from home, you don't have quite the same physical structure. You have to replace that with a software-related type of a structure. Having a really good project management system, having a good CRM is something that flows to every single level, from the most junior person in the company all the way up to the senior management because you need to be able to roll that data up to a high level, get reported, and see we're working on these projects. What sort of utilization of percentages do we have? What's our overhead looking like? What's our expense ratio look like? All these different things related to actually executing. They tie into the rest of the way the business operates.\n\nWith people on remote it’s scattered all over the place, that software has to be the unifying thing that pulls them all together.\n\nBen: Sure. What are some of the top mistakes that you see companies make when they attempt to implement work from home policies? And how can those problems be avoided?\n\nLars: I think really it comes down (again) to a lack of structure and planning. I think that's what happened with a lot of companies when the pandemic hit because there was not a lot of warning. One week where everything's looking like it could be bad, then the next week everyone's told to go home. Everything from our education system, we have teachers that don't have the tools they need to teach remotely, to businesses where people were working remotely. They don't really know what to do, they're not really tracked. You've got all these issues that suddenly have to be resolved very, very, quickly. Unfortunately, it was a lot of these kinds of things that took planning to do it right.\n\nI think a lot of businesses did a knee jerk reaction and said, okay, we're going to get Zoom. We're going to get Microsoft teams. We're going to get Meet or whatever. We're going to have our meetings and talk. Those are important to have. It's good to have FaceTime. It's good to have people involved in some way to feel that interpersonal connection in the business.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-84987\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/195_Lars-Podcast-Graphics_quote-02.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1361\" height=\"630\" />\n\nOn the other side of that, you have to come up with the process and the structure to help people have a way to bound their day. What are they doing? How are they supposed to be doing all of it? Make sure that you have a maintained structure of management. Every business has people that do stuff and people that manage stuff. [...] obviously, but people have to know where they fit. And that takes planning.\n\nWhat I always tell companies to do and with our customers—we work with them when they come on board, set them up with the CRM and marketing automation systems—is before you even go down that road, have a good understanding of who your target market is. Know your market segment. Have your buyer personas defined. Look at your buyer’s journey and your process both from a buyer’s perspective and internal process.\n\nHave stuff written down. Documentation. It doesn't have to be complicated. It doesn't have to be super fancy or lots of flowery words or whatever. Just have it written down so that you can then translate that into an actual system, actual software. I would recommend using the CRM as the core for that and having all the pieces connect back to the CRM.\n\nThe last part is understanding your data model, understanding what data you are accumulating, how you are going to use it because as you go through this finder’s journey, you have to know how you're going to use that. If the number of likes, shares, reads, clicks, website visits, or whatever it is, impacts the business, make sure you have a way to collect that data and store it in a useful way.\n\nBen: That's all solid advice. That does it for all the questions I have prepared. Before I let you go, is there anything else on this topic you think could be important to throw out there or to share with our audience?\n\nLars: I think a manager has to be very aware of the personalities of the people that work around and underneath them. I was saying before, there's so much to a business that goes beyond software. It really has to do with understanding people, how they work, and I think that's very much a conversation. They don't work as well when you have this hammer approach ruled by fear kind of thing. It's about how you create an environment where the people who are in the company feel like they're part of a team, feel like they're heard, and feel like they're valued. I think that's really one of the important things when you're talking about creating a good company culture.\n\nIt's harder when people don't go to the office. It's harder to set the tone because you're not seeing them every day. I think that if every manager were to take a few minutes and think about each of the people they work with, think about their personalities, think about what really motivates them, even if it just means opening the door, having conversations, and saying hey, how are you doing, extended remote work can be hard. How did you feel? Is there anything we can do to make you feel better? Do you feel like you have enough structure in your day? Do you feel like you have enough tools to accomplish what you need to accomplish?\n\nSimple conversations like that go a long way. The more human-centric approach, especially now where we feel very isolated, goes a long way towards helping a company operate and just be more efficient and be happier. People like to feel valued and that's how we do that.\n\nBen: Absolutely. That's great advice. Thank you so much for coming on this show, and sharing your insight into making remote work actually work. Like I was saying before we actually jumped into the interview, even though we are a few months into the pandemic, I think this is really continuing to be something else at the top of a lot of people's minds right now.\n\nLars: Yes. It's definitely not going away. We're going to be in this situation for quite some time. Not that the pandemic is good or that anyone getting sick is good, but I think the direction that it's pushed our culture and our society as a whole has actually had some positive effects on it. There's less traffic, there's less impact on the environment, people are spending more time at home, there are more pet adoptions, things like that. The little things.\n\nWhen you have everyone starting to work from home, the positive impact can be really substantial. I'm a surfer. The idea of catching a wave, of how society is changing, take a look at where the direction the society is going and build your business around that. Catch the wave of how things are changing and make your company fit the culture that you want it to be. I think that, as leaders, we all set that. It doesn't matter if you're the CEO or a junior person. You have an impact on all of those things.\n\nI think the more we think long-term, we think more in terms of how we ride this wave in a way that can help our business grow, scale, provide us with advantages, and the quality of life we enjoy from being able to work remotely. Whether that means we're at home with our family and we're able to travel more, then those are all things that can impact both our lives, the company, and the people around us.\n\n<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/actionable-marketing-podcast/id1162659795\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-84982 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/195_Lars-Podcast-Graphics_CTA.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1361\" height=\"550\" /></a><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/the-two-things-every-remote-marketing-team-needs-to-succeed-and-how-to-bring-them-together-with-lars-helgeson-from-greenrope-amp-195/\">The Two Things Every Remote Marketing Team Needs to Succeed (And How to Bring Them Together) With Lars Helgeson From GreenRope [AMP 195]</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://coschedule.com\">CoSchedule Blog</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 13:00:00 +0000","feedId":4227,"bgimg":"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/195_Lars-Podcast-Graphics_header.png","linkMd5":"f807479dc6bb7f8d53415e5244a6f25c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn19@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-56-11-068_4f443a0fcf88775a.webp","destWidth":1361,"destHeight":581,"sourceBytes":135247,"destBytes":45086,"author":"Ben Sailer","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/195_Lars-Podcast-Graphics_header.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn19@2020_1/2020/08/24/21-56-11-068_4f443a0fcf88775a.webp","https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/195_Lars-Podcast-Graphics_quote-03.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn71@2020_2/2020/08/24/21-56-35-132_8df0a42a07ec95c7.webp","https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/195_Lars-Podcast-Graphics_quote-01.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn27@2020_2/2020/08/24/21-56-37-871_5b20a790c8be4857.webp","https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/195_Lars-Podcast-Graphics_quote-04.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn67@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-56-33-177_231f9e0fd0005266.webp","https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/195_Lars-Podcast-Graphics_quote-02.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn92@2020_6/2020/08/24/21-56-36-134_abf8aa6edeca9282.webp","https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/195_Lars-Podcast-Graphics_CTA.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn44@2020_3/2020/08/24/21-56-32-923_08fd85c35ba2886e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598306169466},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 05:56:09","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 05:56:09","title":"Making Sponsorships Successful By Picking the Right Partners With Ken Ungar From CHARGE [AMP 193]","link":"https://coschedule.com/?p=84027","description":"<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-84510\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/193_Ken-Podcast-Graphics_header.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1361\" height=\"581\" />\n\nWhat does it take to make sponsorships successfully work?

Welcome to the show.</span>\n\nKen: Ben, it's great to be here. Thank you.\n\nBen: Absolutely. Would you mind taking a moment to introduce yourself to our audience and explain what you do at CHARGE?\n\nKen: Sure. My name is Ken Ungar and I'm the president and founder of CHARGE. CHARGE is a sponsorship marketing agency. We help organizations unlock the power of sponsorship to help them accomplish their business objectives, whether that's revenue growth or image enhancement. Whatever they want sponsorship to do, we help them accomplish that.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-84524\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/193_Ken-Podcast-Graphics_quote-02.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1361\" height=\"630\" />\n\nBen: Very cool. If I'm a marketer, I'm listening to this episode, and I've never delved into sponsorships before, or just never really considered that being an avenue that I would consider going down, why should I consider sponsorships? If I'm either skeptical or unaware, what makes that an area of marketing that I should really strongly consider making part of my strategy?\n\nKen: That's a great question and it's obviously a question we get a lot. I'll start with defining some terms for everybody. A sponsorship is a type of marketing. It's a marketing platform. I know you're based in Fargo, North Dakota, so let's just say North Dakota State. North Dakota State, the Bisons are a property and they might give a brand or sponsor the right to speak to its audience (the property's audience), in exchange for a fee.\n\nJust boiling it down, that's what a sponsorship is. It happens that sponsorship is one of the most powerful marketing platforms for a couple of reasons. First, if you look at something like advertising. Now, advertising is a great marketing platform. It's obviously the most prolific and the most used marketing platform as defined by dollars.\n\nThe marketer in advertising has to convince the consumer that the marketer’s company, its product or service has a great image. It is the marketers speaking directly to the consumer, but the convincing that has to happen is the marketer has to convince the consumer.\n\nWith sponsorship, the positive image of the property—the case we used before, North Dakota State—the positive image of North Dakota State is transferred to the sponsor simply by virtue of the relationship.\n\nI'll use another example. I'm a baseball fan. I love the Chicago Cubs. If you love the Chicago Cubs by virtue of the sponsorship, you will love their sponsor. We call that effect transfer. But sometimes there's image transfer where if the Cubs or North Dakota State has a positive image, automatically the consumer's going to ascribe that positive image to the sponsor.\n\nIt's a lot more powerful than advertising in the sense that it's third-party validation. I, as a marketer, don't have to convince anybody of anything. Just by virtue of the relationship, the consumer feels better about the sponsor.\n\nBen: Sure. I think that's a pretty thorough explanation there. Our CEO, Garrett Moon, also happens to be a massive Cubs fan. I think he would appreciate hearing that for sure. Something that you touch on a little bit there is the idea of a sponsorship being a relationship. As it’s essential for any positive relationship of any sort, you need to really choose partners and collaborators wisely.\n\nLet's say I'm sold on sponsorships as a strategy or as a tactic. What would be the first thing that you would recommend that I do to identify potential partners that might really be strong candidates for my business to partner with?\n\nKen: That's a great question. In that respect, we usually advise people to start with one thing and I'm going to mention this a number of times during our discussion today, and that's the audience. A marketer knows his or her audience in terms of the customers of their brand and that's super important because the most important aspect in choosing a partner to sponsor is to understand their audience. In order for sponsorship to really work, there has to be a shared target audience.\n\nIf your consumers are ages 25–44, predominantly male, have a certain household income, from a psychographic perspective they like certain pursuits, certain hobbies, your audience and the property's audience have to match pretty much like a hand in glove. When that happens, that's when all the good impacts that we talked about earlier happen. The first thing you're going to do is you're going to identify a property that has the same or similar audience to you.\n\nThe next thing you're gonna do is look at a property. If you're a brand marketer, you're going to look at a property and you're going to say, what is the reputation of that property? Whether it's a Cubs, the North Dakota State Bisons, what is the reputation of that property? Because we talked about image transfer, that great reputation is going to be transferred to you as a brand.\n\nYou're going to want to find properties that share your values, that stand for the same things that you do, but potentially are more well-known because they're in sports, entertainment, music, or fine arts. Those two things start with the audience, and then understand the brand and the reputation of the property. Those are the two best things to get you started in terms of identifying a potential partner.\n\nBen: I think it makes a lot of sense to start with partners that have the same or similar audiences. I guess a follow-up question I would have to that is, do you have any advice on researching potential partners or sponsorships that can really also help you grow your own audience?\n\nI imagine if there is already some overlap there, there’s that thought of trying to use that to get in front of people who don't already know who you are. I imagine that might get a little bit complicated if you're speaking to the same people twice, so to speak, if they are already aware of you because your audiences do overlap so much.\n\nKen: Yeah, a great question. Let's break that down into its component parts. There's a difference between the audience being the same in terms of its demographics and psychographics and the size of the audience. Let's stick to professional sports. Probably about 75% of all sponsorship are in sports, either amateur youth, college, professional, and then the remaining part are in not-for-profits, museums, festivals, concerts, things of that nature. We'll stick with some sports examples and I'll stick with Cubs because I love the Cubs.\n\nLet's just say that they're a family-oriented brand, so their audience are families. If I'm a company and the audience for my customers, for my products, or services or also families, that's an alignment of the audience in terms of how it's composed, but the size is really different. I might be a smallish company, maybe I sell in only a certain part of the Chicago area, but the Cubs reach millions of families.\n\nNow, they're both family-oriented brands—the Cubs and this magical sponsor—but the Cubs are now opening the door to its significantly larger audience. Now, the company can convert many new customers, people who may not have heard of this company before by virtue of their association. That's one way that brand can grow is just by virtue of an introduction to a much bigger audience than that company could ordinarily reach by advertising or other means, digital advertising or otherwise.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-84526\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/193_Ken-Podcast-Graphics_quote-03.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1361\" height=\"630\" />\n\nBen: That makes a lot of sense. Let's say I've identified a potential sponsorship partner. In this hypothetical example, let's say I'm a mom-and-pop shop in the greater Chicago area, and I want to make a pitch to the Chicago Cubs for why I should be considered a partner to start a partnership program. In a case like that, I'm a lot smaller, as you said, than the Cubs. I imagine my pitch to the marketing department within the Cubs organizations, I probably got to be pretty compelling.\n\nHow would you advise a marketer in that sort of situation? Or maybe some business owner who's taking on a marketing function? How would you advise them to make that pitch and really make a strong first impression, to maybe tilt the odds in their favor of that interaction going positively?\n\nKen: Let's look at that question from two perspectives. I'll give you two scenarios. One is a property trying to sell a sponsor and buying that sponsorship and then I'll flip it, then it's a sponsor, a company, that wants to use a property to extend its brand. I'll look at it from both perspectives.\n\nIn the first one, I'm a mom-and-pop hamburger shop. I'm not McDonald's. Maybe I have a few restaurants, but now I want to convince the mighty Chicago Cubs that I want to be their sponsor. The first thing we mentioned before, the audience. If the Cubs or another organization like that is a family-oriented brand, that small hamburger shop is going to demonstrate that it has the same audience every Friday night. You can find all the families in the neighborhood at that hamburger shop. They support families throughout the neighborhood, they do all these things, that their brand is a family brand. Right there, you're showing that that audience is the same.\n\nBut next, that hamburger shop would want to understand the Chicago Cubs and understand what its goals are. It might be a professional sports organization that wants to maximize the amount of money that it gets from potential sponsors. In that case, that mom and pop hamburger shop might not be able to help them because they don't have the resources of a McDonald's. But they might have other things that would benefit the Cubs.\n\nFirst, it's authenticity. That might be something that the Cubs want to align with authentic brands, that it's not necessary for them to align with multinational corporations like McDonald's. But instead, they want to really demonstrate they're all about families, so their sponsors are family-oriented businesses and that is authentic.\n\nUnderstanding where the Cubs are coming from, and their goals, and how they market their brand, that's what a sponsor wants to think about in terms of what's in it for the property. That's kind of an example of that from the small sponsor, large property perspective. Let's flip that.\n\nNow a Double-A baseball team or Single-A baseball team wants to convince McDonald's. McDonald's needs to sponsor that particular small baseball team. Same process. Number one is the audience. The audience has to be the same. McDonald's is a family-oriented brand, so that baseball team needs to demonstrate that family orientation. But then, that property, in the case of the small baseball team, they need to understand McDonald's objectives and help McDonald's achieve what it wants to do.\n\nIn this case, it might be that in the geography where that team plays, McDonald's is not the strongest hamburger chain or not the strongest quick service restaurant in the area. But this small baseball team has a really loyal following. Again, Sunday afternoon, every Monday night, the entire community can be found at their ballpark enjoying the game.\n\nWhat could be in it for McDonald's is that they're going to get greater penetration in a certain geographic area because it aligns with this smaller, yes, but very popular property in the area. Again, the audience is aligned, but understanding both marketing objectives, in this case, the large sponsor that's McDonald's, creating that win-win marketing attitude, that's in terms of creating a pitch, either attracting a sponsor or selling a sponsor. That's what you want to keep in mind.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-84527\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/193_Ken-Podcast-Graphics_quote-04.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1361\" height=\"630\" />\n\nBen: That makes a lot of sense. I really appreciate how you can take a look at that from both perspectives. I think there are a lot of important considerations there for both sides to keep in mind.\n\nKen: That's another important aspect of sponsorship, is it's definitely a two-way street. It works for both because it's a relationship. It's not the marketers speaking to the consumer. These are two institutions talking to each other by virtue of their relationship. They're creating magic for both. In the case the baseball team sells more tickets, the sponsor gets more business or enhances its brand, and that's because it's a relationship. It's got to be seen from both sides.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-84528\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/193_Ken-Podcast-Graphics_quote-01.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1361\" height=\"630\" />\n\nThe best sponsorships that I see are when there's that win-win, that both sides benefit from it and the worst that I see is either no one cares to work the relationship—if nothing is invested, nothing is gained—or there really isn't any activity between the two in terms of really making that relationship come to life.\n\nBen: Whether you're looking to place some signage at a local sports stadium or maybe work with a top-performing Twitch streamer or whatever type of sponsorship opportunity you might be looking at, success always starts by putting the audience first. A key point that Ken makes, though, that you need to consider is not only the similarities and audiences between your brand and your partner but the size of your own audience relative to theirs as well.\n\nWhether you're a small sponsor looking to partner with big brands or a large sponsor looking to work with smaller brands, I love what Ken has to say about finding ways to make sure that those relationships can benefit both parties without the pitch of looking lopsided right from the start.\n\nI think what's great about that too is how much it reveals about the potential value of sponsorships in general because if you're a small brand, it's tough to imagine too many other channels that can scale as effectively. For larger brands, there’s an opportunity in a lot of ways to demonstrate your values and maybe to connect on a closer level with your audience and with your potential consumers than what might be possible otherwise.\n\nIt is as Ken says, a two-way street and that's really the way that you have to think about it. Now, back to Ken.\n\nOnce a partnership program is up and running, let's say McDonald’s and the Single-A baseball team in town are hitting it off, or it's a local chain that's landed. There's this big deal with the Chicago Cubs. What should those companies be doing or keeping in mind to ensure that they are proactively fostering that relationship in order to make sure that it really is mutually beneficial in the long term success rather than just like a one-off transactional sort of thing that just fizzles out and doesn't really provide results?\n\nKen: This is a really important point. What I recommend to everyone is strategy, planning, and work, work, work. Because it's a relationship, you go in with certain expectations. What we find is that the mere fact of the association doesn't necessarily make it work.\n\nIf I'm the official sponsor of your podcast, it may not work for me to just say that I'm the official sponsor of your podcast. What I want to do is create an entire plan around that to do what we call either leveraging or activating the relationship. That takes many forms and there's a strategy behind it. There's obviously plans behind it and there's a lot of work. I'll give you some examples of that.\n\nLet's stick with McDonald's and the small baseball team. They're going to activate it in a lot of different ways. From a physical perspective, they're probably going to put signs in the ballpark that McDonald's is the official sponsor of this baseball team. They're going to put things on displays, jumbotrons, and public address announcement reads. All these different things to announce to the audience that, yes, McDonald's is the sponsor of this team and is proud to do so.\n\nBut the audiences really want to know about authenticity and they want to know why McDonald’s wants to sponsor this baseball team. So McDonald’s is going to do things from a public relations and an audience relations perspective to demonstrate that they wanted to be involved with this baseball team because they wanted to make sports a better experience for this audience. They wanted to do something to improve this community, to improve entertainment opportunities, to provide more access to quality entertainment in the community.\n\nThey're going to do various things that you see sponsors do. They might provide premiums or giveaways. Free baseball bats with the McDonald's logo on it, or free hats, free sunscreen. Do all kinds of things for the audience. Maybe free Wi-Fi that enhances the audience’s experience. From a public relations perspective, there are plans that go in to make activating or leveraging that relationship.\n\nThere may be television commercials where McDonald's is going to tag at the end of its commercial that it is the official sponsor of this particular baseball team. It might help them advertise. They might have premium giveaways, like if there are two home runs at a certain game, bring your ticket stub in and you get 25% off on your next Big Mac.\n\nThere are all these different things that go into activating a relationship. It takes that strategy like, how am I going to really speak to this audience, planning to pull it all together. Email marketing, inbound marketing, there might be a variety of different things, and then there's the work. There is work to make this relationship come alive. But again, that's to get all that benefit that I talked about, to grow your business, to improve your image. Once you do those things, you get those great outcomes.\n\nBen: Those are all the things that companies should be doing to make sure that they're putting in the effort into those relationships to make them successful. On the flip side, are there any common sponsorship, marketing mistakes that you sometimes see that you can offer any advice on how to avoid? What are the common pitfalls that people get tripped up on, that they should be mindful of going into any sponsorship-type arrangement?\n\nKen: I think there are three things that I have people keep in mind. First, you're not going to be surprised. I've used this word a lot in this discussion and that's the audience, knowing your audience. If you're a brand, you need to really understand your customer. You should if you're a really good marketer; you already know that. But to have that really front of mind from a demographic, psychographic perspective, to really know what makes your customer tick.\n\nIf you're property—let's just say that Single-A or Double-A baseball team—it's for you to really understand your audience. Sometimes that's harder. We find with smaller properties, for example, that they don't necessarily have the marketing resources to really understand their customer the way that McDonald's does. A company like that knows everything about their customer.\n\nWe find a lot of properties. Sometimes they struggle a bit, but they shouldn't have to struggle because there are relatively easy ways to avoid this pitfall. One of the things we recommend is surveying, so they can survey their email list. They can survey before an event, they can survey at an event, or they could survey after.\n\nA lot of times, we find that email marketing is the key to this. There are even free resources. Things like a free account on SurveyMonkey or even just one step up to get their paid account. There are survey templates all over the place about how to survey your audience and get some good baseline data. Find out how old they are. Find out how much—if they will share with you—what's their household income. Find out things like do you intend to buy a car in the next 6–12 months? If you understand those things about your audience, then all of a sudden car companies and auto dealerships might be more interested in aligning with you if they know that your significant audience is ready to buy a new car in the next 6–12 months up.\n\nFind out things that they care about. Hobbies, camping, video games, playership, all these different things. But the more that you can survey as a property and find that out, wow, you've got some incredible ammunition. The pitfall is not doing that. We see properties just go to a sponsor and go, here, I've got these three packages: gold, silver, and bronze. It costs $100,000, $50,000, and $25,000. We're going to give you these things, and not understand what audiences both parties are talking to. Avoid that first pitfall.\n\nSecond is not activating the sponsorship. We find that sometimes, especially in a little bit of larger sponsorship, some sponsors think hey, I've got it covered. I just spent $100,000 or $50,000. I just spent money on what's called a rights fee—that is the money that you pay to a property for the right to use their logo, to use their name—that I have paid money. I now have the right to use it and I'm all set. I'm not going to do anything else because now I have the right to use the logo.\n\nWe talked about before, if you don't activate, leverage that relationship, and really communicate to that audience of the property why you're proud to be a sponsor, the benefits you're conferring, all these different things, you never bring the sponsorship to life.\n\nYou're really, in that case, depending on that property, that baseball team (for example) to advertise your presence and for the audience to accidentally find out that you're a sponsor. The second pitfall is companies that don't activate. They just buy the rights. And what we say is if you're at the front of the relationship. For some of your listeners who have never done this before, we talk about a minimum ratio of either 0.5:1 or 1:1 of rights fees to the amount you spend on leverage or activation.\n\nFor example, if you spend a dollar to become the official sponsor of a baseball team, you want to spend at least a dollar in activating it, whether it's the premiums you give away, or email marketing that you do, the inbound marketing, or all these different things that you do, you want to do at least $1 of rights to $1 of activation.\n\nIf in the front of the relationship, the sponsorship costs you $50,000 and you're like, whoa, that's my budget. I don't have any other money, don't do it. If you only have $50,000 as a budget to activate this relationship, then divide that by two. I can only afford to buy the relationship for $25,000 because I need to keep at least $25,000 to bring it to life. The second pitfall is not activating.\n\nThen the third is not measuring. It's interesting, 80% of sponsors that you ask would say one of the most important things in the sponsorship relationship is to measure success. But then you find the same surveys will tell you that they only dedicate 3%–6% of their entire budget to measure it.\n\nThey all say how important it is, but they never measure enough. Not measuring success is the third pitfall, because if you fail to plan, you plan to fail in the sense that you're going to spend all this money. If you're a marketer, the CEO or the president is going to come to you and say hey, I saw that sponsorship. It looked good on TV. But what did it get us? As a marketer, it's incumbent upon us to measure results.\n\nHow do we avoid that pitfall? Determine what success looks like. If you're a brand, are you going into it for sales lift? If you are, measure your sales before the sponsorship, measure your sales during, and measure after.\n\nIf you're looking for image enhancement, you're probably going to do that through surveys. So you're going to survey before, you're going to survey during, and you're going to survey after to demonstrate because then, when your CEO comes to you, you go, hey, boss. Look, we have a 25% lift in awareness. We have a 30% lift in purchase consideration and all these great metrics is a result of this sponsorship. So don't you think that it was money well spent? That's the third pitfall. Failing to measure for success, so make sure you measure.\n\nBen: I think that last point applies to so many areas of marketing. I feel like it's very easy to get caught up in the excitement of doing stuff and not spend so much time looking at things like, well, I did that. It probably worked. Actually, taking a look and analyzing what happened and why as a result of your actions.\n\nKen: I have quite a few clients who are engineers. So I kept this all the time because in their world, if you can't measure it, it doesn't happen. If you can't use a formula, you can't do it. They look at us as marketers and sometimes there's all this magic that goes on behind the scenes or when someone asks, hey, you did an advertisement but did it really work?\n\nEspecially now, especially in the digital age, it's so incumbent upon us to measure and really demonstrate that here is the result of what we do, and here's how we can prove it. Sponsorship is no different, but the great thing is, if you do it, you can then form a strategy perspective, make it even better because from what you've done, you know what the results are from your activity.\n\nBen: Absolutely. So one last question I'll throw your way. I think that this is something that would be very pertinent to anything with sponsorships or advertising, but I think that this also applies to a lot of different areas in marketing.\n\nLet's say that you are working with a client or you are working for a boss or a business owner who's a little bit skeptical of marketing in general because they're maybe of the mindset that there's got to be a clear process or an action you take that drives this really predictable outcome. Like with engineers. I imagine in their world they follow a schematic. They can see that process from start to finish, and in the end, they have a concrete product or a result of their actions so that they can point to saying like, I did this and then this happened.\n\nWhereas with marketers, as you say, there's this perception that we just kind of go behind the curtain and a bunch of magic happens and then money gets made somehow. That's what it looks like to them. When in reality, if you're doing your job correctly, there's a lot of strategic thought, a lot of processes, and a lot of repeatable methodologies that go into making that work.\n\nTo bring this back to our topic here of talking about sponsorships, if you're trying to convince a stakeholder who is skeptical, that sponsorships are a good idea or that you can honestly measure the impact of what you're doing, measurement means showing data and all of that after you've done some things that are super important.\n\nBut let's say that if you're getting stuck on not being able to get started because you can't pass that barrier with somebody, because they're like, well, I'm not going to put money into this if you can't do a better job of explaining how this is all going to work upfront. If someone's in that position, how would you advise that they make the case?\n\nKen: We see that often especially when the boss or the CEO does not necessarily have a marketing background. They might approach it with a bit of skepticism which, hey, skepticism in business is a good thing. It's incumbent upon us to prove it. The way I approach it is there are two things, case studies and testimonials.\n\nDon't trust me. I'm here telling your boss that if we do this type of activity, you'll get this kind of result. Don't trust me. Trust all these organizations that are independent third parties. This is a case of third-party validation which we find in marketing always is more persuasive than if we say it. Bring them case studies and testimonials.\n\nI'll give you an example. When I was on the property side, I used to work for the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and the IndyCar Series back in the day. We had an aerospace sponsor and that aerospace sponsor was selling private jets.\n\nIt was a pretty target-rich environment because anywhere you look, there was a race car driver who makes millions of dollars a year or a race team owner who is a millionaire or a billionaire, and all of them want to fly in private jets. There is a sponsor who had exclusive access because they were the exclusive aerospace sponsor and they will tell you, there is a case study that for every dollar they spent on the sponsorship, they got $32 back in terms of the sales they made directly related to the sponsorship.\n\nThat's an example from a sales perspective. You bring in that case study and you go, hey, boss. I can't necessarily prove to you or guarantee a 32 to 1 return on investment, but I can guarantee that this technique, that sponsorship can provide this kind of return on investment. We just have to go in and we have to see. Or you find a case study in your industry that gets closer to the potential ROI that you would have. Or a testimonial.\n\nWhen properties want to sell sponsors, they might reference other sponsors. You might have your CEO call the CEO of a current sponsor and ask them, hey, what's been your experience in the sponsorship? Have you sold more stuff? Has your image been enhanced? Is this property good to work with? And the other CEO says, oh, yeah. They've been fantastic.\n\nAgain, I recommend those two different cases of third-party validation to demonstrate, listen, these are the results that others are getting. Can't promise that we'll get them, but I can promise you the technique works.\n\nBen: I think that's great advice. That's really bringing it back to just the fundamentals with testimonials and case studies. I love it.\n\nThat's all I had for you, but before I let you go, were there any other lingering thoughts or anything else that you've got on your mind as it pertains to this topic, that you'd maybe like to share with our audience?\n\nKen: Obviously, I'm a true believer in sponsorship because I know it works and I know the power of it, especially in terms of things like image transfer and all those things that really help sponsors take their businesses to the next level.\n\nOne thing is I just recommend listeners to not be afraid of it. If they're uninitiated, they just haven't experienced it before. There are lots of ways to put your toe in the water. For example, on our website at chargesponsorship.com, in the insight section. We have dozens and dozens of blogs, ebooks, and all these different things, completely free, kind of help people get started, help them get a toe in the water.\n\nThere are books. We have one coming out next month called Sponsorship Strategy: Practical Approaches to Powerful Sponsorships. That's a $24.99 way to get your feet wet and understand it. But really, it's kind of to educate yourself a little, seek out a professional like our agency if you need one, but really try it.\n\nThere is an old expression: “Try it, you'll like it.” Our parents used to tell us that. Dip your toe in the water. Get some experience. It is a valuable addition to us to a marketer's tool belt if you don't already do it.\n\n<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/actionable-marketing-podcast/id1162659795?mt=2\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-84348 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/192_Jim-Podcast-Graphics_CTA.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1361\" height=\"550\" /></a><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/making-sponsorships-successful-by-picking-the-right-partners-with-ken-ungar-from-charge-amp-193/\">Making Sponsorships Successful By Picking the Right Partners With Ken Ungar From CHARGE [AMP 193]</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://coschedule.com\">CoSchedule Blog</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 14 Jul 2020 13:00:00 +0000","feedId":4227,"bgimg":"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/193_Ken-Podcast-Graphics_header.png","linkMd5":"b18606823d1dfdb5f17881a3ec853473","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn52@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-56-11-028_8f3308747844c828.webp","destWidth":1361,"destHeight":581,"sourceBytes":131632,"destBytes":36178,"author":"Ben Sailer","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/193_Ken-Podcast-Graphics_header.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn52@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-56-11-028_8f3308747844c828.webp","https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/193_Ken-Podcast-Graphics_quote-02.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn67@2020_6/2020/08/24/21-56-25-290_22aea137e941f481.webp","https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/193_Ken-Podcast-Graphics_quote-03.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn95@2020_3/2020/08/24/21-56-26-645_15d642eaa3b4519e.webp","https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/193_Ken-Podcast-Graphics_quote-04.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn51@2020_5/2020/08/24/21-56-28-410_6f6e83a048b8f79d.webp","https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/193_Ken-Podcast-Graphics_quote-01.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn60@2020_2/2020/08/24/21-56-25-507_6a033a5d7e3a81a6.webp","https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/192_Jim-Podcast-Graphics_CTA.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn76@2020_6/2020/08/24/21-56-26-981_e291f8d82725af71.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598306169469},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 05:56:09","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 05:56:09","title":"Digital Asset Management: The Complete Non-Boring Guide For Marketers","link":"https://coschedule.com/?p=82586","description":"<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-84249 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/digital-asset-management-header.png\" alt=\"Digital asset management guide for marketers header.\" width=\"1361\" height=\"581\" /> \n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Have you ever searched endlessly for that one elusive marketing asset? </span> Maybe it’s a new version of a logo your coworker needs to add to your redesigned website, or a chart for a presentation that you literally need RIGHT NOW. \n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">You decide to go on a hunt for that treasured asset.</span> One that leads you through tangled webs of randomly named files, images, videos, you name it.

This could include the ability to attach documents to client accounts or help individuals access a web-based content library. [Tweet \"Most software options that are designed for businesses include some kind of file storage option.\"] These integrated file management solutions are pretty primitive compared to the functionality you will get from a full-fledged DAM platform. You also might be thinking… Why can’t I just use OneDrive, Dropbox, or Google Drive? These tools do help overcome hurdles to file sharing, but they don’t provide in-depth features like advanced search capabilities and version control. Which, in turn, don’t really solve the problems companies face when trying to improve ROI on their assets and breakdown silos. Here are some common functionalities of DAM software solutions. \n<h3>Ability to Manage Metadata</h3> Much like metadata provided to search engines, DAM metadata is information that provides details about the asset’s contents. Metadata can describe many different details about the file, including who owns it, who has rights to access the file, keywords associated with the document, etc. \n<h3>Ability to Track and Record Version History</h3> How many times have you encountered a document saved as Sales_Slide_Deck_Final_Final2_Final-FOR-REAL \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-84252 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/asset-final-copy.png\" alt=\"Faux final copy of a document.\" width=\"1361\" height=\"729\" /> Or something similar. There’s nothing more frustrating, as a marketing team member, to think this is the final revision just to have another stakeholder come in and make additional changes — totally messing up the naming convention you had going. As a non-marketing team member, it's also frustrating trying to find a document and encountering that each designer has a different way of naming their files, or finding that they haven’t bothered to upload it to the shared drive, and the asset is saved on their desktop. One of the major strengths of digital asset management software is that it syncs changes in real-time, while also keeping reversion history and the ability to revert back if needed. [Tweet \"Digital asset management software syncs changes in real-time, while also keeping reversion history and the ability to revert back.\"] \n<h3>Advanced Search Capabilities</h3> A cloud storage solution, like Dropbox, is usually limited to retrieving files based on searching for the document’s title. Honestly, who can remember the name of that document from last year? With custom metadata, keywords, categories, and more, you can make sure that the right files will always show up — regardless if you know the file name or not. \n<h3>Security and Customer Usage Rights</h3> Let’s say you want some people to have full editing access to certain documents and not others, or certain images are reserved for the use of specific departments. DAM software sets clear details about which departments can access and edit each document. \n<strong><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/?p=82586#toc\">Back to the Top</a></strong> \n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Download Our Digital Asset Management Template Bundle</span></h2> Before we dive into the depths of DAM, download our helpful digital asset management bundle.

What exactly do you need to start implementing DAM? We have six starting points that’ll help you successfully get your marketing assets in order. Begin with these steps to start building your own DAM process. \n<h3>1. Audit the Content You Already Have</h3> By taking stock of the assets you have, you’ll better understand how you should structure your new DAM system and which files will need to be updated. We included a \n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Content Audit Template </span>in our bundle to help you easily audit your assets. Download it — if you haven’t already! \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/getting-started-with-digital-asset-management/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Getting Started With Digital Asset Management for Marketers</a>\n</div> Before you implement a digital asset management tool, you’ll want to get a better understanding of what content you already have. This helps you clear out outdated content, gives you a laundry list of things that need to be updated, and an idea of how to structure the metadata for your new DAM platform. In the content upgrade above, you’ll find a Content Audit Template Spreadsheet. \n<img class=\"drop-shadow alignnone\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/18b0000b-6f0e-44e1-94b8-5ea191ad5c74_Screenshot202019-07-172013.49.49.png\" alt=\"Content audit template spreadsheet.\" width=\"1327\" height=\"480\" /> Here’s how you use it. Begin filling out the columns. Add the title of the document, who produced it, who it was produced form, etc. Here’s what it will look like as you start. \n<img class=\"drop-shadow alignnone\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/bafb51e5-4389-4433-adfb-c1e3644b7d5e_Screenshot202019-07-172013.56.35.png\" alt=\"DAM content audit spreadsheet.\" width=\"1361\" height=\"215\" /> As you start your DAM content audit, be on the lookout for the following items: \n<ol> \n <li>Is the asset professional looking and on-brand?</li> \n <li>Is it supporting your business objectives?</li> \n <li>Does it need to be updated in anyway?</li> \n</ol> \n<h3><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\">2. Add Up the Cost of All That Wasted Time (Hint: It’s <em>E</em></span><em><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\">xpensive</span></em><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\">)</span></h3> Digital assets are often duplicated or re-created due to the inability of users to find what they need. This wastes precious time and resources. [Tweet \"Digital assets are often duplicated or re-created due to the inability of users to find what they need.\"] Here’s how to calculate the cost of duplicating work. Say you have 5,000 assets and 5% of them, on average, are re-created or duplicated due to inefficient file storage. This means that every year, approximately 250 resources are unnecessarily duplicated. Now, let’s say that your designer’s salary broken down to an hourly wage is about $25/hour and it takes them approximately 2 hours to re-create assets. This amounts to $12,500 lost per year. \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-84253 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/calculate-cost.png\" alt=\"Calculate cost of duplicating assets.\" width=\"1361\" height=\"924\" /> \n<h3>3. Reduce Time Wasted Searching for Documents</h3> Team members spend a huge amount of time each day searching for information. When they can’t find what they’re looking for, they interrupt someone else to help them, which wastes additional resources. Here’s how to calculate those costs. Say you have 20 users who need to find assets and it takes them 10 minutes per day trying to find what they’re looking for. This means the team spends approximately 16 hours per week looking for things. This is 832 hours per year or about 41 hours per person per year. That’s a full week of work wasted every year. Now, let’s say that the average hourly wage of that team of 20 is $20/hour. This amounts to $16,640 lost per year. \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-84254 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/search-for-documents.png\" alt=\"Calculate the cost of the time wasted searching for lost documents.\" width=\"1361\" height=\"923\" /> \n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">With just these two things alone, the example company will save over $29,000/year. That’s not to mention the additional productivity created through time-saving.</span> \n<h3>4. Check in with your stakeholders</h3> If your company is planning on implementing a new DAM process, it’ll likely be used by other people and teams across your organization. In addition to sharing the cost above with essential stakeholders, check in with them to determine a DAM solution that works for everybody. Start with people like the Head of Technology and Head of Finance. \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/digital-asset-management-software/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How to Get Better ROI on Your Marketing Assets With Digital Asset Management Software</a>\n</div> \n<h3>5.

Agencies</span></h3> \n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Before DAM:</span>&nbsp;Agency marketers juggle a lot of clients--and a ton of files for each of those clients. Time is money, but there’s no quick way to find and distribute the right versions of those assets to the right people. \n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">After DAM: </span>With functional file naming and organizing, agency marketers always know where to find each asset for each client.

Colleges and Universities</span></h3> \n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Before DAM: </span>Marketers in higher ed need to create materials for many departments at once while maintaining overall brand consistency. A catalog of hundreds of photos and videos is needed to connect with students, staff, and alumni, but is nearly impossible to manage. \n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">After DAM:</span>&nbsp;With one place to store their entire collection of assets, marketers can easily divide them among folders for each department or campaign. And because&nbsp;they’re so easy to sort and share across departments, the assets stay totally on-brand. \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-84258 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/schools.png\" alt=\"What colleges and universities look like after DAM.\" width=\"1361\" height=\"1165\" /> \n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">3. In-House Marketing Teams</span></h3> \n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Before DAM:</span>&nbsp;Marketers at tech companies can experience frustrating silos between teams. The latest assets can get lost in the shuffle between marketing, sales, and support teams, and customers can be misled by inaccurate versions of files. \n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">After DAM:</span>&nbsp;Sharing assets internally between teams is a breeze, so everyone has access to the latest product photos or marketing collateral. Because&nbsp;they’re used more effectively, these assets help marketers boost their ROI. \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-84259 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/tech-companies.png\" alt=\"What tech companies look like after DAM.\" width=\"1361\" height=\"1165\" /> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/?p=82586#toc\">Back to the Top</a></strong>\n</div> \n<a name=\"dig\"></a> \n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">How </span><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">T</span><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">o Dig Deeper Into </span><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Digital Asset Management Vendors</span></h2> At this point, you might be thinking that using a DAM tool sounds like a pretty great option.

I know I have. It’s a daunting task to get words out when you have \n<em>no idea</em> what you want to write.

How’d you get started in your career? How'd you get to where you are today?</h3> Answering this question is a great way for your followers to catch up on your journey. Share everything with them. You might just touch someone's life and nudge them in a direction toward achieving their goals. \n<h3>2. List and embed videos that deal with your niche.</h3> For example, if you were a blogger, you could put together a list of 20 actionable videos on how to be a more amazing blogger. Think of useful and helpful videos that will make your readers better at what they do. \n<h3>3. Compile a good list of posts and links that are focused on one topic.</h3> Say you'd want to write up a post on how to do social media management. You'd find the most actionable links and tag them in a \n<a href=\"http://coschedule.com/blog/types-of-blog-posts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">list formatted blog post</a>. \n<h3>4. What marketing tips didn’t work for you?</h3> It's always good to know what worked, but there are many things that don't work. Why don't you share them so no one else makes the same mistakes? \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/sales-campaign-ideas-templates/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Best Sales Campaign Ideas &amp; Templates to Increase Your Revenue</a>\n</div> \n<h3>5. Write out a list of FAQs.</h3> Are you asked tons of questions? If so, write them down and answer them. If you haven't been asked any questions, think up the things that people would probably ask about your product or service. What things could be an issue that people might need more clarity on? \n<h3>6. Take an unrelated topic and tie it to your field.</h3> Take something that has nothing to do with your career and turn it into something that has something to do with your career. I once wrote a guest post where I wrote about \n<a href=\"http://thewritepractice.com/its-complicated/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">being in a complicated relationship with my characters</a> (I write fiction in addition to blogging). I basically compared writing characters to complicated relationships/friendships. It was super fun to write. Think about how you can apply this to your own writing. \n<h3>7. Pitch an influencer to guest post on their blog.</h3> Guest posting is such a great way to get more followers and build authority. Just make sure that when you pitch influencers, you put your best foot forward. \n<div class=\"callout\">\n <b>Recommended Reading:</b> \n <a href=\"http://coschedule.com/blog/content-marketing-guest-blogging/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">25 Lessons From Guest Blogging For the Top Blogs In the World</a>\n</div> \n<h3>8. What sets your blog/business apart from your competitors?</h3> Sometimes, it can be scary when your competitors' websites look way more amazing than your own. Maybe they are better at social media than you. Maybe they have a bigger team than you, which makes it easier to create more or do more. \n<div class=\"callout\"> \n <strong>Steps to take:</strong> \n <ul> \n  <li>Take a good look at your competitors' blogs.</li> \n  <li>Write down their strengths and weaknesses.</li> \n  <li>Take a look at your blog.</li> \n  <li>What are your strengths and weaknesses? If you feel like you can't answer these questions without being biased, ask a friend in your niche or even a blog reader.</li> \n  <li>How can you be better at your strengths while also covering your competitors' weaknesses?</li> \n </ul> \n</div> \n<h3>9. What is the most creative way someone has used your product?</h3> Working at CoSchedule, I've actually met some people online who have told me they've used our \n<a href=\"http://coschedule.com/headline-analyzer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">headline analyzer</a> to write titles and chapter names for their books. I'd say that's a pretty creative way to use the tool, so it's a blog idea that could help others. Do you have a product? If so, what is a creative way people have used it? \n<h3>10. Profile a few readers and/or customers.</h3> Interview them. You might just learn something new about your blog or business. \n<h3>11. How do you use social media for growing traffic and sales?</h3> Share how you've used social media to grow traffic and sales. This is a topic that many people are interested in as a way to grow their own blogs and businesses, so if you have great tips, share them all. \n<h3>12. Create an ultimate guide.</h3> Write up an ultimate guide to something in your industry. Teach people the tricks of the trade, and they'll be super thankful. \n<h3>13. What is the best part of what you do?</h3> Tell your readers everything. Why do you love what you do? \n<h3>14. Do a Q&amp;A interview with your team.</h3> Write a list of questions and send it to the people on your team. This will help your readers and customers feel like they know \n<em>who</em> is behind the product. \n<h3>15. Recently hire new employees? How'd you come to the decision to hire them?</h3> Share characteristics and qualities that business owners or entrepreneurs should look for when hiring their team. [Tweet \"Share characteristics and qualities that business owners or entrepreneurs should look for when hiring their team.\"] \n<h3>16. Write a manifesto.</h3> \n<a href=\"http://goinswriter.com/how-to-spread-your-ideas-write-a-manifesto/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jeff Goins</a> said: \n<blockquote>\n A manifesto is a great way to condense your message into a short, all-encompassing format. If you’ve written it well, they will get a fuller understanding of your core message, which you may have been trying to communicate for years.\n</blockquote> \n<div class=\"callout\"> \n <strong>Pull your manifesto together:</strong> \n <ul> \n  <li>What is my message?</li> \n  <li>What do I want people to know?</li> \n  <li>Why is my message important?</li> \n </ul> \n</div> \n<div class=\"callout\">\n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/?p=59821#top\">Choose Other Blog Ideas.</a>\n</div> \n<a name=\"creative\"></a> \n<h2>Creative Blog Post Ideas</h2> \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-84096 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/06/creative-blog-post-ideas.png\" alt=\"Creative blog post ideas\" width=\"1361\" height=\"1737\" /> &nbsp; \n<h3>17. Do a (number) by a (certain age) post.</h3> Have you ever heard of \"My 30 by 30\" posts? These are really cool and help readers see into your life and business by showing your personality and uniqueness. Think of this blog idea as a bucket list before you or your business reaches a certain age. \n<h3>18. Put together a gif-filled post.</h3> Everyone loves gifs. Put together a post and use gifs for the images. Gifs have a way of adding humor and energy to posts in a way that images and graphics can't. You could also make your own with \n<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/boomerang-from-instagram/id1041596399?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Boomerang</a>. \n<h3>19. What would you love to learn how to do?</h3> Share pictures and what you'd like to learn, then go out and try that thing. Share an update of your experience with your followers. \n<h3>20. Write a parody post of some sort.</h3> Bringing humor into a post can be good. It's always fun to make people laugh. I once did a \n<a href=\"http://devinberglund.com/deal-with-critics-taylor-swift-style-writers-edition/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">parody post with Taylor Swift's song, \"Shake It!\"</a> and I tied writing into it. It was a lot of fun! \n<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/nbFKffZFdXSeI/giphy.gif\" alt=\"Taylor Swift gif.\" width=\"400\" height=\"225\" /> \n<h3>21. Set up a contest on your blog.</h3> After doing the giveaway or competition on your blog, share the results. Did it turn out, or was it a dud? \n<div class=\"callout\"> \n <strong>Set up your own contest.</strong> \n <ul> \n  <li>What is your goal? Have a clear goal in mind. Do you want more email subscribers or buying customers? More social media followers?</li> \n  <li>What kind of content do you want to have? Think about whether it will be a <a href=\"http://www.problogger.net/archives/2011/09/20/run-an-awesome-blog-contest-in-5-steps/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">skills or challenge contest</a>.</li> \n </ul> \n</div> \n<h3>22. Use questions on forums as blog ideas.</h3> Have you ever spent time on websites, like \n<a href=\"https://www.quora.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Quora</a>? There are so many people asking questions that you can use for new blog ideas. Once you've written your answer in blog post format, go back to the question on&nbsp;Quora and leave a comment that answers the question. It's helpful, and it could also bring some traffic back to your blog. \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/marketing-campaign-ideas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How to Generate Awesome Data-Backed Marketing Campaign Ideas</a>\n</div> \n<h3>23. Find the best jokes in your niche and share them in a blog post.</h3> Like I said earlier, \n<a href=\"http://www.hopesandfears.com/hopes/now/question/216957-what-is-the-purpose-of-humor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">people love humor</a>. We like to laugh and smile. A great place to look is on Google. There are plenty of good places full of jokes. Do this as a special post and share it on a Friday or a day off. \n<h3>24. What adventures does a person experience in career like yours?</h3> Are there any fun adventures that you've gotten to go on or to be a part of while being a _____ (your title)? If so, share your adventures. \n<h3>25. Seen any good movies? Pick one and tie it into something to do with a topic in your niche.</h3> Write a post about how a certain character or situation in a movie has something to do with your niche. These can be a lot of fun to write. Play around with some ideas. \n<h3>26. What are your top five distractions. How do you deal with them?</h3> Distractions aren't fun, but sadly, we have them a lot in our lives — especially with the internet. There's always a distraction waiting around the corner. Do you have a way of holding the distractions at bay? If so, share your tips. \n<h3>27. Pick out three, creative people who inspire you. If they collaborated to make a product, what would the product be?</h3> If those three people created something awesome with all their skills, what would it be? Create that and then share your process and inspiration. \n<h3>28. What scares you the most? Why?</h3> It's interesting to dig into why something scares or doesn't scare you. Share ways you've gotten over your fear, since there are people out there who probably have the same fears. [Tweet \"Share ways you've gotten over your fear, since there are people out there who probably have the same fears.\"] \n<h3>29. What is your first memory?</h3> Do you remember your first memory? Think about it for a while and then write it up. \n<h3>30. List of hacks.</h3> Write down the hacks to doing a certain task or job you have knowledge in. \n<div class=\"callout\"> \n <strong>Think about these things:</strong> \n <ul> \n  <li>What steps will it take to finish your task or project?</li> \n  <li>Write those down.</li> \n  <li>Flesh out your <a href=\"http://coschedule.com/blog/blog-outline/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">blog outline with more detail. What are the actionable tips to doing that task or project?</a></li> \n </ul> \n</div> \n<h3>31. Use five words to describe yourself, your blog, or your business.</h3> How would you describe yourself in only five words? Use those words as an outline for your idea. \n<h3>32. Host a blog hop.</h3> Pick a topic or theme. A good way to think of this is like a party — at parties, there's usually a theme. Write up a few rules and a schedule of events. Set up a blog hop for a certain amount of time. For each of the days, provide a daily prompt. It will pull&nbsp;other bloggers into the fun of writing posts on that topic. Encourage bloggers to visit other bloggers' posts who are also a part of the blog hop. Blog hops are a cool way to create a sense of community and get more comments. Have fun with it! \n<div class=\"callout\">\n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/?p=59821#top\">Choose Other Blog Ideas.</a>\n</div> \n<a name=\"wishes-and-goals\"></a> \n<h2>Wishes and Goals</h2> \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-84097 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/06/wishes-and-goals.png\" alt=\"Wishes and goals for your brand blog.\" width=\"1361\" height=\"1664\" /> \n<h3>33. How do you plan to achieve your current goals?</h3> Think about your monthly \n<a href=\"http://coschedule.com/blog/new-years-resolution-blog-more/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">goals</a>.

For instance, do you have any bad habits or things that get in the way of you being successful? Since you probably do, your audience also probably deals with similar issues or the same ones you do. Share a list of what \n<a href=\"http://blondeonabudget.ca/2015/01/05/why-im-turning-my-tv-off-for-31-days/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">you aren't going to do this month.

What is the road to success?</h3> Have you ever thought about writing an inspirational post that will encourage people in your niche to stand strong and hold on while they are on the road to success? \n<ul> \n <li>What are things that you struggled with when you were starting out?</li> \n <li>List those out, and then give your readers an answer.</li> \n <li>Think of yourself as a mentor of what it takes to reach success. Write it as though you were writing it to yourself when you first started working in your field.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>36. What are your goals for the next five years? Ten years?</h3> It's always good to remember your goals. When you have them set out, it's easier to see where you're headed. It helps you sort out your vision a little more. \n<div class=\"callout\"> \n <strong>Here are some questions to help you brainstorm:</strong> \n <ul> \n  <li>What would you like to do this coming year?

Life and work are so much easier when you love what you do. Write down what you are passionate about. \n<h3>98. What are the top things you've learned over the past year?</h3> This could go in a few different directions. Either you could make a massive list of the different things you've learned this year, or you could write a blog post for each idea off the list. Maybe share how to do what you've learned or the life lessons that a person could learn from. \n<h3>99. What keeps you creative?</h3> When working in a creative niche, there are times where the words flow or the ideas bubble up out of you like a fountain. There are also those days \n<a href=\"http://coschedule.com/blog/how-to-be-creative/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">where you lack creativity</a> and really don't know what direction you want to go with certain projects. This can be hard. Many people give up on their creative endeavors when this happens. Don't let that happen to you and your art. \n<blockquote>\n There is no greater agony than bearing an untold story inside you. – Maya Angelou\n</blockquote> I've been told by countless creatives that creativity is a lot like having a child. If major complications happen during child birth, there is a chance that the mother and the baby could both die. The same story could be said for the artist bearing an untold story. If you have a story to tell but don't tell it, you're hurting yourself and harming the story. You don't want the story to die, right? Stay creative and finish your work. Ship. \n<blockquote>\n Real artists ship. – Steve Jobs\n</blockquote> Share all the things that keep you creative as a writer, blogger, content marketer, artist, or graphic designer. \n<h3>100. Take a word and write a post inspired by it.</h3> Think creatively. You could even choose a couple words to use. \n<a href=\"http://sundayscribblings.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Check out the Sunday Scribblings blog</a> that set up a new word prompt every Sunday for some inspiration. \n<h3>101. How do you stay productive?</h3> Productivity is another area in our lives that we are always trying to improve. \n<div class=\"callout\"> \n <strong>Something to think about:</strong> \n <ul> \n  <li>What kind of a lifestyle has helped you be more productive? (e.g. Do you work out regularly? Do you <a href=\"http://www.lifehack.org/articles/featured/productivity-boost-how-to-start-your-day-at-500-am.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">wake up at 5 a.m.</a> and work on your own projects before going to work in the morning?)</li> \n  <li>What things have been stopping me from being productive? Show how to avoid experiencing those unproductive habits.</li> \n </ul> \n</div> \n<h3>102. If you could change one thing about your life, what would it be?</h3> It's good to think about the things that you want to change about your life. It helps you see how to become better at what you do while also helping your audience see that you still want to improve upon things in your life. \n<h3>103. What do you enjoy doing outside of work?</h3> Sharing some of your life outside of work, business, and/or your blog will help people get to know you better. Sometimes, it helps people to see that you are just a normal person. \n<h3>104. Creative and inspiring quotes related to your industry.</h3> I love inspiring quotes — especially if they are related to a personal niche. Other people love them for the same reason. Basically, quotes are morsels of knowledge from another person that help with inspiration and encouragement. Encourage your audience with niche-related quotes. It also helps just knowing that others have felt the same way. \n<blockquote>\n There is nothing to writing. All you do is sit down at a typewriter and bleed. – Ernest Hemingway\n</blockquote> \n<div class=\"callout\">\n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/?p=59821#top\">Choose Other Blog Ideas.</a>\n</div> \n<a name=\"blogging-ideas\"></a> \n<h2>General Blogging Ideas</h2> \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-84102 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/06/general-blogging-ideas.png\" alt=\"General blogging ideas for your brand blog.\" width=\"1361\" height=\"2126\" /> \n<h3>105. What top things do you wish you'd known when you first started blogging?</h3> Start by writing a list of the top things you wish you'd known. Just brain dump all your thoughts into that list. Then use that as the backbone for your blog post. \n<h3>106. Where do you want your blog or business to be next year? How about in five and ten Years?</h3> It can be tough to try and visualize where you'll be in more than a week, meaning five to ten years into the future can be hard to picture. This can be a great time to imagine and dream. Try to be realistic, though. Setting \n<a href=\"http://coschedule.com/blog/plan-a-blog-schedule/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SMART goals really helps.</a> You don't want to feel overwhelmed when you realize how much is on your plate. \n<h3>107. Write a review.</h3> Writing reviews is a great way to tell companies that you like their products, but more than that, it's a great way to share awesome products with other people. Do you use CoSchedule? If so, you could write a review and \n<a href=\"http://help.coschedule.com/hc/en-us/articles/207235867-CoSchedule-Referral-and-Review-Program\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">save 50%</a>. [Tweet \"Do you use CoSchedule? If so, you could write a review and save 50%.\"] \n<h3>108. Write an open letter.</h3> A few years ago, there was an open letter that many bloggers partook in. You've probably heard of it. It was called, “A Letter To My 16-Year-Old Self”. With this, think about all the things you'd tell your younger self to help them through the things you went through. Here's an \n<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/diane-lee/dear-me-letter-to-my-16-y_b_8892436.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">example you can check out</a> from Huffington Post. \n<h3>109. Reach out to experts and combine the quotes into a single blog post.</h3> Write up a post using quotes you've gotten from experts in your field. People love posts like these, especially if what the experts are saying is new and can't be found anywhere else online. \n<h3>110. Write a best posts of the season (summer, fall, winter, or spring) blog post.</h3> Go to your Google Analytics and look at your most popular posts from the past few months, for each season, and share them with your followers again in a recap post. \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/blog-post-seo-checklist/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Your Essential Guide to SEO for Blog Posts (Checklist Included)</a>\n</div> \n<h3>111. How do you get blog readers?</h3> What has been the most successful way for you to build blog readers? Write down your steps and share them. Some people think it will harm them if they give away their secrets, but that isn't true. If you give away your secrets, people are going to trust you and keep coming back to you for more. \n<h3>112. Try a photo prompt.</h3> Find some awesome free images on \n<a href=\"https://unsplash.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Unsplash</a> or in \n<a href=\"http://coschedule.com/blog/blog-photography-tips/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this blog post</a>. Look at some pictures and use them to inspire your post idea. This is a creativity-building blog idea. \n<h3>113. Your writing place.</h3> I absolutely love seeing writers' writing places. Your followers can take away so much inspiration these places. \n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-60285 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/Blog_Devin_BlogIdeas-NEW-15-1.png\" alt=\"Your writing place.\" width=\"655\" height=\"524\" /> Share your workplace.

Why did you start blogging?</h3> Share what made you start blogging. \n<h3>115. What are 15 things no one knows about you?</h3> Think of 15 awesome and funny things. You could also use this idea to write 15 things that no one knows about your business or product. \n<h3>116. Reach out to friend bloggers to see if they'd do a swap-a-roo blog post.</h3> Contact them to see if they'd write a guest post for you if you write one for them. Something to remember: other bloggers are looking for content as much as you are. \n<h3>117. How do you develop your blogging ideas?</h3> Write a blog post on your process for coming up with blog ideas. \n<h3>118. What makes you unique as a blogger?</h3> Make a list and then focus on ways that you can show those unique characteristics and strengths more often. \n<h3>119. Who are five bloggers who inspire you?</h3> Write a post about it. \n<h3>120. How has your blogging career changed in the past year?</h3> Share the changes, journeys, and stats.

Set up a series of posts.</h3> Have a few posts that talk about a similar topic or continue a longer idea. \n<h3>122. Do you have a team? If so, how did you find them?</h3> Share how you found your team. Was there a hiring process? Did you find them on an outsourcing website? \n<h3>123. Respond to a tweet in longer form.</h3> It can be hard to fit all your thoughts into 140 characters. Take the idea you got from a tweet and share that in post format on your blog. \n<h3>124. Give a book review.</h3> Have you read any great books in your niche?&nbsp;If so, why don't you write a book review of sorts on the book? Grab some of the biggest lessons from the book that stuck out to you that may help your audience. Also, think about reaching out to the author of the book to share your review with them. Authors love it when people contact them to talk about their books. Who wouldn't want to know that their writing impacted your life? \n<div class=\"callout\">\n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/?p=59821#top\">Choose Other Blog Ideas.</a>\n</div> \n<a name=\"writing\"></a> \n<h2>Blog Ideas About the Writing Process</h2> &nbsp; \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-84103 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/06/writing-process.png\" alt=\"Blog ideas about the writing process.\" width=\"1361\" height=\"1509\" /> \n<h3>125. What keywords bring the most traffic to your site? Use that data to write more on those topics.</h3> Creating more content like your most popular blog posts just makes sense. Use a tool, like \n<a href=\"https://moz.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Moz</a>, to understand the keywords that are helping you crush it and get new blog ideas from your best content. \n<h3>126. Write a post where you share your top blog posts.</h3> Create a fun way to get your readers excited about your top posts. What else can you do to make them special? \n<h3>127. Participate in a blog hop, blog roundup, or carnival online.</h3> When you participate in a blog hop, blog roundup, or a carnival, you'll have to write a blog post that has to do with a topic. Usually, the blogger who is hosting the blog hop or setting up the carnival will have an overarching theme. You'll have to write something about that with a topic that relates. \n<h3>128. Write your writer’s guidelines.</h3> Having guest writers is an awesome way to fill up your blog with content. You just want to make sure you go about it the right way. Treat your blog like a magazine and ask for pitches. [Tweet \"Treat your blog like a magazine and ask for pitches.\"] \n<div class=\"callout\"> \n <strong>How to craft your writer's guidelines:</strong> \n <ol> \n  <li>Pitch guidelines: What do you want writers to put into their pitches? What things do you need to see from them in order to say \"yes\" to their pitch? Additionally, I would usually recommend asking for 250–500 words of the article that they're pitching to you. This will help you see if their writing is any good before you accept a pitch.</li> \n  <li>Other things they should send with the pitch include their blog URL, social links, and a few writing samples.</li> \n  <li>Lay out how the guest writing process goes, so the writer will know how to approach you and what to expect about the whole process.</li> \n  <li>Keep in mind what minimum-maximum length you want for your posts.</li> \n </ol> \n</div> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/blogging-business-plan-template/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How to Craft an Effective Blogging Business Plan That Nails Your Blog’s Success (Template)</a>\n</div> \n<h3>129. Create a master list of helpful Amazon Kindle books that are in your niche.</h3> When it comes to free e-books out there, there are a ton of them. Self-publishing has opened many doors for writers, but it has also opened the publishing doors for a whole lot of not-so-good stuff. That makes it difficult for a person to find good, actionable e-books that are actually free. Put together a list post of good, free e-books that you've found. \n<h3>130. Write something that you've never written before.</h3> \n<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/A7rTdPxXP9fqM/giphy.gif\" alt=\"Writing gif.\" width=\"500\" height=\"268\" /> Do you only write blog posts? Ever thought of writing something different? Think about writing lyrics, a short story, poetry, or a short script and then share it on your blog. Playing around in different formats of writing will make you a stronger writer. \n<h3>131. Make a comprehensive guide post.</h3> Make a comprehensive guide on a certain topic. Teach your readers the in-and-out to writing \"how-to posts\" or whatever topic you decide to choose. Remember to make it actionable. \n<h3>132. Write a memorial post.</h3> Did someone influential in your life or business pass away? Write up a blog post in memory of them. Share what you learned from them and how they affected your life, blog, and/or business. \n<h3>133. Create a list of ____.</h3> Write a list post. List posts are some of the more popular blog posts out there. \n<h3>134. Create a list of online tools.</h3> Do you use any online tools? If so, write up a list of the most helpful tools you've found and used. \n<h3>135. Write a checklist on how to ________ (fill in the blank).</h3> We recently published a post here on the \n<a href=\"http://coschedule.com/blog/blog-writing-checklist/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CoSchedule blog that was a checklist</a>. These are fun posts to write. Just walk your readers through the process of doing something in a checklist format. \n<h3>136. A–Z post.</h3> Have you ever seen those posts where bloggers do the A–Z posts on certain topics? There are a few ways that you could go about using this for blog ideas. First, you could write one post with a list from A–Z, and then list words that start with that letter. You could also write a blog post for each letter. That would be a ton of blog ideas, once you got through the whole alphabet. \n<h3>137. 100 things...</h3> 100 things you love, 100 things you enjoy, or 100 tools you swear by. \n<span style=\"font-size: 24px;\"><b>Ideas for Repurposing Blog Content</b></span> \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-84104 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/06/repurpose-content.png\" alt=\"Ideas for repurposing your blog content.\" width=\"1361\" height=\"1529\" /> \n<h3>138. Thank your audience and give them something special for being awesome.</h3> Thank your readers. They're reading your blog posts, so thank them. Give away something special to them for being awesome. They will definitely be thinking, “What’s in it for me?” every time they read a post on your blog. That's just something to keep on your mind whenever you come up with new blog ideas. \n<h3>139. Put your best blog posts into a free ebook.</h3> Do you have a lot of blog posts covering a certain topic? If so, compile them into one document. Ask a designer to make a cool cover through&nbsp;\n<a href=\"https://www.behance.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Behance</a> or \n<a href=\"https://dribbble.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dribbble</a>,&nbsp;or just make your own with \n<a href=\"https://www.canva.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Canva</a>. When you're done with the book, write up another post covering some awesome tips from all the posts that you compiled into the ebook. Put a call to action in there where people can sign up for the book and \n<a href=\"http://coschedule.com/blog/email-list-building-strategy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">grow that email list</a>. \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/blog-calendar-template/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Why You Need To Use A Blog Calendar (and How To Create One With a Template)</a>\n</div> \n<h3>140. Write a handwritten letter or sketch something to share.</h3> Write a&nbsp;blog post and then write a few quotes from your blog post by hand. Scan it and then upload those into your posts. This will add a new creative twist to your blog post. \n<h3>141. Let people hear your voice.</h3> Turn your posts into downloadable audio mp3 files. This is a fun way to be unique since people sometimes get sick of reading a ton of information. Think about having an audio area where they can listen to your post instead. Big blogs, like Social Media Examiner, do this for their most successful posts using a tool called \n<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/powerpress/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Blubrry Powerpress</a>. \n<h3>142. Live blog a conference.</h3> Attend a session and write down everything the speaker says. Post it on your blog. \n<a href=\"http://coschedule.com/blog/promote-your-blog-with-social-media/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Share your post on social media</a> using the event hashtag, so attendees will find it. \n<h3>143. Host your own webinar.</h3> Take an old blog post and make a webinar out of it. Then write a new post and market your webinar in it. \n<div class=\"callout\"> \n <strong>Create and host your own webinar</strong> \n <ol> \n  <li>Create a landing page with something like <a href=\"http://www.leadpages.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Leadpages</a> or <a href=\"https://instapage.com/landing-pages?utm_medium=PPC&amp;utm_source=AdWords&amp;utm_campaign=Instapage&amp;utm_term=insta%20pages&amp;gclid=CNDAwuy168oCFQ6naQodSVYKbg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Instapages</a>.</li> \n  <li>What is the benefit for people to sign up?</li> \n  <li>Give something away for free to people who sign up — of course, in exchange for an email. Then you can send them the recording and also their free gift.</li> \n  <li>Use a program, like <a href=\"https://zoom.us/signup\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zoom</a> or <a href=\"https://hangouts.google.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google Hangouts</a>, to host and record your webinar.</li> \n  <li>Share your landing page on social media, with your friends, and email newsletter subscribers. Be sure to use a great <a href=\"http://coschedule.com/blog/how-to-write-a-call-to-action-template/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">call to action</a>.</li> \n </ol> \n</div> \n<h3>144. Are there templates or downloads that your readers would enjoy having?</h3> Now, write those up and share them freely or use them to \n<a href=\"http://coschedule.com/blog/how-to-build-an-email-list/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">collect email subscribers</a>. Think about turning the content you already have on your blog posts into a download of some sort. Could that be a guide, worksheet, or video course? Take a look at our \n<a href=\"http://coschedule.com/blog/resources/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Resource Library</a> for some great ideas on things you can create. \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/the-best-way-to-manage-your-blog-in-coschedule/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Best Way to Manage Your Blog in CoSchedule</a>\n</div> \n<h3>145. Try vlogging for a month.</h3> Vlogging is a great way to play around with creating new content or reshaping old content into something new. If you want to turn an old post into a vlog, go through your post and pick out the main topics that will help your audience solve whatever problem they want to solve. Then write it out as a script. Practice a ton. Record yourself and then edit it. Once you are done with that, share it with your audience. \n<div class=\"callout\"> \n <strong>Tips for vlogging:</strong> \n <ol> \n  <li>Write your script more like an outline than an actual post. Keep sentences shorter rather than longer, so it's easier to read.</li> \n  <li>Put googly craft eyes on either side of your computer video recorder (if you are using your computer), so you keep eye contact with your audience. As a viewer, it can be distracting to watch a speaker who is always looking away or looking in the wrong direction.</li> \n </ol> \n</div> \n<h3>146. Host a live workshop.</h3> Write an actionable post about the topic that you are going to cover. Don't cover everything you want to cover in the workshop, but you can share something awesome that will make them want to sign up for that course. Having a downloadable piece of content also really helps them sign up. We all love free stuff! \n<div class=\"callout\"> \n <strong>What to keep in mind:</strong> \n <ol> \n  <li>What kind of a workshop do you want to host? In person? Online? A Meetup?</li> \n  <li>Brainstorm the different topics that you'd like to cover. You can even take a post that you've already written — take the key points and cover actionable tips about them.</li> \n  <li>Write your notes like an outline. Keep your sentences short, so it's easier to focus when you look down at your notes.</li> \n  <li>Talk slowly enough for people to understand you.</li> \n </ol> \n</div> \n<h3>147. Create infographics for some of your top-performing posts and share them.</h3> Infographics are a lot of fun for making your blog posts a little more colorful and scannable. You can learn more about \n<a href=\"http://coschedule.com/blog/how-to-make-an-infographic/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">making them here</a>.&nbsp;Share them on social media. Pinterest loves infographics. [Tweet \"Infographics are a lot of fun for making your blog posts a little more colorful and scannable.\"] \n<h3>148. Create a quick reference guide.</h3> You could also call it a cheat sheet. Fill it with tips and tricks of the trade that'll help your audience ace the test. \n<h3>149. Have you made past blogging mistakes?</h3> Have you made any blogging mistakes? Make a list of all the mistakes. It would make a great what-not-to-do post. \n<h2>Great Ideas for Food Bloggers</h2> \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-84105 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/06/food-blogging.png\" alt=\"Ideas for food blogging.\" width=\"1361\" height=\"1386\" /> \n<h3>150.

Why should your audience care?</li> \n</ul> \n<h3>Where Should You Sell Your Product?

You know, like the shoes that had wings on them in Greek Mythology? Yes, just like Hermes and his flying shoes.</li> \n <li><strong>Why do they need it?</strong>&nbsp;It'll cut down&nbsp;on gas prices and also encourage people to get out more.</li> \n <li><strong>What makes it special and different?</strong>&nbsp;Well, they sorta have wings. I'd say that definitely makes them different.</li> \n</ul> \n<strong>Place:</strong> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>How would you sell your product?</strong> I'd sell them online (on my website) and in stores.</li> \n</ul> \n<strong>Price:</strong> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Is it a good value for what your audience would be getting?</strong> I'd probably charge a lot of money for these shoes because they are definitely a great value for flying shoes. I mean, where else can you find such awesome shoes with wings?</li> \n <li><strong>How does the price compare with your competitors and others in the market?</strong> Well, I don't have any competitors, so I'd say the price sets the mark for this product.</li> \n</ul> \n<strong>Promotion:</strong> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Where are you going to promote your content/product?</strong> On my website, in shoe stores, and introduce them to the athletes who perform in the Olympics. Who knows, maybe a new sport will be created because of these shoes.</li> \n <li><strong>How are you getting it in front of people? </strong>I'd send a pair to influencers, artists, and sport stars. I'd also do an awesome job with my branding. The shoe box would be super cool. Shoelaces would be different colors and even some sparkly tissue paper instead of the newspaper colored tissue paper you usually see stuck in the shoes at department stores. My aim would be to make everyone feel like flying superstars.</li> \n <li><strong>Will you do ads? If so, where will you do them? </strong>I don't think I'd need to do much advertising once it got out there&nbsp;because I think shoes that allowed you to fly would pretty much sell themselves.</li> \n</ul> Even though I used a mythological product idea in this example, you get the point. But, man, I'd love to have a pair of those shoes. Create your 4 Ps for your product and make it jump off the page at your audience. \n<a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/?p=55628#top\">Back to the Top</a> \n<a name=\"ongoing-plan\"></a> \n<h2>Create a Pricing Strategy</h2> Before you define your price, it's best to nail down your positioning, branding, and distribution channels. This ensures that your pricing doesn't negatively affect brand strategy or the company's values. The pricing strategy you choose will greatly influence how the market perceives your brand, so it's important to get it right. \n<h3>Match Your Pricing Strategy to Your Value Proposition</h3> Your price needs to be consistent with the perceived value of your product. If your product is too expensive to it's perceived value, it won't sell. Whereas, if your product is too affordable in relation to it's perceived value you risk losing out on revenue and potentially damaging your brand. After all, a luxury usually comes with a price. \n<h3>Analyze Competitor Prices</h3> Look at a wide variety of competitors to see how you are priced in comparison. This ensures that you are still pricing your products according to your brand strategy. \n<h3>Determine Price Sensitivity</h3> Higher price tags usually mean that your company with sell at a lower volume. Volume isn't the only to consider, though. You may generate more total revenue and/or profit with fewer units at a higher price. This depends largely on if your customers are extremely price-sensitive. \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-83842 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/06/manufacture-costs.png\" alt=\"Manufacturing costs of a Burberry coat.\" width=\"1360\" height=\"846\" /> Burberry's customers are less price-sensitive, so the company can move less volume at a higher price tag, yet generate more total profit. The Gap version, on the other hand, moves greater volume at a much lower price due to tighter margins. \n<h2>Marketing Tactics + Checklist</h2> What will be your ongoing marketing plan? What do you want to do? Where do you want to do it? In order to plan your future marketing, you have to know these things. Set up an ongoing marketing plan for the year. What things will need to be done. I found this great sample example from the \n<a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/133378695/Tips-for-Developing-a-Marketing-Plan-Heavenly-Pies-Example\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Agricultural Development Center at the University of Tennessee</a>. It's so easy to see it all at a glance. You'll know exactly what goals you'll need to hit monthly. \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-83843 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/06/marketing-plan-checklist.png\" alt=\"An example of a marketing plan checklist.\" width=\"1361\" height=\"1521\" /> \n<a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/?p=55628#top\">Back to the Top</a> \n<a name=\"budget\"></a> \n<h2>Create a Values Matrix</h2> A values matrix helps you prioritize all the tactics that you have come up with. Essentially, it helps you choose the tactics that have the highest business value and take the least amount of resources to implement. \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-83844 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/06/value-complexity-matrix.png\" alt=\"Quadrants of the value-complexity matrix.\" width=\"1361\" height=\"1233\" /> Business “value” depends on strategic objectives. This could include a campaign's usefulness in increasing sales, increasing website visitors, generating leads, or increasing brand awareness. The most valuable marketing campaigns, initiatives, or activities are the ones that are tied closest to the business's overall objective. Implementation “complexity” encompasses the time it takes to implement, internal resources needed, and design costs. \n<strong>High-value, low-complexity:</strong> “Easy wins” that should be considered for your plan. \n<strong>High-value, high-complexity:</strong> Larger strategic initiatives that require effort and time but pay enormous dividends. \n<strong>Low-value, low-complexity:</strong> Might or might not be worth your time. Revisit these features later or brainstorm ways to make them of higher value. \n<strong>Low-value, high-complexity:</strong> Items that should be deprioritized. \n<h2>Budget to Understand Where You'll Spend Cash and Find Gaps</h2> You need to estimate how much&nbsp;your&nbsp;marketing projects are going to be.&nbsp;You'll be able to put&nbsp;together&nbsp;a budget to keep everyone on track over the course of the year. Marketing costs and needs vary quite a bit. There is no easy way to figure out what your marketing budget should be, but starting with your needs and wants is a great place to start. \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-83845 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/06/dave-ramsey.png\" alt=\"Quote from Dave Ramsey about budget.\" width=\"1360\" height=\"537\" /> What's important is that you know what your needs and wants are. Answer these questions: \n<ul> \n <li>What does your content or business <strong>need</strong> when it comes to spending on marketing? This will help you narrow down the most important things that you currently need.</li> \n <li>What does your content or business <strong>want</strong> when it comes to spending?</li> \n <li>How much <strong>can</strong> you spend monthly?</li> \n</ul> Next for the needs and wants, write down how much it's going to cost. After doing that for all of your needs, you can start to see how much you can budget for your wants.

This person is the point-man for every aspect of a campaign and ensures it goes off without a hitch. The primary duties of this role will be: \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Writing email subject lines and body content.</strong></li> \n <li><strong>Collaborating with designers to create email graphics, if necessary.</strong></li> \n <li><strong>Determining which list segments will receive the email.</strong></li> \n</ul> The owners of each project should be recorded in your email marketing calendar. \n<img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter wp-image-73952 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/email-campaign-owner.png\" alt=\"Where to list email campaign owner\" width=\"1360\" height=\"272\" /> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Action Item:</strong> Select your email project owner&nbsp;for each campaign.\n <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">&nbsp;</span>This person may change depending on the campaign that needs to be created by your email marketing team.\n</div> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/?p=53803#toc\">Back to the Top</a></strong>\n</div> \n<a name=\"two\"></a> \n<h2>Step 2: Determine Email Topics and Themes</h2> Before you begin planning your campaign, you need to decide what topics your emails will cover. Are you launching a new product or promoting an upcoming webinar, or are you hoping to provide new subscribers with helpful introduction content? Work with your team to decide the topic each email of your campaign will cover. Some common themes are: \n<ul> \n <li><strong>New product launch</strong></li> \n <li><strong>Upcoming webinar</strong></li> \n <li><strong>Weekly newsletter (topics will change week to week)</strong></li> \n <li><strong>New content you’ve written</strong></li> \n <li><strong>New functionality for your existing product</strong></li> \n <li><strong>Upcoming sale or event</strong></li> \n</ul> \n<img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter wp-image-73953 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/email-topic.png\" alt=\"Email topic or purpose\" width=\"1360\" height=\"256\" /> \n<div class=\"link-callout\"> \n <strong>Action Items:</strong> \n <ol> \n  <li>Work with your email marketing team to determine the topics for each of your campaigns.</li> \n  <li>Record each topic in your email marketing calendar template that complements this article.</li> \n </ol> \n</div> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/?p=53803#toc\">Back to the Top</a></strong>\n</div> \n<a name=\"three\"></a> \n<h2>Step 3: Keep Up With the Status of Each Campaign</h2> Your email marketing calendar should show the status of each of your email marketing campaigns. That way you, as a manager, can see what’s coming up, what’s staged and ready to send, and what your team is working on next. Break down the status of your campaign into three sections: \n<ul> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">New: </span>This is a new campaign that has recently been added to your calendar. No one on your email marketing team has touched this campaign.</li> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">In-progress: </span>Your email team is working on content, graphics, and more for this email. Once they are complete, they will move on to the project owner for final review.</li> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Complete:&nbsp;</span>At this point, the email has been designed, subject lines are written, and the project owner is confident that this email is ready to be sent to the identified list.</li> \n</ul> Update the status of each of your campaigns regularly (at least weekly) in your template. \n<img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter wp-image-73954 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/campaign-status-1.png\" alt=\"Where to denote campaign status\" width=\"1360\" height=\"255\" /> \n<div class=\"link-callout\"> \n <strong>Action Items:</strong> \n <ol> \n  <li>Set up weekly syncs with your email marketing team.</li> \n  <li>Review any new campaigns that have been added to the calendar.

Update their status in your email marketing calendar template when done.</li> \n </ol> \n</div> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/?p=53803#toc\">Back to the Top</a></strong>\n</div> \n<a name=\"four\"></a> \n<h2>Step 4: Identify the Email Types That You’ll Send to Your Subscribers</h2> Next, you need to identify what types of emails you want to send to your list. There are many different types of email that a marketing team can send but the most common are: \n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Informational Emails</span> \n<ul> \n <li>These are emails that provide subscribers with helpful information that shows them how to solve potential problems they are facing.</li> \n <li>These emails can be anything from newsletters to an email pitching a specific piece of content.</li> \n <li>Helpful emails are usually placed at the beginning of your campaigns.</li> \n</ul> \n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Pitch Emails</span> \n<ul> \n <li>These emails position your product as the best solution for the problems your audience is facing.</li> \n <li>They mention your product directly and focus on the benefits of using your product over another.</li> \n <li>At this point in your campaign, you want to show your readers that you understand their pain and know how to help them.</li> \n</ul> \n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Follow-Up Emails</span> \n<ul> \n <li>Follow up&nbsp;emails help remind your customers that you offer the best solution to their problem and that they should buy from you.</li> \n <li>These come to your audience a few days after your last pitch email.</li> \n <li>They act as gentle reminders that the solution to their problem is right at their fingertips.</li> \n</ul> Identify which emails you’re sending on your calendar. \n<img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter wp-image-73955 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/email-type.png\" alt=\"List email type\" width=\"1360\" height=\"254\" /> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Action Item:</strong> Decide the frequency of each email type you are going to send in one campaign. We’ll cover how many emails you need to send in each campaign in the next section.\n</div> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/?p=53803#toc\">Back to the Top</a></strong>\n</div> \n<a name=\"five\"></a> \n<h2>Step 5: Define the Number of Emails That Will Be Sent for This Campaign</h2> You’ll also need to identify the number of emails that need to be created for each campaign. That number can be hard to figure out. How many emails are too many? What’s the borderline between spamming your audience and sending them just the right amount of content? Start with these basic email delivery schedules for different types of content you might need to promote. \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-85375 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/email-publishing-schedule.png\" alt=\"The best email publishing schedule\" width=\"1361\" height=\"948\" /> What if you’re doing more than just a single piece of content? What if you’re promoting a product launch? Here’s your email publishing schedule for that, too. \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-85376 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/product-launch.png\" alt=\"Best email publishing schedule for a product launch\" width=\"1361\" height=\"1305\" /> What about a webinar email promo template? \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-85377 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/webinar.png\" alt=\"The best publishing schedule for a webinar\" width=\"1361\" height=\"2046\" /> If you decide to send out a newsletter, try sending one \n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://marketingartfully.com/2012/02/16/email-marketing-how-often-should-you-send-your-newsletter/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">at least once a month or weekly</a>,</span>&nbsp;if you can manage to create enough content. If you’re going for one a week or one a month, \n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/best-time-to-send-email/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">send your newsletters on Wednesdays</a>,</span>&nbsp;as that is considered the best day to send emails. \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-85378 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/newsletter.png\" alt=\"Publishing schedule for a newsletter\" width=\"1361\" height=\"1426\" /> Record each email you want to send on your calendar. \n<img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter wp-image-73957 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/send-date.png\" alt=\"Establish send date\" width=\"1360\" height=\"423\" /> \n<div class=\"link-callout\"> \n <strong>Action Items:</strong> \n <ol> \n  <li>Pull the number of projected emails for each&nbsp;campaign.</li> \n  <li>List each email for the campaign in your calendar.</li> \n </ol> \n</div> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/?p=53803#toc\">Back to the Top</a></strong>\n</div> \n<a name=\"six\"></a> \n<h2>Step 6: Account for Email Campaign Seasonality (as Needed)</h2> Identify which season this campaign is associated with. You could stick to the standard four, or you can also include seasonal events, like holiday shopping season. Why would you want to determine your seasons so far in advance? That’s the beauty of using an email marketing calendar; you can plan everything. By planning ahead, you can show your team when they can expect to be working on a larger number of emails and adjust their workload to accommodate them. For example,&nbsp;for a business-to-consumer retail store,&nbsp;it may&nbsp;make sense for&nbsp;your organization to&nbsp;send a lot more email during the holiday season in November and December than in March. You could have your team working on those November emails earlier in the year — or during their downtime in March — to ensure they won’t be so stressed by the time your holiday campaigns roll out. \n<img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter wp-image-74004 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/buying-season-email-calendar-1.png\" alt=\"Where to find Buying Season on the Email Marketing Calendar\" width=\"1360\" height=\"194\" /> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Action Item:</strong> Decide what season each email campaign is going to be sent.\n</div> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/?p=53803#toc\">Back to the Top</a></strong>\n</div> \n<a name=\"seven\"></a> \n<h2>Step 7: Define The Marketing Persona You’re Targeting&nbsp;With Each Campaign</h2> If your company works with multiple marketing personas who are you trying to speak to in this campaign. \n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/marketing-strategy/marketing-persona\">As a </a></span>\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/marketing-strategy/marketing-persona\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">refresher</a></span>: \n<blockquote>\n Your marketing persona is a document that details your target audience’s who, what, when, where, and why, in addition to understanding general demographics information such as gender, job title, job function, business size, team size, needs, pain points, and challenges.\n</blockquote> If your team doesn’t have a marketing persona to work with yet, you can create your own. Start by answering the following questions: \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Who are our current best customers?</strong></li> \n <li><strong>What do our best customers all have in common?</strong></li> \n <li><strong>What problem are they experiencing?</strong></li> \n <li><strong>How did they get to the point where they were ready to search for a solution to their problem instead of trying to fix it themselves?</strong></li> \n <li><strong>Why did they go with our product over another?</strong></li> \n</ul> Once you start to see certain qualities overlap, you can format them into your marketing persona statement. This statement can be created with the following template: \n<blockquote>\n The target audience of [your organization] is looking for a solution to [problem]. We have found that our audience is more likely to experience that problem if they are [demographic], [demographic], and [demographic].\n</blockquote> Identify your persona, and record it on your calendar. \n<img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter wp-image-74005 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/find-target-persona.png\" alt=\"Where to find Target Persona on the email marketing calendar\" width=\"1360\" height=\"194\" /> \n<div class=\"link-callout\"> \n <strong>Action Items:</strong> \n <ol> \n  <li>Identify your audience personas.</li> \n  <li>Choose the persona that would be most likely to respond to this campaign.</li> \n </ol> \n</div> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/?p=53803#toc\">Back to the Top</a></strong>\n</div> \n<a name=\"eight\"></a> \n<h2>Step 8: Identify the Email Segment&nbsp;in Which You Are Sending This Campaign</h2> Your email calendar should also contain information about which list you plan to send this campaign. For example, you could have a campaign that goes to everyone on your list, or you could say this campaign should only go to people who attended your last webinar. However, if you don’t have an email list to send your content to,&nbsp;you won’t get very far. Plus,&nbsp;you don’t want to blast your emails to every person on your list because not all of your subscribers are in the same phase of your \n<a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/marketing-funnel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">marketing funnel</span></a>. For example, if you have a customer who is just learning about your product, they don’t need to see an email that encourages them to buy right this second. How can you do all of this? First, you need to build your list. Try a few of the following tactics and see which ones your audience responds to: \n<ol> \n <li><strong>Add CTA’s to your website.</strong></li> \n <li><strong>Provide them with something of value that they can download in exchange for their email address.</strong></li> \n <li><strong>Publish content on other sites and encourage readers to learn more by joining your email list.</strong></li> \n</ol> Growing your email list is all about getting creative. The more value you can provide to your subscribers, the better. \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/how-to-build-an-email-list/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">21+ Easy Ways To Build An Email List That Will Skyrocket By 140% In 1 Year</a>\n</div> Once you’ve built your email list, you can segment it out based on actions subscribers have taken on your site. For example, when a subscriber visits a specific product page, add that person into a specific segment for subscribers who are interested in that product. This type of action is possible with many email automation providers like \n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://autopilothq.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Autopilot</a></span>, \n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://www.marketo.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Marketo</a></span>, and \n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hubspot</a></span>. This segmenting process allows you to get specific and send targeted messages at the right time to the right subscribers. The right message at the right time can help increase your conversions if it’s done correctly. There are many different ways you can segment your list.&nbsp;\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/email-list-segmentation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">In fact, Hubspot has 30 of them</a></span>&nbsp;listed to help you get started. \n<img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter wp-image-74006 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/email-list-calendar.png\" alt=\"Where to find Email List on the Email Marketing Calendar\" width=\"1360\" height=\"193\" /> \n<div class=\"link-callout\"> \n <strong>Action Items:</strong> \n <ol> \n  <li><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/how-to-build-an-email-list/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Build your email list</a>.</li> \n  <li>Decide how you want to segment your email list.</li> \n  <li>Choose your segments&nbsp;based on where your subscribers are at in their buying process.</li> \n </ol> \n</div> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/?p=53803#toc\">Back to the Top</a></strong>\n</div> \n<a name=\"nine\"></a> \n<h2>Step 9: Consider Your Email Suppression List</h2> Once you identify who you are sending your emails to, you&nbsp;may&nbsp;need to determine who you are not sending your emails to. Maybe there is a group in your email list that needs to see a different message than the one you’ve planned for this campaign. Remember when you took all that time to segment your email marketing list? Now you can decide who doesn’t need to see specific emails you want to send. Add excluded segments to your calendar template. \n<img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter wp-image-74007 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/excluded-list.png\" alt=\"Where to find suppressed email lists on the email marketing calendar\" width=\"1360\" height=\"195\" /> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Action Items:</strong> Identify which of your email lists should be excluded from each&nbsp;campaign.\n</div> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/?p=53803#toc\">Back to the Top</a></strong>\n</div> \n<a name=\"ten\"></a> \n<h2>Step 10: Clarify the Goal of Your Email Campaign</h2> What goal do you want your email campaign to accomplish? Are you trying to sell more of a particular product or are you trying to build awareness for your brand? Setting goals touches every single part of your marketing including your emails. These goals help define the purpose of you sending your email in the first place. Each goal you create for your email campaigns should be S.M.A.R.T or: \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-85379 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/calendar-smart-goals.png\" alt=\"Email calendar SMART goals\" width=\"1361\" height=\"540\" /> Creating goals doesn’t have to be complicated. Since you know the topics of each of your campaigns, your goals should come naturally. For example, if you’re launching a new product, your goal could be to reach X amount of sales within one week. If you’re promoting a webinar, your goal will revolve around increasing your signups. \n<img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter wp-image-74008 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/campaign-goal.png\" alt=\"Where to find Campaign Goals on the email marketing calendar\" width=\"1360\" height=\"192\" /> &nbsp; \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/marketing-strategy/marketing-goals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How To Set SMART Marketing Goals</a>\n</div> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/?p=53803#toc\">Back to the Top</a></strong>\n</div> \n<a name=\"eleven\"></a> \n<h2>Step 11: Write Your Email&nbsp;Subject Lines</h2> Subject lines can be a bit of a pain to write. What makes a good subject line? Should&nbsp;you include emojis in your subject lines? What language should you add in your subject lines to help increase open rates? CoSchedule just made it easy to write great subject lines with the introduction of the&nbsp;\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/email-subject-line-tester\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Email Subject Line Tester</a></span>. \n<img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter wp-image-74455 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/email-subject-line-tester.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of the Email Subject Line Tester\" width=\"1360\" height=\"603\" /> Hit \n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Score My Subject Line,</span>&nbsp;and the tester will show you ways to improve your subject line: \n<img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter wp-image-74011 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/eslt-example-1.png\" alt=\"Example from the Email Subject Line Tester\" width=\"1360\" height=\"528\" /> Include at least two subject lines for your A/B test and record them on your calendar. \n<img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter wp-image-74017 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/subject-lines.png\" alt=\"Where to add subject lines to the email marketing calendar\" width=\"1360\" height=\"193\" /> \n<div class=\"link-callout\"> \n <strong>Action Items:</strong> \n <ol> \n  <li>Write potential subject lines.</li> \n  <li>Run them through the Email Subject Line Tester.</li> \n  <li>Choose your top two subject lines for your A/B test.</li> \n </ol> \n</div> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/?p=53803#toc\">Back to the Top</a></strong>\n</div> \n<a name=\"twelve\"></a> \n<h2>Step 12: Determine the Dates and Times Each Email Will Be Sent</h2> What date and time is each email being sent out on? This is an essential element to establish in your email marketing calendar because it allows your marketing team to determine when they need to start working on an email to make sure that it gets done on time. First, let’s cover the best time to send your emails. \n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/best-time-to-send-email/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">According to ten studies</a></span>&nbsp;the best times to send your emails are: \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-85380 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/best-time-for-email.png\" alt=\"Best time to send an email\" width=\"1361\" height=\"1190\" /> While the best days to send email are: \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-85381 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/email-calendar-day.png\" alt=\"The beset day to send an email\" width=\"1361\" height=\"1137\" /> Now that’s not to say that these are the times and days to send your emails on. You’ll need to experiment and see which days and times your audience prefers or is the most active. Try the following times and dates to start. \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-85382 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/test-email-time.png\" alt=\"Test for the best email times and days\" width=\"1361\" height=\"868\" /> Once you have the days and times determined for each of your emails sends you can work backward to determine when your team needs to start working on the campaign to get it done on time. For example, let’s say your email publishing workflow looks something like this: \n<ul> \n <li><em>Email campaign owner chooses campaign topics and number of sends: One Day</em></li> \n <li><em>Copywriters write emails: Two Days</em></li> \n <li><em>Copywriters edit emails: One Day</em></li> \n <li><em>Campaign owner approves emails: One Day</em></li> \n <li><em>Designers create images and videos: Three Days</em></li> \n <li><em>Designers edit images and videos: One Day</em></li> \n <li><em>Images and videos are approved by campaign owner: One Day</em></li> \n <li><em>Copy and graphics are added to email platform: One Day</em></li> \n <li><em>Email lists are chosen: One Day</em></li> \n <li><em>Email is ready for publish: One Day</em></li> \n</ul> In this case, your email marketing team would need to work on a campaign at least 13 days before it begins. You may even add extra buffer days in case the work gets off course. \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-85383 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/08/working-email-calendar.png\" alt=\"Your working email calendar\" width=\"1361\" height=\"1114\" /> Equipped with that information,&nbsp;you can select publish dates and times that maximize each email you send. Record your publish date times on your calendar. \n<img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter wp-image-74019 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/email-send-date.png\" alt=\"Where to find Email Send Date in the Email Marketing Calendar\" width=\"1360\" height=\"422\" /> \n<div class=\"link-callout\"> \n <strong>Action Items:</strong> \n <ol> \n  <li>Using the best times to send an email and your audience’s preferences, determine what time you’re going to send your emails.</li> \n  <li>Repeat the process to decide which days you’re going to send your emails on.</li> \n  <li>Use those dates to determine when your team needs to start working on each of your campaigns.</li> \n </ol> \n</div> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/?p=53803#toc\">Back to the Top</a></strong>\n</div> \n<a name=\"thirteen\"></a> \n<h2>Step 13: Plan Your Email Content</h2> Next, determine which content you'll share in each email. For the sake of this template, we will call each content block in your newsletter a \"lead story\". Each lead story should be a link, article, product, or other piece of content you'll place in the email. \n<strong>This doesn't need to be the exact email copy you'll write, just the items the email will promote</strong>. \n<img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter wp-image-74020 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/plan-email-content.png\" alt=\"Plan Your Email Content on the Email Marketing Calendar\" width=\"1360\" height=\"128\" /> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/?p=53803#toc\">Back to the Top</a></strong>\n</div> \n<a name=\"fourteen\"></a> \n<h2>Step 14: Include Links to Graphics and Videos That Need to Be in Each Email</h2> One of the last elements to record in your calendar are links to graphics and videos that have been created for each email in your campaign. This is important for your entire email marketing team because they need to be able to access which images and videos are associated with which email. If everything is in one folder, you run the risk of the wrong image being sent to the wrong email. \n<div class=\"link-callout\"> \n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <ul> \n  <li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/how-to-work-with-designers/\">How To Work With Designers With Authentic Advice From CoSchedule’s Designer</a></span></li> \n  <li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/color-psychology-marketing/\">The Know It All Guide To Color Psychology In Marketing + The Best Hex Chart</a></span></li> \n  <li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/how-to-make-an-infographic/\">How To Make An Infographic In 7 Easy Steps</a></span></li> \n </ul> \n</div> Each image and video should be linked to in your calendar, so it is easily accessible by the campaign owner. \n<img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter wp-image-74021 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/add-images-email-content.png\" alt=\"Where to add image links to the email marketing calendar\" width=\"1360\" height=\"256\" /> \n<div class=\"link-callout\"> \n <strong>Action Items:</strong> \n <ol> \n  <li>Work with designer to create graphics or videos for your emails.</li> \n  <li>Upload them to a file storing system like Dropbox or Google Drive.</li> \n  <li>Link back to the folder in your calendar.</li> \n </ol> \n</div> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/?p=53803#toc\">Back to the Top</a></strong>\n</div> \n<a name=\"fifteen\"></a> \n<h2>Step 15: Record the A/B Test Results of Your Subject Lines</h2> After you have sent your campaign, identify which of the two subject lines you created, won the A/B test. Most email service providers allow you to A/B test your subject lines within the platform. Based on how each subject line performs, your email platform will take the winning subject line and send it out to the rest of your list. \n<img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter wp-image-74018 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/test-results.png\" alt=\"Email A/B Test Results in the Email Marketing Calendar\" width=\"1360\" height=\"192\" /> \n<div class=\"link-callout\"> \n <strong>Action Items:</strong> \n <ol> \n  <li>Pull the results of your A/B test.</li> \n  <li>Record the winning subject line.</li> \n </ol> \n</div> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/?p=53803#toc\">Back to the Top</a></strong>\n</div> \n<a name=\"coschedule\"></a> \n<h2>How to Plan, Organize, and Schedule Email Content With CoSchedule</h2> The spreadsheet-based template included in this post is a great low-cost option to get started, but you might soon find it's somewhat limited. In that case, it may be time to consider using CoSchedule's marketing calendar and Content Organizer with email service provider integrations (MailChimp, Campaign Monitor, Active Campaign, and Constant Contact). Here's how to get set up and apply this process using CoSchedule. \n<h3>Setting Up Your Account</h3> Follow a few simple steps to get started: \n<ol> \n <li><strong>Connect your selected ESP</strong>. You can choose your provider under Settings.</li> \n <li><strong>Add team members to your account, if you haven't already</strong>. Give your team visibility into your email marketing strategy.</li> \n <li><strong>Head over to the Marketing Calendar</strong>. This is where you'll get started creating your email.</li> \n</ol> \n<img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter wp-image-74025 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/cos-calendar.png\" alt=\"Example of the CoSchedule Calendar\" width=\"1360\" height=\"671\" /> Alternately, if you prefer to manage projects using a Kanban board, you can also use the Kanban Project Dashboard. \n<img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter wp-image-74026 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/kanban-project-dashboard-example-1.png\" alt=\"Example of the Kanban Project Dashboard\" width=\"1360\" height=\"620\" /> \n<h3>Add an Email Newsletter to Your Marketing Calendar</h3> Now, if you have your email service provider connected to CoSchedule, you can start planning and scheduling email content. To begin, either click a day on the calendar, or click on the \n<strong>+Create</strong> button on the calendar. \n<img class=\"drop-shadow alignnone wp-image-74334 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/cos-calendar-copy-12.png\" alt=\"Example of the CoSchedule Calendar\" width=\"1360\" height=\"671\" /> If you're using the Kanban Project Dashboard, you can start by clicking the \n<strong>+</strong> at the top of a column, or by clicking \n<strong>+Create</strong>. \n<img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter wp-image-74027 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/create-email.png\" alt=\"Progress dropdown menu for projects\" width=\"1360\" height=\"621\" /> \n<h3>Add a Description</h3> Here's a quick look at what the interface looks like within a project in CoSchedule. While we'll go through each area you see below shortly, for now, enter a text description of your email in the Description field. \n<img class=\"drop-shadow alignnone wp-image-74335 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/enter-text-description-13.png\" alt=\"Enter a text description in CoSchedule\" width=\"1360\" height=\"396\" /> \n<h3>Add Tags for Email Type, Buying Season, and Email List</h3> Next, you can use tags to organize email content by some of the other elements mentioned earlier in this post, like the type of email, buying season it's aimed at, email list segments that should receive it, or anything else that makes sense for your needs. Start by clicking \n<strong>+Tag</strong> underneath the Description field, and you'll see a list of tags you've created. \n<img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter wp-image-74029 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/add-tag.png\" alt=\"Add a tag in CoSchedule\" width=\"1360\" height=\"578\" /> Now, how do you actually create and set which tags are available in your account? Head over to \n<strong>Settings</strong> in the left-hand navigation. \n<img class=\"drop-shadow alignnone wp-image-74339 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/find-settings-copy-14.png\" alt=\"Find calendar settings\" width=\"1360\" height=\"929\" /> Then, scroll down a bit to and add custom tags. \n<img class=\"drop-shadow alignnone wp-image-74346 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/add-custom-tags-copy-15.png\" alt=\"Add custom tags in Coschedule\" width=\"1360\" height=\"241\" /> \n<h3>Set Up a Workflow Using Task Templates + Custom Statuses</h3> When your team works on creating your email content, they'll need a clear workflow to follow. Planning those workflows into checklists will help keep production on track, ensure that deadlines are met, and remove ambiguity around who is doing what and when they'll get it done. You can do this in CoSchedule using \n<strong>Task Templates</strong>. In the screenshot below, you'll see a few things: \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Where to find your Task Templates</strong>. They're labelled in the upper right of your screen.</li> \n <li><strong>A list of templates</strong>. You can create multiple checklists for all different types of projects — not just email.</li> \n <li><strong>Controls to create, save, and duplicate task templates</strong>. This is easy to do.</li> \n</ul> \n<img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter wp-image-74033 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/add-task-template-1.png\" alt=\"Add a task template\" width=\"1360\" height=\"1084\" /> Let's click on the Email Newsletter task template we have created. This will apply a checklist — note that you can customize your own task templates any way you'd like — that looks like this: \n<img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter wp-image-74034 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/task-template-example-3.png\" alt=\"Add new tasks to your task template in CoSchedule\" width=\"1360\" height=\"348\" /> On the right, you'll see a few things on the checklist: \n<ul> \n <li><strong>The name of each task</strong>. What needs to get done?</li> \n <li><strong>When each task is due</strong>. You can easily adjust these deadlines.</li> \n <li><strong>Who is responsible for each task</strong>. They can check off each task when it's complete.</li> \n</ul> Now, it's likely someone on your team will need to review work before it can be considered complete. CoSchedule supports this with Task Approvals, and they're easy to set up as well. Start by clicking into a task, and then adding a team member who will need to approve that task before it can be checked off. \n<img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter wp-image-74035 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/add-task-approval.png\" alt=\"Assign tasks to team members and who the tasks need approval from\" width=\"1360\" height=\"1052\" /> As work progresses on your email, you can also use Custom Statuses to indicate its level of progress. You can see the status in the bottom right. \n<img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter wp-image-74037 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/custom-statuses.png\" alt=\"Customize your task progress\" width=\"1360\" height=\"1230\" /> \n<h3>Write an Email Subject Line Using the Built-In Email Subject Line Tester</h3> Once it's time to start writing your email, begin with the subject line. You can use either the standalone web version of CoSchedule's Email Subject Line Tester to start, or you can use it, built-in, with CoSchedule. \n<img class=\"drop-shadow alignnone wp-image-74347 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/built-in-eslt-16.png\" alt=\"Coschedule email subject line tester\" width=\"1360\" height=\"607\" /> \n<h3>Manage Workflow in CoSchedule + Set Up the Email Newsletter in Your Email Service Provider</h3> Next, you'll need to create your email content in your email service provider, but you can plan the content and organize your copy — provided you're writing copy using Google Docs or Word — in CoSchedule. Here's one way to consider approaching this. If you're creating content in Google Docs, then attach your Google Doc as an attachment to your project. You can also attach a Word Doc as a file, link content from Google Drive or Dropbox, or write copy directly in CoSchedule with the built-in text editor — use the option that best suits your workflow. \n<img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter wp-image-74041 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/add-attachment.png\" alt=\"Add project attachment\" width=\"1360\" height=\"794\" /> This makes your email copy easily accessible. You can then use Discussion Threads to discuss the email as your team collaborates throughout the process. If you have images that will be designed for the email, you can use Discussion Threads to pass the files along and share feedback for review purposes as well. \n<img class=\"drop-shadow aligncenter wp-image-74042 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/use-discussion-threads.png\" alt=\"Using Discussion Threads\" width=\"1360\" height=\"396\" /> Then, once all your assets are created, you can set up the email in your ESP, and be ready for the final step. \n<h3>Schedule Send Date and Time</h3> Finally, it's time to actually schedule your email's delivery time and date. If you're using MailChimp, you can adjust the day and time within CoSchedule or in your ESP. Other ESPs are one-way sync only, meaning that you'll need to schedule the day and time within the ESP, but your send day and time will then be reflected on your CoSchedule calendar, too. \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/?p=53803#toc\">Back to the Top</a></strong>\n</div> \n<a name=\"conclusion\"></a> \n<h2><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\">Start Using Your Email Marketing Calendar to Get Organized</span></h2> Now that you have the tools and knowledge to improve your email calendar for everyday marketing, try out your newfound skills on your marketing newsletter.

Shouldn’t you have those down by now? You might, but a brush-up never hurt anyone. There’s also the fact that the what’s now considered a basic marketing skill may have changed from what it was ten years ago. Plus, the basics are what build your foundation as a successful marketer. If they start to crumble, the rest of your skill set will go right along with it. Here are the 50 basic skills that should be on every marketer’s resumé. \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-84154 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/50-marketing-skills.png\" alt=\"50 marketing skills you need to succeed.\" width=\"1361\" height=\"4968\" /> [Tweet \"50 Basic Marketing Skills That Should Be in Your Wheelhouse.\"] \n<h3>The Ability to Write Well</h3> Writing is the foundation of everything else that a marketer does. Without strong writing skills, everything else you do will falter. Writing comes into play whenever you’re creating ad copy, social media posts, press releases, and so much more. You need to be able to comprehensively communicate your message at all times. \n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Recommend Reading: </span>&nbsp;\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/content-writing-tips/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">40 Content Writing Tips to Make You a Better Marketer Now</a></span> \n<h3>Internal Communication Skills</h3> As a marketer, you’re not just communicating with your target audience. You’re communicating internally with your co-workers and boss as well. Keeping clear and consistent messaging within your marketing team means you can get more done, and you don’t have to worry about another team member running a project off the rails. In addition to communicating with your co-workers, you also need to be able to talk to your boss and upper management. Can you explain your projects and anticipate the questions or concerns they’ll have in advance? \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/3045455/5-tips-to-create-effective-internal-communications-with-your-team\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">5 Tips to Create Effective Internal Communications With Your Team </a>\n</div> \n<h3>Interpersonal Communication Skills</h3> Interpersonal communication skills go hand in hand with internal communication skills. This particular skill set, however, is focused on how things are said, not just what has been said. The reality of the situation is that we are all human, and therefore we’re always communicating with each other — whether we intend to or not. As a marketer, you need to be aware of the people around you and what you are intentionally or unintentionally saying at all times. \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <a href=\"https://www.thebalance.com/interpersonal-skills-list-2063724\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Interpersonal Skills List and Examples</a>\n</div> \n<h3>Be a Confident Public Speaker</h3> Whether you’re standing up in front of your boss or client in the middle of a pitch meeting or giving a live press conference, public speaking is inevitable. While that may have made you cringe in your high school speech class, the fact of the matter is that, as a marketer, you need to be able to pitch your project or your product with ease. If you appear to have confidence in what you’re saying your audience will, too. \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/236611\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">5 Easy Ways to Become a Better Public Speaker -- Fast</a>\n</div> \n<h3>Maintain an Attitude of Lifelong Learning</h3> Another basic skill that should be on the resumé of every marketer is maintaining the attitude of lifelong learning. As marketers, we’re always taking in new information — whether that be a new advertising tactic or a research report that’s been published about our target audience. In other words, our job of learning new things is never done. The minute you close yourself off and think you know everything there is to know, you’ll end up falling behind. Read every book you can get your hands on and listen to a podcast or two on your way to work. \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <a href=\"https://www.teachthought.com/learning/10-simple-ways-to-engage-in-lifelong-learning/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">10 Simple Ways to Engage in Lifelong Learning</a>\n</div> \n<h3>Be Type A Organized</h3> You wear many hats and balance many, many projects, which means that you need to be organized. Why? Because one misstep and $50,000 could fly out the window like *snaps* that. Staying organized helps you avoid that because you and your marketing team members will be able to see what’s coming, plan in advance, and side-step massive mishaps. \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/marketing-project-management/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Complete 16-Step Marketing Project Management Process That Will Get You Organized</a>\n</div> \n<h3>Know How to Select KPIs</h3> \n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://blog.kissmetrics.com/ceos-dont-trust-marketing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">73% of CEOs</a></span>&nbsp;believe that marketers “lack business credibility and the ability to generate significant growth.” Ouch. That's because it’s easy to dismiss marketers as people in the corner drawing pretty pictures who don’t do anything. Yeah, I know. It makes my blood boil, too. How do you solve all of that? You set goals that directly impact business objectives and your company's CEO actually cares about. By creating goals that have a direct and positive impact on your business, you can show your efforts are paying off. \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/marketing-strategy/marketing-goals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How to Set SMART Marketing Goals</a>\n</div> \n<h3>Understand the Difference Between Goals, Strategies, and Tactics</h3> Let’s face it; goals, strategies,&nbsp;and tactics go hand in hand when it comes to marketing, so it’s easy to confuse them with each other. However, being able to tell the distinction between the three is going to ensure you don’t get tripped up on one of them during your marketing process. Goals are the objectives that have been set by your marketing team that you need to meet by the end of a specified time period. Strategies are the organized plans that are composed of different tactics that outline how to reach your goals. Your tactics, on the other hand, are the steps that you take to help you achieve your goals. \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikalbelicove/2013/09/27/understanding-goals-strategies-objectives-and-tactics-in-the-age-of-social/#a08ca9d4c796\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Understanding Goals, Strategy, Objectives and Tactics in the Age of Social</a>\n</div> \n<h3>Be an Active Listener</h3> We all know that one person in our lives who is just waiting for their chance to speak in a conversation. What you’re saying is mostly going in one ear and out the other. As a marketer, you cannot afford to passively ignore your customers or your co-workers. Which is why being an active listener is an essential skill any marketer worth their salt knows how to do. Actively listening to the people around you means that you can find out the messages they need to hear. Doing this can help you perfect your campaigns and, hopefully, convert more people into paying customers. \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <a href=\"https://www.mindtools.com/CommSkll/ActiveListening.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Active Listening: Hear What People are Really Saying</a>\n</div> \n<h3>Know How to Collaborate Across Multiple Teams</h3> Your marketing team doesn’t exist in a vacuum where it’s you vs. everyone else in your company. You need to be able to collaborate across multiple teams to complete your projects. This could mean working with developers, your video team, your product team, and more. All of that cross team collaboration means you need to know how to manage and communicate, so everyone who is involved in one project is always on the same page. \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <a href=\"https://highfive.com/blog/5-ways-improve-cross-team-collaboration/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">5 Ways to Improve Cross Team Collaboration</a>\n</div> \n<h3>Research Everything</h3> Marketing is part strategic intuition; part research to see what everyone else is doing. Successful marketers can research current trends and strategies to figure out which ones would work best for their company. There’s always new information out there for marketers to research and gather.

Part of marketing involves simply testing these new things to see if they’re going to work. You’ll never know if something is going to work or not unless you try. Who knows, maybe your next great marketing tactic is the one you haven’t tried yet. \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <a href=\"https://hbr.org/1975/05/when-where-and-how-to-test-market\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">When, Where, and How to Test Market</a>\n</div> \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong><a href=\"http://coschedule.com/blog/?p=29102#toc\">Back to the Top</a></strong>\n</div> \n<a name=\"design\"></a> \n<h2>6&nbsp;Introductory Design Skills Every Marketer Should Have</h2> [Tweet \"6&nbsp;Introductory Design Skills Every Marketer Should Have.\"] Graphic design or any design is vital for marketers to understand. Why? Because design helps us communicate the message that we want to send to our audience. You may not be at the same level as the graphic designer on your team, but having a basic grasp of necessary design skills can help you communicate what you need and pinpoint what worked and why. \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-84155 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/introductory-design-skills.png\" alt=\"6 introductory design skills marketers should have.\" width=\"1361\" height=\"1139\" /> \n<h3>Understand How Responsive Design Works</h3> With the addition of tablets, mobile phones, and more, the way we access information is changing. The standard one-size-fits-all website no longer applies because there are tons of different screen sizes out there. That’s where responsive design comes in. As a marketer, you need to understand how your message will look across a variety of different formats and ensure that it communicates the same idea. \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <a href=\"http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/beginners-guide-to-responsive-web-design\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Beginner’s Guide to Responsive Web Design</a>\n</div> \n<h3>Grasp the Basics of Adobe Creative Suite</h3> Adobe is well known for their design products. Photoshop, InDesign, and Illustrator are just three of the tools that can help bring the images inside your head to life in an online format. Having a basic understanding of how those two programs work can help you and your designer save time. How? If you need a social media graphic that has to go out in 20 minutes, you can now do it yourself. It’s also nice to have an idea of the limitations this type of software might have, so you can know what to expect when requesting something from your designers. \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <a href=\"https://helpx.adobe.com/creative-cloud/tutorials-explore.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Creative Cloud Tutorials</a>\n</div> \n<h3>Knowing How UX and UI Plays a Role in Your Customer Interaction</h3> The way you’ve designed your website and the experience your customer has interacting with it can affect the way they see your marketing messages.

Which means that marketers need a specific set of skills to stand out in this new landscape. If you don’t stay on top of your skills and techniques, there’s a good chance your content will be buried in an avalanche of other stuff. End of story. The following are seven simple skills you should have a grasp on. \n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-84157 size-full\" src=\"https://media.coschedule.com/uploads/2020/07/social-media-skills.png\" alt=\"7 social media skills for marketers.\" width=\"1361\" height=\"1140\" /> \n<h3>Know How to Write for Each Social Channel</h3> Not all social media messages are created equal. What works for one channel may not go over as well on another. For example, hashtags are great when they’re used on Twitter and Instagram, but they don’t do much for Facebook posts. Knowing the differences between the message types that need to go on each channel can help your content stand out in a sea of other stuff. \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/social-media-content-creation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How to Write the Best Social Media Posts [Backed By 6,399,322 Messages + 11 Studies]</a>\n</div> \n<h3>Have a Decent Amount of Social Media Algorithm Knowledge</h3> Social media algorithms are intelligent systems that sort through content and showcase what it believes the user would most likely want to see — based on interactions from previous content. These algorithms can’t be tricked or fooled. You can’t post your content and then try and trick the algorithm into showing it to more of your fans. Well, you could, but that’s going to backfire on you sooner rather than later. Algorithms are the social network's way of telling you what content they want to see posted to their newsfeeds. After all, you are advertising and posting content on someone else’s turf. For example, live video is going over well on Facebook. Therefore, it would make sense to assume that the Facebook algorithm rewards live video content. If you want to boost your presence on Facebook, you could consider creating more live videos. \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <a href=\"https://forgeandsmith.com/how-do-social-media-algorithms-affect-you/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How Do Social Media Algorithms Affect You?</a>\n</div> \n<h3>Be Able to Keep Up With Social Trends and Ideas</h3> The social media landscape changes at an incredibly fast pace. The minute you’ve got something down, something new surfaces, and you’re off to the races again. A proficient social media marketer (or a marketer, in general) can keep up with those changes by continually thinking ahead and keeping their social strategy head on a metaphorical swivel. Maximize those trends before they hit their peak and get ready to move on to the next one. \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/dakota-shane/social-media-trends-change-quickly-this-6-step-guide-will-help-you-keep-up.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Social Media Trends Change Quickly. This 6-Step Guide Will Help You Keep Up</a>\n</div> \n<h3>Understand How to Select Social Channels That Make Sense for Your Business</h3> Social media networks appear and disappear. A new one may surface, but that doesn’t mean it’s going to be the next Facebook or Twitter. As a marketer, it’s up to you to decide whether or not joining a new network is best for your business. Just because Pinterest works for one company, doesn’t mean it will work for you. You need to follow your audience and let them lead you to where they are. \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/social-media-marketing-strategy/#channel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How to Create the Best Documented Social Media Marketing Strategy in Eight Steps</a>\n</div> \n<h3>Understand Marketing Strategy and How to Apply It to Social Media</h3> A skill that marketers must have is being able to see and understand the marketing strategy that goes into creating a social media presence. Don’t just chuck your social media profiles to an unsuspecting college grad and assume that because they’re young, they’ll know how to get your company noticed on social. No. Wrong. Do not pass Go, do not collect $200. Social media, like every other one of its marketing counterparts, requires strategic thinking, planning, and execution. This means you can’t just throw up a bunch of posts consistently and hope it works. You need to apply the same marketing methodologies you'd use for any other channel and apply it to your social strategy. That includes understanding your audience, writing great copy, understanding analytics, and more. \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <a href=\"https://coschedule.com/blog/social-media-content-strategy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How to Develop a Winning Social Media Content Strategy (Free Template)</a>\n</div> \n<h3>Know How to Generate Creative Campaign Concepts</h3> Campaigns are a considerable part of the social media presence your business creates. Because there is such a massive amount of content out there, you need to be as creative as possible to stand out. Take Arby’s, for example. Their entire Facebook presence is dedicated to nerdy references reenacted by everything from curly fries to ketchup packets. \n<div class=\"fb-video\" data-href=\"https://www.facebook.com/arbys/videos/10156107898326812/\" data-width=\"770\" data-show-text=\"false\"> \n <blockquote class=\"fb-xfbml-parse-ignore\" cite=\"https://www.facebook.com/arbys/videos/10156107898326812/\">\n  Exterminate!

Take CoSchedule’s blog, for example. One of our core pillars is centered around actionability or going beyond giving advice and showing people how to execute it. Whether it’s a simple step-by-step video on how to use your product or an in-depth explanation blog post, use your space to teach your audience want they need to know. \n<div class=\"link-callout\">\n <strong>Recommended Reading:</strong> \n <a href=\"https://www.crazyegg.com/blog/make-your-content-actionable/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">7 Ways to Make Your Content More Actionable</a>\n</div> \n<h3>Be Persuasive</h3> Part of being a good marketer involves being able to be persuasive.

Start small at first — maybe subscribe to a blog or two as you begin to integrate reading into your routine add in a variety of books, magazines and more. To stay on top of news or to find sources, try tools like \n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://feedly.com/i/welcome\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Feedly</a></span>&nbsp;or \n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://flipboard.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Flipboard</a></span>.
