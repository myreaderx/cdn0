The same is true for efficient onboarding. The faster new employees are onboarded, the faster they &nbsp;feel they’re part of the team and can contribute to your company’s mission.</p>\n  <p>Here are a few tips to help you onboard new employees without a hitch.</p>\n  <h2>1. Set up an onboarding checklist, save to Team Drives</h2>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph_with_image\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid uni-paragraph-wrap\">\n   <div class=\"uni-paragraph h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3\" data-component=\"uni-article-paragraph\">\n    <figure class=\"article-image--wrap-medium \">\n     <img alt=\"Google Keep work hacks\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/workhacks_blog.max-1000x1000.png\" />\n    </figure>\n    <div class=\"rich-text\">\n     <p>To help new employees get up-to-speed quickly, create centralized resources like an onboard checklist or company backgrounder in <a href=\"https://goo.gl/dVwwof\">Google Keep</a> or <a href=\"https://goo.gl/28GfVf\">Docs</a>.</p>\n     <p>Your new team member can track to-dos by listing out key tasks in Keep. Create a note in Keep and select “Show checkboxes” in the three dots menu. Type in to-dos like “set up HR benefits,” “outline goals” or “meet with Anish about process.”</p>\n     <p>Pro-tip: Keep integrates directly into Docs. If you’re in Keep, pick a specific note, click the three dots menu and select “Copy to Google Doc.” Or if you’re in Docs, drag-and-drop your note over from Keep.</p>\n     <p>You can also prepare a more detailed company background for your teammate in Docs. List upcoming projects, assign action items or include other reference material like key contacts. Once you’ve created these resources, be sure to save them to your <a href=\"https://goo.gl/GoxZ6S\">Team Drives</a> so that the “newbie” knows where to find or upload files for team use.</p>\n    </div>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <h2>2. Create an onboarding portal with Google Sites</h2>\n  <br />\n  <p>Now that you’ve created individual resources for an employee, create a mini-onboarding portal in <a href=\"https://goo.gl/6EbWg2\">Sites</a> to house them. What’s great about Sites is that you don’t have to be handy with code to build a website—you can spin one up quickly without design, programming or IT resources. Sites also syncs with your favorite G Suite apps, like <a href=\"https://goo.gl/GZTXYs\">Drive</a> and <a href=\"https://goo.gl/5hRUwN\">Calendar</a>.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \">\n    <img alt=\"Sites GIF\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/GSuite_Workhacks_TrainingHub_gif_r1_1_1.gif\" />\n   </figure>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <h2>3. Request access to IT systems and equipment using Forms</h2>\n  <p>Sometimes it can take a while to get access to the tools we need to do our jobs, but G Suite apps can help you get around the lag. Help your IT department set up equipment and system access on day one using Forms and Sheets.</p>\n  <p>If you’re a manager or work in the human resources department, try using <a href=\"https://goo.gl/vaxUSx\">Forms</a> to submit requests to IT before a new employee starts. Create a form for equipment and access needs, like computers (shameless plug: <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/topics/connected-workspaces/introducing-chrome-enterprise/\">Chromebooks</a>), keyboards, phones or IT system permissions. The IT team can then import requests from Forms into <a href=\"https://goo.gl/kWsYCL\">Sheets</a> and keep track of needs in real-time.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \">\n    <img alt=\"GIF 3 work hacks\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/WorkHacks_EquipForm_BLog.gif\" />\n   </figure>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <h2>4.

You never have to worry if you’re working on the most up-to-date version of a document because your apps do that for you.</p>\n  <p>But for the times that you need to go back and <a href=\"https://support.google.com/docs/answer/190843?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;hl=en\">see changes</a>, it’s simple. Go to <b>File &gt; Version history &gt; See version</b> history and view a complete list of changes to your document in one place. You can restore previous versions of a document there, too.</p>\n  <p>Another trick is to simply click the text at the top of your navigation bar that says “last edit was…” or “all changes saved” in Google Docs. If you hover over that text, it will actually tell you what the last change to the document was and who made it. Or if you’re returning to a document, you can click “See new changes” and the Doc will highlight edits that have been made since your last visit.</p>\n  <p>Read on for more tips on how to keep track of work in G Suite.</p>\n  <h3><b>Take it a step further</b></h3>\n  <p>Beyond viewing versions, there are other cool things you can do to keep track of work in G Suite. You can:</p>\n  <p><b>1. Make copies of specific versions</b>.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>This is great for sharing “before” and “after” versions of your work with your boss. You can make copies of specific versions within version history. Click the three dot icon next to your selected version and choose “make a copy” to have a second record.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \">\n    <img alt=\"make copies.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/make_copies.gif\" />\n   </figure>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p><b>2. Name specific versions of your work.</b>&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>In version history, you can keep track of your work by naming individual versions in your list. Because all of your changes are saved in the cloud, it’s easy to go back and change version names instead of having ten different versions of a “Final” document floating in email threads. Bonus points for creative names!</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \">\n    <img alt=\"name specific versions.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/name_specific_versions.gif\" />\n   </figure>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p><b>3. See who’s viewed your work and when.</b>&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>If you’ve ever wondered who specifically has looked at your work, there’s a way for you to view activity within Google Docs, Sheets or Slides. Those folks who use paid versions can go to <b>Tools &gt; Activity</b> dashboard and see detail about the number of people reviewing their document, who specifically has reviewed and viewership trends. If you want to get there quicker, you can use this keyboard shortcut to see the activity dashboard: Ctrl + Alt/Option + T, then click Z.</p>\n  <p><b>4. Set up notifications to see when changes are made in Sheets.</b>&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>If you’re working in a spreadsheet to track a project, you may want to see regular updates for when changes are made. You can set up notifications to alert you of changes immediately after someone changes data in a cell.

Now, if you have data organized in a spreadsheet, Sheets can intelligently suggest a pivot table for you.</p>In the Explore panel, you can also ask questions of your data using everyday language (via natural language processing) and have the answer returned as a pivot table. For example, type “what is the sum of revenue by salesperson?” or “how much revenue does each product category generate?” and Sheets can help you find the right pivot table analysis.\n  <br />\n  <p></p>\n  <p></p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <figure class=\"article-image--full article-module \">\n  <img alt=\"Pivot GIF #2\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/LAUNCHsheetbundle_blog_1_Bo6LIQT.gif\" />\n </figure>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>In addition, if you want to create a pivot table from scratch, Sheets can suggest a number of relevant tables in the pivot table editor to help you summarize your data faster.</p>\n  <h2>Suggested formulas, quicker answers</h2>\n  <p>We often use basic spreadsheet formulas like =SUM or =AVERAGE for data analysis, but it takes time to make sure all inputs are written correctly.

Stay tuned here and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GoogleForEdu\">follow along on Twitter</a> throughout the week to see how we’re celebrating.</i></p>\n  <p>In the two years since we launched <a href=\"https://gsuite.google.com/learning-center/products/forms/quizzes-get-started/#!/\">Quizzes in Google Forms</a>, educators have expanded the possibilities of the tool both inside and outside the classroom. Today, we’re announcing six new features based on valuable feedback from teachers and designed to help educators continue using Quizzes in Google Forms in creative ways:</p>\n  <p><b>1. Quiz answer suggestions:</b> Using Google’s machine learning, Forms can now predict the correct answer as a teacher types the question, as well as provide options for wrong answers. If you give a pop quiz on U.S. capitals, this new feature will predict all the right capitals for every single state—and even throw in some curveballs, like Charlotte Amalie and San Juan. <br /></p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <figure class=\"article-image--full article-module \">\n  <img alt=\"FormsLaunchCorrectAnswer.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/FormsLaunchCorrectAnswer.gif\" />\n </figure>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p><b>2. Autocomplete answers</b><b>:</b>Machine learning is also helping educators save time with more predictive analysis. After you type one answer, Forms will now propose related answers. For example, if a question requires the days of the week as answer options, Google Forms will autocomplete the remaining answers. Additionally, this feature is now available in 14 languages, including Spanish, French, Chinese, German and Arabic. “I love this feature, it saves so much time. The ability to start typing something and have Forms start suggesting things before you’re even done typing is pretty cool,” says Chris Webb, a math teacher at John Rennie High School in Montreal.<br /></p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <figure class=\"article-image--full article-module \">\n  <img alt=\"Autocomplete answers\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/FormsLaunchAutoCompSugg_blog.gif\" />\n </figure>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p></p>\n  <b>3. Automatically grade checkbox and multiple choice grid questions:</b>Grading quizzes can be time consuming, which is why we built a \n  <a href=\"https://gsuite.google.com/learning-center/products/forms/quizzes-get-started/#!/section-3\">new way</a> to automate the process. Now, in checkbox grid and multiple choice grid-style questions, you can denote correct answers in the answer key, and completed quizzes are automatically assigned points based on answers. “Previously, there was a lot of repetition for teachers trying to ask these types of questions. But this [feature] saves time, collects all the data in a sheet in a way that's really smart, and gives teachers full control over grading,” says Webb.\n  <br />\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <figure class=\"article-image--full article-module \">\n  <img alt=\"Automatically grade checkbox and multiple choice grid questions\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/03_Social_GIF_1280x720.gif\" />\n </figure>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <b>4. Give decimal grades:</b>You can give partial credit on a paper quiz, and now you have the same flexibility in Google Forms. If an answer is partially correct, you can give a half or quarter point, making grades more precise. Like all grades in Google Forms, these are automatically added up and \n  <a href=\"https://support.google.com/edu/classroom/answer/7627459?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=6163289\">can be synced with Google Classroom</a>. \n  <br />\n  <p><br /></p>\n  <p><b>5.&nbsp;Improve understanding with YouTube video feedback:</b>You can now give <a href=\"https://support.google.com/docs/answer/7032287#question_by_question\">highly customized feedback</a> to students by attaching a video from YouTube. If a student doesn’t understand a concept or could use extra practice, link them to any YouTube video so they can review material on their own.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <figure class=\"article-image--full article-module \">\n  <img alt=\"EDU_VideoFeedback.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/EDU_VideoFeedback.gif\" />\n </figure>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p><b>6. See the total number of points in a quiz:</b>Teachers told us they would like a way to quickly reference the total number of points in a quiz as they’re editing.

Fortunately, there are many ways to keep Chromebooks and G Suite up and running even when online access is slow or unavailable. We’ve pulled together ideas for educators and school IT teams who want to encourage all students to keep learning, regardless of their online access.&nbsp;</p>\n  <h3>For edtech and IT teams: The basics of enabling offline access</h3>\n  <p>Using Chromebooks and G Suite without Wi-Fi or low connectivity is relatively easy, but you may want to enlist your EdTech and IT teams to <a href=\"https://support.google.com/a/answer/7684186?hl=en\">set up offline access for everyone</a>. Here are the key steps in the process, along with useful Google support links.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>Keep in mind that people need to go through this process while they still have online access. Consider taking a few minutes to guide students and staff through the process while they’re on school Wi-Fi networks.</p>\n  <p>Step 1: To help students, teachers and staff work in G Suite offline, the first step is to enable offline access for all users. Your IT or EdTech team can do this from G Suite’s admin console using <a href=\"https://support.google.com/a/answer/1642623?hl=en\">these instructions</a> for managed devices; in the Features and Applications section of the Admin console, administrators can click “Allow users to enable offline access.”&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>Step 2: G Suite users also need to download the <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-docs-offline/ghbmnnjooekpmoecnnnilnnbdlolhkhi\">Google Docs Offline extension</a> for Chrome Browser, which will allow them to use Google Docs, Sheets, Drive and Slides without online access.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>Step 3: Finally, people should turn on offline access for the G Suite applications they’d like to use before they go offline. Share <a href=\"https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2375012\">these instructions</a> for opening G Suite files offline. It’s a good idea to ask students to test that offline access is working properly; help them turn off Wi-Fi access and try to access a G Suite file. Students can download notes from Slides, Docs, and more, and download the lectures from Classroom and Drive to watch later if they do not have internet at home.</p>\n  <h3>For teachers: Things to do offline</h3>\n  <p>Remind students that even if they don’t have Wi-Fi access away from school, there’s a lot that they can <a href=\"https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/3214688?hl=en\">do with their Chromebooks</a>:</p>\n  <ul>\n   <li><p>Read and respond to emails. Once the IT administrator <a href=\"https://support.google.com/a/answer/7684186?hl=en\">enables offline access</a>, they can read and write emails. The emails are sent as soon as students get back online.&nbsp;</p></li>\n   <li><p>Take, view and <a href=\"https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/1751068\">edit photos and videos</a>.&nbsp;</p></li>\n   <li><p>Take notes in the <a href=\"https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/3214688?hl=en\">Google Keep app</a>.&nbsp;</p></li>\n   <li><p>Work on <a href=\"https://support.google.com/docs/answer/6388102\">Google Docs, Sheets, and Drive</a> files.&nbsp;</p></li>\n  </ul>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <h3>For edtech and IT teams: Chrome extensions that work offline</h3>\n  <p>Encourage students to use Chrome extensions that help them do classwork while offline—and ask your edtech or IT team to <a href=\"https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/6306504?hl=en\">push out the extensions</a> to all G Suite and Chromebook users. Search the<a href=\"https://chromebookapphub.withgoogle.com/ideas\">Chromebook App Hub</a> or the <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions\">Chrome Web Store</a> using the “runs offline” option to find useful extensions, or start with <a href=\"https://chromebookapphub.withgoogle.com/apps/screencastify\">Screencastify</a> for recording and editing videos and <a href=\"https://chromebookapphub.withgoogle.com/apps/soundtrap-for-education\">Soundtrap</a> for recording and saving audio files.&nbsp;</p>\n  <h3>Tips from teachers</h3>\n  <p>Teachers are already brainstorming creative ways to help students without home online access continue their studies:</p>\n  <p><b>Create a “file upload” feature in Google Forms:</b>Eric Lawson, director of technology at Maine’s York School Department, shared that you can create a Google Form directly from Google Classroom. One of the question options in Google Forms is to create a “file upload.” This allows for students to work on podcasts, videos, journals, infographics, etc. and simply submit them to their teacher through a form. On a day where students may not have internet access, they can still work on their project offline on their Chromebooks at home and then submit the file when they have access.</p>\n  <p><b>Offer mobile hotspot access:</b>At Grain Valley Schools in Missouri, Kyle Pace, director of technology, plans to remind students that they can check out mobile hotspot devices from the school’s libraries—just as they’d check out books.</p>\n  <p>If you use Google Classroom and want to make sure students can view assignments offline, follow this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48NnlPf-rog\">YouTube tutorial</a> from Stewart Lee, technology integration coordinator with Anderson School District 3 in South Carolina.<br /></p>\n </div>\n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 13 Mar 2020 19:30:00 +0000","feedId":5824,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"232f1aa1a1340ebca9e38e2ed98dafe1","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GoogleDocsBlog/~4/m1AAxAiUPH4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn91@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-44-02-640_f40fc89822b642b1.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598308920719},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:42:00","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:42:00","title":"What’s that you say?

However, they didn’t work very well, particularly in noisy backgrounds, so she eventually stopped wearing them.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>A few years later on a school bus in Bethesda, MD, nine-year-old Abigail sat next to a classmate who taught her how to communicate using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Sign_Language\">American Sign Language</a>. In high school, she worked in a biology lab at the <a href=\"https://nei.nih.gov/\">National Eye Institute</a>where she researched retinitis pigmentosa, a genetic disorder that causes loss of vision.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>Flash forward to today where we, Laura and Abigail, work at Google, building products with accessibility features that help billions of users across the globe. We met earlier, through the accessibility community at MIT, where we studied computer science with the hopes of using our technical skills to make a difference in people’s lives.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>During our time at university, Abigail built a solution that helped a blind man use his touch-screen oven, led a team that enabled blind individuals to sign legal documents independently, and co-founded an <a href=\"http://assistivetech.mit.edu/athack/\">assistive technology hackathon</a>. Laura researched a <a href=\"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2331216517710354\">new signal processing algorithm</a> for hearing aids in noisy environments, built an app for residents in a neurological disease care facility to <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/08/08/mit-students-patient-collaborate-app/bW0DDqu7fGz55fmuz27ZKO/story.html\">call for help in a more accessible way</a>, and worked on a hands-free page turner for individuals unable to use their arms. This work not only made us see what an impact technology can make on people with accessibility needs, but also motivated us to focus our careers in this area when we graduated.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>When we landed at Google, we both independently joined the G Suite accessibility team. As part of this team, we've improved <a href=\"https://support.google.com/docs/answer/6282736\">screen reader</a>, <a href=\"https://support.google.com/docs/answer/6057417\">Braille</a> and <a href=\"https://support.google.com/docs/answer/6282736#magnification\">screen magnifier</a> support on Google Docs, Sheets and Slides, and we have represented the Google Accessibility team at external conferences. We’re also involved with the American Sign Language community at Google, which promotes inclusivity among all Googlers through shared language.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>Recently, an internal hackathon led us to work on a project that is deeply personal. Upon observing that presentations can be challenging for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing to follow along, we both teamed up with the idea to add automated closed captions to G Suite’s presentation tool, Google Slides.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>This work has moved from a passion project to our full-time job, and today we’re officially launching automated closed captions in Google Slides. The feature will gradually roll out to all Slides users starting this week.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-video\">\n <div class=\"h-c-page h-c-page--mobile-full-bleed\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <div class=\"h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col-l--12 \">\n    <div class=\"article-module article-video \">\n     <figure>\n      <a class=\"h-c-video h-c-video--marquee \" data-glue-modal-disabled-on-mobile=\"true\" data-glue-modal-trigger=\"uni-modal-GbBtW-vlXmY-\" href=\"https://youtube.com/watch?v=GbBtW-vlXmY\">\n       <div class=\"article-video__aspect-image\" style=\"background-image: url(https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Screen_Shot_2018-10-08_at_8.58.09_AM.max-1000x1000.png);\">\n        <span class=\"h-u-visually-hidden\">Google Slides Closed Captions</span>\n       </div>\n       <svg class=\"h-c-video__play h-c-icon h-c-icon--color-white\" role=\"img\">\n        <use xlink:href=\"#mi-youtube-icon\"></use>\n       </svg></a>\n      <figcaption class=\"article-video__caption h-c-page\">\n       <p>An example of closed captions in Google Slides</p>\n      </figcaption>\n     </figure>\n    </div>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </div>\n <div class=\"h-c-modal--video uni-video-tracker\" data-analytics=\"{\n        &quot;event&quot;: &quot;page interaction&quot;,\n        &quot;category&quot;: &quot;video tracking&quot;,\n        &quot;label&quot;: &quot; - https://youtube.com/watch?v=GbBtW-vlXmY&quot;\n      }\" data-glue-modal=\"uni-modal-GbBtW-vlXmY-\" data-glue-modal-close-label=\"Close Dialog\">\n  <a class=\"glue-yt-video \" data-glue-yt-video-autoplay=\"true\" data-glue-yt-video-height=\"99%\" data-glue-yt-video-listeners=\"videoTrackerCtrl.listenerMap\" data-glue-yt-video-vid=\"GbBtW-vlXmY\" data-glue-yt-video-width=\"100%\" href=\"https://youtube.com/watch?v=GbBtW-vlXmY\" ng-cloak=\"\"></a>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <h2>How it works</h2>\n  <p>The closed captions feature is available when presenting in Google Slides. It uses your computer’s microphone to detect your spoken presentation, then transcribes—in real time—what you say as captions on the slides you’re presenting. &nbsp;When you begin presenting, click the “CC” button in the navigation box (or use the shortcut Ctrl + Shift + c in Chrome OS / Windows or ⌘ + Shift + c in Mac).</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>As you start speaking into your device’s microphone, automated captions will appear in real time at the bottom of your screen for your audience to see. The feature works for a single user presenting in U.S. English on a laptop or desktop computer, using the Chrome browser. We’re looking to expand the feature to more countries and languages over time. The captions are powered by machine learning and heavily influenced by the speaker's accent, voice modulation, and intonation. We’re continuing to work on improving caption quality.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>Closed captioning in Slides can help audience members like Laura who are deaf or hard of hearing, but it can also be useful for audience members without hearing loss who are listening in noisy auditoriums or rooms with poor sound settings. Closed captioning can also be a benefit when the presenter is speaking a non-native language or is not projecting their voice. The fact that the feature was built primarily for accessibility purposes but is also helpful to all users shows the overall value for everyone of incorporating accessibility into product design.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>You might think that the experiences we had growing up are the reasons we were inspired to work on accessibility at Google. That’s partly true. But we really got into this work for its potential to improve the lives of people with disabilities, for the interesting technologies and design constraints, and because of our desire to use our skills to make the world a better place. We’re excited to contribute to that effort with closed captions in Google Slides, and we’re eager to share it with you.

You should have the original spreadsheet (Ex: “Sales Revenue”) and the one you want to add information into (Ex: “Product Inventory”).</p>\n  <p><i><b>Step 2: Grab two things from the original sheet.</b></i></p>\n  <p>You need two pieces of information from the original spreadsheet in order to move the data: the spreadsheet URL and the range of cells where you want to pull the data from. In this example, our original spreadsheet’s name is “Sales Revenue.”</p>\n  <p>First, highlight and copy the full spreadsheet URL from the original spreadsheet (Note: you can also use the spreadsheet “key,” which is a code hidden inside the URL between the “d/” and “/edit.” It looks like a jumbled mix of letters and numbers.).</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \">\n    <img alt=\"G Suite Pro Tips: image 1\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Image_1_-_Pro_Tips_1.max-1000x1000.png\" />\n   </figure>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>Next, before you switch to the new spreadsheet, make sure to note the range of cells where you want to pull the data from in the original spreadsheet. For example, A:1 to C:10.</p>\n  <p><i><b>Step 3: Use a Google Sheets function to port your data over.</b></i></p>\n  <p>Now we use the <a href=\"https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093340?hl=en\">IMPORTRANGE</a> function. First, click into the new spreadsheet where you’d like to add data into. In this example, it’s named “Product Inventory.” Insert columns or rows into the spreadsheet where you want to put data.</p>\n  <p>Next, type =IMPORTRANGE in the cell (you can choose to use all caps or not, it doesn’t matter.). The function will then ask you for three things:</p>\n  <ol>\n   <li>The URL of the original spreadsheet (or the spreadsheet key, both options work.)<br /></li>\n   <li>The name of the specific tab in your spreadsheet that you’re pulling information out of<br /></li>\n   <li>The range of cells for data you need</li>\n  </ol>\n  <p>It will look similar to this:</p>\n  <p>=IMPORTRANGE(“https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RNez4bhTMt_evAdHrFOBHeBgk1l5HAWVTb43EKpYHR8/edit#gid=0\",\"Sales Revenue by Quarter!A1:C10”)</p>\n  <p>It’s important to note that you have to use the specific name of the tab in the sheet in the formula. So for this example, the name of the original spreadsheet housing multiple datasets is called “Sales Revenue,” but the name of the specific tab with our data in it is called “Sales Revenue by Quarter.” We want to use the specific tab’s name to avoid our function breaking in the future when new sheets or tabs are created.</p>\n  <p>Oh and another trick: don’t forget to add the exclamation point (!) before the data range. That’s important, too.</p>\n  <p><i><b>Step 4: Import your data.</b></i></p>\n  <p>After you’ve added your IMPORTRANGE formula, you can click enter.</p>\n  <p>If it’s the first time you’ve imported data from that particular spreadsheet, a pop-up might appear. Don’t worry! This security check makes sure you’re okay with granting any collaborators on this spreadsheet access to data that lives in another spreadsheet. It will ask you to “Allow access” when you see the #REF in your cell. Go ahead and click yes.</p>\n  <p>Voilà! Your data will appear in the new spreadsheet.</p>\n  <h2>Focus on work that’s important</h2>Google Sheets has \n  <a href=\"https://support.google.com/docs/table/25273\">more than 400 functions</a>&nbsp;you can use to help speed up work.

Using AI, the species are automatically identified, so that conservationists can act quicker to help recover global wildlife populations.</li>\n   <li><b>Predicting wildlife trade trends.</b> Using Google search queries and known web page content, Google can help organizations like WWF predict wildlife trade trends similar to how we can help see flu outbreaks coming. This way, we can help prevent a wildlife trafficking crisis quicker.</li>\n   <li><b>Collaborating globally with people who can help.</b> Using G Suite, which includes productivity and collaboration apps like Docs and Slides, Google Cloud, WWF and Netflix partnered together to draft materials and share information quickly to help raise awareness for Endangered Species Day (not to mention, cut back on paper).</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><b>What you can do to help</b><br />Conservation can seem like a big, hairy problem that’s best left to the experts to solve.

If you want to update your macro, you can simply edit the script directly instead of having to re-record the macro from scratch. You can also <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/sheets/macros\">write your own</a> Apps Script functions and <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/sheets/macros#importing_functions_as_macros\">import them as new macros</a>.</p>\n  <p>The best part about Sheets Macros is that they’re built for use in cloud-based files, which means that teams can run macros at the same time that others are working in the sheet without interrupting them. For example, a finance team having a budget meeting can run macros while reviewing the same spreadsheet. It also means that coworkers or clients won’t be forced to download sensitive files to use your macros. Since your Sheets files are in the cloud, you can keep <a href=\"https://support.google.com/docs/answer/2494893?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;hl=en\">tighter controls</a> over who can view and re-share your data.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <h3>More updates to Sheets</h3>\n  <p>You may have noticed that over the past few years we’ve put effort toward building Sheets features to help businesses view, analyze and share their data more easily. This includes adding new chart types (<a href=\"https://support.google.com/docs/answer/190718?hl=en\">waterfall and 3D</a>), ways to <a href=\"https://support.google.com/docs/answer/7009814?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;hl=en\">embed</a> charts while keeping data up-to-date in Docs and Slides (even if you move files), more functions (up to <a href=\"https://support.google.com/docs/table/25273?hl=en\">400+</a> now), additional <a href=\"https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2017/02/support-for-rotated-text-accounting.html\">formatting</a>, <a href=\"https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2017/06/charts-in-sheets-updates_1.html\">print options</a> and more.</p>\n  <p>Today, we’re adding even routinely requested features, including the ability to add <a href=\"https://support.google.com/docs/answer/7663148\">printing page breaks, custom paper sizes</a>, more options for <a href=\"https://support.google.com/docs/answer/54813\">row and column grouping</a> and a way to add <a href=\"https://support.google.com/docs/answer/7684717\">checkboxes in cells</a>.

Students have to learn to navigate the line between other people’s ideas and their own, and how and when to properly cite sources.</p>\n  <p>We've heard from instructors that they copy and paste passages into Google Search to check if student work is authentic, which can be repetitive, inefficient and biased. They also often spend a lot of time giving feedback about missed citations and improper paraphrasing. By integrating the power of Search into our assignment and grading tools, we can make this quicker and easier.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>That’s why Google is introducing <a href=\"http://edu.google.com/products/originality\">originality reports</a>. This new feature—with several reports included free in every course—will be part of <a href=\"https://edu.google.com/products/classroom/?modal_active=none\">Classroom</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/introducing-assignments\">Assignments</a>, which was also announced today. We create originality reports by scanning student work for matched phrases across hundreds of billions of web pages and tens of millions of books.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>When assigning work in Classroom and Assignments, instructors will have the option to enable originality reports. Students will then be able to run up to three originality reports on documents they attach to the assignment before submitting their work. This heads-up gives students an opportunity to proactively improve their work, and also saves time for instructors.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>After submission, a fresh originality report will automatically be available to instructors when grading the assignment. These reports will flag text that has missed citations and has high similarity with text on the web or in books.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \">\n    <img alt=\"Analyze student work with originality reports in Google Assignments\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Analyze_social_1.gif\" />\n   </figure>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>But comparing work to search results isn’t the only way to ensure authentic work. Coming soon, schools can choose to have their own private repository of past student submissions, so instructors can receive originality reports that include student-to-student matches within the same school.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>Once the feature is generally available, instructors will be able to access originality reports at no charge for up to three assignments in each course they teach. Schools that would like unlimited access can upgrade their instructors to <a href=\"https://edu.google.com/products/gsuite-for-education/enterprise/?modal_active=none\">G Suite Enterprise for Education</a>.&nbsp; During the initial, limited testing period, all instructors can use originality reports as much as they would like to, at no charge.

Admins can identify which users are potentially infected, see if anything’s been shared externally and remove access to Drive files or delete malicious emails. Since the investigation tool makes it possible to review your data security in one place and has a simple UI, it makes it easier to take action against threats without having to worry about analyzing logs which can be time-consuming and require complex scripting.

Our AI can catch several different types of corrections, from simple grammatical rules like how to use articles in a sentence (like “a” versus “an”), to more complicated grammatical concepts such as how to use subordinate clauses correctly. Machine learning will help improve this capability over time to detect trickier grammar issues. And because it’s built natively in Docs, it’s highly secure and reliable.

G Suite was born in the cloud and built for the cloud, which means real-time collaboration is effortless. This is why more than a billion people rely on G Suite apps like Gmail, Docs, Drive and more in their personal lives. Instead of defaulting to old habits—like saving content on your desktop—G Suite saves your work securely in the cloud and provides a means for teams to push the boundaries of what they create.</p>\n  <p>In fact, 74 percent of all time spent in Docs, Sheets and Slides is on collaborative work—that is, multiple people creating and editing content together. This is a stark difference from what businesses see with legacy tools, where the work is often done individually on a desktop client.</p>So that’s how we’re reimagining work.

Chat has deep integrations with other G Suite apps like <a href=\"https://goo.gl/aHM9jx\">Google Drive</a>, <a href=\"https://goo.gl/Uf9wB4\">Calendar</a> and <a href=\"https://goo.gl/qpwGWH\">Hangouts Meet</a>, and <a href=\"https://goo.gl/qrR3jv\">built-in security</a> to meet retention, eDiscovery and regulatory/compliance needs for enterprises. <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/g-suite/move-projects-forward-one-placehangouts-chat-now-available/\">Read more</a> about Hangouts Chat or learn how you can <a href=\"https://gsuite-developers.googleblog.com/2018/02/develop-bot-integrations-with-hangouts.html\">build your own bots</a>.</p>\n  <h2>Spend less time setting up meetings and more time accomplishing goals.</h2>\n  <p>We want to make it simple to manage meetings, which is why we’ve built tools to help you surface&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/g-suite/time-refresh-introducing-new-look-and-features-google-calendar-web/\">conference room information</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.google/products/calendar/save-time-with-smart-scheduling-in-google-calendar/\">find times to meet</a>.

Do it again. When it comes to data analysis, it’s easy to fall into routine. But no matter how much of a whiz you are at formulas or pivot tables, superb spreadsheet skills only take you so far if you’re working with multiple versions or outdated datasets.</p>\n  <p>On average, <a href=\"https://www.bettercloud.com/monitor/state-of-cloud-it-2016/\">employees spend</a> up to eight hours each week—an entire work day—searching for and consolidating information. What if businesses spent their time applying data insights instead of tracking them down?</p>\n  <p>We designed cloud-based tools, like Google Sheets, to make it easier to quickly organize and analyze information in one place.&nbsp;Here are five reasons why you should try using Sheets.</p>\n  <h2>1.

Multiple team members can collaborate in real-time from their phone, tablet or computer (online and offline) and create a single source of truth for projects, like quarterly budgets.</p>\n     <p>Need personalization? No problem. You can look at the same data as your coworkers&nbsp;<a href=\"https://goo.gl/wfmfnE\">without disrupting their view</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://goo.gl/wfmfnE\">sort information</a>&nbsp;to be in a specific order or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://goo.gl/6ytKfM\">hide sheets</a>&nbsp;that you don’t need to see. If you’re worried about others mucking up your data, you can&nbsp;<a href=\"https://goo.gl/6ytKfM\">protect cells</a>&nbsp;by setting custom share settings.&nbsp;Plus, you don’t have to worry about version control.

Sheets is no exception.</p>\n  <p>Clicking “Share” in the upper righthand corner of your Sheet determines access settings for individual team members, so you stay in control of who can view, edit or comment on your documents. Additional IRM (Information Rights Management) controls allow you to easily <a href=\"https://goo.gl/UB72Xm\">disable options</a> to download, copy or print spreadsheets, and you can <a href=\"https://goo.gl/1kWg8c\">set expiration dates</a> if you need to suspend access to confidential information.

We’ve also created unique-to-Sheets functions to help you crunch numbers in new ways, like: <a href=\"https://goo.gl/FmCK9T\">FILTER</a> to quickly organize a spreadsheet according to an input, <a href=\"https://goo.gl/cMhg1r\">QUERY</a> to pull specific results out of a central dataset or <a href=\"https://goo.gl/ZEgN9n\">GOOGLEFINANCE</a> to source data directly from <a href=\"http://google.com/finance\">Google Finance</a>. Outside of functions, you can also <a href=\"https://goo.gl/NAM878\">create pivot tables</a> to analyze your data (or let Sheets <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/g-suite/pivot-cloud-intelligent-features-google-sheets-help-businesses-uncover-insights/\">do it for you</a>.).<br /></li>\n   <li><b>What about organization?</b> Color cells using <a href=\"https://support.google.com/docs/answer/78413\">Conditional Formatting</a>, create drop-down lists with <a href=\"https://goo.gl/9i2XJD\">Data Validation</a> or <a href=\"https://goo.gl/F4ErxA\">freeze headers</a> at the top of your sheet, to make your data presentation-friendly. Once your data is organized, you can <a href=\"https://goo.gl/zxkphV\">visualize</a> it in pie charts, bar charts, line charts—<a href=\"https://goo.gl/QnjqXi\">charts galore</a>. <br /></li>\n   <li><b>Editing on the fly.</b> Sheets is available online and <a href=\"https://goo.gl/8ZE74o\">offline</a>—and on desktop web browsers, and <a href=\"https://goo.gl/ZtfHqz\">Android</a> and <a href=\"https://goo.gl/rbuXwq\">iOS</a> apps—which means your teams don’t have to stop working during business travel or when Wi-Fi is down.<br /></li>\n  </ul>\n  <p></p>\n  <h2>5.

Instead of writing alone and revealing her work to readers later, she invited thousands of people to watch her write—and comment on her writing—in real-time with Google Docs.</p>\n  <p>More than 10,000 people watched the Argentinian writer’s story come to life as she wrote it. We sat down with Rivero to learn more about how she incorporated technology into her creative process, and how it changed the final product.</p>\n  <p><b>Tell us about using Google Docs to publicly write your story.</b></p>\n  <p>Believe it or not, this was my first time using Google Docs. First, I created a new document and selected “comment-only” in the share permissions. Next, I hosted a few “live sessions” where I wrote a short story in the document and invited readers&nbsp; to watch and comment. To my surprise, thousands of people contributed! The short story from this session became a part of a printed book called “Zafiros en la Piel” (“Sapphires on the skin”). The book’s back cover even has a QR code that takes the reader to the story on Google Docs, bringing these worlds together.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p><b>What was it like to write in front of other people?</b></p>\n  <p>It was a challenging thing to do. Usually, when a writer creates a story, they don’t find out what the reader thinks until afterward, and even then, there’s no way of gauging how people react the moment they read the words. It was different and exciting because it allowed me to see their reactions as they had them.</p>\n  <p><b>Did&nbsp; your story change as a result of readers’ comments?</b></p>\n  <p>Yes! There’s a character in the story who talks with his dog. People fell in love with the dog—they wrote so many comments about it. I decided to make the dog more important to the story and gave him and his owner more dialogue.</p>\n  <p><b>Did using Google Docs affect your creative process?</b></p>\n  <p>Reading and writing can be lonely activities. While my creative process wasn’t necessarily altered (I already had the general idea for the story), the way in which we experienced the story changed. Docs helped bring the writer and reader together. These two things that are usually done in isolation were shared. It made the process much more enriching.</p>\n  <p>It also meant I showed everything that happens behind the scenes. For example, I don’t use punctuation when I write at first, just to make it faster. I typically put accents, periods and commas in after the story is written. At first I felt vulnerable because I didn’t want people to see unpolished work, but in the end, I think the readers appreciated seeing how a writer works.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p><b>Were there any interesting results from the experiment?</b></p>\n  <p>I was surprised by the amount of new readers who participated. I expected many people to be fans already, but there were many new readers who joined the live sessions by chance. Since writing the story, we’ve seen a 170 percent increase in sales of the paper book. It was also awarded a Bronze Lion at the Cannes Lions Film Festival.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p><b>Do you suggest other authors try using Google Docs and inviting readers to watch their process?</b></p>\n  <p>Many of my writer friends ask what it was like to write in front of thousands of people, something not many of them would dare to do. I tell them: Stories are something that will never die, and the way we tell them will continue to evolve. Before paper existed, people shared stories with their voices. And even if paper ceases to exist, the storyteller will remain, because people love stories.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>Being able to interact with readers so closely motivated me; I hope to be able to do it again someday.</p>\n </div>\n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 13 Dec 2019 17:00:00 +0000","feedId":5824,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"431b16d905c75b28f584f4dcbe36d82e","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GoogleDocsBlog/~4/NzNtgWFWIXc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn40@2020_3/2020/08/24/22-44-03-580_81bc3c3366d10528.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598308920719},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:42:00","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:42:00","title":"Protecting our Google Docs and Drive Users","link":"https://blog.google/products/docs/protecting-our-google-docs-and-drive-users/","description":"<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>Protecting all Google users from viruses, malware, and other abusive content is central to user cyber-safety and sometimes we remove access to certain files in order to provide these protections.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>On Tuesday, October 31, we mistakenly blocked access to some of our users’ files, including Google Docs.
