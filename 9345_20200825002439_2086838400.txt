It provides a fuller, richer picture of who is using a given package and how they&#8217;re using it.</p><h2 id=\"what-counts-as-a-dependent-package\">What counts as a &#8220;dependent package?&#8221;</h2><p>The <strong>Used By</strong> tab will show the top 5 packages that depend on <em>any version</em> of the package of interest in their <em>latest stable version.</em></p><p>This ensures that <strong>Used By</strong> always shows an up-to-date list of packages that <em>currently</em> trust and endorse the package of interest. If a dependent package decides to stop using on the package of interest in their latest stable release, then they will be removed from that package&#8217;s <strong>Used By</strong> list.</p><p>To get a better idea of how this works, check out the following example from the <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/finding-and-choosing-packages#evaluating-packages\">Evaluating packages docs</a>:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Package A versions</th><th>Package A is listed as a dependent of Package B?</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>v1.0.0<br>v1.1.0 (latest stable) &#8211;> Package B<br>v1.2.0-preview</td><td>TRUE, latest stable version depends on Package B</td></tr><tr><td>v1.0.0 &#8211;> Package B<br>v1.1.0 (latest stable)<br>v1.2.0-preview</td><td>FALSE, latest stable version does not depend on Package B</td></tr><tr><td>v1.0.0 &#8211;> Package B<br>v1.1.0 (latest stable)<br>v1.2.0-preview &#8211;> Package B</td><td>FALSE, latest stable version does not depend on Package B</td></tr></tbody></table><p><br></p><h2 id=\"whats-next\">What&#8217;s next?</h2><p>The next iteration of the <strong>Used By</strong> section will include access to a full list of all dependent packages and GitHub repos. A full list of dependents will futher help package consumers evaluate packages as well as provide a wider range of usage examples to learn from. It may even help you find a usage example in a project that&#8217;s a lot like yours! Not to mention, package authors will be able to better inform product decisions by tracking who uses their package and how the package is being used.</p><h2 id=\"we-want-to-hear-your-feedback\">We want to hear your feedback!</h2><p>We want NuGet to meet the evolving needs of our community.

I have two of their first CrowPi device and I use them in demonstrations and talks all the time, especially when talking to students.</p> <p>They <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/elecrow/crowpi2-steam-education-platformand-raspberry-pi-laptop?ref=scottha\">have a <strong>Kickstarter ending this week for the new CrowPi2</strong></a>. It's an update of the original CrowPi which was basically a Raspberry Pi in a tiny suitcase...instead the CrowPi2 looks like a laptop! The magical part is that the full exploration and sensor board is hidden underneath a wireless keyboard with trackpad, held on with magnets!</p> <p>The CrowPi folks sent me an early CrowPi2 because I was a vocal supporter of the previous version, so I did a <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://twitter.com/shanselman/status/1292969850105548800\">LIVE video unboxing</a> on twitter <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://twitter.com/shanselman/status/1292980878340050945\">as well as a follow up software video on the CrowPi2</a>. I am not being paid for this review and I always am honest with y'all about the stuff I like. I plan on buying a few for my kids' public school science class.</p> <p><a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/elecrow/crowpi2-steam-education-platformand-raspberry-pi-laptop?ref=scottha\"><img title=\"This blog post in Chromium on a Raspberry Pi CrowPi2\" style=\"display: inline\" alt=\"This blog post in Chromium on a Raspberry Pi CrowPi2\" src=\"https://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/c41524f075d8_116F0/IMG_5016_303bb33c-384c-45cc-9d6c-e9556cd708bb.jpg\" width=\"637\" height=\"478\"></a></p> <p>It's more than \"just a laptop shaped case\" for the Raspberry Pi, the CrowPi2 has an integrated 1080p screen, 22 onboard sensors (that can be connected and disconnected with a switch), a microphone and 2MP webcam, speaker, as well as support for both 5v battery and 12v external power. </p> <p>The keyboard is also quiet clever and very thin. It's held on with magnets and is charged with any micro-USB connector. Hidden underneath is an upgrade of the original CrowPi sensor board!</p> <p><a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/elecrow/crowpi2-steam-education-platformand-raspberry-pi-laptop?ref=scottha\"><img title=\"Sensors hidden under the keyboard\" style=\"display: inline\" alt=\"Sensors hidden under the keyboard\" src=\"https://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/c41524f075d8_116F0/image_3363f802-b831-4e72-b726-8b8922ad7466.png\" width=\"640\" height=\"363\"></a></p> <p>Here's a close up of the sensor board:</p> <p><img title=\"20+ Sensors on the CrowPi2\" style=\"display: inline\" alt=\"20+ Sensors on the CrowPi2\" src=\"https://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/c41524f075d8_116F0/IMG_5013_0eed73eb-0334-4629-805f-48c478736b4b.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"479\"></p> <p>The part I was the most surprised with was that there's 20+ projects already setup out of the box. I usually get a device like this and maybe there's some sample code on the desktop that you can run with Python. The CrowPi2 is more polished in that it has a whole front-end introductory UI that lets you run the samples right away - and they are cool samples! I show a <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://twitter.com/shanselman/status/1292980878340050945\">few of the LIVE samples in my Video on Twitter</a>.</p> <p>The plastic in the early version I got is a little soft, and I might have preferred it in black versus silver, but it's light and drops in a backpack easily. It's somewhat thick (remember this is a Raspberry PI, not an iPad or a millimeter thin laptop) so to be conscious if you think you're getting an Ultrabook. This is a Raspberry Pi-based laptop and learning platform. Would be a great starter for any kid as the Pi4 is pretty legit and it'll even run Chromium!</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> I did try to join a Zoom web-based meeting over Chromium and while the speaker and mic were detected, I wasn't able to get Chromium to see the webcam. I'll report back on this as clearly all the parts are there to allow this little laptop to join at least a web Zoom meeting! That would be even cooler.</p> <p><strong>UPDATE! </strong>I was able to enter a web-based Zoom meeting! There's a little USB cable underneath that snakes out then in again to allow access to the webcam. Very clever! I <em>don't think this is a reliable option </em>for Zoom meetings, but I can confirm that the webcam works!</p> <p><img title=\"IMG_5022\" style=\"display: inline\" alt=\"IMG_5022\" src=\"https://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/c41524f075d8_116F0/IMG_5022_d5a6403c-a89a-477c-b6f3-0bde7e0df7b6.jpg\" width=\"521\" height=\"332\"></p></blockquote> <p>Here's a side view of the CrowPi2, as well as how the Raspberry Pi mounts inside.</p> <p><img title=\"CrowPi2 from the Side\" style=\"display: inline\" alt=\"CrowPi2 from the Side\" src=\"https://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/c41524f075d8_116F0/IMG_5014_d49a4645-cf80-48ec-9a55-9529ce58645a.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\"></p> <p><img title=\"Raspberry Pi mounted inside\" style=\"display: inline\" alt=\"Raspberry Pi mounted inside\" src=\"https://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/c41524f075d8_116F0/IMG_5019_d90b42c7-a1e9-44c2-9967-6ed08b1998e9.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"479\"></p> <p>There is even a cool little retractable tray in the back of the CrowPi2 that you can use for a battery (with a micro-USB cable you can run the entire device) or for holding wires, LEDs, and resisters for projects.</p> <p><img title=\"Cool tray in the back of the CrowPi2\" style=\"display: inline\" alt=\"Cool tray in the back of the CrowPi2\" src=\"https://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/c41524f075d8_116F0/IMG_5015_c5ef0521-961b-4abc-90e1-e63740ed73d2.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\"></p> <p>The real magic is the sample projects - they are quite cool. They've added AI and Machine Learning lessons with Thonny PI, loaded MineCraft Pi. There are games, sensor tests, and they basically exercise the whole main sensor board with Python. </p> <blockquote> <p><strong>NOTE: </strong>I've also installed <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://www.hanselman.com/blog/InstallingTheNETCore2xSDKOnARaspberryPiAndBlinkingAnLEDWithSystemDeviceGpio.aspx\">.NET Core on Raspberry Pi</a> and it works great since it's an ARM Machine. You can even run Docker!</p></blockquote> <p>The basic kit is very reasonably priced compared to the much more barebones kits you see on Amazon. While I wouldn't call it a \"premium\" kit due to the plastic case, it's definitely the best Raspberry Pi kit I've ever used.</p> <p><a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/elecrow/crowpi2-steam-education-platformand-raspberry-pi-laptop?ref=scottha\"><img title=\"Playing Games on the CrowPi\" style=\"display: inline\" alt=\"Playing Games on the CrowPi\" src=\"https://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/c41524f075d8_116F0/IMG_5017_c2ff2776-e2ee-447f-945e-95279e4ca74b.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"479\"></a></p> <p>You can <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/elecrow/crowpi2-steam-education-platformand-raspberry-pi-laptop?ref=scottha\">go support the new CrowPi2 over on their KickStarter ending this week</a>, it's pretty darn cool. </p> <hr>  <p><strong>Sponsor: </strong>Bug in prod?

While WSL2 can forward ports from the inside out (for example, localhost:8000 within a WSL2 instance being made available from the local Windows 10 machine) if you want to build a path to a WSL2 port from completely outside a machine, you'll need to be a lot more explicit.</p> <h3>Install OpenSSH-Server in WSL</h3> <p>First, install OpenSSH server inside your Linux Distro:</p><pre>scott@IRONHEART:~$ sudo apt install openssh-server<br>[sudo] password for scott:<br>Reading package lists... Done<br>Building dependency tree<br>Reading state information... Done<br>openssh-server is already the newest version (1:7.6p1-4ubuntu0.3).<br>0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.</pre><h3>Decide on your SSH port number</h3><p>Next, in WSL2, edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config and uncomment out the Port line. </p><blockquote><p>I edited it with <code>sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>, no shame!</p></blockquote><p>SSH is usually 22, but I like to use something like 2222 so it's less obvious but still easy to remember AND is different from your Window's machine's 22. Note that I told it to listen on 0.0.0.0, so, any adapter. You can also set PasswordAuthentication to \"no\" if you want to use SSH keys rather than passwords for authentication. Set it to \"yes\" if you know what you're doing and don't know how to use ssh keys. </p><pre>/etc/ssh/sshd_config<br><br>...STUFF ABOVE THIS...<br>Port 2222<br>#AddressFamily any<br>ListenAddress 0.0.0.0<br>#ListenAddress ::<br><br>...STUFF BELOW  THIS...<br></pre><p>From within WSL2 get your IP address using \"ifconfig.\" Mine is 172.23.129.80, yours will likely be 172.SOMETHINGELSE and <strong>it will change when WSL2 starts up cold</strong>.</p><p>You may want to ensure it's running, considering WSL2 has no systemd.</p><pre>service ssh start</pre><h3>Forward Ports into WSL2</h3><p>Now, from an <strong>Administrator Windows prompt </strong>- that can be cmd.exe or powershell.exe, it doesn't matter, use the net shell \"netsh\" to add a portproxy rule. Again, change connectaddress to YOUR WSL2 ipaddress, which is an internal address to your machine.</p><pre>netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 listenport=2222 connectaddress=172.23.129.80 connectport=2222</pre><h3>Open the Firewall</h3><p>Next, from the same Administrator Windows prompt, open an incoming Firewall Port. You can do it from the Advanced Firewall Settings, but even easier you can use netsh again!</p><pre>netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name=”Open Port 2222 for WSL2” dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=2222</pre><p>You can list all your portproxy rules like this if you're concerned:</p><pre>netsh interface portproxy show v4tov4</pre><p>You can remove them all if you want with</p><pre>netsh int portproxy reset all</pre><h3>A scripted solution?</h3><p>GitHub user and community member Daehahn is working on a PowerShell Script to automate this process. The <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4150#issuecomment-667621988\">comment thread starts here</a> and the gist for <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://gist.github.com/daehahn/497fa04c0156b1a762c70ff3f9f7edae\">the PowerShell script for wsl2-network.ps1 is here</a>. It resets firewall and portproxies, finds your default distro's new IP, and sets you up again. Save this .ps1 somewhere, read it, and run \"<code>unblock-file wsl2-network.ps1</code>\" on it so you can set up your system quickly for Shushing into your WSL2 instance!</p><blockquote><p>Note the $Ports variable that <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://gist.github.com/daehahn/497fa04c0156b1a762c70ff3f9f7edae#file-wsl2-network-ps1-L21\">likely opens up more than you want</a> or need, remembering that WSL and VS Code will automatically forward ports to localhost when needed for development.</p></blockquote><p>Hope this helps! It would be nice if WSL2 didn't change it's internal IP address every time it starts up so that this could be made even easier and more automated.</p><p>To conclude and sum up: </p><ul><li>This blog post - the one you are reading now, has Windows only forwarding ports, and uses WSL2's Linux OpenSSH and authenticates against Linux. Windows is only involved peripherally. The WSL2 IP address changes on reboot and you'll need to maintain your portproxy rules and firewall rules with the script listened at the end of that post.</li><li><a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://www.hanselman.com/blog/THEEASYWAYHowToSSHIntoBashAndWSL2OnWindows10FromAnExternalMachine.aspx\">This other blog post</a> - <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://www.hanselman.com/blog/THEEASYWAYHowToSSHIntoBashAndWSL2OnWindows10FromAnExternalMachine.aspx\">over here</a> - uses Windows' OpenSSH and authenticates with Windows <em>and then runs WSL2. </em>WSL2 starts up, uses bash, and Windows handles the TCP traffic.</li><!--EndFragment--></ul><p>Understand what you want and use the right one for you. </p><p>Other cool links:</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://www.hanselman.com/blog/DockerDesktopForWSL2IntegratesWindows10AndLinuxEvenCloser.aspx\">Docker Desktop for WSL 2 integrates Windows 10 and Linux even closer</a> <li><a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://www.hanselman.com/blog/RemoteDebuggingANETCoreLinuxAppInWSL2FromVisualStudioOnWindows.aspx\">Remote Debugging a .NET Core Linux app in WSL2 from Visual Studio on Windows</a> <li><a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://www.hanselman.com/blog/CoolWSLWindowsSubsystemForLinuxTipsAndTricksYouOrIDidntKnowWerePossible.aspx\">Cool WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) tips and tricks you (or I) didn't know were possible</a> <li><a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://www.hanselman.com/blog/RubyOnRailsOnWindowsIsNotJustPossibleItsFabulousUsingWSL2AndVSCode.aspx\">Ruby on Rails on Windows is not just possible, it's fabulous using WSL2 and VS Code</a> <li><a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://www.hanselman.com/blog/EasilyMoveWSLDistributionsBetweenWindows10MachinesWithImportAndExport.aspx\">Easily move WSL distributions between Windows 10 machines with import and export!</a> <li><a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://www.hanselman.com/blog/WhatsTheDifferenceBetweenAConsoleATerminalAndAShell.aspx\">What's the difference between a console, a terminal, and a shell?</a></li></ul><p>Hope this helps!

Read it. Know how it works. Learn it. <strong>AND DO NOT DO IT BECAUSE IT'S TOO COMPLEX</strong>.</p> <p>DO <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://www.hanselman.com/blog/HowToSSHIntoWSL2OnWindows10FromAnExternalMachine.aspx\">NOT DO THIS</a>. It's fine. It works. But it's baroque. You're forwarding ports into a little VM'ed local subnet, you're dealing with WSL2 IP addresses changing, you'll have to keep your VM running, and you're generally trying to ice skate up hill.</p> <p>Here's the thing. In that post - which you should not do - you're turning off the Windows Firewall for your port, forwarding to an internal subnet, and then letting WSL take over.</p> <p><strong>BUT! Windows 10 already knows how to accept SSH connections. </strong>In fact, it's shipped OpenSSH as a \"Feature on Demand\" for years. The issue is that you (Mac and Linux switchers) <em>don't like the default shell - PowerShell.</em></p> <h3>So why not change the default Windows shell for SSH to WSL2's Bash? </h3> <p><strong>Boom. </strong>Now you have no port forwarding, firewalls are only opening for one process, and your WSL2 instance starts up on entry. Literally the best of all worlds.</p> <h3>How do you set up SSH'ing into WSL2 on your Windows 10 machine</h3> <p>First, open an admin PowerShell prompt (Start menu, type PowerShell, hold ctrl+shift, and hit enter) type this:</p><pre>&#62; Get-WindowsCapability -Online | ? Name -like 'OpenSSH*'<br><br>Name  : OpenSSH.Client~~~~0.0.1.0<br>State : Installed<br><br>Name  : OpenSSH.Server~~~~0.0.1.0<br>State : NotPresent</pre><p>See how I have the Client and not the OpenSSH Server? Add it:</p><pre>Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Server~~~~0.0.1.0</pre><p>Now either start the SSHD service, or set it to start automatically:</p><pre>Start-Service sshd<br>Get-Service sshd</pre><p>or automatic:</p><pre>Set-Service -Name sshd -StartupType 'Automatic'</pre><h3>Configuring the Default Shell for OpenSSH in Windows 10</h3><p>On my server (the Windows machine I'm SSHing into) I will set a registry key to <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_server_configuration?WT.mc_id=-blog-scottha\">set the default shell</a>. In this case, I'll use open source cross platform PowerShell Core.

Over the last several months, enterprises have had to shift their strategy from &ldquo;physical first&rdquo; to digital first and accelerate their digital transformation to enable remote productivity, reduce costs, or rapidly address new opportunities. In a digital first world, websites and web applications play a significant role in how customers interact with a business. To make a great first impression, companies are modernizing their web applications and data to the cloud for optimal performance, and saving money along the way.</p><p>Nearly a third<sup>1</sup> of the world&rsquo;s public websites are built on <a href=\"https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet\" target=\"_blank\">ASP.NET</a>, and for good reasons; it&rsquo;s fast, scalable, and secure. What if you could combine those benefits with the operational and financial benefits of the cloud? Microsoft Azure offers the only end-to-end application hosting platform to build and manage .NET applications, enabling significant cost savings, operational efficiencies, and business agility.</p><p>Here are three ways you&rsquo;ll benefit from migrating your ASP.NET apps and SQL Server data to Azure.</p><h2>Optimize costs with fully managed services that do more for you</h2><p>Operating your .NET applications on a fully managed platform allows your teams to focus on what matters most by offloading apps, infrastructure, and data management to Azure. With our deep expertise in Windows, Visual Studio and ASP.NET, we have designed <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/web/\" target=\"_blank\">Azure App Service</a> and <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/services/sql-database/\" target=\"_blank\">Azure SQL Database</a> from the ground up for .NET applications and the SQL Server Databases that power them. Simply put, there is no better place to build, host, manage, and scale your .NET applications.</p><p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em>&ldquo;After having used Azure for the past couple of years, we don&rsquo;t want to do it any other way, and the capital cost savings were just too compelling.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em>&mdash;Anand Kulanthaivelu, Solutions Architect for autoTRADER.ca</p><p>Use the power of built-in AI, with capabilities that surface savings opportunities for you. Azure SQL Database offers <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-automatic-tuning\" target=\"_blank\">automatic tuning</a> and adaptive <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/performance/intelligent-query-processing?view=sql-server-ver15\" target=\"_blank\">query optimization</a> to support peak performance. You can break down how increased traffic or upstream dependencies are affecting website response times with rich <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/learn/quick-monitor-portal\" target=\"_blank\">out of the box monitoring for ASP.NET applications</a> in Application Insights.</p><h2>Operate confidently with mission-critical performance and security</h2><p>App Service and SQL Database can help simplify your operations while enabling you to operate confidently to address any business need. With App Service on Windows operating on an Internet Information Services (IIS)&nbsp;server in the backend and SQL Database sharing the same codebase with on-premises SQL Server, your developers and database admins can continue to use their familiar tools and processes to be effective from day one without a steep learning curve.</p><p>Azure .NET app hosting platform serves over 2 million websites and processes, 41 billion requests and 9 trillion SQL queries per day. Built-in auto-scaling quickly adapts to meet workload demand from these apps, ensuring that user experiences stay great. Cloud-native technology like <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/service-tier-hyperscale\" target=\"_blank\">Azure SQL Database Hyperscale</a> removes many of the limits seen in other cloud databases, with a flexible storage architecture that grows as needed, up to 100 TB. Both App Service and SQL Database are available in all 60+ Azure regions, enabling you to deploy your applications closer to customers and meet local regulatory compliance needs.</p><p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em>&ldquo;Hyperscale made it easy for us to support our growing workload and the dozens of microservices that power our core ecosystem.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;&mdash;Andrew Wieck, Manager of Business Analytics, Clearent</p><p><a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/services/security-center/\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Security Center</a> provides enterprise grade protection for all your Azure resources, so you can monitor all your applications and databases and receive recommendations to improve your security posture and threat protection. Azure SQL Database offers the broadest range of <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/security-overview\" target=\"_blank\">built-in security controls</a> across T-SQL, authentication, networking and key management as well as <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/advanced-data-security\" target=\"_blank\">advanced data security</a> that proactively detects threats and vulnerabilities. You can protect applications with <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/web-application-firewall/afds/afds-overview\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Web Application Firewall</a>, leverage Azure CDN to optimize performance or use <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/services/frontdoor/\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Front Door</a> to route user traffic to the lowest latency backend, all while gaining built-in distributed denial of service (DDoS) protection and global load balancing.</p><p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em>&ldquo;We looked at moving to the cloud for better DDoS protection and lowered cost of operations for our apps. We have successfully migrated 200 apps to Azure, while using the App Service Migration Assistant to migrate 60 different .NET Apps. The Azure Migrate App Service Migration Assistant really simplified our migration journey by identifying any migration blockers and enabling us to migrate apps with just a few clicks. As an App development team, we really like the value proposition of Azure managed services for .NET Apps such as App Service and Azure SQL Database. We don&rsquo;t have to worry about patching virtual machines or containers.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em>&mdash;Tim Fragakis, Director of Cloud Services, IT, Clover Imaging Group</p><h2>Accelerate innovation and ship new features faster</h2><p>Native integration between Visual Studio, GitHub, App Service and CI/CD enable developers to build and ship changes faster. Features such as <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/debugger/remote-debugging-azure?view=vs-2019\" target=\"_blank\">remote</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/debugger/debug-live-azure-applications?view=vs-2019\" target=\"_blank\">live-site</a> debugging for ASP.NET apps let developers and operators diagnose issues in production environments and resolve them quickly, without impacting traffic.</p><p>Building on Azure opens the door to new features and services that provide off-the-shelf value to accelerate innovation. Developers can easily connect to new data sources and backend systems with 300+ pre-built connectors for <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/services/logic-apps/\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Logic Apps</a>. Turn legacy web services into modern REST-based APIs by creating fa&ccedil;ades with <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/services/api-management/\" target=\"_blank\">Azure API Management</a>, then innovate with many of the pre-built APIs for <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Cognitive Services</a> such as Speech, Text and Image processing.

And while I could find the answer and email them back, I also <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://www.hanselman.com/blog/DoTheyDeserveTheGiftOfYourKeystrokes.aspx\">have a limited number of keystrokes</a>. Plus, every question that moves knowledge forward is a gift, and I don't want to ignore a gift. So instead, I've email my new friend a link to this blog!</p> <p>Here is their question:</p> <p><b>The tl;dr question: how do I find which directory the app was <i>started</i> in? </b></p> <blockquote> <p><em>I have a CLI app in .NET Core 3 that is supposed to sit in your apps folder you have in your path, do something when you run it, then exit. </em> <p><em>Unfortunately, it needs a single line of configuration (an API key), which store in a text file. I want to keep the app portable (ie. avoid going into other directories), so I want to store the config file right next to the executable. </em> <p><em>And since I want it to be small and easily distributed, I set up .NET to merge and prune the EXE on build. (I think I got the idea from your blog btw, thanks! :) It is a simple app that does a single task, so I figure it should be one EXE, not 50 megabytes in 80 files. </em> <p><em>And there the problem lies: If the config file is right next to the exe, I need to know where the exe is located. <b>BUT</b>, it seems that when I have the entire app built into a single EXE like this, .NET actually extracts the embedded DLL to some temporary location in my filesystem, then runs it from there. Every method for finding the startup assembly's location I have found, either by googling or exploring with reflection while it runs, only gives me the location in the temp directory, not the one where the app was actually launched from. The app then attempts to load the config file from this temp directory, which obviously fails. </em></p></blockquote> <p>Let's break this problem down:  <ul> <li>.NET 3.1 LTS (long term support) has a cool feature where you can ship a single EXE with no dependencies. You ship \"myapp.exe\" and it just works. One file, no install.  <ul> <li>When you run the EXE in .NET 3.1, the system \"unzips\" the app and its dependencies into a temp folder. </li></ul> <li>If you have a config file like myapp.exe.config, you'd like the user to keep that file NEXT TO THE EXE. That way you have two files next to each other and it's simple.  <ul> <li>But how do you find this config file if you got started from a random temp folder?</li></ul></li></ul> <p>Here's how things work in .NET Core 3.1:</p><pre class=\"brush: csharp; gutter: false; toolbar: false; auto-links: false;\">using System;<br>using System.Diagnostics;<br>using System.IO;<br><br>namespace testdir<br>{<br>    class Program<br>    {<br>        static void Main(string[] args)<br>        {<br>            Console.WriteLine($\"Launched from {Environment.CurrentDirectory}\");<br>            Console.WriteLine($\"Physical location {AppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectory}\");<br>            Console.WriteLine($\"AppContext.BaseDir {AppContext.BaseDirectory}\");<br>            Console.WriteLine($\"Runtime Call {Path.GetDirectoryName(Process.GetCurrentProcess().MainModule.FileName)}\");<br>        }<br>    }<br>}</pre><p>And here's the output of this app when started from elsewhere. Look carefully at the paths:</p><pre>~\\Desktop&#62; .\\testdir\\bin\\Debug\\netcoreapp3.1\\win-x64\\publish\\testdir.exe<br>Launched from C:\\Users\\scott\\Desktop<br>Physical location C:\\Users\\scott\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\.net\\testdir\\30gxvy1b.yq3\\<br>AppContext.BaseDir C:\\Users\\scott\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\.net\\testdir\\30gxvy1b.yq3\\<br>Runtime Call C:\\Users\\scott\\Desktop\\testdir\\bin\\Debug\\netcoreapp3.1\\win-x64\\publish</pre><p>You'll note that when on .NET 3.1 if you want to get your \"original birth location\" you have to do a little runtime dance. Starting with your current process, then digging into the MainModules's filename, then getting that file's Directory. You'll want to catch that at startup as it's not a super cheap call you want to make all the time.</p><p>How does it work in .NET Core 5 (&#62; preview 7)? Well, because the assemblies are embedded and loaded from memory in 5, so like any other in-memory assembly, they don't have a location.

I wasn't sure what to title it. Hope Google Juice got you here!</p> <p>Read this whole post, there's a lot initially but there's really just two or three small pieces. It'll be worth it because you'll be able to have a nice <strong>one click menu and drop directly into a serial port terminal on Windows in the Windows Terminal</strong></p> <p>Often when you're doing embedded systems development you'll want to monitor or talk to the COM/Serial Port just like you SSH into remote system. Folks ask questions like \"How to connect to a serial port as simple as using SSH?\" </p> <p>On Linux you'll use things like \"screen /dev/ttyS0\" for COM0. With Windows, however, the historical guidance has always been to use Putty. It'll work but it's somewhat old, quirky, and it doesn't integrate well with the Windows Terminal and a more modern workflow.</p> <p>Say I have a small embedded microcontroller device that talks over a COM Port (usually via a USB-&#62;COM bridge) like an Arduino. </p> <p>Let's assume this device talks to the COM port as if it were a terminal and it's outputting stuff I want to see. I'll use this <a href=\"http://feeds.hanselman.com/~/t/0/0/scotthanselman/~https://www.norwegiancreations.com/2018/02/creating-a-command-line-interface-in-arduinos-serial-monitor/\">great little CLI example app for Arduino from Mads Aasvik to simulate such a device</a>.</p> <p>Here's what it looks like under Arduino's Serial Monitor, for example. This is a Windows app doing serial communication with its own interface wrapping around it. I want to do this at a command line, and bonus points if it's in Windows Terminal.</p> <p><img title=\"Serial port monitor in Arduino talking to a Command Line Interface\" style=\"display: inline\" alt=\"Serial port monitor in Arduino talking to a Command Line Interface\" src=\"https://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/Connecting-to-a-device-over-a-Serial-Por_115BB/image_ab1135f3-5a14-4ff1-9d7d-ba6ab1c3253d.png\" width=\"640\" height=\"344\"></p> <h3>Setup WSL1</h3> <p>If you have Windows 10 you can the Windows Subsystem for Linux quickly with this command at a Admin prompt:</p><pre>dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart</pre><p>Then go to the Windows Store and get any small Linux. Ubuntu or Kali will do for our purposes. Run it and set your user and password.&#160; (I tried Alpine but it still has issues with screen and /dev/null/utmp)</p><blockquote><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you are using WSL2 and have set it as default, run wsl --list -v and ensure that your new distro is using WSL1 as only WSL1 will let us talk to the COM Ports. You can change it to WSL1 with \"wsl --set-version DISTRONAME 1\" from any command prompt.</p></blockquote><p>To test this out now, run your new distro from any command line prompt like this. Add the \"screen\" app with <code>sudo apt update</code>\" and \"<code>sudo app install screen</code>\".</p><p>You can see here that my Arduino serial device is on COM4. On Linux that device is /dev/ttyS4 </p><p><img title=\"Arduino is on COM4\" style=\"display: inline\" alt=\"Arduino is on COM4\" src=\"https://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/Connecting-to-a-device-over-a-Serial-Por_115BB/image_76a6120f-27bb-4f52-8aa2-625da667f7ec.png\" width=\"392\" height=\"117\"></p><p>That means that I <em>should </em>be able to talk it from any WSL1 Linux Distro on Windows like \"<code>screen /dev/ttyS4 9600</code>\" where 9600 is the speed/baud rate. </p><pre>&#62; wsl --list -v<br>  NAME                   STATE           VERSION<br>* Ubuntu-18.04           Stopped         2<br>  kali-linux             Stopped         1<br>  Ubuntu-20.04           Stopped         2<br>  WLinux                 Stopped         2</pre><h3>Get Minicom on your WSL1 distro</h3><p>Screen is somewhat persnickety for Serial Port work so try Minicom. Minicom is a nice little text com program. Install with apt install minicom and run for the first time with \"sudo minicom -s\" to set your default. Note I've change the default port from /dev/modem to /dev/ttyS4 and the speed, in my case, to 9600.</p><p><img title=\"Setting up Minicom on WSL\" style=\"display: inline\" alt=\"Setting up Minicom on WSL\" src=\"https://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/binary/Windows-Live-Writer/Connecting-to-a-device-over-a-Serial-Por_115BB/image_ad9887d3-6537-4c43-97bf-f99321d69ca1.png\" width=\"923\" height=\"478\"></p><p>Then I hit enter and save settings as the dft (default) in minicom. You can also turn on Local Echo with \"Ctrl-A E\" and toggle it if needed. Now I can talk to my Arudino with minicom.</p><h3>Ensure dialout permissions to talk to the COM port</h3><p><strong>NOTE: </strong>If you get \"cannon open /dev/ttyS4: Permission denied, you may need to add your user to the dialout group.
