There&#8217;s a new direct-to-VOD sequel on the way in the form of <em>Tremors: Shrieker Island</em> and a 30-minute documentary, which the studio made available free to watch online now. The documentary, titled <strong><em>Tremors: Making Perfection</em></strong>, features Valentine McKee himself,<strong> Kevin Bacon</strong>, looking back on the horror comedy cult classic.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-641289\"></span></p>\n<p>Universal Pictures may be shaking up the <em>Tremors</em> fan community with new releases in celebration of the film&#8217;s 30th anniversary, but the studio somewhat quietly released <em>Tremors: Making Perfection</em> on YouTube, giving fans an early Halloween treat of a 30-minute making-of documentary.</p>\n<p>Here is the brief description of the documentary:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"quote\"><p>&#8220;A brand new documentary from Universal Pictures telling the fabulous story of one of the most unique films ever made, Tremors. Hear from <strong><em>Kevin Bacon</em></strong>, Michael Gross, S.S. Wilson, Brent Maddock, Ron Underwood, Alec Gillis and many more on the making of the iconic comedy horror movie.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>When <em>Tremors</em> hit theaters in 1990, it barely made a blip, earning just $16 million at the box office. The film starred Bacon as repairmen Val McKee who, alongside &#8220;Earl Bassett (Fred Ward) are tired of their dull lives in the small desert town of Perfection, Nev. But just as the two try to skip town, they happen upon a series of mysterious deaths and a concerned seismologist (Finn Carter) studying unnatural readings below <span class=\"yZlgBd\">the ground. With the help of an eccentric couple (Reba McEntire, Michael Gross), the group fights for survival against giant, worm-like monsters hungry for human flesh.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p>But, the Ron Underwood-directed horror comedy would find a new life as a cult success on home video, spawning a franchise that would last three decades and six sequels (and counting!). The first sequel,<em> Tremors 2: Aftershocks</em>, debuted in 1996, and was followed by<em> Tremors 3: Back to Perfection</em> in 2001, a 2004 prequel titled <em>Tremors: The Legend Begins</em>, 2015&#8217;s <em>Tremors: Bloodlines,</em> and most recently, 2018&#8217;s <em>Tremors: A Cold Day In Hell</em>. All the sequels were direct-to-video, sans star Kevin Bacon, who has yet to reprise his role as Valentine in any form — except for a pilot of  Syfy TV show that was never picked up.</p>\n<p>The seventh <em>Tremors</em> film, <em>Tremors: Shrieker Island</em>, is set to hit Digital and Blu-ray/DVD on October 20, 2020. In the meantime, check out the new <em>Tremors</em> documentary for free from the official <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpCSCQJEmnk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tremors YouTube</a> channel or below.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hpCSCQJEmnk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/tremors-making-perfection-documentary/\">A 30-Minute &#8216;Tremors&#8217; Making-Of Documentary is Available to Watch for Free on YouTube</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=k-MGbGbIsQc:wMAj7HpCyZo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=k-MGbGbIsQc:wMAj7HpCyZo:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=k-MGbGbIsQc:wMAj7HpCyZo:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=k-MGbGbIsQc:wMAj7HpCyZo:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=k-MGbGbIsQc:wMAj7HpCyZo:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=k-MGbGbIsQc:wMAj7HpCyZo:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/k-MGbGbIsQc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 17 Oct 2020 19:00:53 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/tremors-3-700x376.jpg","linkMd5":"cbab34b2981c52c3a8f3668d687cb0dd","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn4@2020_5/2020/10/18/17-02-02-759_bab407d2125ca0f1.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":376,"sourceBytes":22090,"destBytes":13766,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/tremors-3-700x376.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn4@2020_5/2020/10/18/17-02-02-759_bab407d2125ca0f1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn51@2020_2/2020/10/18/17-02-13-046_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=k-MGbGbIsQc:wMAj7HpCyZo:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn38@2020_4/2020/10/18/17-02-13-229_a163b435e415e892.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn78@2020_2/2020/10/18/17-02-13-081_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=k-MGbGbIsQc:wMAj7HpCyZo:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn47@2020_2/2020/10/18/17-02-13-240_1d6619f5f9ac6420.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/k-MGbGbIsQc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn56@2020_3/2020/10/18/17-02-13-024_6f491b3a03da7688.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603040508475},{"createdTime":"2020-10-19 01:01:48","updatedTime":"2020-10-19 01:01:48","title":"‘The Falcon and the Winter Soldier’ Adds ‘On My Block’ Star Danny Ramirez","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=641750","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-641752 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/topgun-dannyramirez-fanboy-cockpit-700x291.jpg\" alt=\"Danny Ramirez Joins The Falcon and the Winter Soldier Cast\" width=\"700\" height=\"291\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/topgun-dannyramirez-fanboy-cockpit-700x291.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/topgun-dannyramirez-fanboy-cockpit-360x150.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/topgun-dannyramirez-fanboy-cockpit.jpg 721w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><em><strong>The Falcon the the Winter Soldier</strong></em> is in the process finishing the last bit of production that was halted earlier this year thanks to the coronavirus pandemic. Even though production is close to wrapping up, we&#8217;re only just now learning about another cast member joining the Marvel Studios series heading to Disney+. <em>On My Block</em> star <strong>Danny Ramirez</strong> has taken a role in <em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em>, joining <strong>Anthony Mackie</strong> and <strong>Sebastian Stan</strong> as the titular characters.<span id=\"more-641750\"></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/on-my-block-actor-danny-ramirez-joins-falcon-the-winter-soldier\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Hollywood Reporter</a> has news on <em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em> cast adding Danny Ramirez, who starred in the Netflix series <em>On My Block</em>, as well as indies like <em>Assassination Nation</em> and the remake of <em>Valley Girl</em>. Ramirez would have already seen his star rise a little bit earlier this year if <em>Top Gun: Maverick</em> hadn&#8217;t been delayed, but now we won&#8217;t see his performance in the sequel until July next year. So it&#8217;s likely we&#8217;ll see Ramirez in <em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em> first. Unfortunately, we don&#8217;t know his specific role, but it&#8217;s said to be a pivotal one.</p>\n<p>As for the rest of <em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em> cast, <strong>Emily VanCamp</strong> is reprising her role as Sharon Carter, aka Agent 13. <strong>Daniel <span class=\"itemprop\">Brühl</span></strong> is also returning as Baron Zemo, the same villain who forced The Avengers to clash in <em>Captain America: Civil War</em>. Speaking of which, <strong>Wyatt Russell</strong> will be playing John Walker, aka U.S. Agent, the government sanctioned replacement for Steve Rogers as Captain America, which is bound to create some conflict.</p>\n<p><em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em> was intended to be the first Marvel Studios series to arrive on Disney+, but the production delay has resulted in <em>WandaVision</em> arriving first, potentially towards the end of November. Hopefully this doesn&#8217;t make the timeline of upcoming projects in the Marvel Cinematic Universe too complicated to follow.</p>\n<p>But regardless of the timeline, it sounds like there&#8217;s the potential for things to get a lot more confusing with Jamie Foxx boarding <em>Spider-Man 3</em> as <em>The Amazing Spider-Man 2</em> villain Electro, not to mention Stephen Strange getting involved with Peter Parker&#8217;s adventures before <em>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</em> arrives. And since that sequel is supposed to have some kind of direct tie-in to the events of WandaVision. As for what impact <em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em> will have on the next era of Marvel movies, that remains to be seen.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/danny-ramirez-joins-the-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier-cast/\">&#8216;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier&#8217; Adds &#8216;On My Block&#8217; Star Danny Ramirez</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=74ZZoEOW48Y:ThO7oBDtzgQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=74ZZoEOW48Y:ThO7oBDtzgQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=74ZZoEOW48Y:ThO7oBDtzgQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=74ZZoEOW48Y:ThO7oBDtzgQ:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=74ZZoEOW48Y:ThO7oBDtzgQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=74ZZoEOW48Y:ThO7oBDtzgQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/74ZZoEOW48Y\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 18 Oct 2020 16:00:05 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/topgun-dannyramirez-fanboy-cockpit-700x291.jpg","linkMd5":"5ecee1811bd79cdacee33d65c5181032","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn13@2020_5/2020/10/18/17-01-59-004_d5e4ceadcfef8a5e.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":291,"sourceBytes":42161,"destBytes":29762,"author":"Ethan Anderton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/topgun-dannyramirez-fanboy-cockpit-700x291.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn13@2020_5/2020/10/18/17-01-59-004_d5e4ceadcfef8a5e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn51@2020_2/2020/10/18/17-02-13-046_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=74ZZoEOW48Y:ThO7oBDtzgQ:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn70@2020_1/2020/10/18/17-02-13-094_3301a78ecc4e8d07.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn78@2020_2/2020/10/18/17-02-13-081_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=74ZZoEOW48Y:ThO7oBDtzgQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn73@2020_2/2020/10/18/17-02-29-183_3a162f6c162f8619.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/74ZZoEOW48Y":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn45@2020_1/2020/10/18/17-02-13-048_7cda8f6476db1a99.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603040508475},{"createdTime":"2020-10-19 01:01:48","updatedTime":"2020-10-19 01:01:48","title":"Michael B.

Jordan, who will produce the project through his Outlier Society production banner, which has a deal at Warner Bros. Pictures. Jordan joins <strong>Reginald Hudlin</strong>, producer of <em>Django Unchained</em> and <em>Marshall</em>, who is already on board the film.</p>\n<p><em>Static Shock</em> debuted in 1993 as a DC Comics-distributed title from Milestone Comics, a comic banner created by Black writers and artists to help make comics a more inclusive space. After being defunct for years, Milestone Comics is coming back, including a new <em>Static Shock</em> digital comic series coming in February 2021 and a graphic novel along with it. Both of those are being written by Reginald Hudlin, which explains why he&#8217;s also producing the movie. So <em>Static Shock</em> is coming back in a big way.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve never heard of <em>Static Shock</em>, the comic follows a geeky high school kid named Virgil Hawkins who gains superpowers after being accidentally exposed to an experimental mutagen. With the newfound ability to control electromagnetic forces, he takes on the superhero named Static Shock and fights crime with the help of his brilliant buddy Osgood, who builds gadgets to enhance the superhero&#8217;s abilities.</p>\n<p>In a statement, Jordan said, &#8220;I’m proud to be a part of building a new universe centered around black superheroes; our community deserves that. Outlier Society is committed to bringing to life diverse comic book content across all platforms and we are excited to partner with Reggie and Warner Bros on this initial step.” He further celebrated the news on Twitter:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"und\" dir=\"ltr\">??? <a href=\"https://t.co/GKdIJOxck0\">pic.twitter.com/GKdIJOxck0</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Michael B.

But this will be the first time Static Shock has been brought to the big screen. It&#8217;s just a shame Jordan is too old to take on the part, because it would have been a great character for him to dig into. So who should star in the <em>Static Shock</em> movie instead?

The film played at the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival and is headed to Premium Video-On-Demand and for Digital in November.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-641653\"></span></p>\n<h2><strong>Jungleland Trailer</strong></h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lRVMe0GsdUg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>In <em>Jungleland</em>, &#8220;Stanley (Charlie Hunnam) and Lion (Jack O’Connell) are two brothers struggling to stay relevant in the underground world of bare-knuckle boxing. When Stanley fails to pay back a dangerous crime boss (Jonathan Majors), they’re forced to deliver an unexpected traveler as they journey across the country for a high-stakes fighting tournament. While Stanley trains Lion for the fight of his life, a series of events threaten to tear the brothers apart, but their love for one another and belief in a better life keep them going in this gripping drama that proves family pulls no punches.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I missed <em>Jungleland</em> at TIFF last year, but I will say this is an effective trailer. It&#8217;s well put together and does a good job selling a melancholy tone for the flick, which is not what I was expecting from the synopsis.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d always wanted to write sort of an unconventional love story,&#8221; director <strong>Max Winkler</strong> said in an interview with Deadline, &#8220;and this one is about brothers. It&#8217;s sort of like the male dramas of American film in the ’70s—Bob Rafelson movies like <em>The King of Marvin Gardens</em> and <em>Five Easy Pieces</em>, and Hal Ashby’s <em>The Last Detail</em>. I love Paul Newman in <em>Hud</em>. I just loved these movies about masculinity, and how we mask our true emotion with these sort of faux facades of toughness, and that, paired with how much I love John Steinbeck’s <em>Of Mice and Men</em>, was the early starting point for me, when I started writing this. I knew I wanted to make a movie about toxic masculinity and brotherhood, [because] this type of love story is not something you see a lot. We sent it to Charlie with our fingers crossed, and it was then that we really started kicking in gear.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Name dropping all those titles sure goes a long way toward making me interested in seeing this thing. The screenplay comes from Winkler, Theodore B. Bressman, and David Branson Smith, and in addition to Charlie Hunnam and Jack O&#8217;Connell, the cast includes Jessica Barden and Jonathan Majors. <em>Jungleland</em> arrives on VOD and digital purchase on <strong>November 11</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/jungleland-trailer/\">&#8216;Jungleland&#8217; Trailer: Charlie Hunnam and Jack O&#8217;Connell Are in for the Fight of Their Lives</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=PwiSvM8sq_Q:kZKGtElr2LQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=PwiSvM8sq_Q:kZKGtElr2LQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=PwiSvM8sq_Q:kZKGtElr2LQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=PwiSvM8sq_Q:kZKGtElr2LQ:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=PwiSvM8sq_Q:kZKGtElr2LQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=PwiSvM8sq_Q:kZKGtElr2LQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/PwiSvM8sq_Q\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 17 Oct 2020 16:00:13 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/jungleland-trailer-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"beab6b065d7b03db1738466ab514d535","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn5@2020_2/2020/10/18/17-02-11-490_7336fb9c7749aff6.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":54953,"destBytes":39524,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/jungleland-trailer-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn5@2020_2/2020/10/18/17-02-11-490_7336fb9c7749aff6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn51@2020_2/2020/10/18/17-02-13-046_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=PwiSvM8sq_Q:kZKGtElr2LQ:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn34@2020_1/2020/10/18/17-02-13-072_36102f3c25fb2de1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn78@2020_2/2020/10/18/17-02-13-081_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=PwiSvM8sq_Q:kZKGtElr2LQ:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn61@2020_3/2020/10/18/17-02-13-077_0bfb0e3eaad5dde0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/PwiSvM8sq_Q":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn58@2020_1/2020/10/18/17-02-13-037_049331293ed4e07f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603040508475},{"createdTime":"2020-10-19 01:01:48","updatedTime":"2020-10-19 01:01:48","title":"‘Mr. Mercedes’ Featurette: The Stephen King Series is Now on Peacock","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=641557","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mr.-mercedes-featurette.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-641574\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mr.-mercedes-featurette-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"mr. mercedes featurette\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mr.-mercedes-featurette-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mr.-mercedes-featurette-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mr.-mercedes-featurette-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mr.-mercedes-featurette.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong><em>Mr. Mercedes</em></strong> is not a new show. But Peacock is sure treating it like one. The <strong>Stephen King</strong>-inspired series originally aired its first three seasons on Audience Network, and if you&#8217;re reading that and thinking, &#8220;What the hell is Audience Network?&#8221;, you&#8217;re not alone! In fact, the channel doesn&#8217;t even exist anymore. It was discontinued in May of 2020. Audience&#8217;s loss is Peacock&#8217;s gain, as the free streaming service is now making all three seasons available. There&#8217;s no word on a fourth season yet, but perhaps if enough people watch <em>Mr. Mercedes </em>on Peacock then Peacock will order more episodes. In the meantime, a new <em>Mr. Mercedes</em> featurette below goes behind-the-scenes of the show.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-641557\"></span></p>\n<h2><strong>Mr. Mercedes Featurette </strong></h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RtWn8SAGFLg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m a huge Stephen King nerd. I have been for most of my life. But I&#8217;ll confess that I just can&#8217;t get into his Bill Hodges trilogy. It&#8217;s probably because I&#8217;m just not much of a mystery buff, and the Bill Hodges tales are primarily mysteries, although they do throw a few supernatural elements in here and there. As a result, I&#8217;ve never bothered to watch <em>Mr. Mercedes</em>. And I&#8217;m not sure I could&#8217;ve if I even wanted to, since the show aired on Audience, a network I have no idea if I have access to.</p>\n<p>But now the show has moved to Peacock. To be clear: there are no new episodes on Peacock – just the first three seasons that already aired. But if I had to guess, I&#8217;d say that Peacock is trying to decide how big an audience there is for the show now. If it does good streaming numbers they might go ahead and order more. If not, at least the show is now available to a wider audience.</p>\n<p>The featurette above isn&#8217;t very in-depth. It&#8217;s mostly Mr. King talking about how exciting it is to see someone adapt his words into reality. It <em>also</em> features a moment where Stephen King says &#8220;I hope people will binge <em>Mr. Mercedes</em> on Peacock!&#8221;, and just hearing the master of horror fiction utter that sentence is <em>very</em> funny to me, so at least there&#8217;s that.</p>\n<p><em>Mr. Mercedes</em> &#8220;follows a retired detective who is tormented by a serial killer (Brady Hartsfield, aka Mr. Mercedes) through a series of letters and e-mails, causing him to set out on a dangerous and potentially felonious crusade to protect his loved ones and himself.&#8221; The cast includes <strong>Brendan Gleeson</strong>, <strong>Harry Treadaway</strong>, <strong>Kelly Lynch</strong>, <strong>Jharrel Jerome</strong>, Mary-Louise Parker, Holland Taylor, Justine Lupe, Breeda Wool, Scott Lawrence, Ann Cusack, Jack Huston, Tessa Ferrer, Maximiliano Hernández, and Nancy Travis. The show is now streaming on Peacock.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/mr-mercedes-featurette/\">&#8216;Mr. Mercedes&#8217; Featurette: The Stephen King Series is Now on Peacock</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ytr-1a5IP0U:5D9tQ-YLwN4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ytr-1a5IP0U:5D9tQ-YLwN4:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ytr-1a5IP0U:5D9tQ-YLwN4:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ytr-1a5IP0U:5D9tQ-YLwN4:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ytr-1a5IP0U:5D9tQ-YLwN4:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ytr-1a5IP0U:5D9tQ-YLwN4:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/ytr-1a5IP0U\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 18 Oct 2020 17:00:51 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mr.-mercedes-featurette-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"26d5e819c54e5c26ed761c95e5a67c8c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn8@2020_6/2020/10/18/17-02-04-928_6f6a6f8818d7446d.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":18749,"destBytes":9736,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mr.-mercedes-featurette-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn8@2020_6/2020/10/18/17-02-04-928_6f6a6f8818d7446d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn51@2020_2/2020/10/18/17-02-13-046_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ytr-1a5IP0U:5D9tQ-YLwN4:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn63@2020_2/2020/10/18/17-02-13-080_cd47ece0cf96c40f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn78@2020_2/2020/10/18/17-02-13-081_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ytr-1a5IP0U:5D9tQ-YLwN4:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn71@2020_5/2020/10/18/17-02-13-073_a4c3819876c23b49.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/ytr-1a5IP0U":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn66@2020_5/2020/10/18/17-02-13-051_6f840c339188742c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603040508477},{"createdTime":"2020-10-19 01:01:48","updatedTime":"2020-10-19 01:01:48","title":"The Quarantine Stream: ‘Adam Sandler: 100% Fresh’ Marks a Hilarious Return to the Comedian’s Musical Roots","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=641746","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-526928 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/adamsandler-chrisfarleytribute-700x310.jpg\" alt=\"Adam Sandler Chris Farley Tribute\" width=\"700\" height=\"310\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/adamsandler-chrisfarleytribute-700x310.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/adamsandler-chrisfarleytribute-360x160.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/adamsandler-chrisfarleytribute-768x341.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/adamsandler-chrisfarleytribute.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><em>(Welcome to <a href=\"https://slashfilm.com/tag/the-quarantine-stream\"><strong>The Quarantine Stream</strong></a>, a new series where the /Film team shares what they’ve been watching while social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic.)</em></p>\n<p><strong>The Special</strong>: <em>Adam Sandler: 100% Fresh</em></p>\n<p><strong>Where You Can Stream It</strong>: Netflix</p>\n<p><strong>The Pitch</strong>: Taking a break from his seemingly never-ending streak of original movies at Netflix, Adam Sandler returned to his comedy roots by heading out on tour to film a new comedy special. Armed with a series of silly new original songs, Sandler entertained thousands at over a dozen different venues to shoot this special that reminds you how funny he can be, especially when he doesn&#8217;t have to bring all of his usual partners in crime with him.</p>\n<p><strong>Why It’s Essential Viewing</strong>: Long before Adam Sandler got a deal to make mediocre-to-terrible original movies for Netflix, he was a rising star who skyrocketed to fame thanks to his goofy and frequently musical antics on <em>Saturday Night Live</em>. Sandler even had his own comedy albums. But his musical comedy shenanigans took a backseat to his movie career when he became a big screen sensation. Thankfully, it appears his ongoing deals with Netflix gave him enough money and spare time to create a spectacular array of new comedy songs, and it&#8217;s the funniest Sandler has been in a long time.<span id=\"more-641746\"></span></p>\n<p>Sandler&#8217;s songs made him famous on <em>SNL</em>, ranging from &#8220;<span class=\"aCOpRe\">The Chanukah Song&#8221; to &#8220;Lunch Lady Land,&#8221; and he delivers the same kind of oddball tunes in <em>100% Fresh</em>. In the special, Sandler sings about everything from the deformed ears of UFC fighters to remembering his phone, wallet and keys. Sandler also has several songs about fictional characters like &#8220;Bar Mitzvah Boy&#8221; and &#8220;Grandma&#8217;s Roommate.&#8221; For those who love Sandler&#8217;s immature side, don&#8217;t worry, he also has songs called &#8220;Vagina Fart&#8221; and &#8220;Dick Pic.&#8221; Many are bite-sized musical bits rather than full fledged songs, but there are a few longer songs that brings the laughs too.</span></p>\n<p>Accompanying some of the songs are amusing animated sequences, not to mention an array of pictures from Adam Sandler&#8217;s own life. While most of the songs are just comedic nonsense, there are plenty that are also inspired by Sandler&#8217;s personal experiences. But for all of Sandler&#8217;s silliness, easily the best part of the special is when he digs into a couple touching tunes. Not only is there a new rendition of the ballad &#8220;Grow Old with You&#8221; from <em>The Wedding Singer</em>, but Sandler gives an emotional tribute to the late Chris Farley, complete with a photo montage that will bring tears to your eyes. He even <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/adam-sandler-hosted-saturday-night-live-season-44-best-and-worst-sketches/3/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">performed it on <em>Saturday Night Live</em></a>.</p>\n<p><em>100% Fresh</em> serves as a reminder of the kind of great comedy that Adam Sandler can still deliver, but it&#8217;s also frustrating when you see the likes of <em>Hubie Halloween</em>, <em>Sandy Wexler</em> and <em>The Ridiculous 6</em> all over Netflix. Why can&#8217;t Sandler give us more like <em>100% Fresh</em>, or at least tap into what made movies like <em>Happy Gilmore</em>, <em>The Wedding Singer</em> and <em>Big Daddy</em> so funny? He&#8217;s clearly still capable of quality comedy, and it would be nice if he put the same effort into his Netflix movies that goes into acclaimed performances like <em>Uncut Gems</em>. Then Sandler might have a movie of his own that can legitimately be called 100% fresh.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-quarantine-stream-adam-sandler-100-fresh-marks-a-hilarious-return-to-the-comedians-musical-roots/\">The Quarantine Stream: &#8216;Adam Sandler: 100% Fresh&#8217; Marks a Hilarious Return to the Comedian&#8217;s Musical Roots</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=RBSnaRu2RR4:aYIWKaTPIB4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=RBSnaRu2RR4:aYIWKaTPIB4:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=RBSnaRu2RR4:aYIWKaTPIB4:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=RBSnaRu2RR4:aYIWKaTPIB4:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=RBSnaRu2RR4:aYIWKaTPIB4:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=RBSnaRu2RR4:aYIWKaTPIB4:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/RBSnaRu2RR4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 17 Oct 2020 18:00:35 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/adamsandler-chrisfarleytribute-700x310.jpg","linkMd5":"4d0027a24d83f019b6f7e368deea9fca","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn16@2020_1/2020/10/18/17-02-05-283_2081758a1c9da37e.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":310,"sourceBytes":27658,"destBytes":19066,"author":"Ethan Anderton","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/adamsandler-chrisfarleytribute-700x310.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn16@2020_1/2020/10/18/17-02-05-283_2081758a1c9da37e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn51@2020_2/2020/10/18/17-02-13-046_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=RBSnaRu2RR4:aYIWKaTPIB4:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn59@2020_5/2020/10/18/17-02-14-462_9ff6b6c0a71febd0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn78@2020_2/2020/10/18/17-02-13-081_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=RBSnaRu2RR4:aYIWKaTPIB4:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn32@2020_5/2020/10/18/17-02-18-119_05a407c5bb7a1e0a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/RBSnaRu2RR4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn50@2020_5/2020/10/18/17-02-13-029_a748845fc948e7fb.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603040508477},{"createdTime":"2020-10-19 01:01:48","updatedTime":"2020-10-19 01:01:48","title":"This Week In Trailers: Goff, The Dakota Entrapment Tapes, Seduced: Inside the NXIVM Cult, The Eric Andre Show Season 5, Secrets of the Saqqara Tomb","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=641419","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-576905 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Fewer-trailers-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"This Week in Trailers\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Fewer-trailers-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Fewer-trailers-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Fewer-trailers-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Fewer-trailers.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p><em>Trailers are an under-appreciated art form insofar that many times they’re seen as vehicles for showing footage, explaining films away, or showing their hand about what moviegoers can expect.

Barry Meier, Janja Lalich, Rick Alan Ross, and Catherine Oxenberg appear in the series, alongside other women sharing their stories and experiences in the organization.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I have not seen The Vow, but this looks like an unbelievably wild story. Cults are nothing new, but somehow this one has taken the imaginations and the collective attention of thousands across the globe. Rightly or wrongly, this group is getting its fair share of attention, so if you&#8217;re wanting to go down further into this rabbit hole, it will be your latest obsession.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/u6KkiL2fPpY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<h2><strong>The Dakota Entrapment Tapes</strong></h2>\n<p>Director <strong>Trevor Birney</strong> is laying down a mystery.</p>\n<blockquote><p>In a sleepy North Dakota town, where the crime rate is so low people often don’t lock their front doors, 20-year-old college student Andrew Sadek mysteriously disappears in May 2014 and is found dead almost two months later. What Andrew’s friends and family didn’t know was that in the months before his death, he had been coerced into becoming an informant for an aggressive police task force that had been secretly operating for years.</p>\n<p>As details of Andrew’s double life are revealed, the cover of the shadowy program is blown, laying bare the collusion and abuse of power of local law enforcement at all levels. Following the Sadek family’s fight for the truth about how their son was killed, The Dakota Entrapment Tapes skillfully uncovers the forces at play in his death and reveals why law enforcement secretly waged a war on drugs, on a college campus that didn’t have a drug problem.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This trailer gets everything right about how you sell a conspiracy. Start small, hook the viewer early, and then ramp up to the crucial point to drive the message home. It&#8217;s only been in the last year when I&#8217;ve decided to marvel at tales of intrigue (<em>Unsolved Mysteries</em> coming back might have helped), but this is the kind of story that has larger implications. It&#8217;s not just a death in small-town America, it&#8217;s the cover-up, the forces of unseen power at work, and the labor by those who will not be silenced that inspires the most.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/W1Hmp65tuK8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<h2><strong>The Eric Andre Show Season 5</strong></h2>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know who needs this in their life, but <strong>Eric Andre</strong> is back, and this trailer tells me everything I need to know about why this will be at the top of my viewing queue. To say Andre is fearless is to miss the point. The man is transgressive in ways that many entertainers simply wouldn&#8217;t dare. It is hijinks at its most infantile but, at the same time, its most brilliant.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/77_UeHKMB-I?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<h2>Secrets of the Saqqara Tomb</h2>\n<p>Director <strong>James Tovell&#8217;s</strong> latest is giving me some easy viewing that I desperately need.</p>\n<blockquote><p>This documentary follows a team of local archaeologists which excavates never before explored passageways, shafts, and tombs, piecing together the secrets of Egypt’s most significant find in almost 50 years in Saqqara.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Unearthing long undisturbed tombs, finding mummified remains of those who lived thousands of years ago, feels a bit like Indiana Jones and the History Channel rolled into one. It&#8217;s fairly straightforward as far as the story goes: archaeologists gs looking for ancient ruins, find dead things wrapped in Egyptian linen, and then postulate on everything they find scrawled/drawn/written on the walls. It may not seem thrilling, but this kind of adventure is straight-up my jam right now.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/392326692?dnt=1&#38;app_id=122963\" width=\"740\" height=\"416\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen title=\"&#38;quot;GOFF&#38;quot; Teaser\"></iframe></p>\n<h2>Goff</h2>\n<p>Director <strong>Britni Harris</strong> is taking us on an architectural detour of sorts.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Bruce Goff was one of the greatest American architects of the 20th century. His unconventional perspective challenged stigmas about the Midwest’s inability to produce innovative work. A peer to Frank Lloyd Wright, his work had a profound influence on the next generation of architects, including Phillip Johnson and Frank Gehry.</p>\n<p>However, Goff’s willingness to explore unprecedented forms often<br />\nsolicited polarized perspectives of his work. As a result of establishing his practice in an otherwise conservative landscape and his unabashed desire to experiment with the possibilities of form, much of his work has been left to decay or forgotten altogether. GOFF explores the life of an iconoclast and chronicles the events that lead to the destruction and renewed interest of his memory and dwellings.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The trailer sells the story of someone, I would argue, not many of us have ever heard of. When you see this man&#8217;s work in the structures he made, you would be hard-pressed in asking yourself why this man isn&#8217;t talked about more often. The designs are otherworldly in how they depart from traditional home design. You could overlook some flourishes here and there, but the man upended what livable space was supposed to mean. I&#8217;m not sure I would enjoy how stark these locations ultimately would make an occupant feel, but he absolutely thought differently, and the world is better with these places in them.</p>\n<p><em style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Nota bene: If you have any suggestions of trailers for possible inclusion in this column, even have a trailer of your own to pitch, please let me know by sending me a note at Christopher_Stipp@yahoo.com or look me up via Twitter at @Stipp</em></p>\n<div>\n<p>In case you missed them, here are the other trailers we covered at /Film this week:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/sylvies-love-trailer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Sylvie&#8217;s Love Trailer</strong></a> &#8211; Looks like Amazon Prime quality</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/hillbilly-elegy-trailer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Hillbilly Elegy Trailer</strong></a> &#8211; The melodrama reeks of awards show desperation</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/monster-hunter-trailer-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Monster Hunter Trailer</strong></a> &#8211; About what I expected</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/jiu-jitsu-trailer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jiu Jitsu Trailer</a> &#8211; </strong>Hahaha&#8230;hot garbage</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-kid-detective-trailer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>The Kid Detective Trailer</strong></a> &#8211; Nope</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/nine-days-trailer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Nine Days Trailer</strong></a> &#8211; Blown away</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-crown-season-4-trailer-official/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>The Crown Season 4 Trailer</strong></a> &#8211; Prestige TV</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/clouds-trailer-new/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Clouds Trailer</strong></a> &#8211; I&#8217;m not a 13-year-old girl so this isn&#8217;t for me</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/pennyworth-season-2-trailer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Pennyworth Season 2 Trailer</strong></a> &#8211; Could not have enjoyed this less than I did</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/everybodys-talking-about-jamie-trailer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Everybody&#8217;s Talking About Jamie Trailer</strong></a> &#8211; OK</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/operation-christmas-drop-trailer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Operation Christmas Drop Trailer</strong></a> &#8211; Trash</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/leap-of-faith-trailer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Leap of Faith Trailer</strong></a> &#8211; Oh yeah</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/uncle-frank-trailer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Uncle Frank Trailer</strong></a> &#8211; No highs, no lows, just mediocre</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/his-dark-materials-season-2-trailer-new/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>His Dark Materials Season 2 Trailer</strong></a> &#8211; Prestige TV for adolescents</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/ammonite-trailer-official/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Ammonite Trailer</strong></a> &#8211; Well, this looks uplifting</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/soul-trailer-additional-voice-cast/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Soul Trailer</strong></a> &#8211; Cannot.
