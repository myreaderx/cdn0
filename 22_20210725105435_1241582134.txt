Blue Origin has yet to release its ticket prices, the Amazon founder has <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-to-sell-tickets-space-tourism-rocket-2021-4\">indicated</a> that the tickets will be competitive with Branson&#39;s company. The first available ticket on Bezos&#39; flight sold for $28 million at auction and the entire 10 minute trip on Tuesday <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2021/07/19/jeff-bezos-space-launch-blue-origin-july-20-2021-billionaires/\">cost the billionaire about $5.5 billion</a> out-of-pocket. The same day, the company said it had <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/20/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-space-tourist-sales-approaching-100-million.html\">sold about $100 million worth of tickets</a> for future passengers to ride on the 4-person aircraft.</p><p>Bezos said he plans to launch future flights at a &#34;very high&#34; rate going forward. &#34;We need to get as good at running space tours as we are as a civilization at running commercial airliners,&#34; he said.</p><p>SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has said that <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/27/13078690/elon-musk-mars-mission-cost-per-person-spacex\">he believes</a> the cost of going to space, in particular visiting Mars (a trip that would <a href=\"https://www.mars-one.com/faq/finance-and-feasibility/what-is-mars-ones-mission-budget\">cost about $10 billion per person</a> using current technology), will one day be equivalent to the cost of buying a house.</p><p>But, the truth is current technology is too expensive for the average person to be able to afford a seat on one of Bezos, Branson or Musk&#39;s rockets. Though Bezos and Musk have been progressively working to make space travel more affordable through th<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/in-space-missions-spacex-satellite-space-rocket-2021-7\">e development of reusable rockets</a>, the industry is still in its beginning stages.</p><p>Space law experts told Insider that even outside of the sheer cost of space tourism there are several hurdles the companies must overcome before space tourism can become a viable industry for everyday people. These include creating standard regulations akin to the policies that guard airplanes, as well as developing strategies to better <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/air-traffic-control-space-launch-72169cc4-f879-4cbf-8028-71c55208fded.html\">manage air travel</a> and <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/bezos-rocket-carbon-emissions-blue-origin-b1888059.html\">pollution</a> from the flights.</p><p>People who ride with Blue Origin or Virgin Galactic &#34;are not astronauts or passengers, legally speaking,&#34; the director of McGill&#39;s Institute of Air and Space Law, <a href=\"https://www.mcgill.ca/law/about/profs/jakhu-ram\">Ram Jakhu</a> told Insider. &#34;They are called spaceflight participants, which means they are essentially people participating in an experiment with a massive risk.&#34;</p><p>As it stands, individuals that currently purchase space tourism tickets must sign an <a href=\"https://research-compliance.umich.edu/informed-consent-guidelines\">informed consent document</a> releasing companies from liability if the ticket-holders are injured or killed.</p><p>Spokespeople from Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic did not respond to a request for comment, but Jakhu and <a href=\"https://law.unl.edu/frans-von-der-dunk/\">Frans Von der Dunk</a>, a professor of Space Law at University of Nebraska-Lincoln told Insider the risk would likely deter the general public, even if the hefty price tag had not already narrowed the field of participants.</p><p>What&#39;s more the flights themselves would also have to be more persuasive for tourists. </p><p>&#34;Right now, these flights are just a sophisticated form of bungee jumping,&#34; Von der Dunk said. </p><p>On Tuesday, one of Blue Origin&#39;s flight participants, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/jeff-bezos-guest-wally-funk-describes-dark-short-crowded-spaceflight-2021-7\">Wally Funk, expressed discontent with the trip, </a>saying it was

The thoughts expressed are those of the author.</li>\n<li id=\"recirc\"><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">See more stories on Insider&#39;s business page</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>For millions of workers across the country, it&#39;s been 12 years without a raise in the minimum wage.</p><p>12 years is a long time. In the past 12 years, we&#39;ve had three different presidents, six  Olympics, and seven Fast &#38; Furious movies. But in all that time, the federal minimum wage has stayed the same. The last time it was increased was on July 24, 2009, to the amount of just $7.25 an hour.</p><p>That means that companies like the one I work for, McDonald&#39;s, can continue to pay us starvation wages, even while they made nearly $5 billion in profits last year in the middle of a global pandemic. McDonald&#39;s CEO, Chris Kempczinksi, made $10.8 million last year while cooks and cashiers like me risked our lives serving burgers and fries for a paycheck that&#39;s hardly enough to keep a roof over our heads.</p><p>That&#39;s why on July 20, I joined my co-workers around the country in a strike to demand $15 per hour from companies like McDonald&#39;s. We&#39;re also calling on Congress to finally increase the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour.</p><h2>A living wage </h2><p>I&#39;ve heard a lot about the so-called economic recovery, but like many fast food workers across the country, I&#39;m struggling, and the pandemic has made things twice as hard. We have to do twice as much work to keep ourselves, our families and our customers safe. I&#39;m afraid of getting sick, but at the same time I&#39;m worried about paying for car insurance, food and rent.</p><p>There are some in Congress who say that states should set their own minimum wages or that it should be up to big corporations to decide base pay. But even while 10 states and some big companies have increased their minimum wages to $15 per hour, here in Michigan, the minimum wage is stuck at $9.65, and I&#39;m still making $10.</p><p>Even worse, Michigan has racist laws on the books. These laws, like Michigan&#39;s <a href=\"http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(lskutbeklmcztmtbsntwcchy))/mileg.aspx?page=getobject&objectname=mcl-123-13851385\">Local Government Labor Regulatory Limitation Act</a>, block Black and brown workers from getting a raise by preventing local governments from raising the local minimum wage. This happens even in cities that are far more expensive to live in than other parts of the state. With these kinds of laws in place, it sometimes feels like it&#39;s impossible for us to win, stuck between elected officials passing the responsibility to do their jobs back and forth. </p><p>But I got involved with the Fight for $15 and a Union because I refuse to accept that anything is impossible. It&#39;s time for a change, and that change can&#39;t be just for some - it has to apply to every single worker across the country.</p><p>We&#39;ll never have a recovery that is equal and just if some workers doing the same job with the same hours thrive, while others barely survive. We cannot leave anybody behind. $15 per hour is the bare minimum we need to get by, period. </p><p>Anything less than that is not only a slap in the face, it&#39;s a strain on the economy. Workers at other restaurants like Burger King are<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/07/13/burger-king-workers-quit/\"> walking off the job</a> as a group, tired of being treated without respect. Meanwhile, millions of families like mine are forced to rely on public assistance programs, at the<a href=\"https://laborcenter.berkeley.edu/the-public-cost-of-a-low-federal-minimum-wage/\"> cost</a> of nearly $107 billion taxpayer dollars a year. Raising the wage would get people back to work and save taxpayers&#39; money too.  </p><p>As a member of the Fight for $15 and a Union, I&#39;m fighting for a future where every community can thrive, regardless of race, gender or ZIP code. I know we can get there if big corporations and our elected leaders listen to our demands for $15 and a voice on the job. </p><p>We&#39;ve been fighting for years, and now I&#39;m asking all workers and allies to join us in the call.

But the federal minimum wage of $7.25 hasn&#39;t.</p><p>In the last 12 years, a real movement to up the minimum to at least $15 has grown. <a href=\"https://fightfor15.org/about-us/\">Fight for 15</a>, a movement led by fast-food workers, began in 2012 - and it hasn&#39;t stopped campaigning. Politicians like <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-bernie-sanders-hopes-make-15-minimum-wage-reality-stimulus-2021-1\">Sen. Bernie Sanders</a> signed on to the cause. <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/most-americans-support-15-minimum-wage-split-on-how-soon-2021-2\">Polling shows</a> that most Americans want a $15 minimum wage, and voters across the political spectrum reflected that: In 2020, red state Florida <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/florida-presidential-election-2020-live-vote-counts-results-2020\">voted</a> for Donald Trump to get another term - and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/florida-minimum-wage-rise-vote-amendment-15-tipped-employees-workers-2020-11\">voted</a> a $15 minimum wage into law.</p><p>Yet, progress has stalled. Eight moderate Democrats voted against a $15 minimum in President Joe Biden&#39;s first stimulus package. </p><p>A minimum wage increase has largely fallen off the Democrats&#39; radar as they prepare to advance as much as $4 trillion in new economic spending. Progressives including Sanders and Sen.

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts told Insider. &#34;Democrats should tackle the minimum wage again. Too many people are struggling at the bottom end of the wage scale.

On the moderate side, Sen.

I actually absolutely agree that getting employers to compete for workers is critical. I think we also know, so is having a wage standard, a floor,&#34; Dube said. </p><p>&#34;The appetite to raise it is very high,&#34; Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia told Insider, but he said Democrats still disagree on things like how fast it should be raised and whether a tipped wage should be left alone.</p><p>Kaine suggested that rising wages in the service sector as well as state moves to increase pay could be dampening urgency. President Joe Biden has said that employers are starting to compete for workers by hiking pay.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60fb32a717cf960019edfc4b?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Mitt Romney congress\" height=\"683\" width=\"910\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Sen.

Scott Applewhite</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h2>What is realistic?</h2><p>While $15 is the number progressives and the president have lined up behind, centrist senators think that&#39;s too high. For instance, Sens. Mitt Romney and Kyrsten Sinema <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/romney-sinema-are-working-on-a-minimum-wage-bill-together-2021-4\">said in April</a> that they were working on a bipartisan proposal to raise the minimum wage. They didn&#39;t specify a number, but Sen. Joe Manchin told <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/minimum-wage-congress_n_60771d6fe4b001befb6fc904\">HuffPost</a> that he thought it was $11 -  a figure that Manchin, a key moderate, has <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/manchin-poses-threat-to-progressives-plan-to-raise-the-minimum-wage\">previously signaled support for</a>.</p><p>That bill hasn&#39;t materialized so far. </p><p>&#34;I think $12 is better than $7.25,&#34; Dube said. &#34;And so I think having some kind of a compromise, which for example, Joe Manchin and others can live with, is much, much better than just not doing anything.&#34;</p><p>Romney and another Republican, Sen. Tom Cotton, have laid out a separate plan to raise it to $10 an hour over two years, tied to immigration enforcement. At the time, Republican Sen. Rob Portman told Insider he supported this plan.</p><p>Some Democrats appear to be revamping older ideas to attract GOP support. Sen. Ron Wyden, chair of the Senate Finance Committee, told Insider in a statement he still supports a backdoor approach that <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/stimulus-democrats-abandon-backup-15-hour-minimum-wage-hike-2021-2\">Democrats scrapped</a> in March. </p><p>It included tax credits for small businesses and tax penalties on large firms to incentivize them to raise wages, but experts at the time said it would be very difficult to implement and easily avoidable.</p><p>&#34;I&#39;ve continued to work on the carrot from my carrot-and-stick approach,&#34; Wyden said. &#39;I want to incentivize the smallest of small businesses - those with middle-class owners - to raise their workers&#39; wages.&#34;</p><p>He went on: &#34;[I] believe including this kind of carrot is key to getting Republicans on board because that&#39;s what we&#39;ve done in the past, and getting 60 votes,&#34; he said.</p><p>The amount of things Congress must address is piling up for September, making a federal minimum wage increase very unlikely before then. Lawmakers must pass new spending bills by September 30 or else the federal government shuts down. They also need to either suspend or raise the debt ceiling and deal with the end of stimulus programs like federal unemployment aid.</p><p>&#34;Going into the fall and end of the year before the holidays is kind of wide-open,&#34; Zach Moller, director of the economic program at the centrist think-tank Third Way, told Insider. &#34;Before then, we have a lot of things that must be done.&#34;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/federal-minimum-wage-raised-12-years-ago-wont-increase-soon-2021-7'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=5dPkBtyjhBg:YJPzokYZcJY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=5dPkBtyjhBg:YJPzokYZcJY:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=5dPkBtyjhBg:YJPzokYZcJY:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=5dPkBtyjhBg:YJPzokYZcJY:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=5dPkBtyjhBg:YJPzokYZcJY:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=5dPkBtyjhBg:YJPzokYZcJY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=5dPkBtyjhBg:YJPzokYZcJY:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=5dPkBtyjhBg:YJPzokYZcJY:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/5dPkBtyjhBg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 24 Jul 2021 12:55:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/6026c6152edd0f001a8d5958?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"7f5cb78e6bd50cdad6041a3b2e4f0bf7","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn12@2020_3/2021/07/25/10-54-25-412_0e6f1da7b8bead3c.webp","destWidth":1777,"destHeight":1333,"sourceBytes":99388,"destBytes":99388,"author":"insider@insider.com (Juliana Kaplan,Joseph Zeballos-Roig,Andy Kiersz)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/6021758067d1e300113c4d41?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn31@2020_2/2021/07/25/10-54-25-751_1336abc1d6210984.webp","https://i.insider.com/60fb326917cf960019edfc3e?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn60@2020_4/2021/07/25/10-54-24-612_5032b8ccb8cf412b.webp","https://i.insider.com/60fb32a717cf960019edfc4b?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn31@2020_5/2021/07/25/10-54-26-141_4c74a6b7119b8a3f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn39@2020_3/2021/07/25/10-54-25-234_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=5dPkBtyjhBg:YJPzokYZcJY:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn4@2020_1/2021/07/25/10-54-24-470_c27169288c7a12cd.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=5dPkBtyjhBg:YJPzokYZcJY:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn47@2020_2/2021/07/25/10-54-26-221_dde515f96030187c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn95@2020_6/2021/07/25/10-54-23-641_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=5dPkBtyjhBg:YJPzokYZcJY:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn99@2020_5/2021/07/25/10-54-23-737_b6c68ff926c8ab75.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/5dPkBtyjhBg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn15@2020_5/2021/07/25/10-54-22-280_b4c99cd9d83d1f4b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1627210446775},{"createdTime":"2021-07-25 18:54:06","updatedTime":"2021-07-25 18:54:06","title":"From clip art to Comic Sans: These screenshots from 25 years ago show just how much the internet has changed","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/web-from-1996-internet-25-years-ago-screenshots-2021-7","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60f25f7571757b0018c6a38a?format=jpeg\" alt=\"clip art of a film reel and giant question mark\" height=\"577\" width=\"769\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Web Design Museum</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>A report from Morgan Stanley analysts in 1996 predicted the prevalence of the internet. </li>\n<li>It said a person of intermediate web literacy was anyone who simply knew their own email address.</li>\n<li>From clip art to Comic Sans, screenshots show how different the internet looks 25 years later.</li>\n<li id=\"recirc\"><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">See more stories on Insider&#39;s business page</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>Morgan Stanley tech analysts Mary Meeker and Chris DePuy knew the world was on the cusp of something big in 1996.

market and have the power to disrupt all kinds of traditional industries, according to RealVision CEO Raoul Pal. </p><p>Pal, who used to run hedge fund sales at Goldman Sachs, before retiring at 36 and devoting himself to other investments, told Insider in an interview he&#39;s so sure social tokens will boom that his company is planning to launch one over the next year. </p><p>Community tokens are a form of cryptocurrency that are linked to a company, an organization or even a person. The idea is the holders of that token will get perks from the issuer, such as exclusive content, access to group chats, or digital merchandise. </p><p>&#34;It&#39;s the biggest thing I&#39;ve ever seen, we all know how big crypto is, but within crypto, community tokens are going to change all business models,&#34; Pal said. </p><p>&#34;When you realise that tokenizing things changes the equation - it will not be long before Disney tokenize, because they have super fans, who want access to parts of the community. So you could have a Star Wars community, or a Disney animation community and people are fanatical about this,&#34; he said. </p><p>A sense of community has been a big factor in the growing adoption and popularity of bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market value. </p><p>Pal said he believes the market in social tokens will go from being a &#34;billion dollar&#34; business  to a &#34;trillion dollar&#34; one in the next five to 10 years, so much so that he&#39;s planning one of his own. </p><p>&#34;I&#39;m trying to work on it. We have a great, amazing community of super smart people all around the world. They write to us all the time saying please can you create a token, we want to be a part of this, we want to be part of this kind of expert network of people that love finance and, you know, love investing and learning,&#34; Pal said. </p><p>Like many other digital assets, social tokens are decentralized and run on a blockchain network, much like traditional cryptocurrencies, or digital collectible items like non-fungible tokens. </p><p>One example is the <a href=\"https://www.rally.io/creator/KSK/\">Keisuke Honda&#39;s KSK Honda Coin</a> launched by <a href=\"https://www.rally.io/creator/KSK/\">Keisuke Honda</a>, a professional Japanese footballer and manager. This token gives fans access to exclusive video updates and private chats.</p><p>Another notable example is the $RAC token by musician and producer RAC. The community token enables his fans access to private discussions, merchandise and other exclusive content. </p><p>&#34;$RAC is a token built on ethereum that I want to give to fans who support the RAC project, and who want to build it alongside me.

Retail and fast-food workers say they&#39;re being harassed and assaulted.

A survey of 4,187 McDonald&#39;s workers from last summer conducted by the Service Employees International Union found that 44% of respondents had been <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/workers-face-verbal-and-physical-assaults-from-anti-mask-customers-2020-7\">physically or verbally assaulted over mask mandates</a>. </p><p>Workers say <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/retail-workers-leaving-quit-over-nightmare-customers-low-pay-2021-5\">the abuse hasn&#39;t let up</a>, even as mask mandates have lifted in many parts of the country.

After aggression over mask compliance spiked last summer, the Federal Aviation Administration began tracking unruly passenger reports, according to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/05/28/1001385922/the-faa-has-seen-a-significantly-higher-number-of-unruly-passenger-reports-in-20\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"20\" data-uri=\"9dfce2d202c0b20da9f6fa0328dc2610\">NPR.</a> Since January 2021, the FAA has received <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/faa-charged-fines-up-to-15000-for-assaulting-flight-attendants-2021-5\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"20\" data-uri=\"a9dc4fbf60d5a81a875fb0eb7fbde8c8\">2,500 reports of unruly behavior,</a> leading to thousands of dollars in fines for passengers. </p><p>FAA spokesperson Ian Gregor told NPR that the number of reports is now &#34;significantly higher&#34; than in the past, which coincides with what flight attendants are seeing on planes: Insider&#39;s Allana Akhtar spoke with several flight attendants who described <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/flight-attendants-are-burned-out-as-passenger-violence-soars-2021-6\">witnessing &#34;unprecedented&#34; passenger violence</a> as travel returns and planes begin to fill back up. </p><p>&#34;It seems that everybody is angry at everybody 24/7,&#34; Colleen Burns, a representative with the Association of Flight Attendants union, told Insider. &#34;One little thing sets them over the edge, either they&#39;re upset they have to wear the mask or they&#39;re upset someone else isn&#39;t wearing the mask.&#34; </p><p>Some small businesses are also noticing a change in customer behavior. Paul Collurafici, the owner of <a href=\"https://www.tattoofactory.com/\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"20\" data-uri=\"4e63630cd91d121cb4a8708f8967ee22\">Tattoo Factory</a>, a piercing and tattoo studio in Chicago&#39;s Uptown neighborhood, told Insider that many of his customers are frustrated and short-tempered when they learn of the restrictions his business has had to put in place due to the pandemic. </p><p>&#34;We have a large amount of people that don&#39;t want to wait, don&#39;t want to follow the rules,&#34; he said. &#34;Everybody&#39;s just always mad.&#34; </p><h2>Fight or flight</h2><p>Marques, the Harvard psychologist, said that the pandemic has understandably caused fear and anxiety in a lot of people, which leads to the activation of the amygdala, the fight-or-flight part of our brains. </p><p>&#34;Patience is the ability to restrain your emotions a little bit, right? And you need your thinking brain there. You need to be able to assess the situation, you need to be able to just slow down and not let your emotional brain take off,&#34; she said. &#34;But if you walk into a store ... and you&#39;re already on edge, you&#39;re more likely to get impatient because you&#39;re not able to press &#39;pause&#39; on your emotional brain.&#34; </p><p>Marques explained that even though life is gradually opening back up and the most frightening days of the pandemic are hopefully behind us, people are still &#34;riding really high cortisol,&#34; which means they&#39;re more on edge and quicker to reach what she called a &#34;boiling point.&#34; </p><p>She said one way to help people recalibrate their emotions and stop resorting to aggression is to shift their perspective. </p><p>&#34;When we&#39;re anxious, our lenses are distorted. We tend to magnify or &#39;catastrophize,&#39;&#34; she said. &#34;Widen your lenses and try to collect more data - that tends to also cool off the brain a little bit.&#34; </p><div

the study found.</p><p>Representatives for Airbnb did not immediately return Insider&#39;s request for comment Saturday.</p><p>There were more than 6,000 Airbnb rentals in Boston in 2018, according to the research, more than double the number the city had in 2014, the study said. </p><p>&#34;What&#39;s interesting about social organization is that it&#39;s not really about going over to each other&#39;s houses for backyard barbecues, it&#39;s not knowing all your neighbors&#34; Daniel O&#39;Brien, one of the researchers who conducted the study, told Boston.com. &#34;It&#39;s as little as being familiar strangers.&#34;</p><p>Airbnb <a href=\"https://news.airbnb.com/airbnb-and-the-neighborhoods-our-hosts-and-guests-call-home/\">in a blog post last week</a> appeared to defend itself against claims presented by the researchers.</p><p>&#34;The study examines a handful of districts in Boston only, and then extrapolates that into nationwide generalizations without providing detailed evidence,&#34;

</p><p>&#34;Over the last year-plus, various reports indicate the unfortunate trend that crime has risen in many American cities (even as travel and tourism, including short-term rentals, have suffered in urban markets). There are many complex issues that contribute to rises and falls in crime rates that require serious research to help inform and guide public policy work,&#34; the company said in the blog post.</p><p>It added: &#34;As a society, we should be working to advance serious research. In this context, Airbnb will be formally reaching out to Northeastern University to express our concerns about the lack of academic rigor in this paper and learn more about the protocols the University applies to assure the quality of the research performed by those associated with the school.&#34;

CDC Director Rochelle Walensky previously <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/cdc-director-says-covid-19-hospitalizations-are-mostly-unvaccinated-2021-7\">called the uptick in cases a &#34;pandemic of the unvaccinated.&#34;</a></p><p>While <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/covid-after-vaccine-symptoms-to-expect-breakthrough-cases-2021-7\">breakthrough infections</a> - cases where vaccinated people test positive for the disease - can occur, the vaccines are effective in <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/us-coronavirus-deaths-nearly-all-among-unvaccinated-cdc-head-2021-7\">preventing serious illness, hospitalizations, and death</a>, according to the CDC. </p><p>The rise in cases has reopened the debate on the wearing of face masks in public settings. The CDC in May updated its guidance on masks, saying face coverings weren&#39;t necessary for fully vaccinated people in most settings. It still advises that unvaccinated people wear them, especially when indoors.</p><p>States and businesses in the US followed suit, ditching the mask requirement for vaccinated individuals.</p><p>But some areas are now taking a more cautious approach, once again encouraging all people, regardless of vaccination status, to mask up in public. Officials in Los Angeles County in California reinstated their mask mandate earlier in July, <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/los-angeles-county-reinstates-indoor-mask-mandate-covid-19-surge-2021-7\">calling the effort to stop rising case numbers an &#34;all-hands-on-deck moment.&#34; </a></p><p>Officials in St. Louis plan to reinstate their mask mandate on Monday, <a href=\"https://fox2now.com/news/mask-mandate-returns-to-st-louis-city-and-county-monday/\">according to Fox 2</a>.</p><p>The American Academy of Pediatrics earlier this week recommended that <a href=\"https://services.aap.org/en/news-room/news-releases/aap/2021/american-academy-of-pediatrics-updates-recommendations-for-opening-schools-in-fall-2021/\">all students and staff at schools wear a mask even if they&#39;re vaccinated against the disease</a> when they return to classrooms. President Joe Biden on Wednesday said the CDC would likely <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-says-cdc-will-advise-unvaccinated-kids-mask-up-school-this-fall-2021-07-22/\">recommend that unvaccinated children wear masks in the fall</a>.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-administration-considers-stricter-mask-guidance-as-delta-variant-spreads-2021-7\">Biden administration and the CDC are considering reintroducing stricter mask guidance</a>, the Washington Post reported this week, in order to protect unvaccinated people, who make up the majority of hospitalizations and deaths from the disease.</p><p>According <a href=\"https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations\">to CDC data</a>, about 49% of the US population is fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Slightly more - about 57% - of the US population is partially vaccinated against the disease.

During that time, Ingenuity is expected to have visited 10 distinct waypoints, snapping photos along the way.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60fb555728e2cf0018905738?format=jpeg\" alt=\"ingenuity flight 10 path\" height=\"784\" width=\"1224\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>An annotated image of Mars’ Jezero Crater depicts the ground track and waypoints for Ingenuity’s 10th flight.\n<p class=\"copyright\">NASA/JPL-Caltech/University of Arizona</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Flight 10 is a significant milestone, since Ingenuity has now flown twice as many times as NASA engineers originally planned. NASA expected Ingenuity to crash on its fourth or fifth flight as it tested the limits of its speed and stamina.</p><p>But Ingenuity has continued to exceed expectations. Even when <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/nasa-ingenuity-mars-helicopter-survived-mid-flight-error-2021-5\">a glitch</a> led the helicopter to wobble mid-air in May during its sixth flight, it still managed to touch down safely.</p><p>The drone started out as a technology demonstration, but NASA gave Ingenuity <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/nasa-ingenuity-mars-helicopter-to-start-scouting-2021-4\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"20\" data-uri=\"9a21f1b74edb60f5f0d2ce291f4d95f1\">a secondary mission</a> in late May after its fourth flight. Since then, Ingenuity has started scouting new Martian terrain and testing operations that NASA might want to conduct with future space helicopters. In its recent flights, Ingenuity has explored unsurveyed areas of <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/nasa-mars-rover-landing-jezero-crater-search-for-alien-life-2021-2\">Mars&#39; Jezero Crater</a> - a 28-mile-wide impact basin that was filled with water about 3.5 billion years ago - landing in new spots each time.</p><p>The uneven landscape is a challenge for Ingenuity, since rocky or rippled land can distort its field of view, causing it to veer in the wrong direction. Ingenuity&#39;s ninth flight earlier this month was a &#34;nail-biter,&#34; <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/status/314/flight-9-was-a-nail-biter-but-ingenuity-came-through-with-flying-colors/\">NASA scientists said</a>, since the helicopter had to cross over particularly treacherous terrain.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/608ad48735c46f0018c0b3ec?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Ingenuity helicopter mars first flight Taking Off and Landing\" height=\"720\" width=\"1280\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The Perseverance rover captured footage of Ingenuity taking off and landing for its first flight on April 19, 2021.\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/25838/mastcam-z-video-of-ingenuity-taking-off-and-landing/\" target=\"_blank\">NASA/JPL-Caltech/ASU/MSSS</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h2>Ingenuity is still proving itself useful on Mars, but its future is uncertain</h2><p>In Ingenuity&#39;s first four flights, the rotorcraft landed in the same spot it lifted off. Its fifth flight led it to touch down in a new airfield that it had previously flown over, photographed, and mapped. But these recent flights have sent Ingenuity traveling south over uncharted territory.</p><p>NASA engineers haven&#39;t said when Ingenuity&#39;s mission will end, but the helicopter could keep flying as long as it stays alive and doesn&#39;t interfere with the science work of the Perseverance rover.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60bfffc5fde7960018aacd9b?format=jpeg\" alt=\"ingenuity flight seven shadow\" height=\"480\" width=\"640\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Ingenuity captured a photo of its shadow during its seventh flight on Mars.\n<p class=\"copyright\">NASA/JPL-Caltech</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Perseverance is combing Jezero Crater in search of <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/nasa-mars-rover-landing-jezero-crater-search-for-alien-life-2021-2\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"100\" data-uri=\"e4cea5940cb6a3bb3c6b01eadc6ba292\">potential fossils of ancient alien microbes</a>. Ingenuity&#39;s new operations can assist with that mission: The helicopter can scout and map terrain, spot promising areas for study from the air, and fly to spots the rover can&#39;t reach.</p><p>NASA scientists are particularly curious about &#34;Raised Ridges,&#34; since water may have once flowed there. During its ninth flight, Ingenuity also snapped color images of intriguing rock outcrops that Perseverance might examine later.</p><p>&#34;We&#39;re hoping the color images will provide the closest look yet at &#39;Pilot Pinnacle,&#39; a location featuring outcrops that some team members think may record some of the deepest water environments in old Lake Jezero,&#34; NASA scientists <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/status/314/flight-9-was-a-nail-biter-but-ingenuity-came-through-with-flying-colors/\">wrote in a recent blog post</a>.</p><p>It&#39;s possible, though, that Perseverance&#39;s tight schedule won&#39;t allow it to visit the rocks, &#34;so Ingenuity may offer the only opportunity to study these deposits in any detail,&#34; the scientists said.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/nasa-mars-ingenuity-helicopter-10th-flight-2021-7'>Business Insider</a></div><div

It wasn&#39;t until Friday that campers and their parents learned she&#39;d tested positive for COVID-19.</p><p>By then, it had already been three days, and Young&#39;s daughters weren&#39;t showing any symptoms, so they went ahead to join extended family at the beach for the holiday. </p><p>&#34;We figured, &#39;OK, even if the kids are sick, we&#39;ll all be fine, it&#39;ll be fine, we&#39;re all vaccinated,&#39;&#34; she said.</p><p>All weekend, her three-year-old was &#34;crazy cranky.&#34;</p><p>&#34;Lots of meltdowns, lots of tantrums, very tired, but no discernible symptoms,&#34; she added. </p><p>By Monday evening, her six-year-old felt fatigued. She later developed a low-grade fever, headache, runny nose, and some nausea.</p><p>Some older adults in the beach house started feeling unwell too, with fatigue, and sore throats. </p><p>&#34;There were six [fully] vaccinated adults in the house,&#34; Young said. &#34;Four of us felt symptoms.&#34; </p><p>Young got a lab test for her six-year-old at a pharmacy, which came back positive for COVID-19.</p><p>&#34;We have tried so hard for the last year and a half to keep our kids safe,&#34; she said. &#34;I think everyone was very complacent, happy to have their lives back, feeling like this is over.&#34;</p><h2>More like a cold than COVID-19</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60f70ac5b9172800127521ce?format=jpeg\" alt=\"sinus/cold\" height=\"2283\" width=\"3044\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Sinus infections last longer than colds, last longer, and require antibiotics.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Halfpoint Images/ Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Young did an at-home BinaxNOW rapid test on herself once she developed symptoms.</p><p>&#34;I just started sobbing because it was like, &#39;oh my God, I have, COVID, I can&#39;t believe this happening,&#39;&#34; she said, phoning her doctor.</p><p>&#34;I was like, &#39;what should I do?&#39; And she was like, &#39;nothing ... <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-to-do-if-vaccinated-and-exposed-to-covid-experts-2021-7\">you just have to quarantine</a> and you should be fine.&#39;&#34;</p><p>For the vaccinated, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/covid-19-delta-variant-symptoms-headache-runny-nose-sore-throat-2021-6\">COVID-19 can appear like a mild illness</a>. </p><p>Young&#39;s symptoms started with a sore throat, then &#34;full-on congestion&#34; and some dizziness.

I never had any respiratory issues.&#34;</p><p>&#34;It wasn&#39;t that bad for me,&#34; Young added, sharing that some of her unvaccinated friends believe her story is another reason why they don&#39;t need to get shots.

Babcock said some fully vaccinated staff at her hospital are getting infected through their kids, too.</p><p>&#34;People who are infected are spreading more virus around them, because they have more virus in their respiratory tract,&#34; she added. </p><p>However, the same disease prevention measures <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/more-kids-hospitalized-covid-masks-vaccines-protect-children-2021-7\">many educators adopted last year</a> can still work to <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7012e3.htm\">crush transmission in the classroom.</a> <a href=\"http://modmedmicro.nsms.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/dct_schools_trial_preprint_20210722.pdf\">One recent UK preprint even suggests</a> that daily, rapid testing of students can work just as well as isolation at preventing future spread in schools.</p><h2>The CDC is &#39;not going to have the right data&#39;</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60f5f1e39addaf00191eae36?format=jpeg\" alt=\"man in a mask helps a kid roll in an inflatable trampoline during COVID-19 pandemic\" height=\"1496\" width=\"2100\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Summer camp in Culver City, California on June 14, 2021.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Young wanted to let the CDC know about her breakthrough case, but found there was nowhere to report it to the agency.

bitcoin. Industry experts say though that June&#39;s outright <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/bitcoin-price-btc-china-mining-crackdown-sichuan-cryptocurrencies-ether-2021-6\">ban on mining operations</a> has been one of the most impactful moves by the country on the bitcoin network. </p><p>Look no further than the chart of the bitcoin hashrate, the measure of computing power being contributed to the network through mining, to see the ban&#39;s effect: a significant drop-off beginning in June as the authorities in the country implemented the ban. </p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60fb20c9fc253600182039d5?format=jpeg\" alt=\"hashrate\" height=\"389\" width=\"526\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">The Block Crypto, CoinMetrics</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p> </p><p>The drop off isn&#39;t entirely negative for the mining industry, however. In fact, as more miners suddenly shut down in China, it made mining easier, and more profitable for those still able to operate.</p><p>&#34;As miners, we&#39;re all competing against each other for the same fixed piece of pie, so when the competition drops off like that, you&#39;re just getting a bigger piece of the pie,&#34; said Jason Les, CEO of <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/stock/RIOT\">Riot Blockchain</a>, one of the largest publicly traded mining companies. <br><br>He described to Insider how the network hashrate dropped 50% within a matter of weeks in June as mining in China stopped. Due to how bitcoin was designed, a drop in the hash rate also led to a drop in the network difficulty, meaning it was easier to mine with less people competing, and subsequently more profitable.</p><p>Les said the crackdown and drop in hashrate has created &#34;tremendous&#34; opportunities for miners unaffected by the ban, though he deeply sympathizes with miners in China, which is the birthplace of the bitcoin mining industry. </p><p>&#34;I can&#39;t imagine going through something like that, where just suddenly you&#39;ve devoted so much time and capital, you built this business, and then at the stroke of a pen, the government decides your business is done,&#34; he said. </p><p>As a result of the ban, miners in China are scrambling to relocate their operations to other countries. Les said his Linkedin inbox is flooded with inquiries from miners looking for facility space in the US.</p><p>&#34;There have been Chinese miners who have just showed up in Texas asking &#39;can you take us to a mining facility that you know is nearby? We need capacity,&#34; he added. </p><p>The migration out of China is especially good for mining companies that are able to host third-party miners within their facilities, like Riot.</p><p>&#34;Being a hoster puts us in a great position because now we have an increased base of prospective customers looking for space,&#34; said Les. </p><p>Interestingly, the mining ban in China has also helped bitcoin toward a fundamental goal of becoming a truly decentralized network, Whit Gibbs, CEO and co-founder of Compass Mining, told Insider. </p><p>Gibbs said the most &#34;dangerous thing for Bitcoin&#34; is for more than 50% of the hash rate to be located in any one country and vulnerable to the whims of one country&#39;s regulations. </p><p>For many years, many bitcoin enthusiasts were concerned about the hashrate being heavily concentrated in China. Now, miners are flocking to countries like the US, Kazakhstan, and Russia.</p><p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/insight/2021/new-data-reveals-timeline-of-chinas-bitcoin-mining-exodus/\">Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance</a> (CCAF), the US&#39;s share of the total <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/btc-usd?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingestgest\">bitcoin</a> hashrate increased from a mere 4.6% to 16.8% from September 2019 to April 2021. </p><p>&#34;It makes for a more secure Bitcoin,&#34; Gibbs said.</p><p> </p><p> </p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/china-bitcoin-mining-ban-riot-blockchain-renewable-jason-les-crackdown-2021-7'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=cnIkPKF9NL8:6WidPdNQL-M:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=cnIkPKF9NL8:6WidPdNQL-M:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=cnIkPKF9NL8:6WidPdNQL-M:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=cnIkPKF9NL8:6WidPdNQL-M:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=cnIkPKF9NL8:6WidPdNQL-M:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=cnIkPKF9NL8:6WidPdNQL-M:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=cnIkPKF9NL8:6WidPdNQL-M:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=cnIkPKF9NL8:6WidPdNQL-M:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/cnIkPKF9NL8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 24 Jul 2021 12:45:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/603929b6d920880018592379?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"f1ceab60ba34ce59575effb40e3c95db","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn70@2020_6/2021/07/25/10-54-21-755_0a6ffd9954251cdf.webp","destWidth":2670,"destHeight":1997,"sourceBytes":544412,"destBytes":544412,"author":"egraffeo@businessinsider.com (Emily Graffeo)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/60fb1efb0729770012b9b14d?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn24@2020_4/2021/07/25/10-54-23-467_6467a8ae976f4aad.webp","https://i.insider.com/60fb20c9fc253600182039d5?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn90@2020_3/2021/07/25/10-54-21-728_e84cc2f7833e87cb.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn39@2020_3/2021/07/25/10-54-25-234_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=cnIkPKF9NL8:6WidPdNQL-M:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn60@2020_1/2021/07/25/10-54-23-907_b44d5116c02e06cf.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=cnIkPKF9NL8:6WidPdNQL-M:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn35@2020_3/2021/07/25/10-54-24-580_f080ebda71fd3565.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn95@2020_6/2021/07/25/10-54-23-641_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=cnIkPKF9NL8:6WidPdNQL-M:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn92@2020_3/2021/07/25/10-54-22-649_3002eb8a44d0c299.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/cnIkPKF9NL8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn55@2020_6/2021/07/25/10-54-23-214_e0c22ae56356c6e7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1627210446761},{"createdTime":"2021-07-25 18:54:06","updatedTime":"2021-07-25 18:54:06","title":"California Gov.

500</a> companies are on track for the best earnings growth since 2009, with companies smashing estimates as the US economy bounces back to life from COVID-19 lockdowns.</p><p>The strong quarter is helping support stocks despite high equity prices, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/consumer-price-index-inflation-june-2021-7\">rising inflation,</a> and the threat of the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/delta-variant-new-covid-19-cases-cdc-director-2021-7\">delta coronavirus variant</a>.</p><p>Earnings for S&#38;P 500 companies are expected to grow 78.1% year-on-year in the second quarter, according to figures from financial data company Refinitiv, released Friday. That would be the best quarterly performance since the final three months of 2009, during the initial rebound from the financial crisis.</p><p>Around a quarter of the 500 companies that make up the benchmark US stock index have reported. Those in the industrial, consumer discretionary, and financial sectors are set to do the best as they profit from the reopening of the economy and favorable comparisons to last year&#39;s weak second-quarter earnings.</p><p>So far, 88% of S&#38;P 500 companies have beaten earnings per share estimates for the second quarter, according to data provider FactSet.</p><p>The strong results put the S&#38;P 500 on track to be the best quarter for beats since FactSet started tracking the data in 2008. The current record was registered in the first quarter of 2021, when 86% of companies beat estimates.</p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/stocks-to-buy-goldman-sachs-minimal-risk-adjusted-high-returns-2021-7\">GOLDMAN SACHS: 33 stocks to buy right now for strong returns of at least 15% and minimal risk as the economic reopening helps equities grind higher into year-end</a></em></p><p>And companies are raising their expectations for earnings and sales as the economic rebound continues. For example, <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/ko-stock\">Coca-Cola</a> stock jumped on Wednesday when it <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/coca-cola-beats-expectations--raises-guidance-10354842\">increased its revenue and earnings outlook</a>, citing the strong economy.</p><p>Investors have not reacted strongly to the second-quarter earnings, given that the S&#38;P 500 has already soared more than 90% since its pandemic-induced crash in March 2020.</p><p>But the strong earnings are helping the benchmark US stock index hover at record highs.</p><p>JPMorgan analysts, led by Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, on Tuesday upgraded their year-end target for the S&#38;P 500 from 4,400 to 4,600, which would be roughly a 5% increase from Friday&#39;s level.</p><p>The index &#34;should be supported by strong earnings growth and capital return until 2023,&#34; Lakos-Bujas and colleagues said in a note.</p><p>Importantly for investors, profit margins are strong despite rising inflation and some reports of higher costs. John Butters, senior earnings analyst at FactSet, said net profit margin for the S&#38;P 500 for the second quarter is expected to be 12.4%.</p><p>&#34;If 12.4% is the actual net profit margin for the quarter, it will mark the second-highest net profit margin for the index since FactSet began tracking this metric in 2008, trailing only last quarter&#39;s net profit margin of 12.8%,&#34; he said.</p><p>Yet, there are risks ahead, not least the fact that the coronavirus pandemic is far from over. Delta variant cases have soared in Britain, and survey data suggests the numbers are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jul/23/uk-recovery-slows-amid-waning-consumer-demand-and-staff-shortages\">slowing the country&#39;s economic recovery</a>.</p><p>Cases are now on the rise again in the US, contributing in part to a <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-news-today-dow-falls-delta-variant-covid-economy-2021-7\">sharp sell-off on Monday</a>, which saw the S&#38;P 500 drop 1.6% and the <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/index/dow_jones\">Dow Jones</a> fall 2.1%.</p><p>However, many investors are hoping high vaccination rates can keep advanced economies ticking over. Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a note: &#34;We see reasons to look beyond the delta variant headlines and stay risk-on, with a tilt toward reflation and reopening beneficiaries.&#34;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/sp-500-q2-earnings-growth-beats-estimates-best-since-2009-2021-7'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=_Wsr-RO2vzw:lv_-pGyzd8Y:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=_Wsr-RO2vzw:lv_-pGyzd8Y:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=_Wsr-RO2vzw:lv_-pGyzd8Y:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=_Wsr-RO2vzw:lv_-pGyzd8Y:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=_Wsr-RO2vzw:lv_-pGyzd8Y:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=_Wsr-RO2vzw:lv_-pGyzd8Y:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=_Wsr-RO2vzw:lv_-pGyzd8Y:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=_Wsr-RO2vzw:lv_-pGyzd8Y:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/_Wsr-RO2vzw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 25 Jul 2021 10:30:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/60fadf290729770012b98e66?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"9df1c9e3168102a32b46c32a117bc84f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn23@2020_1/2021/07/25/10-54-25-463_e83b1a0e99950834.webp","destWidth":5037,"destHeight":3777,"sourceBytes":928272,"destBytes":928272,"author":"hrobertson@businessinsider.com (Harry Robertson)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/60fadf2ffc2536001820167d?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn88@2020_1/2021/07/25/10-54-23-663_4ae8edcca2ade279.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn39@2020_3/2021/07/25/10-54-25-234_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=_Wsr-RO2vzw:lv_-pGyzd8Y:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn44@2020_1/2021/07/25/10-54-22-192_3ef8ba7fdde56199.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=_Wsr-RO2vzw:lv_-pGyzd8Y:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn68@2020_5/2021/07/25/10-54-23-201_6b8374be55059965.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn95@2020_6/2021/07/25/10-54-23-641_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=_Wsr-RO2vzw:lv_-pGyzd8Y:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn56@2020_2/2021/07/25/10-54-22-229_52e321d8fba8d6ee.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/_Wsr-RO2vzw":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn60@2020_3/2021/07/25/10-54-23-701_70753a8bf8d354dd.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1627210446750},{"createdTime":"2021-07-25 18:54:06","updatedTime":"2021-07-25 18:54:06","title":"Larry Page has gone to Fiji and sold his superyacht","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/larry-page-has-gone-to-fiji-and-sold-his-superyacht-2021-7","description":"<p><em>Hello, and welcome to this week&#39;s edition of the Insider Tech newsletter, where we break down the biggest news in tech, including:</em></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/larry-page-google-bought-fiji-island-pandemic-hiding-tavarua-namotu-2021-7\">Larry Page&#39;s Fiji hideout</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-wework-ipo-meltdown-bankers-adam-neumann-chaotic-partnership-2021-7\">The wild WeWork IPO plan that almost came to be</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/uber-losing-employees-high-turnover-attrition-rate-hr-chief-problem-2021-7\">Uber&#39;s brain drain</a></li></ul><h4><a href=\"http://newsletter.businessinsider.com/join/4np/insider-tech\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"20\" data-uri=\"ab8c784ee8c356d47b5e9cae96866a10\">Did someone forward this newsletter to you?

One of those people who died was 51-year-old<a href=\"https://www.kgw.com/article/news/local/oregon-osha-death-investigation-walmart-warehouse-worker-hermiston/283-4a855197-a1f7-4259-85b4-265b82ccb1f4\"> Kenton Scott Krupp, a worker at the </a> Walmart distribution center in Hermiston, Oregon.</p><p>According to the New York Times, <a href=\"https://www.kgw.com/article/news/local/oregon-osha-death-investigation-walmart-warehouse-worker-hermiston/283-4a855197-a1f7-4259-85b4-265b82ccb1f4\">Krupp</a> worked in a<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/09/us/heat-wave-deaths.html\"> hot trailer</a> with only a fan to circulate air, and prior to the end of his shift he found it hard to speak and walk. </p><p>Two days after Krupp&#39;s death, Sebastian Francisco Perez, a migrant farm worker from Guatemala,<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/canada-lifestyle-heat-waves-coronavirus-pandemic-immigration-ec7c31c85db5ef51e56e9d2fed33e719\"> died</a> from heat-related causes working on an apple orchard. These deaths expose the terrible conditions workers face while trying to earn a living.</p><p>Just like the COVID-19 crisis, workers were left to fend for themselves during the extreme heat - especially among low-income and minority communities. We were foolish not to tackle the pandemic early enough, and we can&#39;t afford to ignore that mistake when it comes to the all but guaranteed heatwaves of the future.</p><h2>Heat warning </h2><p>Upon prolonged exposure to extreme temperatures, people can develop heat exhaustion which can lead to headaches, dizziness, nausea and other debilitating symptoms. More seriously, one can develop heatstroke and begin to fall unconscious - which if left untreated, can lead to death. From making asthma worse, to making mental health worse, extreme heat can do untold<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/weather-in-summer-heat-impact-on-health-2018-7#heat-waves-are-the-deadliest-form-of-extreme-weatherresponsible-for-more-deaths-in-the-us-every-year-than-the-combined-effects-of-hurricanes-lightning-tornadoes-earthquakes-and-floods-8\"> damage to our bodies</a>. Multiply this at a population level and you&#39;ve got a seasonal public health crisis.</p><p>Between<a href=\"https://www.ufwfoundation.org/federalheatprotections\"> 1992 and 2017</a>, 815 workers died from heat related causes and more than 70,000 were injured. New research published recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jul/21/us-worker-workplace-injury-heat-study-data\">has suggested</a> that this number may be a significant undercount. Farm workers working all day, outdoors, and with little to shade them are the most at risk. Statistics collected by the CDC from 1992 through 2006 show that US farm workers face a rate of death from heatstroke that is<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5724a1.htm\"> 20 times higher</a> than other workers. During this heat, many workers have started their days under the cover of darkness at 2 or 3 AM.</p><p>Recognizing the danger the heat posed to farm workers, the United Farm Workers and other organizations have consistently called for regulations to protect workers from the heat.<a href=\"https://www.ufwfoundation.org/federalheatprotections\"> These include</a> providing breaks, water, access to shade and training on how to recognize heat stroke symptoms. On July 6, Oregon&#39;s governor<a href=\"https://www.oregon.gov/newsroom/Pages/NewsDetail.aspx?newsid=64091\"> directed</a> the state&#39;s Occupational Safety and Health Association (OSHA) to enact emergency rules that would protect workers from the heat. Washington instituted<a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/business/agriculture/washington-state-to-release-emergency-heat-rules-for-farmworkers-as-advocates-demand-added-protections/\"> similar emergency rules</a> days later. These changes are necessary, but they only came after workers died.</p><p>Farm workers may be the most at risk, but other workers have been harmed by the brutal heat. Last month, workers<a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/heat-wave-workers-walk-out_n_60dcd0c9e4b03d4073e55032?6ky\"> walked off the job</a> at restaurants across the country because of overheated working conditions . </p><p>These stories make it clear that workers - from construction workers, to line cooks, to warehouse workers - need a national standard to mitigate the risk for heat stroke across our rapidly warming country.</p><p>But instead of being proactive, the lack of a unified response to this public health crisis is similar to how the federal government approached the pandemic. <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/covid-19-farmworkers-among-highest-risk-studies-show/\">Farmworkers</a> and<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/02/jobs-where-workers-have-the-highest-risk-of-dying-from-covid-study.html\"> line cooks</a> were also at higher risk for contracting and dying from COVID and  workers across industries were abandoned without any proper protections. When President Biden took office, he promised an emergency temporary standard that would address COVID. When a regulation was finally issued, it only<a href=\"https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/osha-covid-19-rule-intended-to-cover-all-workers-draft-shows\"> covered healthcare workers</a>.</p><p>When we&#39;re talking about health, we can&#39;t ignore the role that our living environments play. With COVID, communities of color across the country saw<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/investigations/coronavirus-race-data-map/\"> higher rates of the disease</a>, as a lot of this spread was<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7436547/\"> tied to work</a>. People would have to work in person and come home, often to<a href=\"https://khn.org/news/multigenerational-households-social-distancing-at-home-coronavirus/\"> multigenerational homes</a>, increasing the spread of the virus.It&#39;s a similar case for heat related illness. In 1995, when a blistering heatwave hit Chicago, most of the dead were<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/heat-waves-fall-hardest-poor-elderly-experts-say-n1031871\"> low-income and Black residents of the city</a> who lived in apartments that did not have air conditioning. 25 years later, there isn&#39;t much that&#39;s changed.</p><p>According to statistics collected by the federal government over a decade ago,<a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/reports/2009/air-conditioning.php\"> nearly 18% of households</a> below the poverty line do not have any form of air conditioning at all and about 30% of  households use window units or &#34;room air conditioning&#34; compared to central A/C. Of course, even if one has an air conditioner,using it can cause<a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2020-06-air-conditioner-electric-bill-energy.html\"> electric bills to increase</a> significantly, meaning some may have units but can&#39;t afford to use them. Extreme heat is especially a concern during the pandemic, when people may feel that it&#39;s unsafe to use communal<a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/07/09/metro/will-staying-cool-this-summer-be-luxury-only-some-can-afford/\"> public cooling centers</a>.</p><p>Of course, it&#39;s not just A/C. Low-income Black and Latinx communities are located in areas that are less likely to have<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/06/30/opinion/environmental-inequity-trees-critical-infrastructure.html\"> tree cover</a>, and as a result, are more likely to be<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/09/climate/city-heat-islands.html\"> heat islands</a> that attract heat - a legacy of racist<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/08/24/climate/racism-redlining-cities-global-warming.html\"> redlining housing policies</a>.</p><p>All of this results in the same disparities that we saw with COVID.<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/heat-related-illness-affects-ethnic-groups-disproportionately-n976501\"> Data from California</a> shows that emergency room visits for heat-related illnesses increased for all groups between 2005 and 2015, but mostly increased for African Americans (67%), Hispanics (63%), Asian Americans (53%), as compared to white Americans (27%).<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-temperature-immigrants-casualties/immigrant-workers-in-u-s-have-tripled-risk-for-heat-related-death-idUSKBN1DE2G3\"> Data collected by the CDC</a> shows that compared to US citizens, immigrants have nearly three times the risk of dying from a heat related illness.</p><p>So what do we do about it? In most states, there are<a href=\"https://www.apartments.com/blog/is-my-landlord-required-to-provide-heat-and-ac\"> no regulations</a> that require a landlord to provide air conditioning to renters - requiring that landlords provide cooling like they do heat is an easy start. Some rightfully point out that<a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/heat-waves-2021-western-us-climate-change-1187805/\"> A/C uses a lot of energy</a> and thereby contributes to the climate crisis, this is undoubtedly true but cooling is a necessity, not a luxury.</p><p>Of course, we can take steps to make neighborhoods cooler - by planting more trees and greenery to create more shade, by retrofitting homes and apartment buildings with rooftop gardens or reflective roofing, and by using solar panels. This could all be done with the<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/05/11/993976948/reaching-back-to-the-new-deal-biden-proposes-a-civilian-climate-corps\"> Civilian Climate Corps</a> that has been proposed by the Biden administration</p><p>We could also deal with future heatwaves like we do the pandemic. Declare a public health emergency and ask people to stay home when they can, close businesses and mandate heat leave pay, and offer transportation to cooling centers. For those still working essential jobs, provide heat hazard pay and labor protections.</p><p>Currently, California is one of the<a href=\"https://civileats.com/2021/06/14/as-the-climate-emergency-grows-farmworkers-lack-protection-from-deadly-heat/\"> few states</a> that have labor protections for heat built into law - the others being Minnesota and Washington. Despite attempts in Congress over the past few years to do so, there are no federal labor standards that address heat.

Before COVID-19, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/experts-predict-when-airline-business-class-travel-will-return-2021-7\">business travelers made up</a> 12% to 15% of trips on larger airlines but generated about 45% of airlines&#39; revenue.</p><p>And while leisure demand has passed complete recovery, business travel is still lagging behind by 60%, Scott Kirby, United Airlines CEO&#39;s, told John Dickerson on CBS&#39; &#34;<a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/united-airlines-ceo-scott-kirby-on-face-the-nation-july-11-2021/\">Face the Nation</a>.&#34; Similarly Southwest Airlines&#39; &#34;business travel component&#34; was down 69%  in June, Gary Kelly, Southwest Airlines chairman and CEO, told <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2021-07-22/southwest-ceo-kelly-on-second-quarter-business-travel-video\">Bloomberg</a>. Kelly predicts this segment will continue to be down 50% by September, and will then improve afterwards.</p><p>In 2022 and 2023, Southwest plans to bring back more flights catered to business customers.</p><p>The consensus is that business travel will accelerate in September after Labor Day, Patrick Scholes, an analyst at Truist Securities, told Insider. And 63% of companies plan to bring back business travel within the next one to three months, according to a <a href=\"https://www.gbta.org/Portals/0/Coronavirus_Recovery_Poll_Key_Highlights_07-19-21.pdf?ver=2021-07-16-151909-503\">Global Business Travel Association</a> survey of over 600 companies.</p><p><em><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/experts-predict-when-airline-business-class-travel-will-return-2021-7\">Lost business class travel is pummeling big airlines.

But he believes there will be a &#34;modest acceleration&#34; after the federal holiday, and that the segment will still be down compared to 2019. </p><p>&#34;Some of the more bullish folks in the greater industry think it&#39;ll be a full recovery by the end of next year,&#34; Scholes said. &#34;Some of the more conservative, perhaps not until 2024.&#34;</p><p>Both Scholes and Kirby fall somewhere in between: They believe business travel will be back by the end of 2023.</p><h2>The impact on hotels</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60587fdb1fcb5700186eea2e?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Airport pandemic covid travel Illinois\" height=\"1998\" width=\"2664\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Travelers arrive for flights at O&#39;Hare international Airport on March 16, 2021 in Chicago, Illinois.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Scott Olson/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>It&#39;s not just airlines: The slow and steady increase in business travel is also impacting hotels.</p><p>From June 21 to June 24 (a Monday through Thursday when business travel typically happens) the revenue per available room for generic business travel hotels was down about 45% compared to the same time in 2019. Meanwhile, mid-week stays at economy hotels - like Super 8, which primarily caters to leisure travelers - were up almost 10%.</p><p>Luckily, the <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/hotels/2021/05/11/business-and-leisure-travel-beginning-blend-marriott-ceo-says/5035270001/\">increasingly blurred line between business and leisure travel</a> has &#34;helped cushion the blow,&#34; Scholes said. But even this won&#39;t &#34;ever fully account for that Wednesday night business travel.&#34;</p><p>As a result, &#34;the road to a full recovery for America&#39;s hotels is long and uneven,&#34; Chip Rogers, president and CEO of American Hotel and Lodging Association (AHLA) said in a <a href=\"https://www.ahla.com/press-release/reports-nearly-500000-hotel-jobs-wont-return-years-end-room-revenue-will-be-down-44\">press release</a>. Like other experts, AHLA predicts business travel won&#39;t fully recover until 2023 or 2024, citing that many conferences, conventions, and in-person events have already been pushed back until 2022.</p><p>Business travel recovery depends on factors like persistent COVID-19 concerns, the rise in Zoom, and the newfound work from home comfort that has replaced the time and stress of commuting. However, Scholes doesn&#39;t believe these factors will permanently slice business travel in half, which is<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gates-business-travel-office-work-predictions-post-pandemic-2020-11\"> what Bill Gates predicted in 2020</a>.</p><p>&#34;In my view, that is way off,&#34; Scholes said, predicting that about 5% of business travel customers will be lost in the end.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/leisure-travel-coming-back-experts-business-travel-recovery-years-out-2021-7'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=mHKeA2bDiFQ:jheaXavyhhg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=mHKeA2bDiFQ:jheaXavyhhg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=mHKeA2bDiFQ:jheaXavyhhg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=mHKeA2bDiFQ:jheaXavyhhg:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=mHKeA2bDiFQ:jheaXavyhhg:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=mHKeA2bDiFQ:jheaXavyhhg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=mHKeA2bDiFQ:jheaXavyhhg:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=mHKeA2bDiFQ:jheaXavyhhg:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/mHKeA2bDiFQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 24 Jul 2021 12:01:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/60f9839e0729770012b94556?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"018ba8193fd124ab45cfdddd1ed5410d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn81@2020_5/2021/07/25/10-54-21-733_1c256895c564587a.webp","destWidth":1428,"destHeight":1071,"sourceBytes":117836,"destBytes":117836,"author":"bchang@businessinsider.com (Brittany Chang)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/60f97f2ffc253600181fcbea?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn27@2020_5/2021/07/25/10-54-23-766_5aa76a78a14225ad.webp","https://i.insider.com/60587fdb1fcb5700186eea2e?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn44@2020_1/2021/07/25/10-54-23-167_251db996bc30ff9a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn39@2020_3/2021/07/25/10-54-25-234_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=mHKeA2bDiFQ:jheaXavyhhg:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn56@2020_4/2021/07/25/10-54-25-293_ba445796c67cba6a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=mHKeA2bDiFQ:jheaXavyhhg:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn88@2020_4/2021/07/25/10-54-24-008_c468ec853ec573aa.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn95@2020_6/2021/07/25/10-54-23-641_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=mHKeA2bDiFQ:jheaXavyhhg:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn12@2020_4/2021/07/25/10-54-26-224_5dadd3181378203e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/mHKeA2bDiFQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn72@2020_4/2021/07/25/10-54-25-270_02c9b0147832955d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1627210446774},{"createdTime":"2021-07-25 18:54:06","updatedTime":"2021-07-25 18:54:06","title":"Biden has been assessing the legality of canceling $50,000 in student debt for millions of Americans.

The $50,000 figure wasn&#39;t his idea; Sen. Elizabeth Warren campaigned on canceling that amount, while Biden said he&#39;d wipe out a more moderate $10,000 per borrower. </p><p>During a CNN town hall in February, Biden began to change his tune, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-wont-cancel-student-debt-heres-why-go-big-economy-2021-2\">saying</a> he didn&#39;t believe he had the legal ability to cancel $50,000 per borrower.</p><p>Soon afterward, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/02/17/press-briefing-by-press-secretary-jen-psaki-and-deputy-national-security-advisor-for-cyber-and-emerging-technology-anne-neuberger-february-17-2021/\">said</a> in February that Biden had asked the Justice Department to conduct a review on his ability to cancel $50,000 in student debt per borrower using executive powers. </p><p>White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain told Politico in April that Biden had also asked Education Secretary Miguel Cardona to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-wants-to-cancel-student-loan-debt-ron-klain-says-2021-4\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"20\" data-uri=\"05c21c044de677fdb8e598f30016a856\">create a memo</a> on the president&#39;s legal authority to forgive $50,000 in student loans per person. He said Biden will &#34;look at that legal authority.&#34;</p><p>&#34;He&#39;ll look at the policy issues around that, and he&#39;ll make a decision,&#34; Klain said. &#34;He hasn&#39;t made a decision on that either way, and, in fact, he hasn&#39;t yet gotten the memos that he needs to start to focus on that decision.&#34;</p><p>So when will Biden be getting those memos?</p><p>Neither the Education nor the Justice Department responded to Insider&#39;s requests for comment, leaving borrowers with no timeline on when Biden will get the information he needs to make a decision on broad student-debt cancellation. The White House also did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>In terms of what experts think will come of the reviews, opinions differ. Mark Kantrowitz, an expert on student loans who has published bestselling books on the subject, told Insider <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/student-loan-debt-cancellation-biden-jobs-economic-recovery-education-2021-7\">last month</a> that if the departments are truly conducting these reviews, they will find Biden &#34;does not have that authority&#34; under the Higher Education Act.</p><p>&#34;He has asked the Department of Justice and US Department of Education to give them a report on whether he has that authority,&#34; Kantrowitz said, &#34;and if they&#39;re honest, they&#39;re going to say &#39;no.&#39;&#34;</p><p>Kantrowitz said the Democrats pushing for $50,000 in student debt cancellation are taking a section of the Higher Education Act out of context, and it&#39;s Congress that has &#34;the power of the purse&#34; and ultimately holds the authority to wipe out debt.

Warren and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer - agree with Frotman. Since Biden took office, they have <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/warren-schumer-biden-cancel-student-debt-executive-order-keep-pressure-2021-3\">remained adamant</a> that the Higher Education Act would permit the president to wipe out student debt for borrowers, and they are urging him to act as soon as possible, even before the results of the reviews are released.</p><p>Warren previously told Insider that she thinks the reviews are a step in the right direction, and for this article, referred Insider to a <a href=\"https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Ltr%20to%20Warren%20re%20admin%20debt%20cancellation.pdf\">letter</a> from the Legal Services Center of Harvard Law School that detailed the Education Secretary&#39;s legal ability to cancel student debt. </p><p>&#34;President Biden can cancel $50,000 of student loan debt with the stroke of a pen,&#34; Warren told Insider in June. &#34;He doesn&#39;t need Congress to act, he can do it on his own, and I hope that&#39;s what he&#39;s going to do.&#34;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/student-debt-cancellation-education-justice-department-reviews-biden-status-unknown-2021-7'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=R2psazNsttY:2bhywxa3MgI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=R2psazNsttY:2bhywxa3MgI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=R2psazNsttY:2bhywxa3MgI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=R2psazNsttY:2bhywxa3MgI:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=R2psazNsttY:2bhywxa3MgI:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=R2psazNsttY:2bhywxa3MgI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=R2psazNsttY:2bhywxa3MgI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=R2psazNsttY:2bhywxa3MgI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/R2psazNsttY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 24 Jul 2021 12:45:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/60fada5efc253600182012f8?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"095b97f96626dd5d923777f5bbb5697a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn18@2020_2/2021/07/25/10-54-19-417_f59f20e1687c09f7.webp","destWidth":4190,"destHeight":3142,"sourceBytes":199072,"destBytes":199072,"author":"asheffey@businessinsider.com (Ayelet Sheffey)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/60fada5efc253600182012f8?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn18@2020_2/2021/07/25/10-54-19-417_f59f20e1687c09f7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn39@2020_3/2021/07/25/10-54-25-234_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=R2psazNsttY:2bhywxa3MgI:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn16@2020_5/2021/07/25/10-54-24-793_4206b9da85b380f8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=R2psazNsttY:2bhywxa3MgI:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn39@2020_4/2021/07/25/10-54-26-205_c425b8b8bc171234.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn95@2020_6/2021/07/25/10-54-23-641_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=R2psazNsttY:2bhywxa3MgI:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn63@2020_6/2021/07/25/10-54-23-609_8ad08f7be733e515.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/R2psazNsttY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn80@2020_1/2021/07/25/10-54-22-103_d2b1a893e287e843.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1627210446772},{"createdTime":"2021-07-25 18:54:06","updatedTime":"2021-07-25 18:54:06","title":"A 19-year-old restaurant boss started out buttering toast for $9.25 an hour - now, he earns $50,000 and manages 22 people.

hotly-anticipated initial public offering, founder Vlad Tenev is trying to make good on that promise by offering <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/robinhood-seeking-35-billion-ipo-2021-7\">a third</a> of the company&#39;s shares directly to customers through its app, a far greater amount than is usually offered to individual investors during most IPOs. </p><p>The decision was surprising, but gels with the company&#39;s stated mission to even the playing field between retail investors and massive institutions. Still, <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/robinhood-ipo-risk-valuation-regulation-analysis-payment-order-flow-stock-2021-7\">some</a> experts have fretted over risks in the upcoming debut, particularly around the payment for order flow practice at the heart of Robinhood&#39;s business model.</p><p>Meanwhile, Robinhood itself has <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/robinhood-ipo-warns-meme-stock-status-day-trader-reddit-wallstreetbets-2021-7\">warned</a> investors that retail-trader interest could pose a risk to the stock price. </p><p>Still, Robinhood&#39;s IPO is among the most highly anticipated of the year. The company counts 17.7 million monthly active users, and the app added six million new active accounts in just the first quarter of this year. </p><p>The Menlo Park, California-based firm in its regulatory <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001783879/000162828021013986/robinhoods-1a1.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">filing</a> said it is aiming to raise as much as <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/robinhood-ipo-pricing-upcoming-stock-market-debut-offering-price-2021-7\">$2.3 billion</a> in its IPO. It is offering 55 million shares priced at $38-$42, putting its market valuation at <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/robinhood-ipo-pricing-upcoming-stock-market-debut-offering-price-2021-7\">$35 billion</a> at the top range. </p><p>According to reports, the company will start trading this coming Thursday, July 29, under the ticker HOOD. </p><p>Insider asked six experts on what to expect ahead of Robinhood&#39;s debut:</p><p><em>(Comments are lightly edited and condensed for clarity.)</em></p><h3>On reserving shares for retail investors</h3><p>&#34;I am struck by Robinhood&#39;s decision to reserve shares for their customers. This may be a strategy to try to build brand loyalty ... Many IPO processes allow participation restrictions that are somewhat skewed towards investors who are relatively informed about the business fundamentals.&#34; - <strong>Chester Spatt, finance professor at Carnegie Mellon University&#39;s Tepper School of Business. </strong></p><p>&#34;Robinhood is following the market trend of today&#39;s most innovative assets, such as bitcoin, by giving retail investors more or all of the first bite at the apple ahead of institutional investors. You no longer need to hit a certain level of financial eliteness in order to access portfolio-defining assets, and that is a meaningful win for retail investors.&#34; - <strong>Rodrigo Vicuna, CFO of Prime Trust.</strong></p><p>&#34;Selling almost a third of its offering directly to customers is a strategic decision by Robinhood to ensure they can keep a fixed customer base of retailers who use only Robinhood for trading. This will ensure that more retail investors buy the shares.&#34; - <strong>Ben Yankowitz, CFO of RocketFuel Blockchain, a payments processing firm</strong>.</p><h3><strong>On valuation</strong></h3><p><strong>&#34;</strong>With Robinhood&#39;s demographic and emotional connection with investors that have powered the rocket ship rides of AMC and Gamestop, anything is possible. The valuation is insane ... They are hoodwinking their clients. They tell people they aren&#39;t paying commissions but the commissions are just hidden in the trading.&#34; - <strong>Eric Schiffer, CEO of Patriarch Organization, a private equity firm.</strong></p><p>&#34;We can expect fireworks. Robinhood traders have become one of the biggest stories in finance over the past 12 months ... Robinhood seeking a valuation of around $35 billion strikes me as reasonable given this context ... I think it could have commanded a significantly higher valuation if it had not received so much negative press for the meme stock trade-halting controversy.&#34; - <strong>Josh Fraser, co-founder of Origin Protocol, a blockchain firm.</strong></p><p>&#34;Robinhood has seen tremendous success over the past 18 months ... I will say, however, that companies that IPO like this tend to see massive hype initially, followed by a sell-off, so if I was to invest in this, I would wait for that entry point rather than participate in the IPO.&#34; - <strong>Darren Franceschini, co-founder of BlockBank, an AI-powered banking platform.</strong></p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/robinhood-ipo-trading-expectations-retail-traders-customers-meme-stocks-2021-7'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=E8eZkyC21Qc:UVIEnlI04gA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=E8eZkyC21Qc:UVIEnlI04gA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=E8eZkyC21Qc:UVIEnlI04gA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=E8eZkyC21Qc:UVIEnlI04gA:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=E8eZkyC21Qc:UVIEnlI04gA:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=E8eZkyC21Qc:UVIEnlI04gA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=E8eZkyC21Qc:UVIEnlI04gA:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=E8eZkyC21Qc:UVIEnlI04gA:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/E8eZkyC21Qc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 24 Jul 2021 13:48:34 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/60fad7d30729770012b989c8?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"d40aa4218e975624cb99e2c4be0d4c72","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn15@2020_5/2021/07/25/10-54-25-345_0407d45cfb7f97dd.webp","destWidth":3546,"destHeight":2660,"sourceBytes":494168,"destBytes":494168,"author":"ilee@insider.com (Isabelle Lee)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/60fad7bffc2536001820117e?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn63@2020_5/2021/07/25/10-54-25-878_a26655c2e35e6d0d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn39@2020_3/2021/07/25/10-54-25-234_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=E8eZkyC21Qc:UVIEnlI04gA:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn100@2020_4/2021/07/25/10-54-22-314_eedf5269042cd75e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=E8eZkyC21Qc:UVIEnlI04gA:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn11@2020_6/2021/07/25/10-54-23-754_1ebc4e401219c78d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn95@2020_6/2021/07/25/10-54-23-641_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=E8eZkyC21Qc:UVIEnlI04gA:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn67@2020_2/2021/07/25/10-54-22-234_ca64575ffbc29dd2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/E8eZkyC21Qc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn52@2020_6/2021/07/25/10-54-25-183_32b94d2c948e60d9.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1627210446756},{"createdTime":"2021-07-25 18:54:06","updatedTime":"2021-07-25 18:54:06","title":"Arizona secretary of state tells Trump to 'accept' his election loss and 'move on' ahead of Phoenix rally","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/arizona-secretary-of-state-trump-accept-election-loss-2021-7","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60fc2f7d28e2cf0018905bbf?format=jpeg\" alt=\"trump rally arizona\" height=\"1000\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>President Donald Trump at a campaign rally in Arizona on October 19, 2020.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Carlos Barria/Reuters</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>In a CNN interview Friday, the Arizona secretary of state said Trump needs to &#34;move on&#34;

The thoughts expressed are those of the author.</li>\n<li id=\"recirc\"><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">See more stories on Insider&#39;s business page</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>Markets plunged earlier this week as concerns about the outlook swelled. The fear is in many ways understandable. COVID conditions, at least as proxied by cases, are deteriorating. At the same time, worrying economic trends have popped up in the form of a potentially more aggressive Federal Reserve and the market reflecting signs of weakening growth. </p><p>But just as stocks have mostly shrugged off their heartburn from earlier in the week, so too should you not get concerned about these developments. There&#39;s good reason to believe the US economy is going to hold up just fine.</p><h2><strong>The bad news</strong></h2><p>First, let&#39;s see why people are getting spooked.</p><p>First is the COVID story. In the US, hospitalizations are on the rise and <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/us-coronavirus-deaths-surge-unvaccinated-long-term-effects-2021-7\">case positivity is at its highest rate</a> since April. Policymakers are even bringing up the possibility of renewed restrictions in some areas. In response, <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/reopening-stocks-carnival-delta-stock-price-cruises-covid-delta-variant-2021-7\">reopening stocks got clipped</a>. Carnival Cruise Lines and Delta Airlines saw big drop offs early in the week and have sunk over the last few months. Planet Fitness is down while Peloton is up sharply. In other words, these companies are trading as if it is spring 2020 again and there is no effective vaccine. </p><p>Next, there are worries over the Fed&#39;s next meeting and whether the central bank is ready to take the foot off the gas when it comes to helping the economy. The market&#39;s current expectations for tapering - when the Fed will ease its support by slowing its buying of bonds - is for the process to begin sometime late this year, as recently reported by the WSJ. At any rate, it&#39;s odd to see the Fed tapering while concerns around COVID appear to be climbing.</p><p>Finally, growth concerns appear to be picking up. Corporate credit conditions, basically how affordable it is for companies to take on and pay back debt, are getting worse. This is a sign that investors don&#39;t think the booming pace of economic growth can keep up.</p><h2><strong>The good news</strong></h2><p>So, why don&#39;t I buy into the worries?</p><p>First, COVID is endemic. There is no doing away with it, but there is managing it. What I see shows that places that are vaccinated are not seeing a large increase in hospitalizations or deaths. The Delta variant originated in India, a population that does not have a large percent of its population vaccinated and cases there have declined quite sharply in recent weeks. In the UK, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/vaccinated-among-delta-deaths-but-older-relatively-few-uk-data-2021-6\">hospitalizations and deaths remain far below</a> where they were the last time cases were this high. So there is a good chance this wave ends up not being as devastating - in human or economic terms - as previous waves that have caused serious pain.</p><p>Moreover, it is not clear where the constituency is for new mitigation measures to slow the spread of the virus. <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/fully-vaccinated-people-not-immune-to-covid-milder-2021-7\">Vaccinated people are still relatively safe</a> from <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/pfizer-vaccine-works-against-delta-covid-but-both-shots-needed-2021-7\">hospitalization and severe illness</a>, and unlikely to spread the virus in a material way. Unvaccinated people, by and large, do not want the mitigation measures in the first place. So despite saber rattling, political leaders might be reluctant to back off current reopening plans. The train has left the station.</p><p>Second, I do not think the Fed is going to abruptly shift policy and ease its support for the economy. New members of the Fed&#39;s interest rate setting committee are going to be even more unlikely to hike rates or taper off support in a serious way. The Fed has made it clear that they are willing to tolerate higher inflation to achieve its expansive goals on employment. </p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60fb33a628e2cf0018905554?format=jpeg\" alt=\"capex\" height=\"778\" width=\"977\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Neil Dutta</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Finally, I don&#39;t see much downside to the economy. Consumers remain flush with cash and the spending boom continues. Inventories remain low and companies are likely to order plenty of new goods to stock their shelves in the months ahead, supporting manufacturing production. Homebuilders are working through backlogs, particularly now as construction costs have moderated, supporting residential investment. Capital spending intentions remain strong. </p><p>What does all this mean?</p><p>If I am right, then we should expect a sharp reversal of these moves in September. Dovish Fed plus stronger economy plus waning COVID equals back to risk on. </p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/us-economy-will-be-fine-delta-covid-variant-case-surge-2021-7'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=mkEOEzF_Guk:DLw7ToEY32o:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=mkEOEzF_Guk:DLw7ToEY32o:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=mkEOEzF_Guk:DLw7ToEY32o:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=mkEOEzF_Guk:DLw7ToEY32o:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=mkEOEzF_Guk:DLw7ToEY32o:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=mkEOEzF_Guk:DLw7ToEY32o:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=mkEOEzF_Guk:DLw7ToEY32o:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=mkEOEzF_Guk:DLw7ToEY32o:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/mkEOEzF_Guk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 24 Jul 2021 12:04:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/60fa06b00729770012b971e4?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"4aa7a13ee7302f000b11c6017e9c84c5","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn10@2020_6/2021/07/25/10-54-07-023_7dc04d643a89b34e.webp","destWidth":2220,"destHeight":1665,"sourceBytes":269754,"destBytes":269754,"author":"insider@insider.com (Neil Dutta)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/60fa06b00729770012b971e4?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn10@2020_6/2021/07/25/10-54-07-023_7dc04d643a89b34e.webp","https://i.insider.com/60fb33a628e2cf0018905554?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn43@2020_5/2021/07/25/10-54-25-160_55ec97e55afe7e50.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn39@2020_3/2021/07/25/10-54-25-234_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=mkEOEzF_Guk:DLw7ToEY32o:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn71@2020_4/2021/07/25/10-54-24-628_85dc552dd88694f0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=mkEOEzF_Guk:DLw7ToEY32o:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn63@2020_2/2021/07/25/10-54-22-628_b5c33cc7031ea1f1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn95@2020_6/2021/07/25/10-54-23-641_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=mkEOEzF_Guk:DLw7ToEY32o:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn3@2020_2/2021/07/25/10-54-25-823_0627b67d3d22214f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/mkEOEzF_Guk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn91@2020_3/2021/07/25/10-54-24-404_cf1b4a0807c348b3.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1627210446769},{"createdTime":"2021-07-25 18:54:06","updatedTime":"2021-07-25 18:54:06","title":"Robinhood promises to fix 'the issues' that outraged customers when it restricted trading in meme stocks","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/robinhood-promises-earn-back-customers-trust-meme-stocks-outrage-2021-7","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60fc7d0828e2cf0018905d54?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Robinhood logo stocks investing\" height=\"3301\" width=\"4401\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev acknowledged the company angered many customers after it blocked them from trading GameStop and other red-hot stocks.</li>\n<li>On Saturday, Tenev promised to learn from past mistakes and &#34;ensure they never happen again.&#34;</li>\n<li>Saturday&#39;s roadshow event comes just days ahead of the commission-free trading app&#39;s hotly anticipated IPO. </li>\n<li id=\"recirc\"><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">See more stories on Insider&#39;s business page</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>Robinhood <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/map-reveals-robinhood-twitter-wallstreetbets-users-furious-gamestop-gme-amc-2021-1\">knows it angered many retail investors</a> earlier this year when the trading app halted buying of GameStop, AMC, and other meme stocks amid an epic rally -

but humans aren&#39;t automated robots, Edmans told Insider in an interview. Their mood impacts their decision making, and this extends too to their investment decisions that ultimately impact markets. </p><p>The base assumption for Edmans&#39; research is that people&#39;s happiness levels are often reflected in what songs they listen to and therefore music choices and market developments can be linked to one another. </p><p>&#34;In weeks in which the citizens of a country are listening to more happy music, the market goes up and in weeks in which they are listening to unhappy music the market goes down. So the music you&#39;re listening to is linked to stock returns,&#34; he explained to Insider in an interview. </p><p>The research is based on data from Spotify, one of the biggest music streaming platforms. It tracks what songs are being played in different countries, as well as assigning them a positivity or negativity score. The researchers used this as one metric to measure the mood of populations before linking it to market events.</p><p>And it is not just stock market returns that can be correlated with music choices. Volatility for example is also mirrored in music - the more people play extremely positive or extremely negative songs, the more market volatility rises, Edmans&#39; research found. </p><p>When it comes to net equity fund flows, more positive music choices can be associated with higher inflows. And looking at government bonds, an increase in negative, or sad songs, being played can be correlated with investors buying into bonds. This is in line with the idea of investors moving into safer assets during periods of low market expectations, he said.</p><p>The research could have real-life implications for investors as it provides evidence for a link between someone&#39;s mood and their investment choices, Edmans said. </p><p>&#34;By showing that emotions actually drive stock returns, that&#39;s just highlighting the importance of traders just being very aware and careful of their emotions and not to trade, perhaps, when they&#39;re in an extremely good mood or an extremely bad mood,&#34; he said. </p><p>&#34;One thing that a lot of other research actually suggests is that when people trade, the average trade loses money. [... ] And what we&#39;re suggesting in this paper is one of the reasons might be that these trades are driven by emotions rather than fundamentals.&#34;</p><p>This does not just apply to professional investors - retail crypto traders for example are just as driven by emotions, Edmans believes. And this can make their investments riskier and losses more likely, he said.  </p><p>Whether you are a professional or retail investor, caution around emotion is therefore key, he said. </p><p>&#34;What we&#39;re saying is just hold your horses sometimes before making a trading decision and to make sure that what really is driving it is analysis rather than emotion,&#34; Edmans said.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-returns-investor-emotions-music-choices-2021-7'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=yGKL1fTvklg:Fi1EddHGKNg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=yGKL1fTvklg:Fi1EddHGKNg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=yGKL1fTvklg:Fi1EddHGKNg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=yGKL1fTvklg:Fi1EddHGKNg:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=yGKL1fTvklg:Fi1EddHGKNg:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=yGKL1fTvklg:Fi1EddHGKNg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=yGKL1fTvklg:Fi1EddHGKNg:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=yGKL1fTvklg:Fi1EddHGKNg:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/yGKL1fTvklg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 25 Jul 2021 09:00:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/60749bed3e3fe7001882a2e6?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"d2a72210e671adca396f0ad02e41cc53","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn57@2020_4/2021/07/25/10-54-21-694_08d4a8b6197cf99f.webp","destWidth":3541,"destHeight":2656,"sourceBytes":238198,"destBytes":238198,"author":"skiderlin@businessinsider.com (Sophie Kiderlin)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/60749bfa2cc1ef0018da1493?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn92@2020_1/2021/07/25/10-54-24-670_9416919b80aa03f3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn39@2020_3/2021/07/25/10-54-25-234_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=yGKL1fTvklg:Fi1EddHGKNg:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn7@2020_4/2021/07/25/10-54-23-073_aada391d7302525d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=yGKL1fTvklg:Fi1EddHGKNg:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn72@2020_1/2021/07/25/10-54-23-266_29d9b651e52c1da4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn95@2020_6/2021/07/25/10-54-23-641_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=yGKL1fTvklg:Fi1EddHGKNg:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn64@2020_1/2021/07/25/10-54-21-786_24df7612dd0bb920.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/yGKL1fTvklg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn99@2020_5/2021/07/25/10-54-22-672_e2b6cb090dbc6797.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1627210446770},{"createdTime":"2021-07-25 18:54:06","updatedTime":"2021-07-25 18:54:06","title":"See inside Victoria's Secret's revamped 'store of the future' as it ditches Angels to lure more women","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/see-inside-victorias-secrets-revamped-store-columbus-ohio-ditches-angels-2021-7","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60fac4f40729770012b97e23?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Victoria&#39;s Secret rebrand columbus ohio Mandy Shunnarah\" height=\"3012\" width=\"4016\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>&#34;I was thrilled to see more representative mannequins like these, but I was hoping for more,&#34;

summer</a>, the Delta variant of the coronavirus is trying to stop the fun.</p><p>The far more contagious variant currently accounts for 83% of all new sequenced COVID-19 cases in the US, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/delta-variant-new-covid-19-cases-cdc-director-2021-7\">the CDC announced on Monday</a>. That&#39;s up from 50% the week of July 3, and even higher in <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/delta-coronavirus-variant-hitting-republican-states-vaccine-divide-2021-7\">areas of the US with low vaccination rates</a>, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said. </p><p>She added that America is entering a &#34;pandemic of the unvaccinated&#34;</p><p>It&#39;s increased the odds of Covid &#34;breakthrough&#34; infections among vaccinated people, a growing minority of which - from the New York <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/all-3-yankees-who-tested-positive-for-covid-19-vaccinated-2021-7\">Yankees</a> to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/covid-vaccine-breakthrough-infection-delta-variant-fully-vaccinated-las-vegas-2021-7\">Vegas partygoers</a> - have caught Covid. The good news is that the vaccinated <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/fully-vaccinated-people-not-immune-to-covid-milder-2021-7https://www.businessinsider.com/fully-vaccinated-people-not-immune-to-covid-milder-2021-7\">remain well protected</a> from serious disease, likely to have mild or no symptoms, and carrying with them a low transmission risk. </p><p>But Biden officials and the CDC are reportedly <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-administration-considers-stricter-mask-guidance-as-delta-variant-spreads-2021-7\">considering stricter mask-wearing guidance</a> to protect unvaccinated people as Delta cases spike. Dr. Anthony Fauci has even said that fully vaccinated Americans <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/delta-variant-vaccine-fully-vaccinated-face-mask-fauci-indoor-cdc-2021-7\">may &#34;want to consider&#34;</a> wearing masks indoors again.</p><p>It doesn&#39;t help that <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/everyone-has-a-cold-now-masks-off-old-viruses-circulating-2021-7\">the common cold is running rampant</a> across the US as we return to socializing with others sans masks. Respiratory viruses, which mimic Covid-like symptoms, are giving many a Covid scare.</p><p>With only half the population vaccinated, all the germs on the loose were enough to put America on edge this week. </p><h2><strong>A threat to the economy</strong></h2><p>As fears over the Delta variant have risen, even Fox News began emphasizing vaccine awareness and the efficacy of vaccines. The network&#39;s vaccine coverage has often mirrored its overall pandemic framing of public health measures as culture wars, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-fox-news-changed-its-stance-on-vaccines-hannity-tucker-2021-7\">Insider&#39;s Jake Lahut reported</a>.</p><p>While several hosts have previously touted the shots, Monday saw a significant leap in the network&#39;s vaccine promotion. Fox News hosts cranked up their vaccine messaging and programming featured banners of the federal government&#39;s vaccine domain page.</p><p>Markets freaked out on the same day, with the S&#38;P 500 closing down about 1.6% on the day. <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-news-today-dow-falls-delta-variant-covid-economy-2021-7\">Investors appeared to be spooked</a> about the rise in Delta variant cases across the country. That worry was fleeting, however, as stocks quickly rebounded over the next couple days, with the S&#38;P 500 closing higher on Thursday than it had the week before. Stocks <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-news-today-sp-500-nasdaq-close-records-earnings-2021-7\">even ended the week hitting record highs</a>.</p><div class=\"insider-raw-embed\"><iframe title=\"S&#38;P 500 500\" aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-bAKaZ\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/bAKaZ/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% ; border: none;\" height=\"450\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){&#34;use strict&#34;;window.addEventListener(&#34;message&#34;,(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[&#34;datawrapper-height&#34;]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(&#34;iframe&#34;);for(var a in e.data[&#34;datawrapper-height&#34;])for(var r=0;r&#60;t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[&#34;datawrapper-height&#34;][a]+&#34;px&#34;}}}))}();\n</script></div><p>Still, the presence of the Delta threat is real. The US <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-july-4-independence-from-virus-celebration-vaccination-goal-missed-2021-6\">missed President Joe Biden&#39;s goal</a> to have at least 70% of adults partially vaccinated by July 4. Currently, <a href=\"https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations\">68.6% of adults</a> are partially vaccinated and only 59% fully vaccinated. </p><p>That leaves millions unvaccinated, at risk of exposure to the variant. Left unchecked, it could slow down America&#39;s economic recovery. </p><p>A new round of shutdowns or unimpeded spread of the highly contagious Delta variant among the unvaccinated population could lead to businesses closing and more layoffs and furloughs like what was seen last spring. It could also make the American shopper <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/delta-variant-covid-economy-consumer-behavior-lockdown-bank-of-america-2021-7\">go back into lockdown</a>, Bank of America forecasted. And, while the CDC has urged schools to fully reopen, there&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.khon2.com/local-news/rise-in-coronavirus-cases-ahead-of-new-school-year-leaves-uncertainty-about-return-to-campus/\">still uncertainty around returning</a> as coronavirus cases rise again. </p><p>But this hasn&#39;t happened yet, and most of the economic data from the last several weeks still suggests a robust recovery. The <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/june-jobs-report-850000-payrolls-unemployment-rate-labor-market-shortage-2021-7\">US added 850,000 jobs in June</a>, getting the labor market steadily closer to recovering the jobs lost in spring 2020. The <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/leisure-hospitality-june-jobs-report-wages-increased-labor-force-2021-7\">leisure and hospitality sector</a> in particular, which includes restaurants, bars, and hotels that were hit especially hard last spring, saw rapid job growth and big wage gains for workers.</p><p>Economists expect <a href=\"https://www.investing.com/economic-calendar/gdp-375?utm_source=WMT_EC&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=COMaign=COM\">next week&#39;s gross domestic product</a> figures to show the US economy expanding at the fastest pace since the early 1980s, with the exception of a spike last fall coming off the historically low levels of activity last spring.</p><p>Still, the Delta virus is <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/06/17/delta-variant-global-concern/\">adding a speed bump</a> in America&#39;s path to a post-pandemic world. While we may be progressing toward normalcy, life still won&#39;t be completely normal by fall. The economy is still under threat.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/delta-covid-variant-cases-threatening-economy-markets-reopening-lockdown-02021-7'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=vxE-aQiDWt0:s6_3d76556A:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=vxE-aQiDWt0:s6_3d76556A:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=vxE-aQiDWt0:s6_3d76556A:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=vxE-aQiDWt0:s6_3d76556A:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=vxE-aQiDWt0:s6_3d76556A:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=vxE-aQiDWt0:s6_3d76556A:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=vxE-aQiDWt0:s6_3d76556A:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=vxE-aQiDWt0:s6_3d76556A:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/vxE-aQiDWt0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 24 Jul 2021 12:50:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/60fb139f0729770012b9ab9f?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"80f6fad252beb7398f731c84166f4bdb","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn22@2020_2/2021/07/25/10-54-07-025_2169e5bad8e4ef61.webp","destWidth":2133,"destHeight":1600,"sourceBytes":98072,"destBytes":98072,"author":"hhoffower@businessinsider.com (Hillary Hoffower,Andy Kiersz)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/60fb139f0729770012b9ab9f?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn22@2020_2/2021/07/25/10-54-07-025_2169e5bad8e4ef61.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn39@2020_3/2021/07/25/10-54-25-234_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=vxE-aQiDWt0:s6_3d76556A:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn80@2020_1/2021/07/25/10-54-25-684_e0a539d8eeb5212f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=vxE-aQiDWt0:s6_3d76556A:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn20@2020_2/2021/07/25/10-54-22-323_c7914dbc3b0d8024.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn95@2020_6/2021/07/25/10-54-23-641_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=vxE-aQiDWt0:s6_3d76556A:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn76@2020_3/2021/07/25/10-54-24-642_5787a34bb6932f30.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/vxE-aQiDWt0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn80@2020_5/2021/07/25/10-54-22-826_2126f398282af45b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1627210446772},{"createdTime":"2021-07-25 18:54:06","updatedTime":"2021-07-25 18:54:06","title":"The GOP governor of Arkansas, where vaccines are lagging and COVID-19 is surging, said it's 'disappointing' vaccines are 'political'","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/gop-arkansas-governor-asa-hutchinson-disappointing-vaccines-political-2021-7","description":"<figure> \n <img src=\"https://i.insider.com/60fcc28717cf960019ee05ad?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Asa Hutchinson\" height=\"3478\" width=\"4638\" charset=\"\"> \n  <figcaption>\n   Arkansas Gov.
