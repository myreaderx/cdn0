And that’s definitely true online, where often we choose a single picture to represent our digital identities. On Google, a single image acts as a reflection of you across a variety of products, like when you send an email, write a comment on a document  or share your location with your family on Maps. </p><p>Of course, people have different preferences of how they want to be represented digitally. Some prefer a photo of themselves, others might select a pet, and there are those who choose an object that might show a hobby or causes they support. But for some people, there isn’t an option that’s a good fit for them. Access to technology, social context or privacy concerns might prevent them from using an actual photo as a profile picture.</p><p>To give everyone more safe, creative and personalized options for profile pictures, we are introducing new Google Illustrations. Google Illustrations are a collection of customizable images that anyone can use to design the image of their choice to represent them across most Google products.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"h-c-page\"><div class=\" article-image h-c-grid__col--10 h-c-grid__col--offset-1 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-l--8 \"><img alt=\"Collection of illustrations you can select from: historical places, animals, food or hobbies.\" class=\"article-image--full\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Selection_variety.mp4_1.gif\" tabindex=\"0\"/></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h2>Inclusive and versatile</h2><p>We all have different tastes and preferences.
