Source: Ramon Martinez Click to enlarge</p></div>\n<p>This figure is best seen in <a href=\"http://public.tableausoftware.com/shared/F2P42M45N?:display_count=yes\">Tableau Public</a> so that you can get information by hovering your mouse over a bar. In Figure 2, Ramon made more room for the graphs by distinguishing homeowners and renters by color, thus freeing up a column. Separating the total expenditures from the specific expenditures also made more room for the specific ones. As is often the case with graphs, just because you can doesn’t mean you should. I find the colors in the % change panel to be distracting. The length and direction of the bars provide the necessary information. I’ve seen many examples in Tableau where the ability to color by value is extremely useful but this is not one of them. The additional space for the bars in Figure 2 facilitates comparisons.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 05 Feb 2013 13:56:48 +0000","feedId":46447,"bgimg":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/naomirobbins/files/2013/02/RM-300x300.png","linkMd5":"a613ee25da4c196775bfa77416ba92ce","author":"Naomi Robbins","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/naomirobbins/files/2013/02/RM-300x300.png":null,"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/naomirobbins/files/2013/02/RM2-252x300.jpg":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602571942272}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-10-13 14:52:22","updatedTime":"2020-10-13 14:52:22","feedId":46447,"fetchDate":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 06:52:22 +0000","fetchMs":60,"handleMs":6,"totalMs":242184,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"af32bc2b950854f7e62e0df470d818c9","hostName":"us-009*","requestId":"16635c5439444d9eb92852c39db9e05b_46447","contentType":"application/rss+xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":0,"bgimgsTotal":1,"bgimgsGithubTotal":0,"articlesImgsTotal":2,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":0,"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 03:41:50","updatedTime":"2020-09-07 06:04:20","id":46447,"name":"Effective Graphs","url":"http://blogs.forbes.com/naomirobbins/feed/","subscriber":69,"website":null,"icon":"https://blogs.forbes.com/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx63/cdn61@2020_4/2020/09/06/21-59-59-205_df10b0c8fbc25b62.ico","description":"[Please go to 'Settings' to change your Tagline]","weekly":null,"link":null},"noPictureArticleList":[{"createdTime":"2020-10-13 14:56:24","updatedTime":"2020-10-13 14:56:24","id":null,"feedId":46447,"linkMd5":"a613ee25da4c196775bfa77416ba92ce"}],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1602571942205,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":61,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":6,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":120282,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"},{"spend":121769,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"}]},"extra5":2,"extra6":0,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{"http://us-006.herokuapp.com/":{"failCount":1,"successCount":0,"resultList":[null]},"http://us-020.herokuapp.com/":{"failCount":1,"successCount":0,"resultList":[null]},"http://europe-22.herokuapp.com/":{"failCount":1,"successCount":0,"resultList":[null]},"http://europe-60.herokuapp.com/":{"failCount":1,"successCount":0,"resultList":[null]}},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[],"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}}
