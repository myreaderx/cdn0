Features like <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/search/know-you-go-google/\">popular times</a>, <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/maps/take-control-your-commute-google-maps/\">multimodal navigation</a>, and <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/maps/navigate-and-search-real-world-online/\">offline maps</a> help you better understand your world so you can decide how to interact with it.</p>\n  <p>This week, we‚Äôre rolling out new visual improvements that bring even more detail and granularity to the map, making it easier to understand what an area looks like whether you‚Äôre exploring virtually or planning a visit.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <h3>A more colorful and accurate view of the world&nbsp;üåé</h3>\n  <p>Google Maps has high-definition satellite imagery for over 98 percent of the world‚Äôs population. With a new color-mapping algorithmic technique, we‚Äôre able to take this imagery and translate it into an even more comprehensive, vibrant map of an area at global scale. Exploring a place gives you a look at its natural features‚Äîso you can easily distinguish tan, arid beaches and deserts from blue lakes, rivers, oceans and ravines. You can know at a glance how lush and green a place is with vegetation, and even see if there are snow caps on the peaks of mountaintops.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>With this update, Google Maps has one of the most comprehensive views of natural features on any major map app‚Äîwith availability in all 220 countries and territories that Google Maps supports. That‚Äôs coverage for over 100M square kilometers of land, or 18 billion football fields!</p>\n  <p>This update is visible no matter what area you‚Äôre looking at‚Äîfrom the biggest metropolitan areas to small, rural towns.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <h3>Mapping the rainbow üåà</h3>\n  <p>How exactly does this color-mapping technique work? First, we use computer vision to identify natural features from our satellite imagery, looking specifically at arid, icy, forested, and mountainous regions. We then analyze these features and assign them a range of colors on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV\">HSV color model</a>. For example, a densely covered forest can be classified as dark green, while an area of patchy shrubs could appear as a lighter shade of green.&nbsp;</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_carousel\">\n <div class=\"h-c-page article-module\">\n  <div class=\"article-module glue-pagination h-c-carousel h-c-carousel--simple h-c-carousel--dark ng-cloak\" data-glue-pagination-config=\"{cyclical: true}\">\n   <div class=\"h-c-carousel__wrap\">\n    <ul class=\"glue-carousel ng-cloak\" data-glue-carousel-options=\"{pointerTypes: ['touch', 'mouse'], jump: true}\">\n     <li class=\"h-c-carousel__item article-carousel__slide\">\n      <figure>\n       <div class=\"article-carousel__slide-img\" style=\"background-image: url(https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Iceland_Resize.max-2000x2000.jpg);\">\n        <span class=\"h-u-visually-hidden\">iceland_resized</span>\n       </div>\n       <figcaption class=\"article-carousel__caption h-c-copy h-u-mt-std\">\n        <div class=\"rich-text\">\n         <p>Iceland‚Äôs rich landscape is now much easier to visualize.

Business Messages provides brands a comprehensive messaging solution across Android devices, and through Maps on iOS. To improve connections with customers, we‚Äôve recently introduced new smart replies, visual product carousels, and unique welcome messages. There‚Äôs also a smooth transition from automated replies to a customer service agent, so that it's not disruptive when the customer messages a business.</p>\n  <p>Several organizations, including Woolworths, Walmart and MyGov were among the first to try the updated Business Messages experience to make customer care more effective and efficient, particularly during COVID-19. Woolworths, Australia's largest supermarket, allows customers to search for products and see availability and aisle information at their local store, plus get details about hours and COVID-19 related updates to make shopping easier. In just a few messages, Walmart lets customers quickly find up-to-date information about store hours, pick-up and delivery options, precautions and more. And MyGov, with partner Amplify.ai, is providing help and answering live questions from Indian citizens about hours, COVID-19 helplines, and ways to volunteer and donate, for more than 11,000 food and night shelters across India. <br /></p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_carousel\">\n <div class=\"h-c-page article-module\">\n  <div class=\"article-module glue-pagination h-c-carousel

I quickly landed on <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Weald+Country+Park/@51.6253265,0.2608318,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x466d8c86a72be4df!8m2!3d51.6253265!4d0.2608318\">Weald Country Park</a>, which boasts a 4.5-star rating, almost a thousand reviews and a promising description: ‚ÄúFallow deer, a visitor center &amp; hiking.‚Äù</p>\n    </div>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph_with_image\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid uni-paragraph-wrap\">\n   <div class=\"uni-paragraph h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3\" data-component=\"uni-article-paragraph\">\n    <figure class=\"article-image--wrap-small \">\n     <img alt=\"Screenshot of reviews of Weald Country Park.png\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Screenshot_20200728-145432.max-1000x1000.png\" />\n     <figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \">\n      <div class=\"rich-text\">\n       <p><br /></p>\n      </div>\n     </figcaption>\n    </figure>\n    <div class=\"rich-text\">\n     <h3>Read the reviews</h3>\n     <p>Deer-watching had the potential to keep toddlers occupied for at least one minute.

But to double-check these critical questions, I relied on the kindness of strangers who had posted recent reviews and ratings. Local Guides and other people who contribute to Google Maps are very helpful in offering information about how much they liked (or didn‚Äôt like) their trip, and many of them have the same topics on their mind that I do. Since you can sort reviews by date, it was easy to see the most relevant ones‚Äîi.e., those that have been filed since lockdown lifted‚Äîfor current info on toilets (yes), parking (yes, but it‚Äôs expensive), and whether the playgrounds have reopened (yes, very recently).&nbsp;</p>\n    </div>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph_with_image\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid uni-paragraph-wrap\">\n   <div class=\"uni-paragraph h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3\" data-component=\"uni-article-paragraph\">\n    <figure class=\"article-image--wrap-small \">\n     <img alt=\"screenshot of photos from Weald Country Park.png\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Screenshot_20200728-145528.max-1000x1000.png\" />\n     <figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \">\n      <div class=\"rich-text\">\n       <p><br /></p>\n      </div>\n     </figcaption>\n    </figure>\n    <div class=\"rich-text\">\n     <h3>Browse the photos and Street View</h3>\n     <p>To really get a feel for a place, sometimes there‚Äôs no replacement for a photo.

It was exciting to see many of the Local Guides we invited in our initial pilot opt in and participate. Equally exciting was the interest we saw from many Google Maps users who began following top Local Guides to receive helpful recommendations about the places around them.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>Today we‚Äôre expanding this feature and beginning to roll it out globally. If a Google Maps user has shared photos, reviews or lists publicly, you can now follow them and get their recommendations, advice and updates delivered to your Updates tab in Google Maps. So the next time you find someone sharing helpful photos of takeout menus, handy lists of your city's most spacious parks or inspiring photos of local shops and services, you can keep up-to-date on all of their recommendations.&nbsp;</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <figure class=\"article-image--medium h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--4 h-c-grid__col--offset-4 \">\n    <img alt=\"Google Maps public profile\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Google_Maps_public_profile_UI.max-1000x1000.png\" />\n    <figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \">\n     <div class=\"rich-text\">\n      <p>Topic filters add color and flavor to your Google Maps profile</p>\n     </div>\n    </figcaption>\n   </figure>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>There will also be new topic filters on Google Maps profiles, so you can see the topics and places people share about the most, like pizza, brunch, camping and parks.

That‚Äôs why we‚Äôve built in settings so you can easily manage and personalize your Google Maps profile. As always, everyone has the option to show (or not show) their reviews, photos and posts on their public Maps profile. To become followable in Google Maps, an eligible user can go to their profile and follow a simple process. And users who are followable on Google Maps can make their profile restricted. With a restricted profile, you approve new followers before they can see contributions on your profile.&nbsp;</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>Want to share your personality on your Google Maps profile?

Lots have messaged me to say it‚Äôs made them feel like they‚Äôve been outside. They‚Äôve really learned something new and taken their minds off the situation for twenty minutes or so.</p>\n  <p><b>Any advantages to using Street View compared to being there in person?</b></p>\n  <p>The great thing about Street View is that you can hop about‚Äîyou can jump a mile down the road and people don‚Äôt have to get on a bus or actually walk, so you can cover a lot of ground.</p>\n  <p>And then there‚Äôs that feature to go back in time and see things how they appeared years ago, back to 2008. On a normal tour, you can show pictures and give people an idea, but if people are on Street View and feel like they‚Äôre standing in a space and seeing the changes right there, it‚Äôs a different experience.</p>\n  <p>One example, on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=252299472479782\">my Aldgate tour</a>, is a garden space that has been relandscaped. The garden looks beautiful now, but three years ago you could see the cobbles of Victorian London. And those cobbles happen to have been the site of the murder of Catherine Eddowes, who was a victim of Jack the Ripper. That was an evocative thing to be able to show.</p>\n  <p><b>Any advice for other small business owners who are trying to figure out how to adapt right now?</b></p>\n  <p>I think you have to do the thing that you enjoy doing. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be able to do these three times a week if I didn‚Äôt enjoy them. If you have something that you want to share, there‚Äôs no reason you shouldn‚Äôt do that. Technology has made everything so accessible, and if you care about something, chances are others care about that as well.</p>\n </div>\n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 24 Apr 2020 09:00:00 +0000","feedId":9466,"bgimg":"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Beavers_on_Oxford_Street.max-1000x1000.jpg","linkMd5":"a69271097f463ce40e8ce86d6b380933","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn61@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-25-43-573_ed50bc57b6901687.webp","destWidth":755,"destHeight":1000,"sourceBytes":71210,"destBytes":36906,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Beavers_on_Oxford_Street.max-1000x1000.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn61@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-25-43-573_ed50bc57b6901687.webp","https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Photo_27-03-2020_17_47_30.max-1000x1000.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn16@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-27-47-740_1b5ee4d5d5271d13.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/SbSV?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn59@2020_6/2020/08/25/00-25-43-454_4bbeb52263385580.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/SbSV?i=SS4xtGzpp8Y:pqj-wl-m-_c:-BTjWOF_DHI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn95@2020_3/2020/08/25/00-27-48-314_01aedf16aeca9dfa.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/SbSV/~4/SS4xtGzpp8Y":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn67@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-27-47-369_0c24feb22aa5d6e1.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598315143273},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:25:43","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:25:43","title":"6 ways you can support local businesses with Google Maps","link":"https://blog.google/products/maps/support-small-business-with-google-maps/","description":"<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p><i>Editor‚Äôs Note:&nbsp;Small businesses are crucial to our communities.

Whether people are hitting the road to get their heart pumping or commute safely during COVID-19, we‚Äôre making it easier for cyclists everywhere to get on their own bike or a shared one.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>&nbsp;Ten years ago, we <a href=\"https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/03/biking-directions-added-to-google-maps.html\">introduced</a> biking directions in Google Maps. Now it‚Äôs available in nearly 30 countries around the world and millions of people use it every day. As biking habits change, especially as things evolve with COVID-19, we‚Äôre constantly updating this information to help you uncover the most reliable bike route.</p>\n  <p><br /></p>\n  <h3>Raise the (handle)bar on biking routes&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>\n  <p>To give you the most up-to-date bike route, we use a combination of machine learning, complex algorithms and our understanding of real-world conditions based on imagery and data from government authorities and community contributions. We also consider various forms of bike lanes and nearby streets that might be less friendly for your two wheels (like tunnels, stairs and poor surface conditions) so you can have the best and smoothest biking route. You can also see how flat or steep your route will be, so you‚Äôll know if you‚Äôre in for an easy breezy ride or one that will really get the heart pumping.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>However, the best route can always change and we are hard at work to reflect new information. For instance, due to COVID-19, many cities are adding and widening bike lanes to encourage cycling and accommodate more riders. We‚Äôre already working to integrate hundreds of thousands of new bike lanes in the coming months. Local government agencies can provide this data through our <a href=\"https://support.google.com/mapcontentpartners/answer/9359574?hl=en\">Geo Data Upload tool</a> to have their latest bike lane information reflected in Google Maps.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p><br /></p>\n  <h3>Gear up for new docked bikeshare directions in 10 cities</h3>\n  <p>As more people choose to cycle, they‚Äôre buying new bikes, fixing up old ones and turning to bike sharing options. In fact, worldwide search interest for ‚Äúbike repair near me‚Äù hit an all-time high this month‚Äîmore than double what it was last year.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>For riders opting to use bike sharing, we‚Äôre rolling out more detailed information. Over the last several years, we‚Äôve <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/maps/travel-last-mile-google-maps-and-lime/\">launched</a> a dockless bike and scooter integration with Lime in more than 100 cities and <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/maps/real-time-bikeshare-information-google-map/\">introduced</a> real-time docked bikeshare information to help travellers in select cities locate bike sharing stations and real-time availability. With bikeshare providers seeing sharp increases in usage during COVID-19, it‚Äôs even more important to quickly and easily check how many bikes are available at the station you‚Äôre headed toward and if there are docks available to drop off your bike near your destination.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>Starting today, when you look up biking directions, you‚Äôll see end-to-end directions that include docked bikeshare information. Steps will include detailed walking directions to bikeshare stations near your starting point along with live bike availability, turn-by-turn cycling directions to the bikeshare station closest to your destination with live dock availability, and, finally, walking directions from there to your final destination. And, for some cities, Maps will show you links to open the relevant bikeshare app to book and unlock the bike.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \">\n    <img alt=\"docked-bike-full.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/docked-bike-full.gif\" />\n    <figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \">\n     <div class=\"rich-text\">\n      <p>New docked bikeshare directions coming to 10 cities.</p>\n     </div>\n    </figcaption>\n   </figure>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>Rolling out over the coming weeks, you‚Äôll find docked bikeshare directions in these 10 cities, thanks to our partnership with <a href=\"https://www.itoworld.com/\">Ito World</a>and bikeshare partners around the world.

needs, from the treatment of chronic conditions to mental health services to evaluating cough and cold symptoms. Yet, people need a way to continue getting medical care from the comfort and safety of their own homes. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we‚Äôve seen interest in virtual care and telehealth <a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=telehealth\">rise dramatically</a>. Health consultations over the phone or by video conference not only help alleviate strain on doctors‚Äô offices and emergency rooms but are also recommended as an important way to <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/preparedness-resources.html\">protect patients and staff</a> against COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>To help individuals and health care providers connect, we‚Äôre focused on providing individuals with access to high-quality and <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/search/connecting-people-covid-19-information-and-resources/\">authoritative information</a> and supporting them throughout their health journey. Over the coming week, we‚Äôre beginning to roll out two new features in Search and Maps that make it easier for people to connect to virtual healthcare options, whether it‚Äôs to a doctor‚Äôs office down the street, the hospital across town, or a national telehealth platform.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <h3>Local healthcare providers, now virtual</h3>\n  <p>Healthcare providers like hospitals, doctors, and mental health professionals can now enter a virtual care offering in their Business Profile, so that people searching for their local provider, for instance, might see a ‚Äúget online care‚Äù link on Search and Maps. Clicking this link will take people to that provider‚Äôs virtual care website where they can find more information, and in many cases, schedule a virtual healthcare visit with a provider.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>The pandemic has affected many healthcare providers‚Äô operating hours and walk-in visit policies.

Transit alerts are rolling out in Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Colombia, France, India, Mexico, Netherlands, Spain, Thailand, United Kingdom and the U.S. where we have information from local transit agencies, with more coming soon.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>We‚Äôre also introducing driving alerts to notify you about COVID-19 checkpoints and restrictions along your route, like when crossing national borders (starting first in Canada, Mexico and the U.S.). You‚Äôll see an alert on the directions screen and after starting navigation if your route is impacted by these restrictions.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>When navigating to medical facilities or COVID-19 testing centers, we‚Äôll display an alert reminding you to verify eligibility and facility guidelines to avoid being turned away or causing additional strain on the local healthcare system. Starting this week, alerts for medical facilities will be available in Indonesia, Israel, the Philippines, South Korea, and the U.S., and testing center alerts will be available in the U.S.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_carousel\">\n <div class=\"h-c-page article-module\">\n  <div class=\"article-module glue-pagination h-c-carousel h-c-carousel--simple h-c-carousel--dark ng-cloak\" data-glue-pagination-config=\"{cyclical: true}\">\n   <div class=\"h-c-carousel__wrap\">\n    <ul class=\"glue-carousel ng-cloak\" data-glue-carousel-options=\"{pointerTypes: ['touch', 'mouse'], jump: true}\">\n     <li class=\"h-c-carousel__item article-carousel__slide\">\n      <figure>\n       <div class=\"article-carousel__slide-img\" style=\"background-image: url(https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Blog_1.max-2000x2000.jpg);\">\n        <span class=\"h-u-visually-hidden\">Commute_Covid19.jpg</span>\n       </div>\n       <figcaption class=\"article-carousel__caption h-c-copy h-u-mt-std\">\n        <div class=\"rich-text\">\n         <p>&nbsp;New transit alerts show you when your trip is likely to be affected by COVID-19 restrictions</p>\n        </div>\n       </figcaption>\n      </figure></li>\n     <li class=\"h-c-carousel__item article-carousel__slide\">\n      <figure>\n       <div class=\"article-carousel__slide-img\" style=\"background-image: url(https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Blog_2.max-2000x2000.jpg);\">\n        <span class=\"h-u-visually-hidden\">Traffic_Covid19.jpg</span>\n       </div>\n       <figcaption class=\"article-carousel__caption h-c-copy h-u-mt-std\">\n        <div class=\"rich-text\">\n         <p>See if there are COVID-19 border restrictions along your route.</p>\n        </div>\n       </figcaption>\n      </figure></li>\n     <li class=\"h-c-carousel__item article-carousel__slide\">\n      <figure>\n       <div class=\"article-carousel__slide-img\" style=\"background-image: url(https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Blog_3.max-2000x2000.jpg);\">\n        <span class=\"h-u-visually-hidden\">Testing Center_Covid19.jpg</span>\n       </div>\n       <figcaption class=\"article-carousel__caption h-c-copy h-u-mt-std\">\n        <div class=\"rich-text\">\n         <p>Heading to a medical facility or a COVID-19 testing center?
