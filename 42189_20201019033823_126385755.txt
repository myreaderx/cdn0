On <strong>Tuesday, 3rd of November</strong> (and days and weeks before with lots of letters), U.S. citizens will decide on all House seats, 35 Senate seats, and if they want to call the Republican Donald Trump or the Democrat Joe Biden their next president.</p> \n<p>It’s an important election. We expect you might want to cover at least the Presidential part of it –&nbsp;and that’s what we’ll focus on in this blog post&nbsp;–, even if you’re not from the U.S., and even if you don’t have the team or the capacity to create a big election dashboard.</p> \n<p>Here are some ideas on which data to cover and how to do so.</p> \n<p>A word ahead: We won’t offer any live-updating charts <strong>on election night</strong>. However, the friendly people from <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">FiveThirtyEight</a> put their <a href=\"https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/election-forecasts-2020\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>election forecasts</strong></a> on Github. We used them in some of the following charts, maps, and tables. They will update once a day. <strong>Feel free to re-use all of the following visualizations</strong>, no matter if they come with live-updating FiveThirtyEight data or test data: Hover over the visualization of your choice, click on “Edit this chart”, change the data if necessary, and then publish &amp; embed it.</p> \n<h2 id=\"Which-states-are-undecided\">Which states are undecided</h2> \n<p>While most people in many states have been voting either Democrat or Republican for years –&nbsp;and polls show that they plan to do the same this year –, “swing” or “battleground” states will decide the election. Most newsrooms focus on them and how little we know (so far) about who will win in these states. To do the same, you can show a map like the following:</p> \n<div class=\"wide\"> \n <img src=\"https://img.datawrapper.de/INKNy/full.png\" /> \n</div> \n<details> \n <summary>Tips for creating this symbol map in Datawrapper</summary> \n <p>When creating the symbol map above, the challenge is to <strong>place symbols in the middle of each state</strong>. To do so, you’ll need the longitudes and latitudes of these center points. You can get them from <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T7M19yn3FIncyhweKvogltB7p3KutsxwOBVB1t7Q2KU/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this Google Sheet</a> we prepared for you.</p> \n <p>If you hover over the map, you’ll see <strong>bar charts in the tooltips</strong>. To create them, you’ll need to style many <code>div</code>s: Each bar section is a <code>div</code> with a width that’s decided by data columns. You can learn the basics in <a href=\"https://academy.datawrapper.de/article/282-how-to-embed-charts-into-tooltips\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this Academy article</a>. To copy and paste the HTML code for the tooltip, click on “Edit this chart” and get it in the <strong>“Customize tooltip”</strong> section in the Annotate tab. Tip: Edit the tooltip in an HTML editor like Atom or Sublime before pasting it back into Datawrapper.</p> \n</details> \n<p>Here we decided to use a symbol map instead of a choropleth map. After all, electoral votes will decide the election, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/how-election-maps-lie/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">not land area</a>. When mapping election polls or results on a state level, consider using <strong>symbols on top of the state’s boundaries</strong> as we did. The symbols sizes represent the number of electors for this state.</p> \n<p>In addition to a map, consider showing a table with detailed information. A table has the advantage to be sortable. Here we sorted it by the difference in the estimated votes for Trump and Biden, to show the swing states first:</p> \n<img src=\"https://img.datawrapper.de/PZomv/full.png\"> \n <details> \n  <summary>Tips for creating this table in Datawrapper</summary> \n  <p>To create the “last eleven elections” column, use our <strong>“Show selected columns as tiny charts”</strong> feature.</p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://academy.datawrapper.de/article/191-how-to-format-your-text-with-markdown\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Markdown</strong></a> comes in handy to make the forecasted vote share bigger than the margin of error below. Your data needs to be in a format like <code>52.7% ^49%-57%^</code> for that.</p> \n  <p>And you can use the “Color cells based on categories” option to <strong>color the votes columns</strong> by a hidden column that categorizes the winning chances.</p> \n  <p>The last column is then a simple bar chart that you can create with a click on the <strong>“Show as bar chart”</strong> button.</p> \n </details><h2 id=\"Electoral-votes\">Electoral votes</h2><p>The U.S. Presidential election will be decided with electoral votes. So many newsrooms show a version of the following line chart:</p><img src=\"https://img.datawrapper.de/mtpfI/full.png\"> \n  <details> \n   <summary>Tips for creating this line chart in Datawrapper</summary> \n   <p>To create the confidence intervals in Datawrapper line charts, use our <strong>“Fill area between lines”</strong> option. Then set the line width of the upper and lower range to zero.</p> \n   <p>To make the names of Trump and Biden <strong>bold</strong>, write HTML tags in the column headers, like so: <code>... for &lt;b&gt;Trump&lt;/b&gt;</code>.</p> \n  </details><p>You can give your readers a concise idea of how many electoral votes (are estimated to) go to which candidate with a stacked bar chart. You will find it in many election dashboards at the very top:</p><img src=\"https://img.datawrapper.de/XIOrj/full.png\"> \n   <details> \n    <summary>How to highlight the 270 votes (more) in this stacked bar chart</summary> \n    <p>In the chart above, we highlighted the 270 votes a candidate must reach to win the election with first turning on grid lines and then setting a <strong>custom axis tick</strong> at 270.</p> \n    <p>But there’s another way. Here’s the same chart, but it highlights the 270 votes even more:</p> \n    <img src=\"https://img.datawrapper.de/kb89a/full.png\"><p>To add the line and the “270 votes are needed to win the election”, you’ll need to write and style both in the <strong>Notes</strong> textfield, like so:</p> \n     <figure class=\"highlight html\"> \n      <table> \n       <tbody> \n        <tr> \n         <td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"tag\">&lt;<span class=\"name\">b</span> <span class=\"attr\">style</span>=<span class=\"string\">\"text-align:center; display:block; font-style:normal; margin-left:-1%; margin-top:-50px; font-size:15px;\"</span>&gt;</span>⎹<span class=\"tag\">&lt;<span class=\"name\">br</span>&gt;</span>⎹<span class=\"tag\">&lt;<span class=\"name\">br</span>&gt;</span>270 votes are needed<span class=\"tag\">&lt;<span class=\"name\">br</span>&gt;</span>to win the election<span class=\"tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"name\">b</span>&gt;</span><span class=\"tag\">&lt;<span class=\"name\">br</span>&gt;</span><span class=\"tag\">&lt;<span class=\"name\">br</span>&gt;</span>Electoral votes as forecasted by FiveThirtyEight. Darker colors mean more likely votes. Grey votes are from uncertain states. 270 electoral votes are needed to win the election.</span><br /></pre></td> \n        </tr> \n       </tbody> \n      </table> \n     </figure><p>The line is is a unicode character⎹ that you can move over the bars with <code>margin-top:-50px</code>. Set the text below the line and then place both in the middle of the chart with <code>text-align:center</code>.</p></img> \n   </details><p>You can also split up the bars to show a plainer comparison that also works well for small screens:</p><img src=\"https://img.datawrapper.de/oUBOX/full.png\"> \n    <details> \n     <summary>Tips for creating this stacked bar chart in Datawrapper</summary> \n     <p>To color all five parts of these stacked bars differently, put your data in five columns: safe for Biden, lean Biden, safe for Trump, lean Trump, uncertain. Only fill the cells that apply, e.g., “safe for Biden” and “lean Biden” in the Biden row.</p> \n    </details><h2 id=\"When-results-will-come-in\">When results will come in</h2><p>Because of the coronavirus pandemic, lots of voters vote by mail. It will take days (<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/elections/how-long-election-results-2020/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">maybe weeks?</a>) for all the votes to be counted so that the election coverage will drag on. Consider letting your readers know when they can expect results and which states have already called a winner.</p><img src=\"https://img.datawrapper.de/x3Dfm/full.png\"> \n     <details> \n      <summary>Tips for creating this table in Datawrapper</summary> \n      <p>For this table, add <strong>empty rows</strong> before each timestamp to give them a bit more room to breathe. Then style the time stamp rows and the first row individually with the <strong>“Customize rows”</strong> option. Consider hiding the actual header row – it’s not needed here.</p> \n      <p>To color the called states, add a hidden “called” column and use this one to <strong>\"Color cells based on categories.\"</strong></p> \n     </details><p>You can do the same in map tooltips:</p><img src=\"https://img.datawrapper.de/S7BI5/full.png\"> \n      <details> \n       <summary>How to create this tilemap in Datawrapper</summary> \n       <p>To create a <strong>tilemap</strong> like this one in Datawrapper, choose “Choropleth map” in the <a href=\"https://app.datawrapper.de/create/map\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">map menu</a>, search for “tile” and then choose the “USA » States: electoral college (hexagons)” map.</p> \n      </details><h2 id=\"The-days-and-weeks-after-the-election-Analysis\">The days and weeks after the election: Analysis</h2><p>After the election comes the time where everyone analyzes what just happened. Consider the following chart types to do so:</p> \n      <ul> \n       <li>A <strong>stacked bar chart</strong> to show voter demographics (e.g., voters by age, religion, education, ethnicity)</li> \n       <li><strong>State maps</strong> to show the turnout</li> \n       <li><strong>County maps</strong> or <strong>scatterplots</strong> to show which counties shifted from voting Republican to voting Democrat and the other way round</li> \n       <li><strong>Arrow charts</strong> to show which states shifted the most</li> \n      </ul><p>Here’s part of what the stacked bar chart showing voter demographics could look like:</p><img src=\"https://img.datawrapper.de/wF0Nc/full.png\"> \n       <details> \n        <summary>How to group in stacked bar charts in Datawrapper</summary> \n        <p>To group your stacked bar chart (or arrow chart, range plots, dot plots, etc.) in Datawrapper, create an additional text column with the category name. Then <strong>“Group bars by column”</strong> in the Visualize step.</p> \n       </details><h2 id=\"A-word-about-maps\">A word about maps</h2><p>Maps are essential for election coverage. If you’re a U.S. organization, your readers will want to know the results from their home county. That’s why Datawrapper lets you create county maps for each U.S. state:</p> \n       <div class=\"wide\"> \n        <p><img src=\"https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/201013_uselection2.gif\" alt=\"different U.S. county maps Datawrapper offers\" /></p> \n       </div><p>There are also lots of U.S. maps to choose from in Datawrapper. You’ve already met two in this article: the U.S. tilemap sized by electoral votes and the U.S. state map. Here are a few more:</p> \n       <ul> \n        <li><strong>U.S. hexagons map</strong>, where each state has the same size. That’s a good choice if the number of states is essential (e.g., how many states allow which kind of postal voting).</li> \n        <li><strong>U.S. congressional district map</strong> to report on the election results for the House of Representatives or the win probability before the election</li> \n        <li><strong>U.S. county map</strong> to show how individual counties voted (e.g., for the Senate), or how that differs to the 2016 election.</li> \n       </ul><p><img src=\"https://blog.datawrapper.de/img/full-201013_uselection1.png\" alt=\"different maps Datawrapper offers\" class=\"b-lazy\" data-src=\"/img/full-201013_uselection1.png\" data-src-thumb=\"/img/thumb-201013_uselection1.png\"><em>Six of the U.S. maps you can find in Datawrapper: a state map, a hexagon map, a county map, a congressional district map, a tilemap sized by electoral votes, and a tilemap sized by population.</em></img></p><p>In total, you’ll find more than 2000 maps in Datawrapper. <a href=\"https://app.datawrapper.de/create/map\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">You can see the whole collection in our map selector</a> (no need to sign up).
