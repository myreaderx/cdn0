This is the so-called Free Town Project, a venture wherein a group of libertarian activists attempted to take over a tiny New Hampshire town, Grafton, and transform it into a haven for libertarian ideals—part social experiment, part beacon to the faithful, Galt’s Gulch meets the New Jerusalem….</p> \n <p class=\"\">the Free Towners spent years pursuing an aggressive program of governmental takeover and delegitimation, their appetite for litigation matched only by their enthusiasm for cutting public services. They slashed the town’s already tiny yearly budget of $1 million by 30 percent, obliged the town to fight legal test case after test case, and staged absurd, standoffish encounters with the sheriff to rack up YouTube hits. Grafton was a poor town to begin with, but with tax revenue dropping even as its population expanded, things got steadily worse. Potholes multiplied, domestic disputes proliferated, violent crime spiked, and town workers started going without heat. “Despite several promising efforts,” Hongoltz-Hetling dryly notes, “a robust Randian private sector failed to emerge to replace public services.” Instead, Grafton, “a haven for miserable people,” became a town gone “feral.” Enter the bears, stage right….</p> \n <p class=\"\">What was the deal with Grafton’s bears? Hongoltz-Hetling investigates the question at length, probing numerous hypotheses for why the creatures have become so uncharacteristically aggressive, indifferent, intelligent, and unafraid. Is it the lack of zoning, the resulting incursion into bear habitats, and the reluctance of Graftonites to pay for, let alone mandate, bear-proof garbage bins? Might the bears be deranged somehow, perhaps even disinhibited and emboldened by toxoplasmosis infections, picked up from eating trash and pet waste from said unsecured bins? There can be no definitive answer to these questions, but one thing is clear: The libertarian social experiment underway in Grafton was uniquely incapable of dealing with the problem. “Free Towners were finding that the situations that had been so easy to problem-solve in the abstract medium of message boards were difficult to resolve in person.”</p> \n <p class=\"\">Grappling with what to do about the bears, the Graftonites also wrestled with the arguments of certain libertarians who questioned whether they should do&nbsp;<em>anything</em>&nbsp;at all—especially since several of the town residents had taken to feeding the bears, more or less just because they could. One woman, who prudently chose to remain anonymous save for the sobriquet “Doughnut Lady,” revealed to Hongoltz-Hetling that she had taken to welcoming bears on her property for regular feasts of grain topped with sugared doughnuts. If those same bears showed up on someone else’s lawn expecting similar treatment, that wasn’t&nbsp;<em>her</em>&nbsp;problem. The bears, for their part, were left to navigate the mixed messages sent by humans who alternately threw firecrackers and pastries at them. Such are the paradoxes of Freedom….&nbsp;Caught up in “pitched battles over who was living free, but free in the right way,” the libertarians descended into accusing one another of statism, leaving individuals and groups to do the best (or worst) they could. Some kept feeding the bears, some built traps, others holed up in their homes, and still others went everywhere toting increasingly larger-caliber handguns.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><a title=\"\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-11/the-next-big-shift-in-economics-takes-shape-under-covid-shadow\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-11/the-next-big-shift-in-economics-takes-shape-under-covid-shadow\" data-original-title=\"\">Next Big Shift in Economics Takes Shape Under Covid Shadow</a></p> \n<p>[Bloomberg, via Naked Capitalism 10-12-20]</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>A rare regime-change in economic policy is under way that’s edging central bankers out of the pivotal role they have played for decades.</p> \n <div>\n   Fiscal policy, which fell out of fashion as an engine of economic growth during the inflationary 1970s, has been front-and-center in the fight against Covid-19.

In addition, the bank came under another criminal investigation in 2012 and 2013 when it lost $6 billion of its bank depositors’ money gambling in credit derivatives in London (the London Whale scandal).</p> \n <p>Turns out Jamie Dimon has been taking&nbsp;<em>very</em>&nbsp;good care of the Directors on his Board and they have been taking&nbsp;<em>very</em>&nbsp;good care of Dimon – turning him into a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/profile/jamie-dimon/#7fd1c0055063\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.forbes.com/profile/jamie-dimon/#7fd1c0055063\">billionaire</a>, notwithstanding the worst criminal record of any major &nbsp;bank in the history of the United States.</p> \n <p>The JPMorgan Chase Board of Directors has a stunning number of incestuous conflicts of interest, few of which have not been properly spelled out to shareholders.

Burke has sat on the Board of JPMorgan Chase since 2004 as a fixture on the bank’s Compensation and Management Development Committee which has turned Dimon into a billionaire despite the trail of felony counts, criminal fines and scandals under his “leadership.” Also for the past 16 years, Burke has sat on the Board’s Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee and is currently its Chair.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><strong>Information Age Dystopia</strong></p> \n<p class=\"\"><a title=\"\" href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/general-paul-nakasone-cyber-command-nsa/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-original-title=\"\">The Man Who Speaks Softly—and Commands a Big Cyber Army</a></p> \n<p class=\"\">[Wired, via The Big Picture 10-17-20]</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p class=\"\">Meet General Paul Nakasone.

They are organizing a wide base of mathematicians in the hopes of cutting off police technologies at their source. The letter’s authors cite ‘deep concerns over the use of machine learning, AI, and facial recognition technologies to justify and perpetuate oppression.’ Predictive policing is one key area where some mathematicians and scientists have enabled the racist algorithms now animating broken-windows policing, which tell cops to treat specific areas as “hotspots” for potential crime. Activists have long criticized the bias inherent in these practices. Algorithms trained on data produced by racist policing will reproduce that prejudice to ‘predict’ where crime will be committed and who is potentially criminal. ‘The data does not speak for itself, it’s not neutral,’ explains Brendan McQuade, author of Pacifying the Homeland: Intelligence Fusion and Mass Supervision. Police data is ‘dirty data,’ because it does not represent crime, but policing and arrests. ‘So what are its predictions going to find?

It was, “I got to vote for somebody who’s not a bad guy.” It’s starting to feel like a dictatorship, where the guy living in the big house on the hill is just going to do what he wants to do. No matter what, this is a democracy…. Yes, I do like the economy piece, but I also care about professionalism. I care about the bedside manner. I care that when my president speaks, he’s not offending masses of marginalized people. I couldn’t even listen to Trump. He just was so ugly and not what I think of when I think of a leader, someone like Barack Obama or even George Bush. • Worth reading in full; there’s a lot to unpack.

Vance, American Compass]. Interviewer: Oren Cass, via Naked Capitalism Water Cooler 10-15-20]</p> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>This one nugget from Arnade is interesting: “I think of Michael Lind’s book [The New Class War] talking about how&nbsp;populism basically fails because it doesn’t have people to staff it. The machine—I don’t want to use the term “deep state” because I don’t think that’s fair, but—our ruling bureaucracy embraces free markets and austerity and all those things that drove people toward Trump. The irony is, Trump is a politician who defines himself by what he’s against, and he was very fortunate to have Jeb Bush as his opposition in 2016, so that he could run against that consensus. Then the reality is, four years later, he ends up being basically a Jeb Bush conservative in how he legislates. So if he loses, I think that’s why: He didn’t deliver; he didn’t fight the consensus, certainly not economically. I think that really matters. I want to keep emphasizing this because it’s just something that it’s really hard for me to communicate, how disinterested a lot of people are in this whole process because they don’t really see a difference. The only difference they see is cultural, and that’s why it’s very frustrating.”</p> \n </blockquote> <p><em>Lambert Strether adds: “I think Sanders would have faced what Trump faced: A professional services strike by the PMC. I suppose one way to look at 2020 is that the PMC achieved class consciousness — in and through the Democrat Party — in reaction to Clinton’s defeat in 2016 (I use the word reaction quite deliberately). The interview as a whole is interesting, but both Arnade and Vance treat politics as bipolar — and it is, it is! — by confusing the Left and liberals.</em></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> \n <div class=\"simplesocialbuttons simplesocial-round-icon simplesocialbuttons_inline simplesocialbuttons-align-left post-15151 post  simplesocialbuttons-inline-no-animation\"> \n  <button class=\"simplesocial-fb-share\" target=\"_blank\" data-href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.ianwelsh.net/week-end-wrap-political-economy-october-18-2020/\" onclick=\"javascript:window.open(this.dataset.href, '', 'menubar=no,toolbar=no,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes,height=600,width=600');return false;\"><span class=\"simplesocialtxt\">Facebook </span> </button> \n  <button class=\"simplesocial-twt-share\" data-href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Week-end+Wrap+%E2%80%93+Political+Economy+%E2%80%93+%C2%A0October+18%2C+2020&amp;url=https://www.ianwelsh.net/week-end-wrap-political-economy-october-18-2020/\" rel=\"nofollow\" onclick=\"javascript:window.open(this.dataset.href, '', 'menubar=no,toolbar=no,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes,height=600,width=600');return false;\"><span class=\"simplesocialtxt\">Twitter</span> </button> \n  <button onclick=\"javascript:window.open(this.dataset.href, '_blank' );return false;\" class=\"simplesocial-whatsapp-share\" data-href=\"https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https://www.ianwelsh.net/week-end-wrap-political-economy-october-18-2020/\"><span class=\"simplesocialtxt\">WhatsApp</span></button> \n  <button target=\"popup\" class=\"simplesocial-linkedin-share\" data-href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https://www.ianwelsh.net/week-end-wrap-political-economy-october-18-2020/\" onclick=\"javascript:window.open(this.dataset.href, '', 'menubar=no,toolbar=no,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes,height=600,width=600');return false;\"><span class=\"simplesocialtxt\">LinkedIn</span></button> \n </div> <img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/IanWelsh/~4/1t2jZdfgRsU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" /></p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 18 Oct 2020 16:24:32 +0000","feedId":50480,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"574038b447f02fd8bfbc5a4a11ae5d85","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Tony Wikrent","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.ianwelsh.net/?p=15151/image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn13@2020_2/2020/10/18/18-48-17-602_2e666c203e470991.jpg","https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f342.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn21@2020_2/2020/10/18/18-48-15-390_81a0eae3f122fa33.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/IanWelsh/~4/1t2jZdfgRsU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn18@2020_5/2020/10/18/18-48-15-348_ce64e4555d70d662.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603046862610}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-10-19 02:47:42","updatedTime":"2020-10-19 02:47:42","feedId":50480,"fetchDate":"Sun, 18 Oct 2020 18:47:42 +0000","fetchMs":3080,"handleMs":16,"totalMs":39163,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"84e253ce38f288a60a012751fa1461fa","hostName":"europe63*","requestId":"ad33ecbe4e5543aeada1d346cbd5c4d8_50480","contentType":"text/xml;
