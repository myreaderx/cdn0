I wanted to highlight a new learning toy we got recently.<br /><b><br /></b><a href=\"http://www.edu2.lt/\"><b>edu2toys</b></a> is a company based out of <i>Lithuania</i> that believes in the power of <i>creative </i>education. They understand that each child has his or her own unique greatness. So, they developed tools &amp; toys that nurture &amp; empower kids to become their best self! I'm totally down with that!&nbsp; <br /><br />As a mom, I find myself wondering what types of activities to do with my <i>toddler.&nbsp;</i> I've tried playing ball, coloring &amp; even making a spider out of a craft materials, he wasn't that interested.&nbsp; Throughout the 'trying'&nbsp; I found myself wondering if I was doing something wrong? -&nbsp;&nbsp; I've had better luck when he &amp; I painted together &amp; read books.&nbsp; As a mom, I am realizing more &amp; more that early childhood is an important stage of development where my little guy is exploring &amp; curious about every single thing!&nbsp; He's obsessed with looking into everything. <br /><br />I came across <a href=\"http://www.edu2.lt/en/product/sensory-play-space-divider/\"><b>edu2toys</b></a> &amp; I love that they believe that developing creativity in our children is a duty to be shared by both teachers &amp; parents.<i> So true! </i>They also explain that in order to understand children we need to try &amp; listen closely to what they say, their facial expressions, the look in their eyes &amp; even analyze their drawings.&nbsp; KIDS tend to communicate via emotions, shadow play, music, art of sculpture,  storytelling, drawing, drama and a multitude of other verbal and  non-verbal means of self-expression. So, my husband I wanted to bring more creativity into Noah's play area where he would be able to express himself more....so, we chose a few items from <a href=\"http://www.edu2.lt/\"><b>edu2toys</b></a>.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.madebygirl.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_8024_1.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.madebygirl.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_8024_1.jpg\" /></a></div><br />The one I<b>'</b>ll be sharing with you today is the<b> - <a href=\"http://www.edu2.lt/en/product/sensory-play-space-divider/\">Sensory Play Space Divider</a>.&nbsp; </b>It's a modular space divider.&nbsp; It helps develop sensory skills &amp; also imagination! You can also use this to divide an area in their room and create activity zones &amp; quiet reading time.&nbsp; I love toys that help Noah develop skills, for example this space divider is valuable because it helps with:<br /><ul><li><b><i>fine motor skills</i></b></li><li><b><i>self-expression &amp; imagination</i></b></li><li><b><i>communication skills</i></b></li><li><b><i>aesthetics</i></b></li></ul><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.madebygirl.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SensorySpaceDivider_edu2_full.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.madebygirl.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/SensorySpaceDivider_edu2_full.jpg\" /></a></div><div class=\"\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><br /></div><div class=\"\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">You can do a lot with this space divider<b> </b>such as<b> </b>folding the panels in a circle to create a house! We did that for Noahs's room &amp; we also got the<a href=\"http://www.edu2.lt/en/product/felt-wool-berries/\"><b> felt wool berries </b></a>- which I LOVE!! I must admit, he hasn't quite mastered the creativity aspect of it, but I think the more we practice.... the more he will understand that play time is about imagining &amp; creating!&nbsp; </div><div
