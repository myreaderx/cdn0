What was once viewed as a simple small add on for new riders has grown into a line of powerful lights that boast leading tech and fantastic price points for consumers. The nice thing about Bontrager&#8217;s line of lights is that they span the cycling globe—there are lights for commuters, lights for fairweather riders, and some for the serious trail rider looking to see the line in the pitch-black wilderness. No matter what the riding experience is, Bontrager has a light to cover it. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Related: <a title=\"Permalink to The Best Mountain Bike Lights for Night Riding\" href=\"https://reviews.mtbr.com/the-best-mountain-bike-lights-for-night-riding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"bookmark noopener\">The Best Mountain Bike Lights for Night Riding</a></strong></p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The Best Bontrager Lights for Mountain Biking</span></h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-209979\" src=\"https://reviews.mtbr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-27-at-11.01.18-AM-1024x569.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1021\" height=\"567\" srcset=\"https://reviews.mtbr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-27-at-11.01.18-AM-1024x569.png 1024w, https://reviews.mtbr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-27-at-11.01.18-AM-300x167.png 300w, https://reviews.mtbr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-27-at-11.01.18-AM-768x427.png 768w, https://reviews.mtbr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-27-at-11.01.18-AM-900x500.png 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1021px) 100vw, 1021px\" /></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">These lights are for the rider who loves to hit the singletrack at night. Some of the best riding, especially in the winter months, can be at night. However, there&#8217;s a problem of illumination &#8211; the ability to see trail features coming at you, especially riding in dense woods. For that, you need a light that not only has the power to brighten up the landscape and provides a wide view of the trails. </span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">These powerful Bontrager lights are just what you need to ride the trails, whether you plan to mount these on your bars or helmet (or both). For quick changes to the light settings, look for the Bontrager transmitter remote—a must-have for those who like to change the power during rides. </span></p>\n<h2>Bontrager Ion Pro RT/Flare RT Light Set</h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-208527\" src=\"https://reviews.mtbr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-06-at-11.21.49-AM.png\" alt=\"Best Bontrager Lights Ion Pro 1300 Lumen\" width=\"966\" height=\"577\" srcset=\"https://reviews.mtbr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-06-at-11.21.49-AM.png 966w, https://reviews.mtbr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-06-at-11.21.49-AM-300x179.png 300w, https://reviews.mtbr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-06-at-11.21.49-AM-768x459.png 768w, https://reviews.mtbr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-06-at-11.21.49-AM-900x538.png 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 966px) 100vw, 966px\" /></p>\n<p>The ultimate &#8220;see and be seen&#8221; bicycle light combo, this set is the easiest way to stay safe when you ride to and from the trails.
