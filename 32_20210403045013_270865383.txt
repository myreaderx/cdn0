This has led researchers at the Shanghai Jiao Tong University and the Purple Mountain Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences to identify characteristic dark matter signatures that would be easier to detect.</p><p>Their new paper proposes a new type of effect that relates to the so-called \"sub-GeV dark matter\" which is boosted by cosmic rays.

They found that these particles have a \"diurnal modulation\" – a scattering pattern that is linked to the time of day. At periods when the Galaxy Center faces the side of the planet that's opposite the location of the detector, the Earth shadows a large amount of these particles. At other times, they come in as a signal with \"higher recoil energy.\"</p><p>\"The conventional diurnal effect is only for slow moving (nonrelativistic) DM particles in our galaxy (so-called standard DM halo),\" Ge and Yuan said to <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2021-03-diurnal-effect-cosmic-ray-boosted-dark.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Phys.org.</a> \"The effect is negligibly small either from direct experimental constraints, or due to the detection threshold.

For many scientists, a group of people known for retaining their childlike wonder, the question naturally evolves to asking how life itself originated on Earth. As is often the case when working with questions about the Earth billions of years ago, those trying to answer this one have access to a limited amount of data.</p><p>Now, a chance finding from a lightning strike in Illinois may reshape how we understand the beginnings of life on this planetand worlds beyond. </p><h3>\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\nIn the beginning, there were a lot of meteorite impacts and\nlightning strikes</h3><br/><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z5DWKTNqByM\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"730\"></iframe><p> Phosphorous is an important chemical for life on Earth, cells use it to help build DNA and RNA and it is required for several other important functions. There is plenty of phosphorous on Earth, but not all of it is water-soluble. It is thought that much of the phosphorus on Earth three and a half billion years ago, about the time when life first appeared, was trapped in minerals that can not dissolve in water. Given how important water is for life on Earth, this was an obstacle to the rise of life.  </p><p>Until very recently, the leading theory about where most of the soluble phosphorous came from credited meteorites, many of which have small amounts of the stuff. However, this theory always had problems. The number of meteorites hitting the early Earth, while high, is thought to have fallen drastically after the event which is theorized to have created the moon. The problem gets worse over time, with fewer and fewer expected impacts as the solar system stabilized.  </p><p>Additionally, meteorite impacts are often catastrophic events more often known for ending life than helping to start it. The amount of phosphorous that could arrive this way is also limited, with the heat and trauma of impact potentially vaporizing much of the stuff and leaving a pittance readily accessible in the environment.  </p><p>This is where the chance finding in Illinois comes in. In 2016, a hunk of <a href=\"https://geology.utah.gov/map-pub/survey-notes/glad-you-asked/what-are-fulgurites-and-where-can-they-be-found/\" target=\"_blank\">fulgurite</a>, a clump of fused sediment created by a lightning strike, was found in Glen Ellyn, a small Chicago suburb. The sample was given to the nearby Wheaton College.  </p><p>A team of researchers from the University of Leeds examined the specimen as part of an investigation into the formation of fulgurite, but were surprised to discover that it contained a large amount of <a href=\"https://www.mindat.org/min-3582.html\" target=\"_blank\">schreibersite</a>, a water-soluble phosphate mineral.  </p><p> Lead author and Ph.D. candidate Benjamin Hess explained how this find might alter theories on how water-soluble phosphates came into being billions of years ago:</p><p>\"Most models for how life may have formed on Earth's surface invoke meteorites which carry small amounts of schreibersite. Our work finds a relatively large amount of schreibersite in the studied fulgurite. Lightning strikes Earth frequently, implying that the phosphorus needed for the origin of life on Earth's surface does not rely solely on meteorite hits.\"</p><p>Their findings were published in Nature Communications and can be read in their entirety <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21849-2\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.  </p><h3>\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\nOkay, this is cool and all, but how can we possibly use this\ninformation?</h3><br/><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/upRqAaCEEhw\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"730\"></iframe><p> In addition to shedding light on the Earth's past environment and how it changed over time, this finding might also aid the search for life on other planets.  </p><p>Lead author Mr. Hess speculated that the finding \"also means that the formation of life on other Earth-like planets remains possible long after meteorite impacts have become rare.\"</p><p>This is important because, as co-author Dr. Jason Harvey explains:</p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><em>\"The early bombardment is a once in a solar system event. As planets reach their mass, the delivery of more phosphorus from meteors becomes negligible. Lightning, on the other hand, is not such a one-off event. If atmospheric conditions are favourable for the generation of lightning, elements essential to the formation of life can be delivered to the surface of a planet. This could mean that life could emerge on Earth-like planets at any point in time.\"</em></p><p>While these speculations presume that alien life forms will require the same substances we do to exist, the discovery of a new source of usable phosphorus is an exciting find for those interested in alien worlds and in the early geology or biology of Earth.

Along the way, they encounter Colonel Kilgore (Robert Duvall) and his love for Wagner, endless battles fought for esoteric reasons, and a mad photojournalist (Dennis Hopper) who considers Kurtz to be a genius.</p><p>Three major cuts of the film exist. In addition to the<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078788/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>original</u></a>, there is Redux, which adds 50 minutes of deleted scenes that provide some extra explanation while smoothing out some transitions. The most recent version, The Final Cut, is director Coppola's favorite and scales back some of these changes.</p><h3>\"13th\"</h3><br/><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krfcq5pF8u8\"><img class=\"rm-lazyloadable-image rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"18f12197823860f092942bfda3576e85\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNTkyMzM3NS9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY0MzkwODIwNX0.75o9rhDkq9Cd4Gc47DHyLSdLiUgKjAlzJpjKJs3atlY/img.png?width=980\" height=\"326\" id=\"2bbfa\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" width=\"220\"/></a><p>Our first staff pick is a documentary by Ava DuVernay. \"13th\" focuses on the 13th Amendment to the United States Constitution—which bans slavery while allowing involuntary servitude as punishment for a crime—and the horrors it has<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5895028/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> <u>wrought</u></a>.</p><p>The film dives into the post-slavery social and economic history of the United States, demonstrating a link between the second half of that amendment and the rise of Jim Crow and mass incarceration.

But being intellectually restless, Schrödinger was ready to take on an even more difficult subject: the nature of organisms. What was it, he asked, that makes living systems different from non-living ones? The results of his thinking became one of the most essential books in the exciting and yet dangerous territory lying between physics and biology. That book's question was also its title, \"<a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/what-is-life/A876185F2DB06FF5C2CC67C9A60DAD7F\" target=\"_blank\">What Is Life</a>?\"<em>.</em> Its ideas are worth looking at now because more than 75 years after its publication, there are stunning new directions opening up toward an answer that both affirms and goes far beyond Schrödinger original vision.</p><h3></h3><br/><img alt=\"Erwin Schrodinger what is life?\" class=\"rm-lazyloadable-image rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"42ed2e7ca08ee2857f677b6a46f9c442\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNTg3NzkzMy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1MzMyMzk4M30.l8PMwZThsmVtI3cLwIRIHNgRUAziOmD30o4i-TsxapI/img.jpg?width=980\" height=\"1125\" id=\"1a691\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" width=\"2000\"/><p>\"What Is Life?\" focused on the need to find the underlying physical principles that make living systems behave so differently. The hope had always been to find \"laws of life\" similar to what has been found for the fundamental laws of nature in other areas of physics. Looking at life from a physicists' viewpoint, Schrödinger saw that one of its most compelling properties was the defeat of the omnipresent second law of thermodynamics. The second law states that the evolution of any physical system always tends toward states of maximum disorder (i.e., maximum entropy). But at the local level of an organism's body, life manages to create and maintain staggering degrees of order. It beats back chaos, for a while at least. Thus, somehow, life manifested what Schrödinger called \"negentropy\" or negative entropy.</p><p>Being one of the founders of quantum mechanics, which is the science of the microworld, Schrödinger also thought deeply about life's mechanics at the molecular level. Here, he was prescient, famously conjecturing that within cells there must reside an \"aperiodic crystal\" that held the information needed to transmit heritable traits from one generation to the next, allowing evolution to work. By aperiodic crystal, Schrödinger meant a molecule that had a stable, regular (i.e., repeatable) structure. If it was too regular and repeatable, however, you couldn't use it to code a living organism's structure. So 'aperiodic' meant 'kinda, sorta repeating.' A decade later, Francis Crick and James Watson credited this conjecture as their inspiration for using Rosalind Franklin's X-ray data to discover DNA as the blueprint for life.</p><p>So yeah, \"What Is Life?\" was a really, really important book. </p><p>But as powerful as the book was, 75 years after its publication no foundational physical laws for life have ever been found. There is no F=ma or E=mc2 or even a <a href=\"https://bigthink.com/scotty-hendricks/the-life-and-death-of-schrodingers-cat-and-what-it-really-means\" target=\"_blank\">Schrödinger's equation</a> for living systems. In spite of decades of searching, physicists have been unable to fully \"reduce\" the domains of the biologist (cells and organs and ecologies) into the domains of their own (atoms and energy and forces). In recent years, however, a new path forward has appeared that holds a unique promise. Rather than reduce biology to physics, the new direction would transform them both.</p><h3></h3><br/><blockquote>The focus on networks of information flows means its laws may be <em>emergent. </em>Life's laws would not, therefore, be encoded in the laws of quarks. </blockquote><h3></h3><br/><p>What has become clear to scientists like <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Demon-Machine-Paul-Davies/dp/024130959X\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Davies</a>, <a href=\"https://biodesign.asu.edu/sara-walker\" target=\"_blank\">Sara Walker</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.chem.gla.ac.uk/cronin/\" target=\"_blank\">Lee Cronin</a>, who are working across domains, is that understanding life requires putting a new actor onto the stage and letting it take the lead. That actor is <em>information</em>. Rather than focusing on the mechanics of life—meaning how the laws of atoms can be built up into a living organism—researchers are beginning to see that what really matters is how atoms and molecules become <em>conduits </em>for complex flows of information. Rather than just thinking about forces or energy exchanges <em>between</em> molecular parts, the key becomes seeing the whole; seeing how these parts can be seen as something more, something that only emerges when information becomes important to a system.</p><p>Why is this new perspective so radical? What's most important is it's not reductive. That means it does not reduce life to \"just\" the laws governing quarks or whatever quarks are made of. Without doubt, life is a physical system, but by creating and then harnessing intricate ballets of information flows, life does something amazing: it <em>creates</em>. The focus on networks of information flows means its laws may be <em>emergent. </em>Life's laws would not, therefore, be encoded in the laws of quarks. Instead, they only emerge when enough matter is brought together in the right conditions for networks of information flows to become possible. That's when novelty enters the universe.</p><h3></h3><br/><p>The other radical consequence of seeing life as a dance of information that <em>rides</em> matter is that this emergence continues upwards in scale. Just as new rules appear for cells, so to do they appear for collections of cells in animals or plants. And then even newer rules appear higher up on the level of ecosystems made of many animals and plants. At even higher levels still, new laws and structures must emerge in the creation of social organizations via ants, tribes of chimps, and even global technological cultures. </p><p>We'll be exploring this information flow perspective on life a lot more in the coming months, but for now it's enough to just recognize one of the key starting points. Schrödinger's \"What Is Life?\" was a remarkable first step because he saw information playing a central role in those aperiodic crystals. But what he could not have seen was how the focus on information <em>flows</em> would transform not just the answer but the very question that he posed. Because if you are going to focus on information, the next question you'll have to address is <em>who</em> or <em>what</em> knows that information. We'll leave that question for another time.</p><h3>Why haven't we found aliens?

The daily logs listed a ship's noon position, the number of sperm whales sighted, and how many whales were harpooned (\"struck\") or processed (\"tried\"). These records allowed the researchers to identify the date on which first contact with local whales occurred. From there, they were able to calculate the rate at which whales were encountered over the subsequent years.</p><p>The researchers found that about 2.4 years after first contact, whalers' strike rate fell by 58 percent. </p><p>At first, it seems the whales didn't quite know what to do about the whalers and responded to them similarly to the manner in which they defend themselves against the only predator they'd known up to that point: orcas. They formed defensive circles, their powerful tails pointed out to fend off their attackers. Unfortunately, this provided no defense against harpoons and likely made whaler's jobs easier by gathering groups of whales together where they could be easily killed.</p><p>Soon however, the leviathan strategy shifted and whales took to swimming upwind away from whalers' ships, an effective evasive maneuver that kept them ahead of the wind-driven boats.

These songs provide some hard-to-argue-with evidence for social leaning among whales: They evolve over time, and as they change, those changes are reflected by entire local whale populations. \"We don't have to do anything but observe it to know that there's no explanation other than learning from others that can account for this,\" wrote Whitehead and Rendell to NPR in 2015.</p><p>Rendell wrote in <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/340/6131/485\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Science</a> in 2013 about what seems to be an innovation that was shared among whales: the spread of a particular type of feeding, \"<a href=\"https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/image-of-the-week/lobtail-feeding-in-whales/\" target=\"_blank\">lobtailing</a>,\" that seems to have spread from <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/130425-humpback-whale-culture-behavior-science-animals\" target=\"_blank\">one humpback whale</a> in 1980 to hundreds in a wider area over the next few decades.</p><p>There are also examples of cetaceans clearly using strategy, such as the manner in which orcas hunt together for <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/weddell-seal\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Weddell seals</a>, <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1748-7692.2010.00453.x\" target=\"_blank\">described</a> by NOAA scientist Bob Pitman. The seals attempt to evade the orcas by remaining out of the water on ice floes. The orcas synchronize their flukes to create waves that either knock a seal off of a floe, or break the ice apart. Once the seal is in the water, the orcas blow bubbles under the water and apparently using their tails to create enough turbulence that the seal finds it harder to get back on the ice. If it does get out to safety, the orcas do it all over again until, according to Pitman, by about the fourth attempt, they usually have their prey, which they share.</p><p>And then there's the whales' evasive tactics for dealing with 19th-century whaling ships.</p><h3>Back to the present and future</h3><br/><p>Unfortunately, modern vessels , equipment, and strategies were not as easy to evade, and whale populations were severely depleted in the 20 century.

In ancient Greece, time was cyclical and if the <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/big-bounce-models-reignite-big-bang-debate-20180131/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Big Bounce theory</a> is true, they were right. In Buddhism, there is only the eternal now. Both the past and the future are illusions. Meanwhile, the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-13452711\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Amondawa</a> people of the Amazon, a group that first made contact with the outside world in 1986, have no abstract concept of time. While we think we know time pretty well, some scientists believe our linear model hobbles scientific progress. We're missing whole dimensions of time, in this view, and our limited perception could be the last obstacle to a sweeping <a href=\"https://www.space.com/theory-of-everything-definition.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">theory of everything.</a> </p><p>Theoretical physicist Itzhak Bars of the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, is the most famous scientist with such a hypothesis, known as <a href=\"https://bigthink.com/philip-perry/there-are-in-fact-2-dimensions-of-time-one-theoretical-physicist-states\" target=\"_self\">two-time physics</a>. Here, time is 2D, visualized as a curved plane interwoven into the fabric of the \"normal\" dimensions—up-down, left-right, and backward-forward. While the hypothesis is over a decade old, Bars isn't the only scientist with such an idea. But what's different with <a href=\"https://www.socr.umich.edu/spacekime/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">spacekime theory</a> is that it uses a data analytics approach, rather than a physics one. And while it posits that there are at least two dimensions of time, it allows for up to five. </p><p>In the spacekime model, space is 5D. Besides the ones we normally encounter, the extra dimensions are so infinitesimally small, we never notice them. This relates to the <a href=\"https://plus.maths.org/content/kaluza-klein-and-their-story-fifth-dimension\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Kaluza–Klein theory</a> developed in the early 20th century, which stated that there might be an extra, microscopic dimension of space. In this view, space would be curved like the surface of Earth. And like Earth, those who travel the entire distance would, eventually, loop back to their place of origin. </p><p>Kaluza-Klein theory unified electromagnetism and gravity, but wasn't accepted at the time, although it did help in the search for quantum gravity. The concept of additional dimensions was revived in the 1990s with <a href=\"https://physicstoday.scitation.org/do/10.1063/PT.5.6195/full/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Wesson's</a> <a href=\"https://wp.towson.edu/5dstm/introduction/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Space-Time-Matter Consortium</a>. Today, proponents of superstring theory say there may be as many as <a href=\"https://bigthink.com/philip-perry/physicists-outline-10-different-dimensions-and-how-youd-experience-them\" target=\"_self\">10 different dimensions</a>, including nine of space and one of time. </p><h2>The Spacekime model</h2><p>Spacekime theory was developed by two data scientists. <a href=\"http://www.socr.umich.edu/people/dinov/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Ivo Dinov</a> is the University of Michigan's <a href=\"http://www.socr.umich.edu/html/SOCR_Support.html#:~:text=SOCR%20is%20a%20not%2Dfor,based%20instruction%20and%20scientific%20computing.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">SOCR</a> Director, as well as a professor of Health Behavior and Biological Sciences, and Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics. SOCR stands for: Statistics Online Computational Resource designs. Dr. Dinov is an expert in \"mathematical modeling, statistical analysis, computational processing, scientific visualization of large datasets (Big Data) and predictive health analytics.\" His research has focused on mathematical modeling, statistical inference, and biomedical computing.</p><p>His colleague, <a href=\"https://socr.umich.edu/people/Milen_Velev.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Milen Velchev Velev</a>, is an associate professor at the Prof. Dr. A. Zlatarov University in Bulgaria. He studies relativistic mechanics in multiple time dimensions, and his interests include \"applied mathematics, special and general relativity, quantum mechanics, cosmology, philosophy of science, the nature of space and time, chaos theory, mathematical economics, and micro-and-macroeconomics.\"</p><p>Drs. Dinov and Velev began developing spacekime theory around four or five years ago, while working with big data in the healthcare field. \"We started looking at data that intrinsically has a temporal dimension to it,\" Dr. Dinov told me during a video chat. \"It's called longitudinal or time varying data, longitudinal time variance—it has many, many names. This is data that varies with time. In biomedicine, this is the de facto, standard data. All big health data is characterized by space, time, phenotypes, genotypes, clinical assessments, and so forth.\" </p><h2>A better way to manage big data </h2><p>\"We started asking big questions,\" Dinov said. \"Why are our models not really fitting too well? Why do we need so many observations? And then, we started playing around with time. We started digging and experimenting with various things. And then we realized two important facts. </p><p>\"Number one, if we use what's called color-coded representations of the complex plane, we can define spacekime, or higher dimensional spacetime, in such a way that it agrees with the common observations that we make in (the longitudinal time series in) ordinary spacetime. That agreement was very important to us, because it basically says, yes, the higher dimensional theory does not contradict our common observations. </p><p>\"The second realization was that, since this extra dimension of time is imperceptible, we needed to approximate, model, or estimate, one of the unobservable time characteristics, which we call the kime phase. After about a year, we discovered that there is a mathematically elegant tool called the <a href=\"https://lpsa.swarthmore.edu/LaplaceXform/FwdLaplace/LaplaceXform.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Laplace Transform</a> that allows us to analytically represent time series data as kime-surfaces. Turns out, the spacekime mathematical manifold is a natural, higher dimensional extension of classical <a href=\"https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_spacetime\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Minkowski</a>, four-dimensional spacetime.\" </p><p>Our understanding of the world is becoming more complex. As a result, we have big data to contend with. How do we find new ways to analyze, interpret and visual such data? Dinov believes spacekime theory can help in some pretty impressive ways. \"The result of this multidimensional manifold generalization is that you can make scientific inferences using smaller data samples. This requires that you have a good model or prior knowledge about the phase distribution,\" he said. \"For instance, we can use spacekime process representation to better understand the development or pathogenesis to model the distributions of certain diseases.</p><p>\"Suppose we are evaluating fMRIs of Alzheimer's disease subjects. Assume we know the kime phase distribution for another cohort of patients suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Lou Gehrig's disease. The ALS kime-phase distribution could be used for evaluating the Alzheimer's patients,\" and many other neurodegenerative populations. Dinov also thinks spacekime analytics could help improve political polling, increase our understanding of complex financial and environmental events, and even the innerworkings of the human brain, all without having to take the huge samples required today to make accurate models or predictions. Spacekime theory even offers opportunities to design novel AI analytical techniques. But it goes beyond that.</p><h2>The problem of time </h2><p>Spacekime theory can help us make headway on some of the most pernicious inconsistencies in physics, such as <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-uncertainty/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Heisenberg's uncertainty principle</a> and the seemingly irreconcilable rift between quantum physics and general relativity, what's known as <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/quantum-gravitys-time-problem-20161201/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">\"the problem of time.\"</a> </p><p>Dinov wrote that the \"approach relies on extending the notions of time, events, particles, and wave functions to complex-time (kime), complex-events (kevents), data, and inference-functions.\" Basically, working with two points of time allows you to make inferences on a radius of points associated with a certain event. With Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, according to this model, since time is a plane, a certain particle would be in one position or phase, time-wise, in terms of velocity, and another phase, in terms of position. </p><p>This idea of hidden dimensions of time is a little like Plato's allegory of the cave or how an X-ray signifies what's underneath, but doesn't convey a 3D image. From a data science perspective, it all comes down to utility.

The 364-meter ship began rolling heavily. Soon, nearly 1,800 of the ship's containers—some of which were carrying dangerous goods like fireworks and liquid ethanol—came loose. Some crashed onto the deck. Others spilled into the ocean, lost forever.</p><p>The ONE Apus incident was one of at least six major containership accidents that occurred since November, which altogether have resulted in the loss of 2,980 containers. That's more than double the annual average number of lost containers from 2008 to 2019, according to a recent report from the World Shipping Council.</p><p>What's causing the uptick? It's likely a combination of bad weather and heavily loaded ships, some of which are packed to the brim due to increased U.S. imports since the beginning of the pandemic. The Bureau of Labor Statistics <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/ximpim.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> that January brought the largest monthly increase in U.S. imports since 2012.</p><p>To be sure, the World Shipping Council notes that containership accidents have been on a downtrend over the past decade, writing \"containers lost overboard represent less than one thousandth of 1% of the roughly 226 million containers currently shipped each year.\"</p><h3></h3><br/><span class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"390d8d65604bc10fbd0557c4438d25ef\" style=\"display:block;position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"auto\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kSpesP7-6vo?rel=0\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></span><p>But that fraction of a percent adds up over time. After all, international containerships move more than 80 percent of global trade, representing a roughly $4 trillion industry. And while accidents are relatively rare, they pose significant threats to crew and the environment, not to mention the economic costs.</p><p>In its recent report, the World Shipping Council notes several ways the industry has been working to improve safety standards, including increased inspection programs and updated packing practices.</p><p>Still, accidents are bound to happen among the 6,000 containerships that are sailing the world's oceans at any given time.

Perhaps its sources are to be found in centuries old Calvinist prescriptions, according to which everyone has the right to interpret the Bible in their own way.</p><hr/><p>Or maybe in the economy, since international trade necessitated respect for others.</p><p>\"According to our report, there is no such thing as Dutch national identity,\" announced Máxima, Queen of the Netherlands, in 2007, which delighted some, outraged others, and left others still unimpressed. This expert report commissioned by the authorities was to establish how the citizens of the country identified with it. The words of Máxima, who herself comes from Argentina and learned Dutch only after her marriage to Willem-Alexander, were quoted in various talk shows and press articles, and the Dutch have quarrelled over them at home tables on more than one occasion since. After all, it is a nation that loves to argue.</p><p>The word 'tolerance' doesn't itself appear in the queen's speech. Rather, it resounds between the lines. The monarch recalled the Dutch boys of Moroccan descent who guided her around Marrakesh, switching from fluent Arabic to equally fluent Dutch. She also spoke of Semra, a Turkish national, who, having passed her exams at a Dutch university, displayed in her window both the Turkish and the Dutch flag.</p><p>In the 1970s, research published by the British author and scholar Christopher Bagley pointed to tolerance as one of the three national traits chosen by the Dutch to define their own collective attitude. We shall inspect the other two a bit later, but first, let us concentrate on what the researchers agree on. Tolerance, the trait that has become pretty much synonymous with the Dutch around the world, has its roots in something much older than the present-day multicultural society of the country. In order to understand the phenomenon of Dutch tolerance, we will need to explain not only this concept, but a few others as well, including pillars, the <em>poldermodel</em> and <em>gedoogbeleid</em>.</p><h3></h3><br/><h3>Feel free to pray, just not here</h3><p>\"In a country where international trade makes for the society's basic source of income, citizens grow tolerant by themselves,\" claims Herman Pleij, a popular cultural history professor and writer. He adds that the greatest driving force behind Dutch tolerance is its citizens' belief that it is simply good for the economy. The Dutch treat politics like business.</p><p>As an example, Pleij points to the fact that in the 16th century, trade continued above and outside of religious divisions. In the Catholic town of Vlissingen, the Protestant minority contributed so much to the local fish trade that the Catholics agreed to protect the Protestants from religious persecution, as long as the minority celebrated the Eucharist outside the town limits. This caveat was quickly abandoned, however, and in 1566 the Protestants were allowed to take over one of Vlissingen's Catholic churches. What's interesting – perhaps even more so because such turns of events were at that time more an exception than the rule – is that when the Protestants were moving into their new church and stripping it of all religious images (seen by them as godless), they didn't destroy them, but instead entrusted them – intact – to the local authorities.</p><p>Hulst and Bronbeek, on the other hand, had for hundreds of years had their 'simultaneums' – shared churches and chapels with separate Catholic and Protestant sections. One Venetian merchant who stayed in the Netherlands between 1562 and 1566 noted that the country allowed remarkable levels of freedom of speech, and that Dutch women had unparalleled freedom of movement in public spaces. In 1699, the Grand Duke of Tuscany, Cosimo III de' Medici, observed that the mercantile city of Amsterdam had \"become the meeting place of men of all religions and citizens of all countries, which made it one of the most important cities in existence.\" Jean-François Le Petit, a French immigrant, praised the city, writing that newcomers from other countries could settle there and nobody asked them where they were from or what faith they professed. Those liberties resulted from, among others, the freedom of religion and outlawing of religious persecution introduced in the second half of the 16th century by William the Silent, Prince of Orange, who was himself most likely influenced by the philosophy of Erasmus.</p><h3></h3><br/><h3>The Dutch divided</h3><p>Towards the end of the 18th century, the Dutch, following the French, adopted a centralized political system. In 1815, the Congress of Vienna formally confirmed the creation of the Kingdom of the Netherlands ruled by the House of Orange-Nassau. The country was, however, organized around the 1814 constitution, the provisions of which granted royal ministers powers similar to those held by their modern-day counterparts, and instituted direct election.</p><p>What began then was a fascinating process called pillarization. Catholics, conservative Calvinists and socialists fought for their religious and civil rights, demanding the formation of their own parties and institutions. Lay and religious authorities allowed just that, seeing as the growing secularization of society might have easily pushed public sentiment towards hostility. This had to be avoided, and thus the four pillars were created: Catholic, liberal, Protestant and social-democratic. Each one of these was, of course, further subdivided. Every pillar had its own schools, hospitals, shops, and later – radio stations, newspapers and television channels (to this day, older generations tend to view television networks and newspapers in light of their Catholic or Protestant roots). Thus, a Catholic would only buy groceries in a Catholic shop or read Catholic papers. In towns and cities, entire districts emerged populated by mostly single-pillar citizens. The country itself was divided into predominantly Catholic and predominantly Protestant areas.</p><p>In order to solve problems at the national level, the pillars would delegate their political and religious elites to make terms among themselves. The art of compromise and the art of negotiation that had grown out of the aforementioned mercantile and nautical traditions became ingrained in the national character. All of these factors seemed to feed into a rather coherent worldview: people differ from one another and there's nothing one can do about it; one should, therefore, tolerate others and make the most of the situation.</p><p>The make-up of subsequent Dutch parliaments, starting in the 19th century, points to the diversity of Dutch society. The last time a single party obtained an absolute majority in legislature and could rule alone as majority government occurred 130 years ago. Ever since then, the country has been ruled by coalition governments made up of three to four parties each. For the last 60 years, the Dutch House of Representatives, the lower house of the parliament, has been sat in by members of at least nine political parties, though, at times, this number has been known to reach 14.</p><p>The Belgian academic Mick Matthys, author of a book about the differences between the Belgians and the Dutch, quotes a Belgian insurance sector worker to whom one very important trait the Dutch seem to possess is their ability to reach business agreement with people they might find disagreeable. \"In the Netherlands, you'll do business with your worst enemy. This never happens in Belgium.\" This sentiment has been confirmed by James Kennedy, an American historian and scholar of Dutch society, who observes: \"The Dutch have this notion that one should rather arrive at an agreement with another person than not; disagreement is tantamount to failure.\"</p><p>\"It's not always about agreement, more often it's about business,\" Pieter van Os, Polish correspondent for the <em>NRC Handelsblad</em> newspaper, offers as a good-natured jibe at his compatriots. \"When the famous basketball player Michael Jordan was asked why he hadn't endorsed any democratic candidate in an election, he gave a very Dutch answer: 'Republicans buy sneakers too.'\"</p><h3></h3><br/><p>Social and political scientists agree that the Dutch are largely inspired by trade and business in their views on politics and social matters. Arend Lijphart, Professor Emeritus of Political Science at the University of California, San Diego, draws attention to the fact that such an understanding of reality makes divisions and differences a side issue, instead encouraging people to focus on the maximization of profit through accord and cooperation. Lijphart also brings up the old practice of dividing public money evenly between the pillars and the Dutch tradition of calling meetings, summits and debates – democratic tools for drawing shared conclusions. The very title of Matthys's book, <em>Why the Belgians are Right and the Dutch Prove They are Right</em>, alludes to that time-honoured Dutch habit of debating each and every case until an agreement can be reached.</p><p>This national trait gave rise to the well-known Dutch concept of <em>poldermodel</em> (in English, 'polder model') multilateral negotiations. Its name comes from polders, the tracts of reclaimed land enclosed by dikes, on which the Dutch have for years built their houses and cities. The polder model of consensus-based policymaking found use and yielded great results at the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s, when mutual concessions between the government, companies and trade unions saved the Dutch economy from a crash.</p><p>Another trait that has helped forge the Dutch national predilection for consensus is the instinctive antipathy towards hierarchy shared by most citizens of the Netherlands. \"They automatically assume that every person has something to say and should be treated as an equal partner in a discussion,\" writes Matthys. The Dutch call this trait of theirs <em>grote mond</em>, which translates to 'big mouth', but it doesn't mean a gossip or a person who can't keep a secret. Rather, it refers to being eloquent, or more of a 'smart mouth' than anything else. Matthys traces the origins of this phenomenon to Calvinist teachings that allowed every citizen to interpret the Bible in their own way and to defend their opinion. He mentions that when he first started teaching at a Dutch university, what surprised him the most was how energetically his students discussed their required reading. \"Interestingly enough, those discussions were dominated not by those who had read the set texts closely, but rather by those who'd only briefly scanned them, but really wanted their opinion heard. And what they especially dwelt on was whether those texts had any practical uses or not.\"</p><h3></h3><br/><h3>A black mark against Piet</h3><p>In one form or another, the pillars somehow made it through World War II, but ever since the 1960s, they have been slowly losing their importance. The cultural, sexual and technological revolutions made new generations of the Dutch rethink their role in society – their parents' and grandparents' mindsets were seen as outdated. What's more, the country saw an influx of migrants, mostly hailing from former Dutch colonies, who didn't identify with any of the pillars, and who brought with them their own beliefs and religions. Those changes also brought about substantial revisions in some of the country's deeply rooted customs. One particularly lively controversy broke out over the so-called 'Black Pete', or <em>Zwarte Piet</em>.</p><p>Although in most European countries Santa is said to fly over from Lapland, Dutch children believe he comes to them from Spain (and by boat, no less). His retinue isn't made up of elves or angels, either. The Dutch <em>Sinterklaas</em> (St. Nicholas) arrives accompanied by short, dark-skinned characters – the <em>Zwarte Pieten</em>. Black Pete has become a divisive symbol and the subject of a nationwide dispute that breaks out in the Netherlands every year in the run up to St. Nicholas's Eve on 5th December. It has been going on for a few years now and has, at times, reached the level of life and death – at least in the media.</p><p>The Black Pete tradition was first protested as early as the 1980s by the Surinamese actress Gerda Havertong, who appeared on the Dutch version of <em>Sesame Street</em>. In one of the holiday episodes of the show, Havertong's character admonished Big Bird for calling her a Black Pete, explaining that this name was derogatory and offensive to many Dutch children and adults alike. The debate was sparked off anew and for good around 2011, when the artist Quinsy Gario, himself of Antillean descent, appeared publicly wearing a T-shirt with the caption 'ZWARTE PIET IS RACISME' ('BLACK PETE IS RACISM').</p><h3></h3><br/><p>Widespread protests swept the country. A group of Dutch citizens of colour sued the mayor of Amsterdam for agreeing to a St. Nicholas parade with Black Petes in it. Dutch television's 'Head Black Pete', actor Erik van Muiswinkel, decided not to reprise the role for that year's televized St. Nicholas pageant. Prime minister Mark Rutte was asked about the issue at, of all places, the Nuclear Security Summit. After numerous complaints, even the UN established a Black Pete task force.</p><p>Conservatives declared the debate an attack on Dutch tradition. They explained that Pete is black with soot because he has to make trips up and down the chimneys of the houses he visits with Santa. What they failed to explain was why Santa, even though he takes the same route, doesn't ever seem even a little sooty. A petition for the preservation of Black Pete was drawn up and soon used to launch the most-clicked on Dutch fan page on Facebook. Within 24 hours, the page garnered over a million likes, overtaking even the Ajax Amsterdam fan page. In Friesland, defenders of tradition blocked the motorway, stopping buses with anti-Black Pete protesters. They were fined for this, but soon found a lawyer willing to defend them entirely free of charge – as \"Frisian heroes\". In Zuilen, near Utrecht, a few men in shoe-polish blackface entered a local school to give children cookies and campaign for Black Pete.</p><p>The Dutch Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment conducted a survey on the perception of Black Pete among children. It turned out that almost 90% of all Dutch children didn't see the character as offensive or racist. Despite this, most TV stations started introducing Rainbow Petes (only the RTL television broadcaster issued an official message saying that in its programming, Pete would stay soot-speckled). The Dutch, as befits the citizens of a country of compromise, tried to strike a balance. In Amsterdam, the St. Nicholas parade introduced a quota system of sorts. 75% of the Petes were rainbow, white or sooty, and the remaining 25% were black.</p><p>The debate, however, returns each year. And there's always St. Nicholas's Eve ahead.</p><h3></h3><br/><h3>Coffee <em>alla turca</em></h3><p>\"The square is all cleared up now\", read the controversial headline of a 2012 article about the dismantling of a tent camp for people seeking asylum in The Hague. This is just one example that tolerance among the Dutch in two socially important areas – politics and the media – does not fare as well as we might expect. For this reason, the newspaper <em>Het Financieele Dagblad</em> organized a debate on the subject last year, inviting four Dutch women of Turkish origin to join in: two politicians and two journalists. As Yesim Candan (a publicist) explained, after publishing each of her column posts she only needs to wait a few minutes until the first offensive comment appears. When she told her Dutch friends that she was writing a book about sex in Turkey, they would ask: \"What does your husband say about this?\"</p><p>Keklik Yücel – a former Partij van de Arbeid (Labour Party) MP – mentioned that when years ago, as a teenager, she worked on a hospital ward, some patients asked her if she had already been forced to marry and if she needed to keep her virginity intact. Years later, when she entered politics, she was struck by how white Dutch people favour other white Dutch people in filling jobs, calling it 'networking'.</p><p>Meryem Cimen, city councillor for Haarlem, added that the higher she progressed within the government ranks, the fewer people of colour she saw around her. \"There were deliberations at which I was initially considered a waitress by some politician and asked for a coffee, because Turkish women surely cannot deal with anything other than catering,\" she continued in an ironic vein.</p><p>The journalist Fidan Ekiz pointed out that the years of fighting for equal opportunities for people from outside the Netherlands also have a dark side: \"When I first worked for a newspaper in Rotterdam, a colleague at the next desk wanted to know if I was accepted into the editorial office because of the parity ensured for Turkish people. And it wasn't even a spiteful question, he was being earnest!\"</p><p>Both the journalists who participated in the debate are appreciated by their native Dutch colleagues and media recipients for the fact that they write about society without excessively referring to their ethnic origin and religion. Nevertheless, for many Dutch people of Turkish descent, they are almost considered traitors for the very same reason.</p><p>Although the Dutch are generally active in the field of charity and care for human rights, not all of them share this attitude. During the refugee crisis, a politician from the then-ruling conservative-liberal People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) demanded that the crews of Dutch ships that rescue refugees encountered at sea be punished, because it allegedly constituted supporting human traffickers. \"This is how we become the last link in a chain of human traffickers that extends all the way back to Africa,\" he said. He didn't have to wait long for a reaction. Comedian and columnist Pieter Derks replied: \"Then let's stop reviving people with heart attacks caused by eating fast food. After all, we are the last link in the obesity chain that extends all the way back to America. Let's not pick up litter from the street and throw them into the bin, because people will litter more, and we will be the last link in the chain of carelessness. Just like you are the last link in the chain of indifference.\"</p><h3></h3><br/><p>And this last word – indifference – has been mentioned over the years as the greatest drawback of Dutch society. Journalist Fidan Ekiz believes that this feature is hidden in the Netherlands behind a facade of tolerance: \"For years, the Dutch had an attitude to economic immigrants from other countries that ran along the lines of: 'OK, let them cultivate their customs and religions, after all, they will leave sooner or later anyway.'\" In turn, the aforementioned Pieter van Os says: \"We are a confident, even arrogant nation. Most of the Dutch don't perceive others as a threat, they simply ignore them.\"</p><p>\"In our public debate, it is often repeated that tolerance turns towards indifference, that we are living side by side instead of with each other. Empty, convenient tolerance derives from the reluctance to critically evaluate the behaviour and views of other people,\" sociologist Dick Pels writes about Dutch indifference in <em>De Groene Amsterdammer</em>. He adds that cultural relativism and the belief that \"everything is allowed\" shape a specific \"culture of avoidance\", which does not take into account the most important social problems: discrimination, violence, unequal opportunities – thus opening the field for radical politicians.</p><p>This is the nucleus of the long-standing dispute between Dutch liberals and conservatives. The former identify the bourgeoisie with people who pass each other indifferently, but with a smile. The latter argue that true civil society requires intervention in the struggle for values. It sounds good, but this slogan unfortunately often hides xenophobia and intolerance. Ever since the high-profile murders of Pim Fortuyn and Theo van Gogh, the problem has been particularly present in the Netherlands.</p><p>Fortuyn was an ambiguous figure: on the one hand, he made a career attacking the values of Dutch Muslims, and on the other, he was a homosexual who openly spoke about his relationships with Moroccan men. \"He placed our debate on the edge of a knife and put the Dutch liberals with whom I myself identify in an embarrassing position. In a sense, he made it clear that when he criticized minorities, he was still more invested in them than we are, because he frequently gave them a place in the public debate. We have long thought that our indifference to minorities was the highest form of tolerance we could offer. Today I no longer think like that,\" says Van Os.</p><h3></h3><br/><h3>See no evil?</h3><p>And what about drugs? If you think that the search for pure Dutch tolerance will be easier in this case, nothing could be further from the truth. When it comes to drug policy in the Netherlands, there is another term – <em>gedoogbeleid</em>. This policy avoids punishing certain acts in the name of the greater good, as long as they do not exceed a certain limit. This concept is situated somewhere between tolerance and decriminalization. The Dutch government recognizes that it is better to tolerate the presence of soft drugs because their harmfulness is acceptable, their impact on tourism revenues is positive, and in addition it gives greater control over the sale of hard drugs. Although no self-respecting journalist cites Wikipedia, I will make an exception here, because the verb <em>gedogen</em> is explained there in an endearing manner: it is the behaviour of the father who sees that the child, contrary to the mother's prohibition, has eaten a cookie, while he himself does not mind it. To avoid conflict with his wife and conflict with his child, he decides to pretend he didn't see it. Tolerance, indifference, or maybe shirking responsibility?</p><p>The question of sex work is similarly ambiguous in this respect. In the Netherlands, it was legalized hundreds of years ago, and sex workers are self-employed small business owners, forming trade unions. Nevertheless, when they try to open a business account with a bank, they generally face formal obstacles. Although the first female city mayor in the history of the Dutch capital, Femke Halsema, has organized debates about the future of the Red Light District since the beginning of her term, activists complain that she treats sex workers as vulnerable victims of human trafficking, even though many of them see themselves more as tax-paying, conscious citizens fighting to ensure that their profession is no longer considered taboo.</p><p>But many conservative residents of Amsterdam city centre are asking for the red-light district to be removed from the city centre. \"How can this be?\" I ask Van Os. \"They've been there for 500 years!\" \"The Dutch practice the 'live and let live' principle, but that doesn't mean they are open to any type of lifestyle. Tourists smoking marijuana and having sex with prostitutes? Fine. But I have many friends for whom the information that someone uses a brothel service would be tantamount to severing contact with that person. And if they found out that their teenage son had been smoking marijuana, they would be outraged. This is the epitome of indifference: let others do what they want, but not me and not the people in my circle!\"</p><p>Dutch openness or tolerance would not be possible if it were not for the enormous internal social control. This is another element of the Dutch self-stereotype, since the ability to exert self-control was mentioned by the Dutch – next to tolerance and manners – in the aforementioned research from the 1970s.</p><h3></h3><br/><p>\"Be normal, that's crazy enough\" is a popular Dutch proverb. The appeal for normality and common sense probably appears most often in discussions on controversial topics, as evidenced, too, by the words of prime minister Mark Rutte when asked at the UN summit about the Black Pete issue: \"Come on, be normal.\"</p><p>\"Is Dutch tolerance just indifference and conformism?\" I ask James Kennedy. \"The average Dutchman is individualistic when it comes to defining his identity, no-one will tell him whether to go or not to go to church and how to spend his time. On the level of pragmatic action, even at work, he is a collectivist. He cooperates because he believes that this is the only way to achieve the goal. In everyday life, he is a conformist. He does what others do, when it's convenient.\" \"Doesn't this sound inconsistent?\" I press on. He replies with a laugh: \"Did I say that the Dutch appreciate consistency?\"</p><p><em>Translated from </em><a href=\"https://przekroj.pl/spoleczenstwo/tolerancja-na-procent-kamil-baluk\" target=\"_blank\"><em>the Polish</em></a><em> by </em><em>Karolina Sofulak</em></p><p><em>Reprinted with permission of <a href=\"https://przekroj.pl/en/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Przekrój</a>.

On the front of the case was a large circular face with hands, similar to a clock. On its side was some sort of handle or knob that could be used to wind the ancient computer.</p><p>The device was found in one big chunk that was later broken into 82 fragments. In 2005, researchers took CT scans of the fragments, <a href=\"https://bigthink.com/robby-berman/an-ancient-device-too-advanced-to-be-real-gives-up-its-secrets-at-last\" target=\"_blank\">revealing text that hadn't been read</a> since before the device landed itself at the bottom of the Aegean Sea.</p><p>Using that text—and a Greek philosopher's math theory—<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/518734183\" target=\"_blank\">the UCL team created a computer model</a> of the part of the Antikythera mechanism that depicts the cycles of the Sun, Moon, and planets.</p><p>\"Ours is the first model that conforms to all the physical evidence and matches the descriptions in the scientific inscriptions engraved on the mechanism itself,\" researcher Tony Freeth <a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2021/mar/experts-recreate-mechanical-cosmos-worlds-first-computer\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">said in a press release</a>. </p><p>\"The Sun, Moon, and planets are displayed in an impressive tour de force of ancient Greek brilliance.\"</p><h2>Piecing it together</h2><p>To create this new model, the UCL team focused on two numbers on the front of the Antikythera mechanism: 462 and 442.</p><p>That's how many Earth years it takes <a href=\"https://www.freethink.com/articles/surface-of-venus\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Venus</a> and <a href=\"https://www.freethink.com/articles/enceladus\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Saturn</a>, respectively, to complete one cycle across the sky—but how the creators of the ancient computer knew that information was a mystery.</p><p>\"The classic astronomy of the first millennium BC originated in Babylon,\" researcher Aris Dacanalis said, \"but nothing in this astronomy suggested how the ancient Greeks found the highly accurate 462-year cycle for Venus and 442-year cycle for Saturn.\"</p><p>Re-creating the cycles of those planets (and others) using this one device was further complicated by the fact that the ancient Greeks assumed the Earth—and not the sun—was at the center of the solar system.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media

It's just the players that change. In our times, the two top dogs are the United States and China. During the Cold War, it was the U.S. versus the Soviet Union. And in 1805, the year this cartoon was published, the main contenders were the British and the French.</p>\n<p><span></span>Across the top, the title reads: <em>The Plumb-pudding in danger: - or – State Epicures taking un Petit Souper</em>. The pudding is of course the earth itself, steaming on a plate between the two 'state epicures'. Seated opposite each other and armed with an oversized knife and fork each, they are carving into the pudding, eager to indulge their insatiable geopolitical appetite.</p>\n<p><span></span>On the left, we have William Pitt the Younger, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. On the right: Napoleon Bonaparte. No longer content to be called First Consul of France, Napoleon had only recently crowned himself Emperor. Both are wearing their 'work clothes', i.e. military uniforms. Pitt is dressed in the red coat typical for the British army of the time. Napoleon is wearing the blue coat of the Imperial French Army.</p>\n<p>And it's not just by these primary colours that the artist underlines their opposition. Pitt's hat is a tricorn, Napoleon's a bicorn (festooned with a cockerel-like plume in the French tricolor). And, perhaps most obviously, Pitt is tall and spindly, his French counterpart–true to the caricature already current at the time–short and stocky.</p>\n<p>What they're doing to that poor pudding between them is also rich in symbolism. Clearly visible at the center of the globe are the British Isles – obviously, the most important part of the globe, at least to the cartoon's British audience. <br /></p>\n<h3>Invade or reconcile</h3>\n<br><img class=\"rm-lazyloadable-image rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"d0c7cfe90f4099f4429d3e65cf576d19\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNTg3NzU5Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYxNzY1MjE1NX0.V_di9NufH74gJDbI3FKXaF4Wrs4ErnjABtTTIlzopRg/img.jpg?width=980\" height=\"2842\" id=\"cca54\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" width=\"3970\" /><p>Both Pitt and Napoleon are using a carving knife and fork to cut slices off the pudding. Pitt's fork is a trident, reminiscent of British sea power; Napoleon's knife resembles a sword, perhaps referring to French supremacy on land. Pitt is slicing off a big chunk of the ocean, while Napoleon is helping himself to continental Europe.</p><p><span></span>Napoleon's fork is sticking into a part of Europe labeled 'Hanover' – no doubt a reminder to the British audience that the French now occupied the ancestral home of the Hanoverian dynasty sitting on the British throne. Perhaps also to please his audience, the cartoonist shows Napoleon's piece as significantly smaller than Pitt's.</p><p><span></span>Pitt and Napoleon each have a golden plate in front of them to put their slice of the world on. Pitt's is emblazoned with the British Royal Coat of Arms, Napoleon's with the Imperial Crown. Pitt's chair shows a lion carrying the Cross of St George, the emblem of England. Napoleon's chair has an imperial eagle holding on to a Phrygian cap, the bonnet that came to symbolize the French revolution.</p><p>So, what's going on? The publication date, February 1805, marks a curious lull in the Napoleonic Wars (1803-15). A few months earlier, Napoleon had amassed a potential force for invading Britain in Boulogne-sur-Mer. But now he was making overtures for reconciliation with his enemy across the English Channel. <br /></p><h3>Spheres of influence</h3><br><img class=\"rm-lazyloadable-image rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"cc84991ac21f5cf85004a65afcdeb7d2\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNTg3NzU5OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY2NzM5MTk0Nn0.Fntcyp0TGr0MurjTE-cU7fPsVJFWX1fkDH5VczoeynE/img.jpg?width=980\" height=\"723\" id=\"6130e\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" width=\"1008\" /><p>As the cartoon suggested, peace with Britain would entail both parties establishing a sphere of influence: for Britain, the seas and its colonies (the map shows the West Indies but not Britain's recently lost North American possessions); for France, the European mainland. </p><p>As it turned out, both the invasion and the reconciliation fell through. Later that same year, Nelson would defeat a Franco-Spanish fleet at Trafalgar, establishing Britain's maritime dominance without having had to resort to political compromise with France.</p><p>For a while at least, Napoleon would continue his victorious streak on the mainland – meaning the cartoon was a prediction that came true. But in the end, Napoleon would be defeated – not once, but twice; at Waterloo in 1815 for the final time (see also #<a href=\"https://bigthink.com/strange-maps/napoleon-cannibal-majesty\" target=\"_blank\">1050</a>).</p><p><span></span>Sold in hand-colored prints, this is likely the most famous work by James Gillray (1756-1815), one of two contenders for the title of Britain's most influential caricaturist – the other being William Hogarth. Martin Rowson, cartoonist for the Guardian, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_cartoon#/media/File:Caricature_gillray_plumpudding.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">calls it</a> \"probably the most famous political cartoon of all time.\"</p><p>Interestingly, it's a thematic elaboration of one of Gillray's earlier cartoons.

It's part of an ambitious plan to build giant wind farms along the East Coast. There's currently only one offshore wind farm in the Eastern U.S., off Rhode Island (1).</span></p>\n<p><span></span><span>When those wind farms get built, you can bet there'll be Danish companies involved. In 1991, Denmark built Vindeby, the world's first offshore wind farm. In the years since, Danish companies have maintained their global lead.</span></p>\n<p>In February, the Danish government announced it would build the world's first 'Energy Island'. Everybody else in the world, take note: if the Danes pull this off, similar islands could soon pop up off your shores – perhaps also in the New York Bight.</p>\n<p>So, what's an Energy Island, and why does Denmark want one? For the answer, we spool back to June 2020, when a broad coalition of Danish parties, left and right, in government and opposition, concluded a Climate Agreement. This is Denmark's plan not only to make a radical break with fossil fuels but also to show the rest of the world how it's done. <br /></p>\n<h3>On the rise again</h3>\n<br><img class=\"rm-lazyloadable-image rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"36416a231d671bb9914068b59239c647\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNTg5MzcyMy9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY3Mzk0NDk1NX0.Eo0MJXW29jN09SWlZ6OUv3OFUa4VDVSr5P1xoLF_uQ4/img.png?width=980\" height=\"1400\" id=\"8a190\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" width=\"2000\" /><p>Due in large part to its pioneering work with wind energy, Denmark has a green image. But that hasn't always reflected reality. Yes, in 2019 the country generated 30 percent of its energy from renewable sources – earning it 9th place worldwide (2). But in 2018, Denmark also was the EU's leading oil producer (3).</p><p>Under the Climate Agreement, that will stop. Denmark will no longer explore and develop new oil and gas fields in its section of the North Sea. Extraction will be gradually reduced to zero. In exchange, Denmark will dramatically scale up the production of sustainable energy via offshore wind farms. The ultimate goal: nationwide carbon neutrality by 2050.</p><p>Offshore wind farms produce the bulk of Europe's sustainable energy. And after a dip in the first decade of the century, offshore wind farms are on the rise again (4). One reason for the increased popularity: taller turbines, which means larger blades, which means greater capacity.</p>\n <ul>\n  <li>In 2016, the tallest turbines were 540 ft (164 m) and had a capacity of 8 megawatts (MW).</li>\n  <li>In 2021, turbines can be up to 720 ft (220 m) tall, generating up to 12 MW. </li>\n  <li>Soon, the turbines will reach 820 ft (250 m) – not that much shorter than the Eiffel Tower (1,030 ft or 314 m, street to flagpole). These will have a capacity of up to 20 MW.</li>\n </ul><h3>Centralised management</h3><br /><img class=\"rm-lazyloadable-image rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"e393ecb4f3b5c521fc1fd133a37b383f\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNTg5MzcyOS9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYyMTQ0MTA1MH0.rY18UEI8iIfIqcmlfnvYs-UuWX62Nf_1YS-UWmLWcvQ/img.png?width=980\" height=\"1203\" id=\"9f0ef\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" width=\"1804\" /><p>As the shallow parts of the North Sea (&lt;66 ft; &lt;20 m) fill up with wind farms, the issue of managing the energy flow produced by these farms becomes acute. The obvious solution would be to build a central point where the energy is collected, converted from AC to DC and transmitted to one or more points onshore. Centralised management of the wind farms would mitigate the fluctuations in energy production and make it easier for supply to meet demand.</p><p>If supply is greater than demand, these collection points can also serve as storage units. Excess energy could be stored in batteries or transformed into hydrogen via electrolysis. If and when necessary, the hydrogen can then be transported onto land and reconverted into electricity.</p><p>The Dutch are thinking about it, and some have suggested the Dogger Bank as an ideal location: shallow and central within the North Sea, ideally placed to distribute energy to the various countries bordering the sea. But the Danes are doing it. The Climate Agreement envisaged not one, but two energy islands.</p><p>One would be Bornholm, Denmark's Baltic island, halfway between Sweden and Poland, which would serve as the hub for local offshore wind farms. But the other would be an entirely new, entirely artificial island in the North Sea, to be built about 50 miles (80 km) off Thorsminde, on the western coast of Jutland.</p><h3>10 million households</h3><br /><img class=\"rm-lazyloadable-image rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"463708ba9cffa1294b32dca8060754ff\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNTg5MzczMy9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY2Nzc2NTI0Nn0.q2yEFX_pOSzgOqjTZtUnMz5_dNBpo9xkTvW0p7DnuwU/img.png?width=980\" height=\"1434\" id=\"9efca\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" width=\"2685\" /><p>In February, the Danish government revealed how much this <em>Energi-Ø</em> would cost, how long it would take to build – and what it might look like.</p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Energy Island will be built via the caisson method – essentially, sinking a watertight box to the bottom of the sea. The island will be protected from storms by high seawalls on three sides. The fourth side will feature a dock for ships.</li>\n  <li>Construction could start in 2026 and is expected to take three years. Building the wind farms and transmission network will take a few years more. By 2033, it could be churning out its sustainable GWs.</li>\n  <li>In its initial phase, the island will have an area of about 12 hectares (30 acres, or about 18 soccer fields). It will centralize the production of about 200 offshore wind turbines, with a joint capacity of 3 GW. That's about the equivalent of 3 million households – slightly more than the total for Denmark. </li>\n  <li>When fully completed, the island will have an area of around 46 hectares (114 acres, just under 70 soccer fields), collect the energy of 600 turbines, for a total capacity of 10 GW (5). That covers 10 million households.</li>\n  <li>10 GW is equivalent to about 150 percent of Denmark's entire electricity needs (households, industry, infrastructure, etc.) That leaves plenty of scope for supplying neighbouring countries. Agreements have already been reached with Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium.</li>\n </ul><p>The plan also foresees a plant for hydrogen production on the island, either to be piped onshore, or stored and transported in large batteries. <br /></p><h3>Yet untested aspects</h3><br><img class=\"rm-lazyloadable-image rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"28c0675ce4ada413ce7e212ad02ee48c\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNTg5MzczNy9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYyMTM1MjgzM30.oNsasFWQWuTIToXy2SUq348EAsVZhV9GpLTEKqsGdGE/img.png?width=980\" height=\"851\" id=\"09288\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" width=\"1520\" /><p>In all, the island would cost DKK 210 billion (US$33 billion) to build – by far Denmark's largest construction project (6).<br /><br />The project will be undertaken in a public-private partnership between the Danish state and commercial interests. Because it is 'critical infrastructure', the state will retain a stake of at least 50.1 percent in the project. There are two scenarios for co-ownership:</p>\n  <ul>\n   <li>The island will be owned in its entirety by a company, in which the Danish state retains at least that smallest of majorities;</li>\n   <li>Private companies will be able to own up to 49.9 percent of the island itself.</li>\n  </ul><p>The Danish government needs private-sector input to overcome unknown and as yet untested aspects of the project, not just in terms of design and building an entire island from scratch, but also on how to operate and maintain it, and even when it comes to financing and risk management. </p><p>But where there's risk, there is potential. If the project is successful, it will become the blueprint for similar energy islands the world over – and the companies that helped build the first one, will be in high demand to build the other ones too, perhaps soon in Biden's 'Wind Energy Area'.</p><p>Green, as the Danes have discovered, is not just the color of nature. It's also the color of money.</p><p><strong>Strange Maps #1077</strong><br /><br /></p><p><em>Got a strange map?

These genes were predominantly \"housekeeping\" genes that handled basic cellular functions.</p><p>The second group were genes known to be involved in activities such as memory and thinking. They're also implicated in seizure events and are important in schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease research. These genes degraded rapidly once the test period began.</p><p>The third group, the \"zombie\" genes, were found in glial cells involved in inflammation during life. The activity of these genes was inversely proportional to the rapidly fading second group.

One of the most memorable moments in the movie comes near the end when the protagonist, Neo, finally understands the Matrix for the illusionary simulation that it is. Now, he can see the numbers underpinning everything. He can see the source code of the world.</p><p>With only the slightest of modifications, Neo's epiphany is no science fiction at all. This <em>is </em>how the world is made. But, where Neo saw green, floating numbers, we now know the universe is actually made up of tiny, imperceptible objects. Rather than code, we have atoms—the building blocks of everything there is, ever was, and ever will be.</p><p>We know atoms exist thanks to scientists and electron microscopes, but the idea goes much further back than that. It goes back to the ancient Greeks. Their output was prodigious. Almost every discipline you can study, the Greeks turned their minds to first. Pythagoras laid the foundation for math and geometry, Aristotle contemplated biology and physics, Plato thought about governance, Herodotus was a historian, and Hippocrates gave doctors his eponymous oath. But one of the most ingenious \"firsts\" must come with the atomists, like Democritus or Epicurus.</p><p>It's odd to think that millennia ago, a few bearded men in togas, strolling around a sun-bleached agora, used philosophy to establish the fundamental fabric of the universe.</p><p>Although the <em>idea</em> of \"the atom\" had been floating around the Peloponnese for a while, Democritus was the first to articulate it fully. He argued that atoms must exist because the alternative is sheer nonsense. If we could constantly divide or cut a thing into two then we would go on forever. We'd get smaller and smaller all the way to infinity, and there'd be no end point. But the universe can't be built without foundations. Nothing can come from nothing. So, there <em>must </em>be a fundamental unit to the world from which everything else is made, and for this, Democritus coined the term \"atom\" (which literally means uncuttable, although 20th Century scientists learned how to split one, rather ruining the definition).</p><p>The question now facing Democritus was how these basic, imperceptible atoms came to make the objects we all see, touch, and love. He noted how, when we look at the world around us, we can see it constantly changing, shifting, dying, and growing. The world flows. So atoms, which make up everything there is, must themselves be moving. They can't just be inert or still.</p><p>Democritus argued that atoms come together in various combinations, and then emit something called an \"<em>eidôla.</em>\" These composite blobs of atoms radiate <em>eidôla</em> outward, like ripples in water. The <em>eidôla</em> are then picked up by us as the subjective experiencer and we translate this atomic radiation into ideas or sensations.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n        <img alt=\"eidola democritus atom\" class=\"rm-lazyloadable-image rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"6a8d68a64ca1d8dbbb48c405e2aed08a\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNTg5MDIzNi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY2OTkxODg1MX0._yjJL_NzwkuPIe-CS3zgH3JByG3wQGIZx1lx2a_pRF0/img.jpg?width=980\" height=\"2062\" id=\"d1de5\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" width=\"4147\"/>\n        \n        \n        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Caption...\">Democritus thought that atoms emit an \"eidôla\" that we perceive as sensations.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\">Credit: Courtesy of Jonny Thomson</small></p><div style=\"display: none;\"><img alt=\"eidola democritus atom\" class=\"rm-lazyloadable-image rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"8f7ef1760a124f99d077a6f3e5e83151\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNTg5MDIzNi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY2OTkxODg1MX0._yjJL_NzwkuPIe-CS3zgH3JByG3wQGIZx1lx2a_pRF0/img.jpg?width=980\" height=\"2062\" id=\"d1de5\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" width=\"4147\"/></div><p>For example, let's imagine a group of atoms come together and, with a special wiggle, emit their <em>eidôla</em>. This flies through the space (or \"void,\" as Democritus called it) to our eyes. Our eyes then whizz this <em>eidôla</em> along to our understanding, where it's converted into \"blue\" or \"round\" or \"big.\"<br/></p><p>There were two big implications to Democritus' theory.</p><p>First, the world as we know it doesn't actually exist. Just like the code in the Matrix, the world is <em>really </em>just incomprehensible atoms. Our minds create \"reality\" out of these atoms, and everything is just an illusion we play on ourselves.</p><p>Second, the world is <em>entirely</em> made up of atoms. The tree outside, your pet turtle, your feeling of love, and even the mind that processes <em>eidôla</em> are all made up of atoms.</p><p>The upshot of this is that Democritus was one of the first \"determinists\" in that he thought there could be no free will or choice. We're all just marbles, bouncing around to the laws of physics.</p><p>We might think this a pretty depressing place to finish, yet Democritus was actually known as \"the laughing philosopher.\" He simply refused to take anything seriously. If reality was ultimately the invented story of our minds, and the universe was just physical laws, what's the point in getting wound up by things? Why stress about that email from your boss, or that mean thing a friend said when there's nothing we can do anyway? If the world is an illusion, and a boringly scripted one at that, why not laugh?</p><p>The first \"atomist,\" Democritus, of course got a lot wrong, but it's remarkable how much he got right. By reflecting on reality long enough, he came to conclusions that scientists proved millennia later. If nothing else, he offers a shining example of the power of contemplation.</p><p><em>Jonny Thomson teaches philosophy in Oxford.

The tunnels are what physicists call wormholes, strange funnel-like folds in the very fabric of spacetime that would be—if they exist—major shortcuts for interstellar travel. You can visualize it in two dimensions like this: Take a piece of paper and bend it in the middle so that it makes a U shape. If an imaginary flat little bug wants to go from one side to the other, it needs to slide along the paper. Or, if there were a bridge between the two sides of the paper the bug could go straight between them, a much shorter path. Since we live in three dimensions, the entrances to the wormholes would be more like spheres than holes, connected by a four-dimensional \"tube.\" It's much easier to write the equations than to visualize this! Amazingly, because the theory of general relativity links space and time into a four-dimensional spacetime, wormholes could, in principle, connect distant points in space, or in time, or both.</p><h3></h3><br/><img alt=\"A wormhole connecting two points in space.\\u200b\" class=\"rm-lazyloadable-image rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"681b20f2e4bbed5b4526f2fca9e80126\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNTg2ODg0MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1NjE4MzkyMn0.RZfqi2YX88_z7ziw-mHfzazIrANgJd96Mb83CXzX6PE/img.jpg?width=980\" height=\"1125\" id=\"1097a\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" width=\"2000\"/><p>The idea of wormholes is not new. Its origins reach back to 1935 (and even earlier), when Albert Einstein and Nathan Rosen published a paper constructing what became known as an <a href=\"https://www.space.com/20881-wormholes.html\" target=\"_blank\">Einstein-Rosen bridge</a>. (The name 'wormhole' came up later, in a 1957 paper by Charles Misner and John Wheeler, Wheeler also being the one who coined the term 'black hole.') Basically, an Einstein-Rosen bridge is a connection between two distant points of the universe or possibly even different universes through a tunnel that goes into a black hole. Exciting as the possibility is, the throats of such bridges are notoriously unstable and any object with mass that ventures through it would cause it to collapse upon itself almost immediately, closing the connection. To force the wormholes to stay open, one would need to add a kind of exotic matter that has both negative energy density and pressure—not something that is known in the universe. (Interestingly, negative pressure is not as crazy as it seems; dark energy, the fuel that is currently accelerating the cosmic expansion, does it exactly because it has negative pressure. But negative energy density is a whole other story.)</p><p><span></span>If wormholes exist, if they have wide mouths, and if they can be kept open (three big but not impossible ifs) then it's conceivable that we could travel through them to faraway spots in the universe. Arthur C. Clarke used them in \"2001: A Space Odyssey\", where the alien intelligences had constructed a network of intersecting tunnels they used as we use the subway. Carl Sagan used them in \"Contact\" so that humans could confirm the existence of intelligent ETs. \"Interstellar\" uses them so that we can try to find another home for our species.</p><h3></h3><br/><blockquote>If wormholes exist, if they have wide mouths, and if they can be kept open (three big but not impossible ifs) then it's conceivable that we could travel through them to faraway spots in the universe. </blockquote><h3></h3><br/><p>Two recent papers try to get around some of these issues. <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07317\" target=\"_blank\">Jose Luis Blázquez-Salcedo, Christian Knoll, and Eugen Radu</a> use normal matter with electric charge to stabilize the wormhole, but the resulting throat is still of submicroscopic width, so not useful for human travel. It is also hard to justify net electric charges in black hole solutions as they tend to get neutralized by surrounding matter, similar to how we get shocked with static electricity in dry weather. <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06618.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Juan Maldacena and Alexey Milekhin's paper</a> is titled 'Humanly Traversable Wormholes', thus raising the stakes right off the bat. However, they are open to admitting that \"in this paper, we revisit the question [of humanly traversable wormholes] and we engage in some 'science fiction.'\" The first ingredient is the existence of some kind of matter (the \"dark sector\") that only interacts with normal matter (stars, us, frogs) through gravity. Another point is that to support the passage of human-size travelers, the model needs to exist in five dimensions, thus one extra space dimension. When all is set up, the wormhole connects two black holes with a magnetic field running through it. And the whole thing needs to spin to keep it stable, and completely isolated from particles that may fall into it compromising its design. Oh yes, and extremely low temperature as well, even better at absolute zero, an unattainable limit in practice.</p>\n<p>Maldacena and Milekhins' paper is an amazing tour through the power of speculative theoretical physics. They are the first to admit that the object they construct is very implausible and have no idea how it could be formed in nature. In their defense, pushing the limits (or beyond the limits) of understanding is what we need to expand the frontiers of knowledge. For those who dream of humanly traversable wormholes, let's hope that more realistic solutions would become viable in the future, even if not the near future. Or maybe aliens that have built them will tell us how.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/Efe_droyVZI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 24 Mar 2021 20:02:07 +0000","feedId":32,"bgimg":"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNTg2ODg2NS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzNDc4MzA0Nn0.nWd8Uv3EZr0qaMB7WQxbEz46671ho_1yRJ3ME_5Cuak/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0&height=700","linkMd5":"0fa289c521e0004a104c3183636cd237","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn68@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-49-17-007_fa6c4041bd366257.webp","destWidth":1245,"destHeight":700,"sourceBytes":96724,"destBytes":96724,"author":"Marcelo Gleiser","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNTg2ODg2NS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzNDc4MzA0Nn0.nWd8Uv3EZr0qaMB7WQxbEz46671ho_1yRJ3ME_5Cuak/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0&height=700":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn68@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-49-17-007_fa6c4041bd366257.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/bigthink/main/~4/Efe_droyVZI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn63@2020_4/2021/04/03/04-50-10-523_6dfc0e3c01343854.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425356643},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:16","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:49:16","title":"New surgery may help amputees control muscles and sense their 'phantom limb'","link":"https://bigthink.com/surprising-science/phantom-limb","description":"<img src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNTg4MzIwMy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY2MDMxNzEwOX0._wlm5CZJUUS3IB82cK1O9U2kPWDsp5QeroA1reyMsAU/img.jpg?width=1245&coordinates=0%2C25%2C0%2C68&height=700\"/><br/><br/>MIT researchers have invented a new type of amputation surgery that can help amputees to better control their residual muscles and sense where their \"phantom limb\" is in space.<hr/><p> This restored sense of proprioception should translate to better control of prosthetic limbs, as well as a reduction of limb pain, the researchers say.</p><p>In most amputations, muscle pairs that control the affected joints, such as elbows or ankles, are severed. However, the MIT team has found that reconnecting these muscle pairs, allowing them to retain their normal push-pull relationship, offers people much better sensory feedback.</p><p>\"Both our study and previous studies show that the better patients can dynamically move their muscles, the more control they're going to have. The better a person can actuate muscles that move their phantom ankle, for example, the better they're actually able to use their prostheses,\" says Shriya Srinivasan, an MIT postdoc and lead author of the study.</p><p>In a study that will appear this week in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>, 15 patients who received this new type of surgery, known as agonist-antagonist myoneural interface (AMI), could control their muscles more precisely than patients with traditional amputations. The AMI patients also reported feeling more freedom of movement and less pain in their affected limb.</p><p>\"Through surgical and regenerative techniques that restore natural agonist-antagonist muscle movements, our study shows that persons with an AMI amputation experience a greater phantom joint range of motion, a reduced level of pain, and an increased fidelity of prosthetic limb controllability,\" says Hugh Herr, a professor of media arts and sciences, head of the Biomechatronics group in the Media Lab, and the senior author of the paper.</p><p>Other authors of the paper include Samantha Gutierrez-Arango and Erica Israel, senior research support associates at the Media Lab; Ashley Chia-En Teng, an MIT undergraduate; Hyungeun Song, a graduate student in the Harvard-MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology; Zachary Bailey, a former visiting researcher at the Media Lab; Matthew Carty, a visiting scientist at the Media Lab; and Lisa Freed, a Media Lab research scientist.</p><h3></h3><br/><h3>Restoring sensation</h3><p>Most muscles that control limb movement occur in pairs that alternately stretch and contract. One example of these agonist-antagonist pairs is the biceps and triceps. When you bend your elbow, the biceps muscle contracts, causing the triceps to stretch, and that stretch sends sensory information back to the brain.</p><p>During a conventional limb amputation, these muscle movements are restricted, cutting off this sensory feedback and making it much harder for amputees to feel where their prosthetic limbs are in space or to sense forces applied to those limbs.</p><p>\"When one muscle contracts, the other one doesn't have its antagonist activity, so the brain gets confusing signals,\" says Srinivasan, a former member of the Biomechatronics group now working at MIT's Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research. \"Even with state-of-the-art prostheses, people are constantly visually following the prosthesis to try to calibrate their brains to where the device is moving.\"</p><p>A few years ago, the MIT Biomechatronics group invented and scientifically developed in <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28211795/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">preclinical studies</a> a new amputation technique that maintains the relationships between those muscle pairs. Instead of severing each muscle, they connect the two ends of the muscles so that they still dynamically communicate with each other within the residual limb. In a 2017 <a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2017/making-prosthetic-limbs-feel-more-natural-0531\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">study of rats</a>, they showed that when the animals contracted one muscle of the pair, the other muscle would stretch and send sensory information back to the brain.</p><p>Since these preclinical studies, about 25 people have undergone the AMI procedure at Brigham and Women's Hospital, performed by Carty, a surgeon in the Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at Brigham and Women's Hospital. In the new <em>PNAS</em> study, the researchers measured the precision of muscle movements in the ankle and subtalar joints of 15 patients who had AMI amputations performed below the knee. These patients had two sets of muscles reconnected during their amputation: the muscles that control the ankle, and those that control the subtalar joint, which allows the sole of the foot to tilt inward or outward. The study compared these patients to seven people who had traditional amputations below the knee.</p><p>Each patient was evaluated while lying down with their legs propped on a foam pillow, allowing their feet to extend into the air. Patients did not wear prosthetic limbs during the study. The researchers asked them to flex their ankle joints — both the intact one and the \"phantom\" one — by 25, 50, 75, or 100 percent of their full range of motion. Electrodes attached to each leg allowed the researchers to measure the activity of specific muscles as each movement was performed repeatedly.</p><p>The researchers compared the electrical signals coming from the muscles in the amputated limb with those from the intact limb and found that for AMI patients, they were very similar. They also found that patients with the AMI amputation were able to control the muscles of their amputated limb much more precisely than the patients with traditional amputations. Patients with traditional amputations were more likely to perform the same movement over and over in their amputated limb, regardless of how far they were asked to flex their ankle.</p><p>\"The AMI patients' ability to control these muscles was a lot more intuitive than those with typical amputations, which largely had to do with the way their brain was processing how the phantom limb was moving,\" Srinivasan says.</p><p>In a <a href=\"https://stm.sciencemag.org/content/12/573/eabc5926.abstract?casa_token=igvz149hBeUAAAAA:w9ExpmsNMbA9FQBSxcdl8FcTMaINNg6QLU3qo2qxGpfAdNZRMpRmQC_DHzydEjfIHs16KET4J2ze\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">paper</a> that recently appeared in <em>Science Translational Medicine</em>, the researchers reported that brain scans of the AMI amputees showed that they were getting more sensory feedback from their residual muscles than patients with traditional amputations. In work that is now ongoing, the researchers are measuring whether this ability translates to better control of a prosthetic leg while walking.</p><h3></h3><br/><h3>Freedom of movement</h3><p>The researchers also discovered an effect they did not anticipate: AMI patients reported much less pain and a greater sensation of freedom of movement in their amputated limbs.</p><p>\"Our study wasn't specifically designed to achieve this, but it was a sentiment our subjects expressed over and over again. They had a much greater sensation of what their foot actually felt like and how it was moving in space,\" Srinivasan says. \"It became increasingly apparent that restoring the muscles to their normal physiology had benefits not only for prosthetic control, but also for their day-to-day mental well-being.\"</p><p>The research team has also developed a modified version of the surgery that can be performed on people who have already had a traditional amputation. This process, which they call \"regenerative AMI,\" involves grafting small muscle segments to serve as the agonist and antagonist muscles for an amputated joint. They are also working on developing the AMI procedure for other types of amputations, including <a href=\"https://journals.lww.com/annalsofsurgery/Citation/9000/Agonist_Antagonist_Myoneural_Interfaces_in.93809.aspx\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">above the knee</a> and above and below the elbow.</p><p>\"We're learning that this technique of rewiring the limb, and using spare parts to reconstruct that limb, is working, and it's applicable to various parts of the body,\" Herr says.</p><p>The research was funded by the MIT Media Lab Consortia; the National Institutes of Health's National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research; and the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs of the U.S. Department of Defense.</p><p>Reprinted with permission of <a href=\"http://news.mit.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">MIT News</a>.

All 12 children involved <a href=\"https://bigthink.com/politics-current-affairs/anti-vaxx\" target=\"_self\">were handpicked</a>, which is antithetical to clinical research. The now-deregistered physician falsified results. Wakefield used microscopic-level stains to make his case; a more reliable molecular method found no evidence of a link between vaccines and autism.</p><p>Add to this the fact that parents of study subjects, some with their own agendas (such as litigation), kept changing the timeline of their child's conditions. During all this time when Wakefield was raging against the vaccine, he filed for two patents on single measles shots. It was a money play from day one. </p><p>Twenty-three years later, the vaccine-autism myth remains in circulation despite decades of contrary evidence. Six years after the study was published, 10 of the 13 authors of their paper <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC381161/\" target=\"_blank\">retracted their findings</a>. It took <em>The Lancet</em> a few more years; in 2010 the publication finally <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2831678/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">retracted the paper</a>. Journalist Brian Deer <a href=\"https://jhupbooks.press.jhu.edu/title/doctor-who-fooled-world\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">documented Wakefield's scam</a> for years. Still, the lie persists. </p>Science's <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/12/13/the-truth-wears-off\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">replication crisis</a> is well-known. But the research community is suffering from another serious problem, one ill-fated for the social media age: the retraction crisis.<h3>Will America’s disregard for science be the end of its reign? | Big Think</h3><br/><span class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"b9ffd5b853019c2a13ab262efb5a8243\" style=\"display:block;position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"auto\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/S58vlJwhwDw?rel=0\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></span><p>As science journalist (and former marine biologist) Fanni Daniella Szakal <a href=\"https://massivesci.com/articles/science-retractions-publications-mistakes-month/\" target=\"_blank\">recently pointed out</a>, retracted papers are still being cited and used as gospel even when—sometimes it seems<em> especially when</em>—data are intentionally fabricated. Currently, roughly <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/362/6413/390\" target=\"_blank\">four retractions occur per 10,000 publications</a>, with the <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0044118\" target=\"_blank\">highest percentages</a> being in medicine, life sciences, and chemistry journals.</p><p>That overall number might not seem high yet those retracted studies have an outsized influence.

The researchers relied on a combination of big data and AI to replace randomized controlled clinical trials, leading to false results.

We can't possibly expect every paper to get it right, but unfortunately, we also have to factor in biased researchers pushing forward their agendas. While the publication of such research is troublesome, Szakal takes particular issue with the authors and publications that continue to cite them after they've been retracted.</p><p>More than just a critique, however, Szakal suggests a path forward. </p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\"In each and every publication, author guidelines should include that the author is needed to check all citations for possible retractions. Today numerous citation software are available to do this with ease; such as Zotero, scite.ai, and RedacTek alert users for any retracted papers in the reference list. As well as more care from authors, preventing post-retraction citations is a responsibility of publishers too. Along with double-checking the reference list of papers to be published, they should also make sure that retraction notices appear on all platforms where the study is available.\"</p><p>The past year has proven how dangerous scientific misinformation (and, even more disturbingly, disinformation) is to public health measures. The frantic urgency of social media platforms and the speed with which we consume headlines without reading articles makes teaching good science even more daunting. At the very least, we need the gatekeepers to take more responsibility for their publication process. Being the first to break bad science is way more socially damaging than being the tenth to publish science worth repeating.</p><p>--</p><p><em>Stay in touch with Derek on <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/derekberes\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DerekBeresdotcom\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a>.

Given their proximity to funerary grounds, they might have served a ritual purpose or merely marked where the dead were buried. They might have housed cremated remains. A more pragmatic purpose has been put forward: to collect monsoon rainwater. </p><p>The Plain of Jars, as this network is known, was heavily bombed by the United States Air Force in the 1960s. In fact, the USAF dropped more bombs on Laos (specifically, these jar sites) than in the entirety of World War II—a total of 262 million cluster bombs.

It's also an organ that affects our thinking, feelings, perception and identity.</p><hr/><p>The human heart is usually the size of one's fist, sometimes a little larger.</p><p>It's made of two parts – the left and the right – that are not directly connected to one another. This is why sometimes they are called the left heart and the right heart.</p><p>The right heart pumps blood to the lungs. Then, oxygen-rich blood travels to the left heart.</p><p>The left heart pumps blood to the entire body, which is why it's a little larger than the right one.</p><p>Then blood comes back to the right heart, which pumps it into the lungs again.</p><p><br/></p><h3></h3><br/><p>The heart has its own automatism, meaning that it can work without being managed by the brain. It controls its contractions itself.</p><p>Cardiac contractions are induced by the electrical conduction system of the heart. This system is independent of the nervous system, which can only slow the contractions down or speed them up.</p><p>The cells of the electrical conduction system are capable of generating cyclical electric impulses. Those electrical impulses originate in the wall of the right atrium, in the sinus node of the heart, and from there, they travel to other cells in the system.</p><p>The electrical activity of the heart is measured during an ECG.</p><p>In a very simplified way, the heart's work can be divided into two phases: systole, when it contracts to pump the blood, and diastole, when the heart relaxes and fills with blood.</p><p>The sounds of the typical healthy heart resemble the syllables 'lub' and 'dub'. The first opens the contraction sequence and the latter closes it.</p><p>During contraction, pain is felt less acutely, and our reflexes and perception are numbed. According to the results of experiments carried out by Sarah Garfinkel from Brighton and Sussex Medical School, tiny stimuli (such as pinpricks) could go unnoticed.</p><h3></h3><br/><p>Awareness of one's own heartbeat has some positive effects. People who can feel their own heartbeat are more intuitive and better at estimating risks accurately. Research by the British scientists Narayanan Kandasamy, Sarah Garfinkel and Lionel Page suggests that such people make better stockbrokers.</p><p>Meanwhile, people who cannot clearly feel their heartbeat are less apt at reading the emotions of others, following research by Oxford neurobiologist Geoff Bird.</p><p>The rhythm of the heart's systole and diastole cycle leaves its mark on our cerebral activity, the so-called heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP) – the brain's electrical activity that is synchronized with our heartbeat.</p><p>The stronger the HEP, the clearer we can register our heartbeat.</p><p>Various experiments have shown that people with strong HEP are better at noticing visual details. According to the results of Catherine Tallon-Baudry's experiments at the French Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, these people are also more consistent and confident in their decision making.</p><p>Some scientists – including Olaf Blanke and Hyeongdong Park from the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne – claim that the HEP phenomenon is key to our identity building. They even say that the rhythm of our heartbeat gives us a sense of the continuity of the self.</p><p>It's also worth mentioning that HEP can be improved with the right training.</p><p>The human heart beats an average of 70 times per minute. Each time, it expels about 72 millilitres of blood. This makes for about 100,000 heartbeats and over 7200 litres of blood pushed through the heart each day.</p><p>During the average 78 years of the human lifespan, the heart beats 2.8 billion times, pumping 200 million litres of blood, an amount equal to 60 Olympic-sized swimming pools.</p><h3></h3><br/><p>During physical exertion, the heartbeat rate is raised, but regular exercise lowers our blood pressure because the heart – like any other muscle – can be strengthened and made more efficient.</p><p>Sometimes it is claimed that every person has a finite number of heartbeats to use up in their lifetime. This is not true – the equation is not so simple. But it is true that those with a slower heartbeat tend to live longer.</p><p>As for animals, the ones with a slower pulse (such as whales – 20 heartbeats per minute) tend to live longer than those with fast-beating hearts (such as hamsters – 450 beats per minute).</p><p><em>Translated from <a href=\"https://przekroj.pl/nauka/glos-serca-lukasz-kaniewski\" target=\"_blank\">the Polish</a> by Aga Zano</em></p><p><em>Reprinted with permission of <a href=\"https://przekroj.pl/en/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Przekrój</a>.

'I need to <em>talk</em> to my patients,' she said, 'and give them time to ask questions.\" <hr/><p>\"Some of them are foreign-born and struggle with the language, and all of them are in distress! But I hardly have the time to explain the essentials to them. There's all the paperwork, and we're constantly understaffed.'</p><p>Such grievances have become sadly familiar – not only in medicine, but also in education and care-work. Even in more commercial environments, you're liable to hear similar objections: the engineer who wants to deliver quality but is told to focus on efficiency only; the gardener who wants to give the plants time to grow, but is told to focus on speed. The imperatives of productivity, profitability and the market rule.</p><p>Complaints come from the other side of the table as well. As patients and students, we want to be treated with care and responsibility, rather than as mere numbers. Wasn't there a time when professionals still knew how to serve us – a cosy, well-ordered world of responsible doctors, wise teachers and caring nurses? In this world, bakers still cared about the quality of their bread, and builders were proud of their constructions. One could trust these professionals; they knew what they were doing and were reliable guardians of their knowledge. Because people poured their souls into it, work was still meaningful – or was it?</p><p>In the grip of nostalgia, it's easy to overlook the dark sides of this old vocational model. On top of the fact that professional jobs were structured around hierarchies of gender and race, laypeople were expected to obey expert judgment without even asking questions. Deference to authority was the norm, and there were few ways of holding professionals to account. In Germany, for example, doctors were colloquially called 'demigods in white' because of their status vis-à-vis patients and other staff members. This is not exactly how we might think that citizens of democratic societies should relate to one other now.</p><h3></h3><br/><p>Against this backdrop, the call for more autonomy, for more 'choice', seems hard to resist. This is precisely what happened with the rise of neoliberalism after the 1970s, when the advocates of 'New Public Management' promoted the idea that hard-nosed market thinking should be used to structure healthcare, education and other areas that typically belonged to the slow and complicated world of public red tape. In this way, neoliberalism undermined not only public institutions but the very idea of <a href=\"https://www.nomos-elibrary.de/10.5771/0340-0425-2018-2-189/markt-oder-profession-die-politik-zweier-wissenslogiken-jahrgang-46-2018-heft-2\" target=\"_blank\">professionalism</a>.</p><p>This attack was the culmination of two powerful agendas. The first was an economic argument about the alleged inefficiency of public services or the other non-market structures in which professional knowledge was hosted. Long queues, no choice, no competition, no exit options – that's the chorus that critics of public healthcare systems repeat to this day. The second was an argument about autonomy, about equal status, about liberation – 'Think for yourself!' instead of relying on experts. The advent of the internet seemed to offer perfect conditions for finding information and comparing offers: in short, for acting like a fully informed customer. These two imperatives – the economic and the individualistic – meshed extremely well under neoliberalism. The shift from addressing the needs of <em>citizens</em> to serving the demands of <em>customers</em> or <em>consumers</em> was complete.</p><p>We are all customers now; we are all supposed to be kings. But what if 'being a customer' is the wrong model for healthcare, education, and even highly specialised crafts and trades?</p><h3></h3><br/><p>What the market-based model overlooks is hyperspecialisation, as the philosopher Elijah Millgram argues in <em>The Great Endarkenment</em> (2015). We depend on other people's knowledge and expertise, because we can learn and study only so many things in our lifetimes. Whenever specialist knowledge is at stake, we are the opposite of a well-informed customer. Often we don't <em>want</em> to have to do our own research, which would be patchy at best; sometimes, we are simply unable to do it, even if we tried. It's much more efficient (yes, efficient!) if we can trust those already in the know.</p><p>But it can be hard to trust professionals forced to work in neoliberal regimes. As the political scientist Wendy Brown argued in <em>Undoing the Demos</em> (2015), market logic turns everything, including one's own life, into a question of portfolio management: a series of projects in which you try to maximise the return on investment. By contrast, responsible professionalism imagines work-life as a series of relationships with individuals who are entrusted to you, along with the ethical standards and commitments you uphold as a member of a professional community. But marketisation threatens this collegiality, by introducing competitiveness among workers and undermining the trust that's needed to do a good job.</p><p>Is there a way out of this conundrum? Could professionalism be revived? If so, can we avoid its old problems of hierarchy while preserving space for equality and autonomy?</p><p>There are some promising proposals and real-life examples of such a revival. In his account of 'civic professionalism', <em>Work and Integrity</em> (2nd ed, 2004), the American education scholar William Sullivan argued that professionals need to be aware of the moral dimensions of their role. They need to be 'experts and citizens alike', and 'learn to think and act cooperatively with us', the non-experts. Similarly, the political theorist Albert Dzur argued in <em>Democratic Professionalism</em> (2008) for a revival of a more self-aware version of 'old' professionalism – one committed to democratic values, and an ongoing dialogue with laypeople. Dzur describes, for example, how experts in the field of bioethics have opened up their discussions to non-experts, reacting to public criticisms, and finding formats for bringing doctors, ethics consultants and laypeople into conversation.</p><h3></h3><br/><p>Similar practices could be introduced in many other professions – as well as areas not traditionally understood as specialist vocations, but in which decisionmakers need to draw on highly specialised knowledge. Ideally, this could lead to trust in professionals being not <em>blind</em>, but <em>justified</em>: a trust based on a grasp of the institutional frameworks that hold them accountable, and on an awareness of mechanisms for double-checking and getting additional opinions within the profession.</p><p>But in many areas, the pressures of markets or quasi-markets prevail. This leaves our front-line professionals in a difficult spot, as Bernardo Zacka describes in <em>When the State Meets the Street</em> (2017): they are overworked, exhausted, pulled in different directions, and unsure about the whole point of their job. Highly motivated individuals, such as the young doctor I mentioned at the outset, are likely to leave the fields in which they could contribute most. Perhaps this is a price worth paying if it brings huge benefits elsewhere. But that doesn't seem to be happening, and it makes all of us non-experts vulnerable, too. We cannot be informed customers because we know too little – but we can't rely on being simply citizens any longer, either.</p><p>Up to a point, professionalisation is built on the persistence of ignorance: specialised knowledge is a form of power, and a form that's rather difficult to control. Yet it's clear that markets and quasi-markets are flawed strategies for dealing with this problem. By continuing to accept them as the only possible models, we forgo the opportunity to imagine and explore alternatives. We must be able to rely on other people's expertise. And for that, as the political philosopher Onora O'Neill <a href=\"http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rmhttp/radio4/transcripts/20020403_reith.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">argued</a> in her 2002 Reith Lectures, we must be able to trust them.</p><p>The young doctor I interviewed had long considered leaving her job – so when the opportunity to get a research-based position came up, she jumped ship. 'The system was forcing me to act against my own best judgment, again and again,' she said. 'It was the opposite of what I thought being a doctor was all about.' Now is the time to help reimagine a system in which she can recover that sense of purpose, to everyone's benefit.<img alt=\"Aeon counter – do not remove\" src=\"https://metrics.aeon.co/count/762c9a35-2314-40db-ae4c-edb5055426b0.gif\"/></p><p>Lisa Herzog</p><p>This article was originally published at <a href=\"https://aeon.co/?utm_campaign=republished-article\" target=\"_blank\">Aeon</a> and has been republished under Creative Commons.

The paper outlines a series of strategies that are either currently being practiced, could be practiced in conjunction with other astronomical projects, or could be developed in the near future.</p><p>A few of those strategies include searching for:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://bigthink.com/surprising-science/dyson-spheres\" target=\"_self\">Dyson spheres</a> — gigantic structures that, in theory, could orbit stars and generate vast amounts of energy for civilizations.</li><li>Near-Earth objects — space agencies could search the Moon, Mars or other space bodies for evidence of extraterrestrial artifacts, such as crashed probes.</li><li>Abnormal spectra in planetary atmospheres — if aliens are conducting industrial activity on another planet, that planet's atmosphere would likely contain evidence of such activity.</li><li>Night-time illumination</li><li>Radio and laser signals</li></ul><p>When thinking about the best ways to search for alien life, it helps to reverse the perspective: How would aliens know humans exist? With this question in mind, researchers who deal with technosignatures consider all of the signals humans are sending into space.</p><p>Some of our technosignatures are transmitted intentionally, like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecibo_message\" target=\"_blank\">the Arecibo message</a> humans sent toward the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Globular_Cluster_in_Hercules\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">globular star cluster M13</a> in 1974. Others are unintentional, like night-time illumination and pollution-driven atmospheric changes.</p><h3>The 'ichnoscale'</h3><br/><p>To put the concept of technosignatures into perspective, researchers have developed a framework called ichnoscale. Ichnoscale ranks the size of a technosignature relative to what human technology is currently capable of producing.</p><p>The scale also ranks the number of potential targets throughout the Universe. For example, searching for a crashed alien probe on the Moon would represent one target, while scanning the stars for Dyson spheres would have millions of targets.</p><p>Together, these measurements help scientists estimate the most likely ways to discover evidence of alien civilizations. Of course, there's no guarantee that any one strategy will work, or that aliens even exist.</p><p>That's one reason why efforts to search for technosignatures have received little funding. But the researchers propose that many of these strategies could be tacked onto other astronomical missions at little cost.</p><h3></h3><br/><img class=\"rm-lazyloadable-image rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"5dc3e87a6a4585272cc1919a2dfa21b7\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNTg3Nzk3NC9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY2ODIxODAzMX0.1ONurmJlFMnJECdUMhY0uU4D1bkAO9Y4H3w7PQ0BNwk/img.png?width=980\" height=\"976\" id=\"9699f\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" width=\"1342\"/><p>And even if the searches turn up nothing, the researchers said the results would still provide \"enormous ancillary benefits on solar system research and advance our knowledge about the objects being scrutinized,\" and would \"establish quantitative upper bounds on certain types of technologies or developmental stages of civilizations in the solar neighborhood.\"</p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\"The search for TS deals with questions that have profound implications on the future of humanity,\" the researchers concluded. \"Perhaps one the most important is whether technological civilizations are ephemeral or, on the contrary, can be long lasting.

The first step in the process of converting the information in a gene to a protein product is to transcribe (\"photocopy\") the gene into a molecule known as messenger RNA (mRNA). The trouble with mRNA in higher organisms is that it is riddled with garbage sequences, known as \"introns,\" that need to be removed. The protein-encoding sequences, known as \"exons,\" are then strung together. The process of removing introns from mRNA for the purpose of stringing together exons is called splicing. When the splicing process is complete, the mature mRNA is translated to protein.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n        <img alt=\"sp\" class=\"rm-lazyloadable-image rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"59ee9316858e8445da82f8cc551a8f2b\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNTg5MTAyOC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1NjA1MjA2MX0.GXnIxjxzdTkUBrnU3XyxPnICrHhO67omD7G3WKE6xKg/img.jpg?width=980\" height=\"516\" id=\"0697f\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" width=\"727\"/>\n        \n        \n        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Caption...\">In plants and animals, mRNA \"splicing\" removes the introns and strings together the exons. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\">Credit: Genomics Education Programme <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/genomicseducation/13063038314\" target=\"_blank\">via Flickr</a></small></p><div style=\"display: none;\"><img alt=\"sp\" class=\"rm-lazyloadable-image rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"76f6bed4492f87b08701b6e8e39a95e1\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNTg5MTAyOC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1NjA1MjA2MX0.GXnIxjxzdTkUBrnU3XyxPnICrHhO67omD7G3WKE6xKg/img.jpg?width=980\" height=\"516\" id=\"0697f\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" width=\"727\"/></div><p>As with all biological processes, splicing can go wrong. Typically, splicing occurs only at the ends of exons, so that the end of one exon is spliced to the beginning of the subsequent exon. In progeria, something very strange happens. The G to C point mutation mentioned above occurs in a gene called <em>LMNA</em> and reveals a cryptic splicing site in an inappropriate location. The outcome is the removal of a crucial exon (see \"exon 11\" in the figure below), which results in a deformed protein called progerin. (The normal protein, which contains exon 11, is called Lamin A.)<br/></p><p><br/></p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n        <img alt=\"progeria progerin lamin A \" class=\"rm-lazyloadable-image rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"38b33f3c38dce7f8d6d00b9cd0e89b77\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNTg4MzQzOC9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY2Njk2MzEzMH0.Qy0ixPkrdBmWCGWAcj8X16HsnOXnGT53I1wfLK9yAHw/img.png?width=980\" height=\"546\" id=\"4df2d\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" width=\"998\"/>\n        \n        \n        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Caption...\">A mutation in a gene called LMNA results in inappropriate mRNA splicing.

The results are reported in <em><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01274-0\" target=\"_blank\">Nature Medicine</a></em>. </p><h2>Treating progeria</h2><p>Existing treatments are not ideal, as they both have serious side effects. The drug lonafarnib causes gastrointestinal problems, and the drug everolimus causes immunosuppression. A more targeted approach, therefore, is needed.</p><p>Erdos and his colleagues have identified a potential candidate, which comes from a class of drugs called \"antisense peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers\" (PPMOs). Essentially, it's a molecule similar to DNA or RNA with a tiny protein attached. The PPMO can be designed to recognize a very specific mRNA sequence, and in this case, it can be engineered to recognize and bind to the cryptic splice site next to exon 11. This physically blocks the cell from inappropriately splicing out exon 11 and allows it to produce a normal version of the protein (Lamin A).<br/></p><p>Using mice that were genetically modified to mimic progeria, the researchers showed that their PPMO drug helped prevent the onset of progeria symptoms and extended the lives of the mice by nearly 62%.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n        <img alt=\"mice progeria antisense ppmo\" class=\"rm-lazyloadable-image rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"914e5fdb28b3000547e47b6981dcb32e\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNTg4MzQ2OC9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzMzkyOTEyOX0.VZnQpNh28SHGvGOXtEFZYz652eaaIjQo4WJX-mkkEjo/img.png?width=980\" height=\"470\" id=\"e20d5\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" width=\"1448\"/>\n        \n        \n        <small class=\"image-media media-caption\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Caption...\">Treatment of mice genetically modified to mimic progeria helped prevent symptom onset.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\">Credit: Michael R.

Examples range in size from the New York landmark of <em>Agloe</em>, a tiny map trap that accidentally became real (see #<a href=\"https://bigthink.com/strange-maps/643-agloe-the-paper-town-stronger-than-fiction\" target=\"_blank\">643</a>) to the huge country of <em>Pakistan</em>, one man's dream turned into a home for millions (see #<a href=\"https://bigthink.com/strange-maps/647-purist-among-the-pure-the-forgotten-inventor-of-pakistan\" target=\"_blank\">647</a>).</p>\n<p>For an example at the intersection of lyrical and whimsical, book a stay at <em>Heartbreak Hotel</em>. It's in Memphis, right across from Elvis Presley's Graceland mansion. The King of Rock 'n Roll had a hit with that title back in 1956. Today, as in the song, you'll find the hotel down at the end of <em>Lonely Street</em>. <br /></p>\n<h3>Brightly-colored bridges</h3>\n<br><img class=\"rm-lazyloadable-image rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"005f95375654b439d4ca4a984e79b33f\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNTg2NzE4Mi9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY3NDUxNzQ2OX0.MozsLMxLfkaHE9hnal_uHkSkp_WdH-XQcqAw2FVM1NU/img.png?width=980\" height=\"1243\" id=\"5a47f\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" width=\"1627\" /><p>And then there's the otherwise unassuming Dutch town of Spijkenisse, where you can take a walk across seven brightly-colored bridges which until recently only existed on banknotes.</p><p>You might recognize those bridges. If you've ever handled euro notes, you'll have seen them on the reverse of each of the seven denominations. Those bridges, however, <em>are not real</em>. Unlike other currencies, which often double as patriotic pamphlets and/or tourist teasers, the euro notes do not feature real-life landmarks or real-dead Europeans.</p><p>That would have involved favoring some countries and leaving out others, and in a multinational endeavor like the pan-European currency, that was a definite no-no.</p><p>So, what to do? It's a problem that had to be solved relatively recently, as the euro is the youngest of the world's major currencies. The look of the euro notes can be traced back to a European Council meeting in Dublin on December 13, 1996, when the European Monetary Institute (the precursor of today's European Central Bank) announced the winner of its competition to design the euro notes. <br /></p><h3>44 contenders</h3><br><img class=\"rm-lazyloadable-image rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"035dae1bbc427c28285eb2266be1bee1\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNTg2NzE5NS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzODU2ODM2Nn0.Luz8lUgmVKVhmINbq4Obez8UNfHMGIcMuDcKso4Cr58/img.jpg?width=980\" height=\"3120\" id=\"fa7b9\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" width=\"4160\" /><p>The prize went to Robert Kalina, a designer with the National Bank of Austria. His 'Ages and Styles of Europe' was chosen from among 44 contenders. Mr Kalina had some form in the matter. All Austrian banknotes from 1982 onwards were by his hand, as were notes he later designed for Bosnia-Herzegovina, Azerbaijan, and Syria.</p><p><span></span>Mr Kalina's euro designs scrupulously avoided any allusion to particular people or places, referring merely to abstract, supra-national style periods. The obverse of each note shows a window and a doorway, symbolizing Europe's spirit of openness. Each reverse shows a bridge, exemplifying communication and cooperation, both between the countries of Europe and between Europe and the rest of the world.</p><p>The architectural style of each note progresses chronologically as the value of the denomination increases. Most also feature a color from the rainbow spectrum. <br /></p><h3>The Elements</h3><br><img class=\"rm-lazyloadable-image rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"dc8f4541e78eb0ccc1bfc80d4237ccf6\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNTg2NzIwMC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYyOTk4OTUxN30.htp--K1OCBp8xASxZ6w_ZrDIgCxuGvrq7umvKNsYpks/img.jpg?width=980\" height=\"3120\" id=\"a8738\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" width=\"3410\" />\n   <ul>\n    <li>€5: Classical (as this was to be the most widely used note, grey was chosen to mask the dirt)</li>\n    <li>€10: Romanesque (red)</li>\n    <li>€20: Gothic (blue)</li>\n    <li>€50: Renaissance (orange)</li>\n    <li>€100: Baroque and Rococo (green)</li>\n    <li>€200: 19th century Industrial (yellow)</li>\n    <li>€500: 20th century Modern (purple)</li>\n   </ul><span></span><p>These euro bridges would have remained fictional, were it not for Robin Stam. The Rotterdam-based artist got the idea of turning financial fiction into architectural fact in a pizza place, while fiddling with a euro note. \"Suddenly it struck me how amazing it would be if these fictional bridges came to life,\" he said.</p><p>Mr Stam found a willing partner for his idea in the city council of Spijkenisse, his hometown, a suburb of Rotterdam. The plan was to build seven euro bridges across a canal that almost entirely surrounds an area called <em>De Elementen</em> ('The Elements'). <br /></p><h3>Letter of approval</h3><br><img class=\"rm-lazyloadable-image rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"309ff802d625d7b8af64d90f9d5ab3d2\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNTg2NzIxNi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzOTIwMzU2MH0.t2rEc1-fh3pjQInANyomqNYJwJ4uvcTefS8oOj6fTDc/img.jpg?width=980\" height=\"3120\" id=\"b7fbe\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" width=\"4160\" /><p>But before he got started, Mr Stam felt he needed the blessing of the European Central Bank. The euro notes scrupulously avoid favoring one member state over the other, but Mr Stam's euro bridges would all be in one country – the Netherlands. Would the ECB mind? Mr Stam sent them a letter. But he needn't have feared: out of Frankfurt came a kind reply with an official letter of approval. \"Their main concern is counterfeiting. And you can't pay with a bridge,\" says the artist.</p><p>And so, 'The Bridges of Europe' got underway. Funded by the city and aided by local contractors, all seven bridges were installed between October 2011 and September 2013. They all preserve the color and shape of the 'originals'. All were made of concrete except the two most recent styles (€200 and €500 notes), which were made out of steel. In all the project cost around €1 million to complete. <br /></p><h3>\"Kitschy facade\"</h3><br><img class=\"rm-lazyloadable-image rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"114f4a3e85684e4775625d0a359ff698\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNTg2NzI0Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY0MDg3Njc5NX0.I-jDQ-capuU2tbsQFZffhQjL2BnaHE9lFRcCQdgd-CQ/img.jpg?width=980\" height=\"3120\" id=\"9c863\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" width=\"4160\" /><p>However, the euro bridges of Spijkenisse are not as monumental as their depiction on the notes suggests. In fact, they're pedestrian in more than one sense. Mr Kalina, who first drew the fictional bridges, while amused by the project, has said he would have liked the bridges to be built in the style in which each was designed, instead of their appearance being used as a \"kitschy façade.\" So, it's perhaps more appropriate to call them 'follies', but then many have said the same about the euro itself.</p><p><span></span>From 2013 onwards, a second series of euro notes was published. This 'Europa' series–named after the Greek goddess who is watermarked into the notes–is a redesign by the German banknote designer Reinhold Gerstetter, who wanted the notes to be \"more colorful, so they would appear friendlier\". </p><h3>Useful to criminals</h3><br /><img class=\"rm-lazyloadable-image rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"14a60641e46c05cc61ff24aa38c6b8fc\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNTg2NzI3OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY0NDc2NjI3Nn0.ayivHSy-QR14sW9xVQp2GUdJiVqq65RlfeG5ldHUDaY/img.jpg?width=980\" height=\"3120\" id=\"28d36\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" width=\"4160\" /><p>The basic design of the first series, including the colors and bridges, has been maintained, with one notable exception. The Europa series no longer features a €500 note, out of concern that it appeared to be more useful to criminals than to law-abiding citizens.<br /></p><p><span></span>The reason is its exceptionally high value. True, Switzerland has a 1,000-franc note (app. € 900, or US$ 1,075), but the euro is the only major currency to have a note this valuable. Compare the US dollar, which has the $100 bill as its highest denomination.</p><p>Because it is so valuable and was so relatively widespread, the €500 bill is ideal for transferring large amounts of money in a compact volume of notes. Turns out that quality was greatly appreciated by money launderers, drug smugglers, and tax dodgers.<br /></p><h3>'Bin Ladens'</h3><br><img class=\"rm-lazyloadable-image rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"e9267e65de995bdf7f1942a91cdb7c4b\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" data-runner-src=\"https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNTg2NzI1My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYyNzkwNTM5MH0.U3a46zNDsbvvopue8ebjn64W2jexO4Tyfk6TD1wrTpA/img.jpg?width=980\" height=\"3120\" id=\"82bb1\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" width=\"4160\" /><p>The notes soon acquired the nickname 'Bin Ladens' because, despite their notoriety, they were rarely seen in public. One examination by the UK's Serious Organised Crime Agency noted 90% of the €500 bills distributed in the U.K. were in the hands of criminal organisations, who liked the note because it made it easier to launder money (the highest British denomination is £50).

In our era of hyperpolarisation, social-media echo chambers and populist demagogues, many have turned to civility as the missing ingredient in our public life.</p><p>So, how important is civility for democracy? According to one of the greatest theorists of the democratic public sphere, the German philosopher Jürgen Habermas, not very. Habermas is deeply concerned with protecting our ability to solve problems through the use of reason. Yet he <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-2885.2006.00280.x\">believes</a> that democracy is best served when the public sphere is left open, anarchic and conflictual.</p><p>For Habermas, the function of public debate is not to find a reasonable common ground. Rather, the public sphere 'is a warning system', a set of 'sensors' that detect the new needs floating underneath the surface of a supposed political consensus. And if we worry too much about civility and the reasonable middle, we risk limiting the ability of the public sphere to detect new political claims. To get those claims on the agenda in the first place often requires uncivil and confrontational political tactics. </p><p>Habermas's vision of politics focuses on the power of a wild public sphere. His great fear, one he expresses already in his <em>habilitation</em> thesis in 1962, published in English as <em>The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere</em>, is that large-scale, formal political and economic institutions are increasingly shutting themselves off from public criticism. Habermas traces the development of the idea of the critical public in 18th-century Europe, one that would hold state power accountable through the use of reason, and then its decline in an era of public-relations management focused on minimising the role of the public in political decision-making. While Habermas has been accused of romanticising the European Enlightenment, his goal was to draw attention to the stark gap between the ideals of the critical public and the reality of political and social domination.</p><h3></h3><br/><p>Like other individuals associated with the Institute for Social Research in Frankfurt, Habermas has always been guided by the hope of creating an emancipated society – one where the use of political, social and economic power can be fully justified to those potentially affected. To this Frankfurt School ideal, Habermas adds an insight that goes back to Aristotle – that the central human capacity is language. The fact that we can understand one another, Habermas argues, means that we are committed to using reason to resolve disputes. In our day-to-day life, we have to continuously use language to organise our lives and make plans – instances of what Habermas in 1981 called 'communicative action'.</p><p>Habermas thinks this has radical consequences. In all these instances, we accept, just by entering into the continuous flow of communication, that the only thing that should count are reasons that everyone accepts. Habermas's critics point out that, in the real world, social differences in power affect whose voices are heard and whose ideas are recognised in all deliberation. But this point is not incompatible with Habermas's insights. From his early work, he has seen reasoning as a fundamentally social practice, one that must always include moral and political questions. Bringing to light these subtle forms of power and exclusion helps to realise the ideal of rational enquiry.</p><p>What follows politically from Habermas's theory of communication? Again, one possibility is to find some way to make people live up to an ideal of disinterested, civil deliberation. In the face of increasing polarisation and the potential breakdown of the rules of the game, we should search for some way to restore the underlying norms of mutual forbearance that ensure politics does not descend into civil war. But this is hardly the direction in which Habermas goes. It's not that he then prizes incivility in and of itself. Rather, Habermas worries that a public sphere shackled by excessive regard for the norms of deliberation and rational debate loses its essential function. And that function is to bring to light questions, issues, concerns and needs that are currently invisible to political leaders and the larger public. In <em>Between Facts and Norms</em> (1992), he argues that 'liberal misgivings about opening up an unrestricted spectrum of public issues and topics are not justified'. Rather, because of its 'anarchic structure', contestation in the public sphere can enable the perception of 'new problems' and help to overcome 'the millennia-old shackles of social stratification and exploitation'.</p><h3></h3><br/><p>Confrontation, protest and incivility are all components of deliberative politics as Habermas understands it. These forms of conflict, of refusing existing norms and institutions, are what bring to light whether those institutions and norms can survive rational scrutiny. Habermas goes so far as to <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/41035345?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\" target=\"_blank\">call</a> the ability to withstand and even celebrate civil disobedience the 'litmus test' for the maturity of a constitutional democracy. Even as Habermas has a famously ambitious understanding of our capacity for the collaborative search for truth, his is an activist's view of politics. Consensus is not the highest good. Rather, the possibility of a society based on rational consensus becomes visible only in moments of dissensus, when the failure of existing norms is unmasked. Enlightenment comes about when social groups show that the dominant social organisation fails to take into consideration their legitimate claims and concerns. This is why Habermas is <a href=\"https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/habermas/1968/theory-knowledge.htm\" target=\"_blank\">clear</a> that he is interested, not in rational political communication as such, but 'the history of its repression and re-establishment'.</p><p>Habermas's recent work has focused on the fate of European integration, of which he is a prominent defender. This activist current in his thought has receded as he has worried more and more about the lack of long-term political vision on the part of Europe's leaders. Yet he has also more recently come to recognise the dangerous failures of those institutions to produce their own legitimacy. The more those institutions, such as the European Union, insulate themselves from the unruly forces of the public sphere, the more they provide ammunition for whoever can claim to speak on behalf of a suppressed public opinion. Large-scale political institutions, from the European Union to the modern administrative state, approach politics as a set of management problems, best solved without extensive input from a potentially recalcitrant public.</p><p>Democracy, according to Habermas, requires a vibrant political sphere and political institutions that are able to respond to and incorporate the energy that arises from debate, protest, confrontation and politics. Perhaps it's not citizens who have become unreasonable. Rather, their leaders have too long refused to listen, instead treating the public as nothing more than a periodic reservoir of votes, an obstacle to be managed on the path to smooth, technocratic governance.<img alt=\"Aeon counter – do not remove\" src=\"https://metrics.aeon.co/count/10500a57-b140-4d03-a954-ef07c21c3a31.gif\"/></p><p>Steven Klein</p><p>This article was originally published at <a href=\"https://aeon.co/?utm_campaign=republished-article\" target=\"_blank\">Aeon</a> and has been republished under Creative Commons.
