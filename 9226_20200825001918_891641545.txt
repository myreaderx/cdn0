We made some major changes to the installers, and some people had a few issues with some of the images we released. So, we made some slight alternations to smooth things out and make the install process easier for everyone.<span id=\"more-3914\"></span></p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Base Image</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Before, we used to release multiple separate installers for different Desktop Environments (DE). With 2020.1 we changed how we distributed our base images, without having multiple different ISOs for each DE, by introducing a &#8220;installer&#8221; image as well as a &#8220;live&#8221; image.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Both accomplish the same thing, but how they do it is different. The &#8220;installer&#8221; image is the new one, as this uses &#8220;debian-cd&#8221; on the back-end. We noticed <a href=\"https://bugs.kali.org/view.php?id=6053\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">a bug</a> in a dependency chain, which caused an issue with x11. As a result, you may not have got a graphical interface after installing Kali. As a result, <a href=\"https://www.kali.org/downloads/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">we pushed out a fix (2020.1a)</a> to address this.</p>\n<p> <strong>Note: If you are already running 2020.1, you do not need to reinstall. The 2020.1a release is only for those who weren&#8217;t able to successfully install 2020.1</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-3917 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.kali.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/raspberry-pi.jpg\" alt=\"raspberry-pi\" srcset=\"https://www.kali.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/raspberry-pi.jpg 600w, https://www.kali.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/raspberry-pi-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p>\n<h2>Raspberry Pi</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">We have also pushed out an updated image, both 32-bit and 64-bit for <a href=\"https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-arm-images/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">Raspberry Pi</a>, due to some files being corrupt in the initial image.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-3920 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.kali.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/VAGRANT_CLOUD.png\" alt=\"VAGRANT-CLOUD\" srcset=\"https://www.kali.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/VAGRANT_CLOUD.png 398w, https://www.kali.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/VAGRANT_CLOUD-300x184.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 398px) 100vw, 398px\" /></p>\n<h2>Vagrant</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Since the introduction of a <a href=\"https://www.kali.org/news/kali-default-non-root-user/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">non-root user</a>, we have switched the <a href=\"https://www.kali.org/docs/introduction/default-credentials/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">default user</a> to be <code class=\"codecolorer text default\"><span class=\"text\">kali</span></code>.

Sporting a Qualcomm SDM730 Snapdragon, 6GB RAM &amp; 64GB /128GB it is a beast of a machine for under US$300! The miui interface is gorgeous especially when paired with the lawnchair 3 launcher but might not be everybody’s cup of tea. Luckily there are 3rd party ROMs available to suit everyone’s taste.</p> \n<p data-sourcepos=\"110:1-110:87\">Just like its bigger brother, the OP7, this device includes all the bells and whistles:</p> \n<ul data-sourcepos=\"112:1-120:0\"> \n <li data-sourcepos=\"112:1-112:92\">Full support for USB multi-port adaptors (USB,HDMI, ethernet, pass-through charging, etc.)</li> \n <li data-sourcepos=\"113:1-113:18\">Full HID support</li> \n <li data-sourcepos=\"114:1-120:0\">The latest rtl88XXXu drivers from Kimocoder, adding injection support for: \n  <ul> \n   <li>RTL8812AU</li> \n   <li>RTL8814AU</li> \n   <li>RTL8821AU</li> \n  </ul> </li> \n</ul> \n<p data-sourcepos=\"121:1-122:54\">Miui being a little bit eccentric, you might have to disable the “Privileged Extension” in the NetHunter store app under “Expert mode” if the store app fails to install applications. Other than that, this device is my personal favourite.</p> \n<p data-sourcepos=\"126:1-127:204\">The image is available for download on our <a href=\"https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-nethunter-download/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">Kali NetHunter download page</a>.

As part of our evaluation of <a href=\"https://tools.kali.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">Kali tools</a> and <a href=\"https://www.kali.org/docs/policy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">policies</a> we have decided to change this and move Kali to a &#8220;traditional default non-root user&#8221; model. This change will be part of the 2020.1 release, currently scheduled for late January. However, you will notice this change in the <a href=\"https://cdimage.kali.org/kali-weekly/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">weekly images</a> starting now.</p>\n<h2>The History of Default Root User</h2>\n<p>In the beginning, there was <a href=\"https://www.backtrack-linux.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">BackTrack</a>. In its original form, BackTrack (v1-4) was a Slackware live based distro intended to be ran from a CDROM. Yes, we do go back a ways <em>(2006!)</em>.</p>\n<p>In this model, there was no real update mechanism, just a bunch of pentesting tools living in the <code class=\"codecolorer text default\"><span class=\"text\">/pentest/</span></code> directory, that you could use as part of assessments. It was the early days, so things were not very sophisticated, we were just all happy things worked. A lot of those tools back then either required root access to run or ran better when ran as root. With this operating system that would be ran from a CD, never be updated, and had a lot of tools that needed root access to run it was a simple decision to have a &#8220;everything as root&#8221; security model. It made complete sense for the time.</p>\n<p>As time went by however, there were a number of changes. All of us that were around back then sort of remember things a little differently but on the broad strokes we saw people were installing BackTrack on bare metal so we felt like there should be an update mechanism. Especially after walking around Defcon and noticing how many people were using a version of BackTrack that was vulnerable to a certain exploit which came out a few weeks prior. That moved us to basing BackTrack 5 off of Ubuntu instead of Slackware live <em>(February 2011)</em>. Then as more time went by we were so busy fighting with Ubuntu that we felt like we needed to move onto something else.</p>\n<p>That brought us to <a href=\"https://www.kali.org/news/birth-of-kali/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">Kali</a>, and being an official <a href=\"https://wiki.debian.org/Derivatives/Census/Kali\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">Debian derivative</a>.</p>\n<h2>Modern Kali</h2>\n<p>Our move to be a Debian derivative brought with a whole host of advantages. So many in fact its not worth reviewing them here, just look at the <a href=\"https://www.kali.org/news/kali-linux-whats-new/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">early</a> <a href=\"https://www.kali.org/news/bleeding-edge-kali-repositories/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">Kali</a> <a href=\"https://www.kali.org/news/kali-linux-accessibility-improvements/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">blog</a> <a href=\"https://www.kali.org/penetration-testing/kali-linux-penetration-testing-platform/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">posts</a> shortly after the launch and you will see a ton of <a href=\"https://www.kali.org/tutorials/tracking-fixing-installer-bugs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">examples</a>. But one advantage that we never really talked to much about is the fact that we are based on <a href=\"https://wiki.debian.org/DebianTesting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">Debian-Testing</a>.</p>\n<p>Debian has a well earned reputation for being one of the most stable Linux distros out there. Debian-Testing is the development branch of the next version of Debian, and realistically is still more stable than many mainstream Linux distros.</p>\n<p>While we don&#8217;t encourage people to run Kali as their day to day operating system, over the last few years more and more users have started to do so <em>(even if they are not using it to do penetration testing full time)</em>, including some members of the Kali development team. When people do so, they obviously don&#8217;t run as default root user. With this usage over time, there is the obvious conclusion that default root user is no longer necessary and Kali will be better off moving to a more traditional security model.</p>\n<h2>Why Some Tools Require Root Access</h2>\n<p>Lets have a quick sidebar and review how some tools require root. For this, we will pick on <a href=\"https://tools.kali.org/information-gathering/nmap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">nmap</a>.</p>\n<p>Nmap is hands down the most popular portscanner in use today, and one of the most popular tools used on Kali. When ran by a non-root user doing a standard scan, nmap will default to running what is known as a connect scan (<code class=\"codecolorer text default\"><span class=\"text\">-sT</span></code>). In this sort of scan, a full TCP three way handshake is conducted to identify if a given port is open or not. However, when ran as a root user nmap takes advantage of the additional privileges to utilize <a href=\"http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/raw.7.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">raw sockets</a> and will conduct a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_scanner#SYN_scanning\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">syn scan</a> (<code class=\"codecolorer text default\"><span class=\"text\">-sS</span></code>), a far more popular scan type. This syn scan is not possible unless ran as root.</p>\n<p>This aspect of security tools requiring root level permissions traditionally has not been uncommon. Running as a root user by default makes it easier to use these tools.</p>\n<p>One of the, possibly surprising, conclusions we came to while looking at this issue is the number of tools that require root access has dropped over the years. This has made this default root policy less useful, bringing us to the point now where we are going to make this change.</p>\n<h2>Many Applications Require Non Root Accounts</h2>\n<p>On the opposite direction, over the years a number of applications and services have been configured to forbid their usage as the <code class=\"codecolorer text default\"><span class=\"text\">root</span></code> user. This has become either a maintenance burden for us (when we opted to patch out the check or reconfigure the service) or a nuisance for users that could not use their application (with <a href=\"https://bugs.kali.org/view.php?id=5404\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">chrome/chromium</a> being a well known case).</p>\n<p>Dropping this default root policy will thus simplify maintenance of Kali and will avoid problems for end-users.</p>\n<h2>Kali Non-Root User Implementation</h2>\n<p>There are a number of changes you can expect to see as part of this change.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Kali in live mode will be running as user <code class=\"codecolorer text default\"><span class=\"text\">kali</span></code> password <code class=\"codecolorer text default\"><span class=\"text\">kali</span></code>. No more <code class=\"codecolorer text default\"><span class=\"text\">root</span></code>/<code class=\"codecolorer text default\"><span class=\"text\">toor</span></code>. (Get ready to set up your IDS filters, as we are sure this user/pass combo will be being scanned for by bots everywhere soon).</li>\n<li>On install, Kali will prompt you to create a non-root user that will have administrative privileges (due to its addition to the <code class=\"codecolorer text default\"><span class=\"text\">sudo</span></code> group). This is the same process as other Linux distros you may be familiar with.</li>\n<li>Tools that we identify as needing root access, as well as common administrative functions such as starting/stopping services, will interactively ask for administrative privileges (at least when started from the Kali menu). If you really don&#8217;t care about security, and if you preferred the old model, you can install kali-grant-root and run <code class=\"codecolorer text default\"><span class=\"text\">dpkg-reconfigure kali-grant-root</span></code> to configure password-less root rights.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>All-in-all, we don&#8217;t expect this will be a major change for most users. It is possible that some tools or administrative functions will be missed in our review, when that happens we would ask that you create a <a href=\"https://bugs.kali.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">bug report</a> so it can be tracked and corrected. (And no, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/kalilinux\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">tweeting</a> at us is not a bug report and won&#8217;t be tracked. Sorry, but that just does not scale).</p>\n<h2>Going Forward</h2>\n<p>All that said, we are still not encouraging people to use Kali as their day to day operating system. More than anything else, this is because we don&#8217;t test for that usage pattern and we don&#8217;t want the influx of bug reports that would come with it. However, for those of you that are familiar with Kali and want to run it as your day to day platform, this change should help you out a lot. For the rest of you, this should give you a better security model to operate under while you are doing assessments.</p>\n<p>As we mentioned at the start, this change is currently available in the daily builds and will be in the next weekly build. Feel free to download and test early, as we would like to have as many potential issues shaken lose before release as possible. The more active users on this the better.</p>\n<p>After a strong 2019 with Kali, this is a major change to start out our 2020 development cycle. Expect more as the <a href=\"https://www.kali.org/news/kali-linux-roadmap-2019-2020/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">year goes on</a>.

For a long time, nobody cared and Python 3 adoption was slow. But things have changed a lot lately as the deadline is right around the corner (1st January).</p>\n<h2 id=\"debian-is-removing-python-2-support\">Debian is removing Python 2 support</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Debian is planning to get rid of <a href=\"https://wiki.debian.org/Python/2Removal\">Python 2 entirely for their next stable release</a> so they are progressively getting rid of Python 2 code. They filed release critical bugs on leaf packages (i.e. packages without reverse dependencies) asking them to be ported to Python 3. If the Python 3 port is not happening soon enough, these packages will be removed from <a href=\"https://wiki.debian.org/DebianTesting\">Debian Testing</a> <em>(which is what Kali is based on)</em>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"consequences-for-kali\">Consequences for Kali</h2>\n<h3 id=\"applications-disappearing\">Applications disappearing</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">As Kali is a rolling distribution, it continuously receives updates from Debian Testing. This includes when packages &#8220;go away&#8221; because they have been dropped from Debian. However, they can always come back later, provided that someone ports them to Python 3.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">We have already experienced this in the case of <code class=\"codecolorer text default\"><span class=\"text\">zenmap</span></code> which is no longer maintained by the <a href=\"https://nmap.org/zenmap/\">nmap developers</a>. Thus, it&#8217;s no longer built by <a href=\"https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=zenmap\">Debian&#8217;s nmap source</a> package, and as a result no longer appears in Kali.</p>\n<h3 id=\"broken-applications\">Broken applications</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">We have many Python 2 applications in Kali that use modules which are packaged in Debian. When Debian drops the Python 2 version of such a module, the application is broken in <a href=\"https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/kali-linux-sources-list-repositories/\">kali-dev</a>. kali-rolling is not affected due to the way it&#8217;s managed but the growing divergence between kali-dev and kali-rolling is making our job more difficult: we don&#8217;t get updates for such packages and there are other (recent) applications that will likely require new versions of those packages!</p>\n<h2 id=\"kali-must-remove-python-2-code-too\">Kali must remove Python 2 code too</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Due to this change in the ecosystem, Kali has no other choice than to follow Debian&#8217;s lead and remove Python 2 code as well. This giant effort is tracked with <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/groups/kalilinux/-/issues?label_name%5B%5D=Project%3A%3APy2Removal\">many GitLab issues</a> against all packages depending on Python 2 in some way. We have already filed upstream bug reports for all the packages where there&#8217;s no Python 3 support yet.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">How we handle each case depends on many factors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If upstream is working on Python 3 support, then we just wait until it&#8217;s ready.</li>\n<li>If upstream is inactive or is not interested into porting its code to Python 3, then we have few choices:\n<ul>\n<li>either we remove the package;</li>\n<li>or we find some fork/patch that adds Python 3 support;</li>\n<li>or we do the porting work ourselves (rather unlikely except for trivial scripts).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">It also depends on the kind of packages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For a Python library, it&#8217;s a two step process: first we add Python 3 support; Python 2 support is removed later, once all reverse dependencies have been updated to use Python 3.</li>\n<li>For a Python application, a single update might be enough but that update might depend on having dependencies be ported to Python 3 first.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">We don&#8217;t like to remove software, but sometimes when they are no longer maintained, we have no other choices. For important packages, we are waiting longer thus letting more time for the community to add the required Python 3 support. We might even patch them so that they display a warning inviting users to contribute, or at least understand the application may be removed in the near future.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">For packages that no longer add much value, or that have viable alternatives in Kali, we might remove them at any point in time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-you-can-contribute\">How you can contribute</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">If one of your favorite applications appears among the <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/groups/kalilinux/-/issues?label_name%5B%5D=Project%3A%3APy2Removal\">affected Kali packages</a> or among the <a href=\"https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?tag=py2removal;users=debian-python@lists.debian.org;maint=team%2Bpkg-security@tracker.debian.org\">affected packages from Debian&#8217;s pkg-security team</a>, then you should review its situation and possibly help the upstream developer(s) by submitting a pull request adding Python 3 support. Even if upstream is not very active, we will be able to merge your changes in Kali and keep the package for longer until upstream becomes active again.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">If you don&#8217;t have the coding skills required for this, you can still try to find a Python 3 fork/patch written by someone else and point it out to us in the corresponding GitLab issue or Debian bug report. Or, tell the developers how much you like their application and that you would like to continue to make use of it, so they should port over to Python 3.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 16 Dec 2019 14:31:09 +0000","feedId":9226,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"0af4024d36e2f7f9af4adb090cbde718","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"elwood","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598314727391},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:18:47","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:18:47","title":"Kali Linux 2020.1 Release","link":"https://www.kali.org/?p=3701","description":"<p style=\"text-align: left;\">We are here to kick off our first release of the decade, with Kali Linux 2020.1! Available for immediate <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.kali.org/downloads/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">download</a>.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The following is a brief feature summary for this release:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.kali.org/news/kali-default-non-root-user/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Non-Root by default</a></li> \n <li>Kali single installer image</li> \n <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.kali.org/docs/nethunter/nethunter-rootless/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kali NetHunter Rootless</a></li> \n <li>Improvements to theme &amp; kali-undercover</li> \n <li>New tools</li> \n</ul> \n<h2 id=\"non-root\">Non-Root</h2> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Throughout the history of Kali (and its predecessors BackTrack, WHAX, and Whoppix), the default credentials have been <code class=\"codecolorer text default\"><span class=\"text\">root/toor</span></code>. This is no more. We are no longer using the superuser account, root, as default in Kali 2020.1.

It’s up to you.<br /> There wasn’t anything really stopping you before, we just don’t encourage it. We still don’t. But its a helping hand for the people who are familiar with Kali enough.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Why do we not recommend it?<br /> Because we are unable to test for that usage pattern and we donâ€™t want the influx of bug reports that would come with it.<br /> If you are brave enough to try it, you may wish to switch the <a href=\"https://www.kali.org/docs/introduction/kali-branches/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">branch from “rolling” to “kali-last-snapshot”</a> to try and be more stable.</p> \n<h2 id=\"kali-single-installer-image\">Kali Single Installer Image</h2> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">We took a good hard look at the usage of Kali, what images are actually downloaded, how they are put to use, and so on. With this information in hand, we decided to completely restructure and simplify the images we release. Going forward, we will have an installer image, a live image, and a network installer image.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">These changes should allow for easier selection of the right image for you to download, while increasing flexibility on installation and further reducing download sizes.</p> \n<p><strong>Our Installer Image</strong></p> \n<ul> \n <li>This is what we recommend for most users that want to install Kali on their system</li> \n <li>Doesn’t require a network connection (aka offline install) for the default package selection</li> \n <li>Able to select desktop environment to install (Previously there was a separate image for each DE: XFCE, GNOME, KDE, etc.)</li> \n <li>Able to select tools to install at install time</li> \n <li>Can’t be used to boot a live system. This is just an installer image.</li> \n <li>Filename: \n  <ul> \n   <li><code class=\"codecolorer text default\"><span class=\"text\">kali-linux-2020.1-installer-&lt;amd64|i386&gt;.iso</span></code></li> \n  </ul> </li> \n</ul> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">We are no longer offering separate images for every desktop environment (DE). Instead, we now have a single image with the option to pick your DE during installation. This means there isn’t a download link for Xfce (which is our default option since <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.kali.org/news/kali-linux-2019-4-release/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2019.4</a>), GNOME, KDE, MATE or LXDE DEs. Just one image to rule them all.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">At install time, you may <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/metapackages/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">select the tools included</a> with Kali (or <strong>none at all</strong>)! This gives you more control over what <strong>you</strong> want. We understand that Kali comes with more tools than some people use, or they have their own select tools they use. Now they can install Kali without any metapackages, giving them a bare Kali installation, so they can <strong>individually select what tools they want</strong> (rather than groups).</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The default image contains the <code class=\"codecolorer text default\"><span class=\"text\">kali-desktop-xfce</span></code> and <code class=\"codecolorer text default\"><span class=\"text\">kali-tools-default</span></code> packages, allowing for an offline installation of Kali (as it always has been). Selecting any non-default tools will require a network connection.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Note: “Kali Live” is not included in this image. If you wish to use live mode, you’ll need the live image.</p> \n<p><a ref=\"magnificPopup\" href=\"https://www.kali.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/tasksel_first_0.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://www.kali.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/tasksel_first_0.png\" alt=\"Kali Setup Screen\" style=\"width:100%; max-width:600px;\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3776\" srcset=\"https://www.kali.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/tasksel_first_0.png 800w, https://www.kali.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/tasksel_first_0-300x225.png 300w, https://www.kali.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/tasksel_first_0-600x450.png 600w, https://www.kali.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/tasksel_first_0-768x576.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></a></p> \n<p><strong>Network Install Image</strong></p> \n<ul> \n <li>Smallest image to download</li> \n <li>This requires a network connection to install</li> \n <li>During setup, it will download the latest packages every time it’s used</li> \n <li>Able to select desktop environment to install</li> \n <li>Able to select tools to install</li> \n <li>Can’t be used to boot a live system.

This allows you to try Kali without installing it and is perfect for running off a USB stick. You can install from this image, however, it will require a network connection (this is why we suggest the stand-alone install image for most users).</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Alternatively, you can <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.kali.org/docs/development/dojo-mastering-live-build/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">generate your own image</a>, in particular if you want to use another desktop environment instead of our default Xfce. It’s not as hard as it sounds!.</p> \n<h2 id=\"nethunter-images\">ARM Images</h2> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">You will probably notice a bit of a change in the ARM images starting with our 2020.1 release. There are fewer images available for download, due to both manpower and hardware constraints, some images won’t be posted without community assistance.<br /> The scripts are still updated, so if an image doesn’t exist for a machine you use, you will have to create it by running the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gitlab.com/kalilinux/build-scripts/kali-arm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">build script</a> on a Kali machine.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">ARM images for 2020.1 will still run as root by default.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The sad news that a lot of people didn’t want to hear… an image for the Pinebook Pro isn’t included in the 2020.1 release. We are still working on getting it added, and as soon as it is ready we will post it.</p> \n<h2 id=\"nethunter-images\">NetHunter Images</h2> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Our mobile pen-testing platform, Kali NetHunter, has also had some new improvements. You are now no longer required to root your phone in order to run Kali NetHunter, but that does come with some limitations.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">To suit everybody’s needs, Kali NetHunter now comes in the following three editions:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>NetHunter</strong> – Needs rooted devices with custom recovery and patched kernel. Has no restrictions. Device specific images are available <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-nethunter-download/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</li> \n <li><strong>NetHunter Light</strong> – Needs rooted devices with custom recovery but no custom kernel. Has minor restrictions, i.e. no WiFi injection or HID support. Architecture specific images are available <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-nethunter-download/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</li> \n <li><strong>NetHunter Rootless</strong> – Installable on all stock standard, unmodified devices using Termux. Some limitations, like lack of db support in Metasploit and no root permissions. Installation instruction is available <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.kali.org/docs/nethunter/nethunter-rootless/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</li> \n</ul> \n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.kali.org/docs/nethunter/#1-0-nethunter-editions\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> NetHunter documentation page</a> includes a more detailed comparison.<br /> Each NetHunter edition comes with both the new “kali” user as well as root.

However, to recap, the default toolset going forward has changed. To help with this transition, for this release only (Kali 2019.3), there is a one-off, extra image called <code class=\"codecolorer text default\"><span class=\"text\">kali-linux-large-2019.3-amd64.iso</span></code>, that contains all previous default tools.â€‹</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Going forward, during our release cycle, we will be evaluating which tools belong to each group:â€‹</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Kali-linux-default &#8211; tools we believe are essential to a penetration tester</li>\n<li>Kali-linux-large &#8211; for penetration testers who have a wider set of non standard/common situations</li>\n<li>Kali-linux-everything &#8211; for those who want it all (and without Internet access during the assessment)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>â€‹With the switchover to <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/kalilinux\">GitLab</a> (<a href=\"https://www.kali.org/news/kali-linux-roadmap-2019-2020/\">read more here</a>), we will soon begin accepting community package submissions. This means that anyone can directly submit improvements to us&#8211;anything from minor fixes and patches to complete tool packages is encouraged. We&#8217;re currently working through the documentation on how to create a package, making it easier for folks to get started and help out. More details to come later this year.</p>\n<p>â€‹We also noticed some packages failed to build on certain ARM architectures, which has now been fixed (allowing for more tools to be used on different platforms!).</p>\n<h2 id=\"helper-scripts\">Helper Scripts</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There&#8217;s a wide range of tools in Kali. Some tools are designed to be used on Linux, some are designed for Windows <em>(and we can still use them with WINE)</em>, and some are static resources. During our recent <a href=\"https://www.kali.org/news/major-metapackage-makeover/\">metapackage refresh</a>, we took the time to create a few &#8220;helper scripts&#8221;.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You may have installed a package, gone ahead and typed in the package name to run it, and the response back was <code class=\"codecolorer text default\"><span class=\"text\">command not found</span></code>. Not any more!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We understood it may not have been obvious how to use them straight away. As a result, all of our static resources should now be easy to find. Just type in the package name (Such as <a href=\"https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/payloadsallthethings\">PayloadsAllTheThings</a>, <a href=\"https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/seclists\">SecLists</a>, <a href=\"https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/webshells\">WebShells</a> and <a href=\"https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/wordlists\">Wordlists</a> to a name a few), you&#8217;ll see a brief description, a directory listing, and then be moved to the folder.â€‹</p>\n<div class=\"codecolorer-container text default\" style=\"overflow:auto;white-space:nowrap;border:1px solid #9F9F9F;width:435px;\"><div class=\"text codecolorer\" style=\"padding:5px;font:normal 12px/1.4em Monaco, Lucida Console, monospace;white-space:nowrap;\">root@kali-dev:~# webshells<br />\n&#62; webshells ~ Collection of webshells<br />\n/usr/share/webshells<br />\n&#160; |--asp<br />\n&#160; |--aspx<br />\n&#160; |--cfm<br />\n&#160; |--jsp<br />\n&#160; |--perl<br />\n&#160; |--php<br />\nroot@kali-dev:/usr/share/webshells#</div></div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When it comes to Windows binaries (Such as <a href=\"https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/hyperion\">hyperion</a>, <a href=\"https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/mimikatz\">mimikatz</a>, and <a href=\"https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/windows-privesc-check\">windows-privesc-check</a>), depending on their functionality, it will now either start up WINE or, like above, hotlink you to the location.â€‹</p>\n<div class=\"codecolorer-container text default\" style=\"overflow:auto;white-space:nowrap;border:1px solid #9F9F9F;width:435px;height:400px;\"><div class=\"text codecolorer\" style=\"padding:5px;font:normal 12px/1.4em Monaco, Lucida Console, monospace;white-space:nowrap;\">root@kali-dev:~# mimikatz<br />\n&#62; mimikatz ~ Uses admin rights on Windows to display passwords in plaintext<br />\n/usr/share/windows-resources/mimikatz<br />\n&#160; |---kiwi_passwords.yar<br />\n&#160; |---mimicom.idl<br />\n&#160; |---Win32<br />\n&#160; |----mimidrv.sys<br />\n&#160; |----mimikatz.exe<br />\n&#160; |----mimilib.dll<br />\n&#160; |----mimilove.exe<br />\n&#160; |---x64<br />\n&#160; |----mimidrv.sys<br />\n&#160; |----mimikatz.exe<br />\n&#160; |----mimilib.dll<br />\nroot@kali-dev:/usr/share/windows-resources/mimikatz#<br />\nroot@kali-dev:/usr/share/windows-resources/mimikatz# shellter<br />\nâ€‹<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 1010101 01 &#160; 10 0100110 10 &#160; &#160; 01 &#160;11001001 0011101 001001<br />\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 11 &#160; &#160; &#160;10 &#160; 01 00 &#160; &#160; &#160;01 &#160; &#160; 01 &#160; &#160; 01 &#160; &#160;10 &#160; &#160; &#160;11 &#160; 10<br />\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 0010011 1110001 11011 &#160; 11 &#160; &#160; 10 &#160; &#160; 00 &#160; &#160;10011 &#160; 011001<br />\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;11 00 &#160; 10 01 &#160; &#160; &#160;11 &#160; &#160; 01 &#160; &#160; 11 &#160; &#160;01 &#160; &#160; &#160;01 &#160; 11<br />\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 0010010 11 &#160; 00 0011010 100111 000111 00 &#160; &#160;1100011 01 &#160; 10 v7.1<br />\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; www.ShellterProject.com &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Wine Mode<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nChoose Operation Mode - Auto/Manual (A/M/H):</div></div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On the subject of tool type, we have altered the location of packages related to Windows (which eagle eye readers may have spotted in the example above).

One thing to note is package management is done through the F-Droid compatible <a href=\"https://store.nethunter.com\">NetHunter store</a>, so you can even choose to have a NetHunter device without any Google Play.</p>\n<p>â€‹The proxmark3 client supports RDV4 out of the box and NetHunter now also works with Android&#8217;s new partition layouts (A/B partitions no longer have one boot partition and one recovery partition. They are all the same, but twice! A few paths have also changed, such as <code class=\"codecolorer text default\"><span class=\"text\">/system</span></code> now actually being under <code class=\"codecolorer text default\"><span class=\"text\">/system/system</span></code>), which allows it to be built for the latest generation of devices.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Plus, there are new apps in the NetHunter app store, thanks to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mayank_metha\">@mayank_metha</a> for Rucky and the <a href=\"https://github.com/termux/termux-app/graphs/contributors\">Termux team</a> for Termux.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are 4 additional images for you to try NetHunter on (some may look familiar, as they are back due to community demand):â€‹</p>\n<ul>\n<li>LG V20 International Edition</li>\n<li>Nexus 5X</li>\n<li>Nexus 10</li>\n<li>OnePlus 7 (Our new flagship device!)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a ref=\"magnificPopup\" href=\"https://www.kali.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/nethunter-release-2019.3-02.jpg\"><img src=\"https://www.kali.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/nethunter-release-2019.3-02-138x300.jpg\" alt=\"NetHunter 2019.3\" width=\"138\" height=\"300\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-3389\" srcset=\"https://www.kali.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/nethunter-release-2019.3-02-138x300.jpg 138w, https://www.kali.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/nethunter-release-2019.3-02-473x1024.jpg 473w, https://www.kali.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/nethunter-release-2019.3-02-600x1300.jpg 600w, https://www.kali.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/nethunter-release-2019.3-02-768x1664.jpg 768w, https://www.kali.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/nethunter-release-2019.3-02.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 138px) 100vw, 138px\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With this announcement, the <strong>OnePlus 7</strong> is now the phone we recommend for Kali NetHunter.

The RaspberryPi Zero W has seen improvements as well.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Bluetooth firmware that was accidentally dropped has been added back in, and the <code class=\"codecolorer text default\"><span class=\"text\">rc.local</span></code> file has been fixed to properly stop <code class=\"codecolorer text default\"><span class=\"text\">dmesg</span></code> spam from showing up on the first console.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">All of the RaspberryPi images have had their <code class=\"codecolorer text default\"><span class=\"text\">/boot</span></code> partition increased, which is required due to the size of the new kernel packages.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The ODROID-C2 has been bumped to the 3.16.72 for its kernel.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">All images now run <code class=\"codecolorer text default\"><span class=\"text\">dpkg-reconfigure xfonts-base</span></code> on their first boot &#8211; this will cause a bit of a slow down for the first boot, but the result is that if you use VNC to any of them, they will no longer show a blank screen.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On the <a href=\"https://www.kali.org/tutorials/kali-on-the-windows-subsystem-for-linux/\">WSL</a> front, we have added WSL ARM64 support, which you can find in the <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/kali-linux/9pkr34tncv07?rtc=1&#38;activetab=pivot:overviewtab\">Windows store</a> today.â€‹</p>\n<h2 id=\"official-kali-linux-lxd-container-image-released\">Official Kali Linux LXD Container Image Released</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">LXD is a next generation system container manager.

We are working on the documentation but would like to share the excellent article from <a href=\"https://blog.simos.info/using-the-lxd-kali-container-image/\">Simos Xenitellis</a> in which he details how to install and run Kismet in a LXD Kali container.â€‹</p>\n<h2 id=\"setup-notes\">Setup Notes</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A couple of notes when installing Kali. If you choose to install Kali in a VM (rather than <a href=\"https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-vm-vmware-virtualbox-image-download/\">downloading our pre-made image</a>), during the setup process, it should now detect if its running in <a href=\"https://docs.kali.org/general-use/install-vmware-tools-kali-guest\">VMware</a> or <a href=\"https://docs.kali.org/general-use/kali-linux-virtual-box-guest\">VirtualBox</a> and install the necessary packages to give you the best experience possible. However, if you have upgraded Kali rather than doing a fresh install, and never got around to installing these packages, the process has been automated by just running <code class=\"codecolorer text default\"><span class=\"text\">kali-setup</span></code>. This program will have more functionally at a later date.â€‹</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you use Kali in a VirtualBox, please ensure you allocate 32 MB or more video memory to the VM, otherwise you may now run into some &#8220;interesting&#8221; issues where the screen is frozen after login through the graphical greeter, as if the computer had crashed, except that it&#8217;s working (you could confirm it by switching to another virtual terminal). If you are affected by this <a href=\"https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=934483\">problem</a>, you might see the following message from the kernel: <code class=\"codecolorer text default\"><span class=\"text\">[drm] Error -12 pinnning new fb, out of video mem?</span></code>.â€‹</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you are using Kali Linux via <a href=\"https://www.kali.org/news/announcing-kali-for-vagrant/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Vagrant</a>, the path has now changed.

Linux Containers are a great alternative to Virtual Machines, without the overhead.<br />\nThey are as awesome as docker containers but for entire systems, not just for single applications.</p>\n<p>We personally recommend using LXD on Ubuntu and LXC on other Linux distributions but that is purely personal preference as that is what is natively supported by those systems.</p>\n<p>We have published a dedicated page in our <a href=\"https://www.kali.org/docs/containers/kalilinux-lxc-images/\">Kali Linux Documentation site</a> with step-by-step guides on how to install containers in the following scenarios:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Kali Linux LXD container on Ubuntu host for running command line applications</li>\n<li>Kali Linux LXD container on Ubuntu host for running GUI applications</li>\n<li>Kali Linux LXC privileged container on Kali host</li>\n<li>Kali Linux LXC unprivileged container on Kali host</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let&#8217;s see how easy it is to launch a Kali LXD container image in Ubuntu:</p>\n<h2 id=\"setting-up-a-kali-linux-lxd-image-in-ubuntu\">Setting up a Kali Linux LXD Image in Ubuntu</h2>\n<p>Obviously, to get this running, you need LXD installed. In Ubuntu we can install LXD as a snap package. Once installed we launch a Kali Linux container image, install some additional packages and create a non-root user. The whole procedure should only take a few minutes before we can log in.</p>\n<div class=\"codecolorer-container text default\" style=\"overflow:auto;white-space:nowrap;border:1px solid #9F9F9F;width:435px;\"><div class=\"text codecolorer\" style=\"padding:5px;font:normal 12px/1.4em Monaco, Lucida Console, monospace;white-space:nowrap;\">## Install LXD<br />\nsudo snap install lxd<br />\nlxd init<br />\n<br />\n## Launch the container<br />\nlxc launch images:kali/current/amd64 my-kali<br />\n<br />\n## Install some additional applications, use either light or default<br />\nlxc exec my-kali -- passwd &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ## First things first<br />\nlxc exec my-kali -- apt install kali-linux-light &#160; ## Bare minimum<br />\nlxc exec my-kali -- apt install kali-linux-default ## Default set of packages<br />\n<br />\n## Setup non-root user<br />\nlxc exec my-kali -- adduser kali<br />\nlxc exec my-kali -- usermod -aG sudo kali<br />\nlxc exec my-kali -- sed -i '1 i\\TERM=xterm-256color' /home/kali/.bashrc<br />\nlxc exec my-kali -- sh -c &#34;echo 'Set disable_coredump false' &#62; /etc/sudo.conf&#34;<br />\n<br />\n## Login<br />\nlxc console my-kali</div></div>\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://www.kali.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/LXD-055_Ubuntu_KaliCliSession_DE.png\" alt=\"https://www.kali.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/LXD-055_Ubuntu_KaliCliSession_DE.png\" />\n</p>\n<p>Voila!

As a result, they feel very comfortable around the command line. We understand that “shells” are a very personal and precious thing to everyone (local or remote!), as that is how most people interact with Kali Linux. To the point where lots of experienced users only use a “GUI” to spin up multiple terminals. By default, Kali Linux has always used “bash” <em>(aka “Bourne-Again SHell”)</em> as the default shell, when you open up a terminal or console. Any seasoned Kali user would know the prompt <code class=\"codecolorer text default\"><span class=\"text\">kali@kali:~$</span></code> <em>(or <code class=\"codecolorer text default\"><span class=\"text\">root@kali:~#</span></code> for the older users!)</em> very well!</p> \n<p>Today, we are announcing the plan to switch over to <strong>ZSH shell</strong>. This is currently scheduled to be the <strong>default shell in 2020.4</strong> <em>(for this <strong>2020.3 release, bash will still be the default</strong>)</em>.</p> \n<p>If you have a <strong>fresh default install</strong> of Kali Linux 2020.3, you should have ZSH already installed <em>(if not, do <code class=\"codecolorer text default\"><span class=\"text\">sudo apt install -y zsh zsh-syntax-highlighting zsh-autosuggestions</span></code>)</em>, ready for a try. However if you installed an earlier version of Kali Linux and have <strong>upgraded to 2020.3</strong>, your user will be lacking the default ZSH configuration that we cooked with lots of love. So for upgrade users only, make sure to copy the configuration file:</p> \n<div class=\"codecolorer-container text default\" style=\"overflow:auto;white-space:nowrap;border:1px solid #9F9F9F;width:435px;\">\n <div class=\"text codecolorer\" style=\"padding:5px;font:normal 12px/1.4em Monaco, Lucida Console, monospace;white-space:nowrap;\">\n  kali@kali:~$ cp /etc/skel/.zshrc ~/\n  <br /> kali@kali:~$\n </div>\n</div> \n<p>Then all you need to do is switch to ZSH:</p> \n<div class=\"codecolorer-container text default\" style=\"overflow:auto;white-space:nowrap;border:1px solid #9F9F9F;width:435px;\">\n <div class=\"text codecolorer\" style=\"padding:5px;font:normal 12px/1.4em Monaco, Lucida Console, monospace;white-space:nowrap;\">\n  kali@kali:~$ zsh\n  <br /> â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliã‰¿kali)-[~]\n  <br /> â””â”€$\n </div>\n</div> \n<p><a ref=\"magnificPopup\" href=\"https://www.kali.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/release-2020.3-zsh.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://www.kali.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/release-2020.3-zsh.png\" alt=\"\" /></a></p> \n<p>If you like what you see, you can <strong>set ZSH as your default</strong> <em>(replacing bash)</em> by doing <code class=\"codecolorer text default\"><span class=\"text\">chsh -s /bin/zsh</span></code>. <em>Which is what we will be doing in 2020.4</em>.</p> \n<p>We wanted to give the community a notice before this switch happens. This is a very large change (some may argue larger than the <a href=\"https://www.kali.org/news/kali-linux-2019-4-release/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gnome to Xfce switch last year</a>). <strong>We are also looking for <a href=\"https://bugs.kali.org/main_page.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">feedback</a></strong>. We hope we have the right balance of design and functionality, but we know these typically donâ€™t get done perfect the first time. And, we don’t want to overload the default shell with too many features, as lower powered devices will then struggle or it may be hard to on the eyes to read. ZSH has been something we have wanted to do for a long time <em>(even before the switch over to <a href=\"https://www.kali.org/news/kali-linux-2019-4-release/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Xfce</a>!)</em>.</p> \n<p>We will be doing extensive testing during this next cycle so we reserve the right to delay the default change, or change direction all together. Again, we encourage you to provide <a href=\"https://bugs.kali.org/main_page.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">feedback</a> on this process. There is no way we can cover every use case on our own, so <strong>your help is important</strong>.</p> \n<hr /> \n<p><strong>Q.) Why did you make the switch? What’s wrong with bash?</strong> A.) You can do a lot of advanced things with bash, and customize it to do even more, but ZSH allows you to do even more. This was one really large selling point.</p> \n<p><strong>Q.) Why did you pick ZSH and not fish?</strong> A.) In the discussion of switching shells, one of the options that came up is Fish <em>(Friendly Interactive SHell)</em>. Fish is a nice shell <em>(probably nicer than ZSH)</em>, but realistically it was not a real consideration due to the fact that it is not POSIX compatible. This would cause a lot of issues, as common one-liners just wonâ€™t work.</p> \n<p><strong>Q.) Are you going to use any ZSH frameworks (e.g. Oh-My-ZSH or Prezto)?</strong> A.) At this point in time, by default, no. The weight of these would not be workable for lower powered devices. You can still install them yourself afterwards <em>(as many of our team do)</em>.</p> \n<h2><a id=\"user-content-win-kex\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://www.kali.org/?p=4179#win-kex\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a>Win-KeX</h2> \n<p>Having Kali Linux on “Windows Subsystem for Linux” (WSL) is something <a href=\"https://www.kali.org/tutorials/kali-on-the-windows-subsystem-for-linux/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">we have been taking advantage of</a> since it came out. With the release of <a href=\"https://www.kali.org/news/wsl2-and-kali/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">WSLv2</a>, the overall functionality and user experience improved dramatically.</p> \n<p>Today, the experience is improving once more with the introduction of <strong>Win-KeX</strong> (Windows + Kali Desktop EXperience). After installing it, typing in <code class=\"codecolorer text default\"><span class=\"text\">kex</span></code>, or clicking on the button, Win-KeX will give you a <strong>persistent-session GUI</strong>.</p> \n<p><a ref=\"magnificPopup\" href=\"https://www.kali.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/release-2020.3-win-kex.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://www.kali.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/release-2020.3-win-kex.png\" alt=\"\" /></a></p> \n<p>After getting WSL installed <em>(there’s countless guides online, or you can follow <a href=\"https://www.kali.org/docs/wsl/win-kex/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ours</a>)</em>, you can install <code class=\"codecolorer text default\"><span class=\"text\">Win-KeX</span></code> by doing the following:</p> \n<div class=\"codecolorer-container text default\" style=\"overflow:auto;white-space:nowrap;border:1px solid #9F9F9F;width:435px;\">\n <div class=\"text codecolorer\" style=\"padding:5px;font:normal 12px/1.4em Monaco, Lucida Console, monospace;white-space:nowrap;\">\n  sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt install -y kali-win-kex\n </div>\n</div> \n<p>Afterwards, if you want to make a shortcut, follow our <a href=\"https://www.kali.org/docs/wsl/win-kex/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">guide</a>, or you can just type in <code class=\"codecolorer text default\"><span class=\"text\">kex</span></code>!</p> \n<p>On the subject of <strong>WSL</strong> (and this is true for <strong>Docker</strong> and <strong>AWS EC2</strong>) something we have seen a bit is after getting a desktop environment, people have noticed the tools are not “there”. This is because they are <strong>not included by default</strong>, to keep the image as small as possible. You either need to manually install them one by one, or grab the <a href=\"https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/metapackages/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">default metapackage</a> to get all the tools from out-of-the-box: <code class=\"codecolorer text default\"><span class=\"text\">sudo apt install -y kali-linux-default</span></code></p> \n<p>Please note, Win-KeX does require <strong>WSL v2 on x64</strong> as it’s not compatible with WSL v1, or arm64.</p> \n<p>For more information, please see <a href=\"https://www.kali.org/docs/wsl/win-kex/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">our documentation page</a></p> \n<h2><a id=\"user-content-automating-hidpi\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://www.kali.org/?p=4179#automating-hidpi\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a>Automating HiDPI</h2> \n<p>HiDPI displays are getting more and more common. Unfortunately, Linux support, out of the box, hasn’t been great <em>(older Linux users may remember a time where this was very common for a lot of hardware changes.)</em>. Which means after doing a fresh install, there is a bit of tweaking required to get it working, otherwise the font/text/display may be very small to read. We have <a href=\"https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/hidpi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">had a guide</a> out explaining the process required to get it working, but the process before was a little “fiddly”. <strong>We wanted to do better</strong>.</p> \n<p>So we made <strong>kali-hidpi-mode</strong>. Now, either typing in <code class=\"codecolorer text default\"><span class=\"text\">kali-hidpi-mode</span></code> or selecting it from the menu <em>(as shown below)</em>, should automate switching between HiDPI modes.</p> \n<p><a ref=\"magnificPopup\" href=\"https://www.kali.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/release-2020.3-hidpi.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://www.kali.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/release-2020.3-hidpi.gif\" alt=\"\" /></a></p> \n<h2><a id=\"user-content-tool-icons\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://www.kali.org/?p=4179#tool-icons\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a>Tool Icons</h2> \n<p>Over the last few releases, we have been showing the progress on getting more themed icons for tools.

This is done to make sure that you have the latest packages on first boot. And that step can <strong>take a very long time</strong>, especially after a few months after a release when <strong>lots of updates</strong> have accumulated. <strong>Starting with 2020.3, we disabled the network mirror in the full installer</strong> so that you always get the <strong>same installation speed</strong>, and the <strong>same packages and versions</strong> for that release <em>– just make sure to <a href=\"https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/updating-kali/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">update</a> after installing</em>!</p> \n<p>Whilst we were at it, we fixed another related issue. If you didn’t have network access <em>(either voluntarily or otherwise)</em> during installation, you would get an empty <a href=\"https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/kali-linux-sources-list-repositories/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">network repository</a> (<code class=\"codecolorer text default\"><span class=\"text\">/etc/apt/sources.list</span></code>). This means, you would not be able to use <code class=\"codecolorer text default\"><span class=\"text\">apt</span></code> to install additional packages. While there might be some users who will never have network, we believe that it’s best to actually configure that file in <strong>all cases</strong>. <strong>So that’s what we did</strong>. By default, any fresh installs going forward after 2020.3 will have <strong>network repositories pre-defined</strong>.</p> \n<h2><a id=\"user-content-arm-device-updates\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://www.kali.org/?p=4179#arm-device-updates\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a>ARM Device Updates</h2> \n<p>We have (along with the work of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/frangalinux\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Francisco Jose RodrÃ­guez Martos</a> who did a lot of the back end changes) refreshed our <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/build-scripts/kali-arm\">build-scripts for our ARM devices</a>. We <a href=\"https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-arm-images/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pre-generated various different ARM images</a> <em>(as of 2020.3 – 19 images)</em> to allow for quick download and deployment, but we have build scripts for more <em>(as of 2020.3 – 39 images)</em>. If your device is not one of ones that we release images for, you’ll need to use the scripts to self generate the image.</p> \n<p>Notable changes in ARM’s 2020.3 release:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>All of the ARM images</strong> come with <strong><code class=\"codecolorer text default\"><span class=\"text\">kali-linux-default</span></code> <a href=\"https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/metapackages/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">metapackage</a></strong> installed, bringing them in line with the rest of our releases, so <strong>more tools are available when you first boot</strong></li> \n <li>We have <strong>reduced the size of all our ARM images</strong> that are created, so downloads should be smaller. However, you will still need to use <strong>at least a 16GB</strong> sdcard/USB drive/eMMC</li> \n <li><strong>Pinebook</strong> and <strong>Pinebook Pro</strong> images can now be used on <strong>either sdcard or eMMC</strong></li> \n <li>The <strong>Pinebook</strong> image now has the WiFi driver built during image creation, instead of on first boot, this should <strong>speed up first boot time</strong> massively</li> \n <li>The <strong>Pinebook Pro</strong> has a change from the upstream firmware, which changes <code class=\"codecolorer text default\"><span class=\"text\">ccode=DE</span></code> to <code class=\"codecolorer text default\"><span class=\"text\">ccode=all</span></code> – this allows <strong>access to more 2.4GHz and 5GHz</strong> channels</li> \n <li>The <strong>64-bit RaspberryPi</strong> images now have the RaspberryPi <strong>userland utilities</strong> built during image creation, so <code class=\"codecolorer text default\"><span class=\"text\">vcgencmd</span></code> and various other utilities that were previously only available on the 32-bit image are now usable on 64-bit as well</li> \n <li>The <strong>ODROID-C2</strong> image now uses the Kali kernel, instead of a vendor provided one. This means in the future, an <code class=\"codecolorer text default\"><span class=\"text\">apt dist-upgrade</span></code> will get you kernel updates instead of waiting for a new Kali release</li> \n <li>The <code class=\"codecolorer text default\"><span class=\"text\">/etc/fstab</span></code> file now <strong>includes the root partition via UUID</strong>, this should make it <strong>easier when trying to use a USB drive</strong> instead of sdcard on devices that support it</li> \n</ul> \n<p>A few things which are work in progress:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>RaspberryPi</strong> images are using 4.19 kernels. We would like to move to 5.4 however, <code class=\"codecolorer text default\"><span class=\"text\">nexmon</span></code> isn’t working properly with it <em>(as the new kernel requires firmware version =&gt; 7.45.202)</em> for which <a href=\"https://github.com/seemoo-lab/nexmon/issues/423\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">no nexmon patch exists yet</a></li> \n <li>There is a new <strong>USBArmory Mk2</strong> <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/build-scripts/kali-arm\">build script</a>. We don’t have the hardware to test it however, so we are looking for community feedback who is able to test it out</li> \n <li><strong>Veyron</strong> image will be released at a later date to kernel issues that haven’t yet been tracked down</li> \n</ul> \n<h2><a id=\"user-content-desktop-environment\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://www.kali.org/?p=4179#desktop-environment\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a>Desktop Environment</h2> \n<p>As there has been minor update to Gnome, we have been taking some advantages of the new settings:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>GNOME’s file manager <code class=\"codecolorer text default\"><span class=\"text\">nautilus</span></code> has a new theme</li> \n <li>GNOME’s system-monitor now matches the colors and also has stacked CPU charts</li> \n <li>Improved the design for “nested headerbars” <em>(example, in the Settings Window, where the left headerbar is joined with the side-navbar)</em></li> \n</ul> \n<p><a ref=\"magnificPopup\" href=\"https://www.kali.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/release-2020.3-gnome.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://www.kali.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/release-2020.3-gnome.png\" alt=\"Gnome\" /></a></p> \n<h2><a id=\"user-content-community-shoutouts\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://www.kali.org/?p=4179#community-shoutouts\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a>Community Shoutouts</h2> \n<p>A new section in the release notes, community shoutouts.

So let’s cover that first.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">An update to the desktop environment has been a long time coming. We have been talking about how to address this, what we wanted to do, experimenting on different approaches, and so on for months now. As a summary we had a few issues we wanted to address head-on:</p> \n<ul dir=\"auto\" data-sourcepos=\"27:1-32:0\"> \n <li data-sourcepos=\"27:1-28:0\">Performance issues – Gnome is a fully-featured desktop environment with a ton of awesome things it can do. But all these features comes with overhead, often overhead that is not useful for a distribution like Kali. We wanted to speed things up, and have a desktop environment that does only what it’s needed for, and nothing else. Gnome has been overkill for most Kali users, as many just want a window manager that allows you to run multiple terminal windows at once, and a web browser.</li> \n <li data-sourcepos=\"29:1-30:0\">Fractured user experience – We support a range of hardware, from the very high end to the very low. Because of this, traditionally our lower-end ARM builds have had a completely different UI than our standard. That’s not optimal, and we wanted to unify this experience so it did not matter if you were running on a bare metal install on a high end laptop or using a Raspberry Pi, the UI should be the same.</li> \n <li data-sourcepos=\"31:1-32:0\">Modern look – We have been using the same UI for quite a while now, and our old theme maintainer had moved on due to lack of time. So we wanted to go with something fresh, new, and modern.</li> \n</ul> \n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To help us address these items, we tracked down <a href=\"https://drasite.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">Daniel Ruiz de AlegrÃ­a</a> and started the development of a new theme running on Xfce. Why Xfce? After reviewing the above issues, we felt that Xfce addressed them best while still being accessible to the majority of users.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The solution we’ve committed to is lightweight and can run on all levels of Kali installs. It is functional in that it handles the various needs of the average user with no changes. It is approachable where it uses standard UI concepts we are all familiar with to ensure there is no learning curve. And it looks great with modern UI elements that make efficient use of screen space.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We are really excited about this UI update, and we think you are going to love it. However, as UI can be a bit like religion, if you don’t want to leave Gnome don’t worry. We still have a Gnome build for you, with a few changes already in place. As time goes by, we will be making changes to all of the desktop environments we release installs to get them “close” to a similar user experience no matter what DE you run. There will be limits to this, as we don’t have the resources to heavily invest in tweaking all these different environments. So if there is something you would like to see, feel free to submit a <a href=\"https://bugs.kali.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">feature request</a>!</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We have also released a FAQ about the new theme that you can find on our <a href=\"https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/xfce-faq/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">docs page</a>. This includes some common items like how to switch to the theme on your existing install, how to change off of it if you don’t like it, and so on.</p> \n<h3><a id=\"user-content-kali-undercover\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://www.kali.org/?p=3486#kali-undercover\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a>Kali Undercover</h3> \n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With the change to the environment, we thought we would take a side step and do something fun. Thanks to Robert, who leads our penetration testing team, for suggesting a Kali theme that looks like Windows to the casual view, we have created the Kali Undercover theme.</p> \n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3503 size-full\" style=\"max-width: 600px; width: 100%;\" src=\"https://www.kali.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/kali-undercover-1.gif\" alt=\"kali-undercover\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Say you are working in a public place, hacking away, and you might not want the distinctive Kali dragon for everyone to see and wonder what it is you are doing. So, we made a little script that will change your Kali theme to look like a default Windows installation. That way, you can work a bit more incognito. After you are done and in a more private place, run the script again and you switch back to your Kali theme. Like magic!</p> \n<h3><a id=\"user-content-kali-docs-is-now-on-markdown-and-new-home-docs\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://www.kali.org/?p=3486#kali-docs-is-now-on-markdown-and-new-home-docs\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a>Kali-Docs is now on Markdown and new home (/docs/)</h3> \n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This may not be as flashy as the new theme, but the changes to the docs we have done is just as significant.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One of our go-forward goals with Kali is to move more of the development into the public and make it as easy as possible for anyone <em>(that means you!)</em> to get involved and contribute to Kali. That’s what our move to GitLab <a href=\"https://www.kali.org/news/kali-linux-roadmap-2019-2020/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">earlier in the year</a> was all about. Another part of this is changing how we deal with docs.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We have since moved all of our documentation into Markdown in a <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/documentation/kali-docs\">public Git repository</a>. From here on out anyone, not just Kali staff, can contribute to better documentation through merge requests. We will still approve any content changes, but once merged, changes will be automatically available on the docs section of our website.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We encourage everyone to get involved! If you see something wrong in the existing docs, change it! If you have an idea for new docs, write it! These sorts of contributions make Kali better for everyone.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is just the first step. With this change in place, coming soon watch for a kali-docs package in Kali that gives you full offline access to the documentation on every install of Kali. Perfect for those situations where you are working in a closed-off environment with no Internet access.</p> \n<h3><a id=\"user-content-public-packaging\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://www.kali.org/?p=3486#public-packaging\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a>Public Packaging</h3> \n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One of the more significant new documents we have done is <a href=\"https://www.kali.org/docs/development/public-packaging/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">documenting how you can make a new package</a> that will get included in Kali.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One of the most common bug reports is requests for us to add new tools or update existing ones. Oftentimes, by the tool developers themselves as they recognize that having their tool in the Kali repo is the easiest distribution channel for security assessment tools there is. The volume of this has always been difficult to keep up with, and we have to make some hard decisions on where to commit our limited resources.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now with this work-flow in place and documented, you don’t have to wait on us. Go ahead and package up your tool and submit it off to us for approval. This is an awesome way to get involved with improving Kali.</p> \n<h3><a id=\"user-content-btrfs-during-setup\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://www.kali.org/?p=3486#btrfs-during-setup\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a>BTRFS during setup</h3> \n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another significant new addition to the documentation is the <a href=\"https://www.kali.org/docs/base-images/kali-linux-btrfs-install/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">use of BTRFS as your root file system</a>. This is an amazing approach documented by Re4son, that when done gives you the ability to do file system rollbacks after upgrades.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When you are in a VM and about to try something new, you will often take a snapshot in case things go wrong you can easily go back to a known-good state. However, when you run Kali bare metal that’s not so easy. So you end up being extra careful, or if things go wrong have a lot of manual clean up to do. With BTRFS, you have this same snapshot capability on a bare metal install!</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As this is new, it’s not integrated into our installer yet. Once we get some feedback on how it’s working for everyone, the next step is to streamline this and make it an easier option in our installer. So if you try it out, be sure to let us know how it works for you!</p> \n<h3><a id=\"user-content-powershell\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://www.kali.org/?p=3486#powershell\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a>PowerShell</h3> \n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On to other features, in case you missed it PowerShell is now in Kali. This has been really great to bring the ability to execute PowerShell scripts directly on Kali.</p> \n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3522 size-full\" style=\"max-width: 600px; width: 100%;\" title=\"apt install powershell\" src=\"https://www.kali.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/power-shell-1-1.png\" alt=\"apt install powershell\" srcset=\"https://www.kali.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/power-shell-1-1.png 749w, https://www.kali.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/power-shell-1-1-300x225.png 300w, https://www.kali.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/power-shell-1-1-600x450.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px\" /></p> \n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3524 size-full\" style=\"max-width: 600px; width: 100%;\" title=\"Type: &quot;pwsh&quot; to enter PowerShell prompt\" src=\"https://www.kali.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/kali-pwsh-powershell-1.png\" alt=\"Type: &quot;pwsh&quot; to enter PowerShell prompt\" srcset=\"https://www.kali.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/kali-pwsh-powershell-1.png 749w, https://www.kali.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/kali-pwsh-powershell-1-300x225.png 300w, https://www.kali.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/kali-pwsh-powershell-1-600x450.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px\" /></p> \n<h3><a id=\"user-content-nethunter-kex-full-kali-desktop-on-android-phones\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://www.kali.org/?p=3486#nethunter-kex-full-kali-desktop-on-android-phones\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a>NetHunter Kex – Full Kali Desktop on Android phones</h3> \n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another feature we are super excited about is the introduction of NetHunter Kex. In a nutshell, this allows you to attach your Android device to an HDMI output along with Bluetooth keyboard and mouse and get a full, no compromise, Kali desktop. Yes. From your phone.</p> \n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3529\" style=\"max-width: 600px; width: 100%;\" src=\"https://www.kali.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/kali-kex-theme.gif\" alt=\"KeX new Theme\" /></p> \n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We had a live <a href=\"https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">Penetration Testing with Kali</a> course we were teaching, and NetHunter Kex was just in a beta stage. So we wanted to really push the limits. So, in the live course, what we did was attach a USB-C hub to our OnePlus7. This gave us HDMI and Ethernet access. We attached the HDMI to the projector and used a bluetooth keyboard/mouse. With this, we were able to do an entire PWK module from the phone.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is a feature you have to see to believe. Until you experience it, you won’t fully understand what this provides.

This means if you wanted powershell, you had to install the package as a one off by doing:</p>\n<div class=\"codecolorer-container text default\" style=\"overflow:auto;white-space:nowrap;border:1px solid #9F9F9F;width:435px;\"><div class=\"text codecolorer\" style=\"padding:5px;font:normal 12px/1.4em Monaco, Lucida Console, monospace;white-space:nowrap;\">kali@kali:~$ sudo apt install -y powershell</div></div>\n<p>We now have put PowerShell into one of our (primary) <a href=\"https://tools.kali.org/kali-metapackages\">metapackages</a>, <code class=\"codecolorer text default\"><span class=\"text\">kali-linux-large</span></code>. This means, if you choose to install this metapackage during system setup, or once Kali is up and running <em>(<code class=\"codecolorer text default\"><span class=\"text\">sudo apt install -y kali-linux-large</span></code>)</em>, if PowerShell is compatible with your architecture, you can just jump straight into it <em>(<code class=\"codecolorer text default\"><span class=\"text\">pwsh</span></code>)</em>!</p>\n<p>PowerShell isn&#8217;t in <em>the default</em> metapackage <em>(that&#8217;s <code class=\"codecolorer text default\"><span class=\"text\">kali-linux-default</span></code>)</em>, but it is in the one that includes the default and many extras, and can be included during system setup.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"kali-on-arm-improvements\">Kali on ARM Improvements</h2>\n<p>With <a href=\"https://www.kali.org/releases/kali-linux-2020-1-release/\">Kali Linux 2020.1</a>, desktop images no longer used &#8220;root/toor&#8221; as the <a href=\"https://www.kali.org/docs/introduction/default-credentials/\">default credentials</a> to login, but had moved to &#8220;kali/kali&#8221;. Our ARM images are now the same. We are no longer using the super user account to login with.</p>\n<p>We also warned back in <a href=\"https://www.kali.org/news/kali-linux-2019-4-release/\">2019.4</a> that we would be moving away from a 8GB minimum SD card, and we are finally ready to pull the trigger on this. The requirement is now 16GB or larger.</p>\n<p>One last note on the subject of ARM devices, we are not installing <code class=\"codecolorer text default\"><span class=\"text\">locales-all</span></code> any more, so we highly recommend that you set your locale. This can be done by running the following command, <code class=\"codecolorer text default\"><span class=\"text\">sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales</span></code>, then log out and back in.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"lessons-from-installer-changes\">Lessons From Installer Changes</h2>\n<p>With <a href=\"https://www.kali.org/releases/kali-linux-2020-1-release/\">Kali Linux 2020.1</a> we announced our new style of images, &#8220;installer&#8221; &#38; &#8220;live&#8221;.</p>\n<p><strong>Issue</strong> It was intended that both &#8220;installer&#8221; &#38; &#8220;live&#8221; could be customized during setup, to select which metapackage and desktop environment to use. When we did that, we couldn&#8217;t include metapackages beyond default in those images, as it would create too large of an ISO. As the packages were not in the image, if you selected anything other than the default options it would require network access to obtain the missing packages beyond default. After release, we noticed some users selecting &#8220;everything&#8221; and then waiting hours for installs to happen. They couldn&#8217;t understand why the installs where taking so long.</p>\n<p>We also have used different software on the back end to generate these images, and a few bugs slipped through the cracks (which explains the <a href=\"https://bugs.kali.org/view.php?id=6053\">2020.1a</a> and 2020.1b releases).</p>\n<p><strong>Solutions</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>We have removed <code class=\"codecolorer text default\"><span class=\"text\">kali-linux-everything</span></code> as an install time option (which is <em>every</em> package in the Kali Linux repository) in the installer image, as you can imagine that would have taken a long time to download and wait for during install</li>\n<li>We have cached <code class=\"codecolorer text default\"><span class=\"text\">kali-linux-large</span></code> &#38; every desktop environment into the install image (which is why its a little larger than previous to download) &#8211; allowing for a <strong>COMPLETE</strong> offline network install</li>\n<li>We have removed customization for &#8220;live&#8221; images &#8211; the installer switched back to copying the content of the live filesystem allowing again full offline install but forcing usage of our default XFCE desktop</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.kali.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/release-2020.2-setup.png\" style=\"width:100%;\" alt=\"release-2020.2-setup\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are wanting to run Kali from a live image (DVD or USB stick), please use &#8220;live&#8221;</li>\n<li>If you are wanting anything else, please use &#8220;installer&#8221;</li>\n<li>If you are wanting anything other than XFCE as your desktop environment, please use &#8220;installer&#8221;</li>\n<li><strong>If you are not sure, get &#8220;installer&#8221;</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also, please keep in mind on an actual assessment &#8220;more&#8221; is not always &#8220;better&#8221;. There are very few reasons to install <code class=\"codecolorer text default\"><span class=\"text\">kali-linux-everything</span></code>, and many reasons not too. To those of you that were selecting this option, we highly suggest you <a href=\"https://kali.training/\">take some time and educate yourself on Kali</a> before using it. Kali, or any other pentest distribution, is not a &#8220;turn key auto hack&#8221; solution. You still need to learn your platform, learn your tools, and educate yourself in general.</p>\n<p>Consider what you are really telling Kali to do when you are installing <code class=\"codecolorer text default\"><span class=\"text\">kali-linux-everything</span></code>. Its similar to if you went into your phones app store and said &#8220;install everything!&#8221;. Thats likely not to have good results. We provide a lot of powerful tools and options in Kali, and while we may have a reputation of &#8220;Providing machine guns to monkeys&#8221;, but we actually expect you to know what you are doing. Kali is not going to hold your hand. It expects you to do the work of learning and Kali will be unforgiving if you don&#8217;t.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"new-key-packages-icons\">New Key Packages &#38; Icons</h2>\n<p>Just like every Kali Linux release, we include the latest packages possible. Key ones to point out this release are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://pkg.kali.org/pkg/meta-gnome3\">GNOME 3.36</a> &#8211; a few of you may have noticed a bug that slipped in during the first 12 hours of the update being available. We&#8217;re sorry about this, and have measures in place for it to not happen again</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://pkg.kali.org/pkg/joplin\">Joplin</a> &#8211; we are planning on replacing <a href=\"http://pkg.kali.org/pkg/cherrytree\">CherryTree</a> with this in Kali Linux 2020.3!</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://pkg.kali.org/pkg/nextnet\">Nextnet</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://pkg.kali.org/pkg/python3-defaults\">Python 3.8</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://pkg.kali.org/pkg/spiderfoot\">SpiderFoot</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the time being, as a temporary measure due to certain tools needing it, we have re-included <code class=\"codecolorer text default\"><span class=\"text\">python2-pip</span></code>. Python 2 has now reached &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.kali.org/news/python-2-end-of-life/\">End Of Life</a>&#8221; and is no longer getting updated. Tool makers, please, please, <strong>please</strong> port to Python 3. Users of tools, if you notice that a tool is not Python 3 yet, you can help too! It is not going to be around forever.</p>\n<p>Whilst talking about packages, we have also started to refresh our package logos for each tool. You&#8217;ll notice them in the Kali Linux menu, as well as the tools page on <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/packages/\">GitLab</a><em>(more information on this coming soon!)</em></p>\n<p><a ref=\"magnificPopup\" href=\"https://www.kali.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/release-2020.2-icons.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.kali.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/release-2020.2-icons.png\" alt=\"release-2020.2-icons\" style=\"width:100%;\" /></a></p>\n<p>If your tool has a logo and we have missed it, please let us know on the <a href=\"https://bugs.kali.org/bug_report_page.php\">bug tracker</a>.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"wslconf\">WSLconf</h2>\n<p>WSLconf happened earlier this year, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/steevdave\">@steev</a> gave a 35 minute talk on &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8m6tKErjAI\">How We Use WSL at Kali</a>&#8220;.

This includes a new ARM build server and what we use for <a href=\"https://autopkgtest.kali.org/\">package testing</a>.</p>\n<p>This may not be directly noticeable, but you may reap the benefits of it! If you are wanting to help out with Kali, we have added a new section to our documentation showing how to submit a <a href=\"https://kali.org/docs/development/contributing-runtime-tests\">autopkgtest</a>. Feedback is welcome!</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"kali-linux-nethunter\">Kali Linux NetHunter</h2>\n<p>We were so excited about some of the work that has been happening with NetHunter recently, we already did a <a href=\"https://www.kali.org/news/kali-nethunter-updates/\">mid-term release</a> to showcase them and get it to you as quick as possible.</p>\n<p>On top of all the previous NetHunter news there is even more to announce this time around!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nexmon support has been revived, bringing WiFi monitor support and frame injection to <code class=\"codecolorer text default\"><span class=\"text\">wlan0</span></code> on the Nexus 6P, Nexus 5, Sony Xperia Z5 Compact, and more!</li>\n<li>OpenPlus 3T images have been added to the download page.</li>\n<li>We have crossed <a href=\"https://kalilinux.gitlab.io/nethunter/build-scripts/kali-nethunter-devices/nethunter-kernelstats.html\">160 different kernels in our repository</a>, allowing NetHunter to <a href=\"https://kalilinux.gitlab.io/nethunter/build-scripts/kali-nethunter-devices/nethunter-kernels.html\">support over 64 devices</a>! Yes, over 160 kernels and over 64 devices supported. Amazing.</li>\n<li>Our documentation page has <a href=\"https://www.kali.org/docs/nethunter/\">received a well deserved refresh</a>, especially the kernel development section.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One of the most common questions to come in about NetHunter is &#8220;What device should I run it on?&#8221;. Keep your <a href=\"https://kalilinux.gitlab.io/nethunter/build-scripts/kali-nethunter-devices/nethunter-images.html\">eye on this page</a> to see what your options are on an automatically updated basis!</p>\n<p>When you think about the amount of power NetHunter provides in such a compact package, it really is mind blowing.
