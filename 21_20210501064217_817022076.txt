There&#8217;s also already a sequel in the works.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-669348\"></span></p>\n<p>Deadline is reporting that Netflix picked up U.S. distribution rights for <em>Gunpowder Milkshake</em>, an action movie from director <strong>Navot Papushado</strong>. The film will head to Netflix this summer in the U.S., while &#8220;Studiocanal fully financed and will retain the international rights where they plan to distribute the film in their home territories with a planned international theatrical roll out around the world.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Karen Gillan, Lena Headey, Angela Bassett, <strong>Paul Giamatti</strong>, Carla Gugino, Michelle Yeoh, and <strong>Chloe Coleman</strong> star in the movie, which follows &#8220;three generations of female assassins who fight to stop a vicious cycle of violence that has haunted their lives.&#8221; The entire movie takes place over the course of one night. <strong>Ehud Lavski</strong> and Navot Papushado wrote the script. Here&#8217;s a more detailed synopsis:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Sam (Karen Gillan) was only 12 years old when her mother Scarlet (Lena Headey), an elite assassin, was forced to abandon her. Sam was raised by The Firm, the ruthless crime syndicate her mother worked for. Now, 15 years later, Sam has followed in her mother’s footsteps and grown into a fierce hit-woman. She uses her &#8220;talents&#8221; to clean up The Firm’s most dangerous messes. She&#8217;s as efficient as she is loyal.</p>\n<p>But when a high-risk job goes wrong, Sam must choose between serving The Firm and protecting the life of an innocent 8-year-old girl – Emily (Chloe Coleman). With a target on her back, Sam has only one chance to survive: Reunite with her mother and her lethal associates: The Librarians (Angela Bassett, Michelle Yeoh and Carla Gugino).  These three generations of women must now learn to trust each other, stand up to The Firm and their army of henchmen, and raise hell against those who could take everything from them.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In addition to this distribution news, Deadline also adds that a sequel is already in the works, so Netflix is obviously hoping for a full-blown action franchise here. Franchises are becoming the name of the game for the streaming giant – they recently shelled out a ton of money for <em>Knives Out 2</em> and <em>Knives Out 3</em>, and they&#8217;re also planning franchises around the Chris Hemsworth movie <em>Extraction</em> and the Charlize Theron comic book adaptation <em>The Old Guard</em>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/gunpowder-milkshake-netflix/\">&#8216;Gunpowder Milkshake&#8217; With Karen Gillan, Lena Headey, Angela Bassett, Michelle Yeoh, and Carla Gugino Goes to Netflix</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=4y9UsAVYrEw:8Ja0QMlTmp0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=4y9UsAVYrEw:8Ja0QMlTmp0:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=4y9UsAVYrEw:8Ja0QMlTmp0:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=4y9UsAVYrEw:8Ja0QMlTmp0:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=4y9UsAVYrEw:8Ja0QMlTmp0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=4y9UsAVYrEw:8Ja0QMlTmp0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/4y9UsAVYrEw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 30 Apr 2021 20:30:49 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/gunpowder-milkshake-netflix-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"5c800b65b69f572864cc78f666702095","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn20@2020_5/2021/05/01/06-41-51-714_23b64bd6c0c5b50f.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":38883,"destBytes":23956,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/gunpowder-milkshake-netflix-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn20@2020_5/2021/05/01/06-41-51-714_23b64bd6c0c5b50f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn63@2020_5/2021/05/01/06-42-16-370_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=4y9UsAVYrEw:8Ja0QMlTmp0:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn100@2020_6/2021/05/01/06-42-16-617_f5f8afa6dd32fee5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn84@2020_6/2021/05/01/06-42-16-819_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=4y9UsAVYrEw:8Ja0QMlTmp0:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn78@2020_5/2021/05/01/06-42-16-099_db73519dcd3ee4ff.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/4y9UsAVYrEw":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn63@2020_2/2021/05/01/06-42-16-858_eb5cf284699c951f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1619851311494},{"createdTime":"2021-05-01 14:41:51","updatedTime":"2021-05-01 14:41:51","title":"Daily Podcast: Green Lantern Casting, F9, The Doubtful Guest, a Pixar Interview, and More","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=669415","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-669416 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Green-Lantern-1-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Green-Lantern-1.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Green-Lantern-1-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the April 30, 2021 episode of /Film Daily, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">/Film senior writer </span><b>Ben Pearson</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is joined by writer </span><b>Chris Evangelista</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to talk about the latest film and TV news, including </span><b><i>Green Lantern</i></b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> casting, </span><b><i>The Doubtful Guest</i></b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><b><i>Twilight of the Dead</i></b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and </span><b><i>F9</i></b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

That movie is about to get released in the United States, and you can check out the trailer below.<span id=\"more-668988\"></span></p>\n<h2>Port Authority Trailer</h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dk7EvEjZ-Mw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>This movie had its world premiere at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival, but is now finally about to make its way back across the pond to the United States. It&#8217;s written and directed by <strong>Danielle Lessovitz</strong>, a multi-hyphenate who made her feature debut here and who is seemingly able to capture a vibrant, vivacious, pulsing story of life and love against that Big Apple backdrop.</p>\n<p>Lessovitz has said in interviews that the film celebrates the idea of &#8220;the family that&#8217;s chosen&#8221; as opposed to family that one is born into, and you can see that in the way this trailer depicts the trans characters of color in the city&#8217;s underground &#8220;voguing&#8221; scene (which is also explored in the FX series <em>Pose</em>).</p>\n<p>This looks like a great showcase for Bloom, and hopefully it will lead to even bigger projects for her. It may also give audiences a bigger picture of what Whitehead can do as a performer, since his starring role in Christopher Nolan&#8217;s <em>Dunkirk</em> did not, by design, allow for much modulation or dynamism and essentially made him feel like one of many interchangeable players caught up in a scenario much larger than themselves. This looks more like a classic indie film performance, though, see-sawing between violent outbursts out and touching love scenes.</p>\n<p>Here is the official synopsis for <em>Port Authority</em>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>After getting kicked out of his home in central Pennsylvania, Paul (Fionn Whitehead) arrives to NYC&#8217;s dizzying central station with nowhere to go. A momentary encounter with Wye (Leyna Bloom), a trans woman of color, leads him to seek her out. Transfixed by her beauty and confidence, a love soon blossoms. But as the two learn more about each other, Paul&#8217;s false narratives begin to surface and the double life he lives must be reconciled.</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>Port Authority</em> is set to arrive in theaters on <strong>May 28</strong>, <strong>2021</strong>, and hit On Demand and Digital platforms on <strong>June 1</strong>, <strong>2021</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/port-authority-trailer/\">&#8216;Port Authority&#8217; Trailer: Martin Scorsese Exec Produces This New York-Set Love Story</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=HPs9N0VHMIU:dqzRWuT_a8g:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=HPs9N0VHMIU:dqzRWuT_a8g:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=HPs9N0VHMIU:dqzRWuT_a8g:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=HPs9N0VHMIU:dqzRWuT_a8g:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=HPs9N0VHMIU:dqzRWuT_a8g:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=HPs9N0VHMIU:dqzRWuT_a8g:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/HPs9N0VHMIU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sat, 01 May 2021 00:00:49 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Port-Authority-trailer-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"c1eb97a81799e93c4dd06e0db7e2f520","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn14@2020_1/2021/05/01/06-42-03-689_6eda7a6d0c8d736f.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":22051,"destBytes":10800,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Port-Authority-trailer-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn14@2020_1/2021/05/01/06-42-03-689_6eda7a6d0c8d736f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn63@2020_5/2021/05/01/06-42-16-370_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=HPs9N0VHMIU:dqzRWuT_a8g:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn39@2020_4/2021/05/01/06-42-16-210_d42e8cc4d93f6ad6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn84@2020_6/2021/05/01/06-42-16-819_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=HPs9N0VHMIU:dqzRWuT_a8g:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn60@2020_6/2021/05/01/06-42-16-766_c030de105a2456b6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/HPs9N0VHMIU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn82@2020_4/2021/05/01/06-42-16-044_d06364210a6be5bd.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1619851311493},{"createdTime":"2021-05-01 14:41:51","updatedTime":"2021-05-01 14:41:51","title":"Casting News: Gal Gadot Will Star in ‘Meet Me In Another Life’, Florence Pugh Joins ‘The Wonder’","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=668977","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Meet-Me-In-Another-Life.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-668992\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Meet-Me-In-Another-Life-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"Meet Me In Another Life\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Meet-Me-In-Another-Life-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Meet-Me-In-Another-Life-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Meet-Me-In-Another-Life-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Meet-Me-In-Another-Life.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Gal Gadot</strong> and <strong>Florence Pugh</strong> are taking some time off from superhero movies to do other things. Gadot is set to star in<em> <strong>Meet Me In Another Life</strong></em>, based on the novel by Catriona Silvey about a man and a woman who keep meeting in alternate realities. Gadot will also produce the film under her production label Pilot Wave. Meanwhile, Pugh will star in<strong> <em>The</em> <em>Wonder</em> </strong>from <em>A Fantastic Woman </em>director <strong>Sebastián Lelio</strong>. Based on the novel by Emma Donoghue, the story is a psychological thriller about a nurse in the 1800s who travels to a small village to look into what might be a medical anomaly or a full-blown miracle.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-668977\"></span></p>\n<h2><strong>Meet Me In Another Life</strong></h2>\n<p>Deadline is reporting that Gal Gadot will produce and star in <em>Meet Me In Another Life</em>, based on the Catriona Silvey novel of the same name. The book was just published this week, so you might not have even heard of it yet. If not, here&#8217;s the synopsis:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Thora and Santi are strangers in a foreign city when a chance encounter intertwines their fates. At once, they recognize in each other a kindred spirit—someone who shares their insatiable curiosity, who is longing for more in life than the cards they’ve been dealt. Only days later, though, a tragic accident cuts their story short.</p>\n<p>But this is only one of the many connections they share. Like satellites trapped in orbit around each other, Thora and Santi are destined to meet again: as a teacher and brilliant student; a caretaker and dying patient; a cynic and believer. In alternating realities they become friends, colleagues, lovers, and enemies. As blurred memories and strange patterns compound, Thora and Santi come to a shocking revelation—they must discover the truth of their mysterious attachment before their many lives come to one, final end.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This kind of sounds like <em>The Adjustment Bureau</em>, an enjoyable movie no one saw. Gadot is producing under her Pilot Wave banner with Jaron Varsano. Gadot and Varsano released the following statement about the project: &#8220;Catriona’s characters are beautifully explored and deeply complex – their reincarnations sometimes bordering on taboo – that the payoff of their self-discovery feels genuine and earned. We’re thrilled to partner with Chuck Roven and Richard Suckle to bring this story with many layers on the big screen.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gadot recently appeared in both <em>Wonder Woman 1984</em> and <em>Zack Snyder&#8217;s Justice League</em>. She has <em>Death on the Nile</em> and the Netflix movie <em>Red Notice</em> on the way.</p>\n<h2><strong>The Wonder</strong></h2>\n<p>In other casting news, Deadline is <em>also</em> reporting that Florence Pugh, who will next appear in <em>Black Widow</em>, is going to star in Sebastián Lelio&#8217;s <em>The Wonder</em>. Based on the novel by Emma Donoghue, the story follows an English nurse who &#8220;is brought to a small Irish village to observe what appears to be a miracle – a girl said to have survived without food for month – and soon finds herself fighting to save the child&#8217;s life. Tourists flock to the cabin of eleven-year-old Anna O&#8217;Donnell, who believes herself to be living off manna from heaven, and a journalist is sent to cover the sensation. Lib Wright, a veteran of Florence Nightingale&#8217;s Crimean campaign, is hired to keep watch over the girl.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Alice Birch wrote <em>The Wonder</em> script, and production is expected to begin in Ireland in August. Of these two projects, I&#8217;d say <em>The Wonder</em> is the more exciting/interesting, simply because Pugh is the superior actor and I&#8217;m interested in seeing pretty much everything and anything she does.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/meet-me-in-another-life/\">Casting News: Gal Gadot Will Star in &#8216;Meet Me In Another Life&#8217;, Florence Pugh Joins &#8216;The Wonder&#8217;</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=fWPjjl4f8VM:prchgyaS-xM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=fWPjjl4f8VM:prchgyaS-xM:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=fWPjjl4f8VM:prchgyaS-xM:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=fWPjjl4f8VM:prchgyaS-xM:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=fWPjjl4f8VM:prchgyaS-xM:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=fWPjjl4f8VM:prchgyaS-xM:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/fWPjjl4f8VM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 30 Apr 2021 23:30:26 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Meet-Me-In-Another-Life-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"0b2d74884a62fe2c01e86492e8e80ee6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn5@2020_3/2021/05/01/06-42-05-862_c25bec58004653a7.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":29160,"destBytes":17712,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Meet-Me-In-Another-Life-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn5@2020_3/2021/05/01/06-42-05-862_c25bec58004653a7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn63@2020_5/2021/05/01/06-42-16-370_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=fWPjjl4f8VM:prchgyaS-xM:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn48@2020_4/2021/05/01/06-42-16-692_81497da0d52b8c4d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn84@2020_6/2021/05/01/06-42-16-819_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=fWPjjl4f8VM:prchgyaS-xM:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn36@2020_4/2021/05/01/06-42-16-091_f4a9cffd0ecdeb5f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/fWPjjl4f8VM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn19@2020_6/2021/05/01/06-42-16-527_8b05d2cc6064127e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1619851311500},{"createdTime":"2021-05-01 14:41:51","updatedTime":"2021-05-01 14:41:51","title":"‘Benny Loves You’ Trailer: A Stuffed Animal Turns Deadly in This Horror Comedy","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=668506","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/benny-loves-you-trailer.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-668530\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/benny-loves-you-trailer-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"benny loves you trailer\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/benny-loves-you-trailer-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/benny-loves-you-trailer-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/benny-loves-you-trailer-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/benny-loves-you-trailer.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Horror movies have a long, time-honored tradition of killer dolls. Chucky is arguably the most famous, but the list goes on and on, from Talking Tina on <em>The Twilight Zone</em>, to the Zuni Doll in <em>Trilogy of Terror</em>, to the ventriloquist dummies of <em>Dead Silence</em>, and beyond. Now we can add Benny to the list. In <strong><em>Benny Loves You</em></strong>, a childhood stuffed animal comes to life and starts looking to kill, with pretty amusing-looking results. In the film, &#8220;Jack (<strong>Karl Holt</strong>), a man desperate to improve his life throws away his beloved childhood plush, Benny.&#8221; That turns out to be a big mistake. Watch the <em>Benny Loves You</em> trailer below.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-668506\"></span></p>\n<h2><strong>Benny Loves You Trailer</strong></h2>\n<p><iframe width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8VZG778rYEk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Horror comedy is a very tricky subgenre to pull off. Most of the time, horror comedies fail because they lean too heavily into the &#8220;comedy&#8221; side and forget to embrace the horror. The most successful horror comedies – <em>An American Werewolf in London</em>, <em>Shaun of the Dead</em>, etc. – strike just the right balance, embracing both scares and laughs. Will <em>Benny Loves You</em> end up succeeding where so many other horror comedies before them? I don&#8217;t know, but I have to admit I love this trailer. The imagery of Benny the doll running around out for blood is just too funny to ignore.</p>\n<p>In <em>Benny Loves You</em>, &#8220;After the accidental death of his parents, Jack’s comfortable lifestyle comes to an end and he must sell his family home. Desperate to improve his life, Jack throws out his childhood belongings including his beloved plush, Benny. It’s a move that has disastrous consequences when Benny springs to life with deadly intentions!&#8221;</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know if this is all going to add up to a good movie, but I do think the very sight of Benny the goofy-looking killer doll will be enough to entertain more than a few people (like me). At the very least, this is a well-cut trailer that does a great job selling what kind of movie this is. Good work, <em>Benny Loves You</em>. You&#8217;ve sold me on watching this. Written and directed by Karl Holt, <em>Benny Loves You</em> stars Karl Holt, Claire Cartwright, and George Collie. The horror-comedy is coming to select theaters on May 7. After that, it&#8217;ll head to On Demand on May 11. And then, finally, it arrives on Blu-ray starting June 8.

The latest: <strong>Gina Gershon</strong> will play Moxxi,<strong> Cheyenne Jackson</strong> has been cast as Jakobs, and <strong>Steven Boyer</strong> is Scooter. I have no idea who any of those characters are, but if you&#8217;ve played the <em>Borderlands</em> games, you might! Gershon, Jackson, and Boyer join a cast that already includes <strong>Jamie Lee Curtis</strong>, <strong>Cate Blanchett</strong>, <strong>Jack Black</strong>, <strong>Kevin Hart</strong>, <strong>Haley Bennett</strong>, and more.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-669340\"></span></p>\n<p>However <em>Borderlands</em> turns out, it&#8217;s bound to have one of the most interesting casts in a while. As of right now, here&#8217;s the cast: Cate Blanchett as Lilith; Kevin Hart as Roland; Jamie Lee Curtis as Dr. Patricia Tannis; Jack Black as Claptrap; <strong>Ariana Greenblatt</strong> as Tiny Tina; <strong>Florian Munteanu</strong> as Krieg; Haley Bennett as&#8230;well, we actually don&#8217;t know her character name, she&#8217;s playing a new character invented for the film who is &#8220;key to the past of Cate Blanchett’s character, Lilith&#8221;; <strong>Édgar Ramírez</strong> as Atlas; <strong>Olivier Richters</strong> as Krom; <strong>Janina Gavankar</strong> as Commander Knoxx; Gina Gershon as Moxxi; Cheyenne Jackson as Jakobs; <strong>Charles Babalola</strong> as Hammerlock; <strong>Benjamin Byron</strong> Davis as Marcus; Steven Boyer as Scooter; <strong>Ryann Redmond</strong> as Ellie; <strong>Bobby Lee</strong> as Larry. I must admit that in the midst of all those character names I like that there&#8217;s someone just named &#8220;Larry.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The film is &#8220;Loosely based on the video game series of the same name, mysterious outlaw Lilith returns to the planet Pandora and is hired by Atlas to find his missing daughter with the help of Roland, Tannis, Tiny Tina, Krieg, and Claptrap, fighting through its various monsters and bandits on a quest for unthinkable power.&#8221; The <em>Borderlands</em> game series launched in 2009, with the latest release, <em>Borderlands 3</em>, arriving in 2019. The games have inspired novels, comics, and even tabletop games.</p>\n<p>Eli Roth is directing the flick, with <em>Chernobyl</em> creator <strong>Craig Mazin</strong><strong> </strong>handling the script. Filming has already begun on the project, but there&#8217;s no official release date just yet. Having never played a single <em>Borderlands</em> game, I am neutral on this project as a whole. I think the cast is pretty neat, but I&#8217;m also not much of a fan of Eli Roth. In fact, I don&#8217;t think I like any of his movies. So at the moment it&#8217;s a tad difficult to get too excited about what&#8217;s going on here. But a solid trailer and good word-of-mouth might be all I need to get hyped up for <em>Borderlands</em>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/borderlands-cast-gina-gershon/\">&#8216;Borderlands&#8217; Cast Continues to Grow, Adds Gina Gershon and More</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=mKVbAdNTAOo:Mw6p2WRL2Rw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=mKVbAdNTAOo:Mw6p2WRL2Rw:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=mKVbAdNTAOo:Mw6p2WRL2Rw:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=mKVbAdNTAOo:Mw6p2WRL2Rw:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=mKVbAdNTAOo:Mw6p2WRL2Rw:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=mKVbAdNTAOo:Mw6p2WRL2Rw:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/mKVbAdNTAOo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 30 Apr 2021 22:30:21 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/borderlands-cast-gina-gershon-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"f39c24212d5c54b50300fcc2f5a84226","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn29@2020_3/2021/05/01/06-42-03-695_8783f6e7a78151ce.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":24244,"destBytes":13110,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/borderlands-cast-gina-gershon-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn29@2020_3/2021/05/01/06-42-03-695_8783f6e7a78151ce.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn63@2020_5/2021/05/01/06-42-16-370_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=mKVbAdNTAOo:Mw6p2WRL2Rw:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn96@2020_1/2021/05/01/06-42-16-431_06468ad6a32ddf47.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn84@2020_6/2021/05/01/06-42-16-819_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=mKVbAdNTAOo:Mw6p2WRL2Rw:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn35@2020_1/2021/05/01/06-42-16-545_894d0cbebf3976c7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/mKVbAdNTAOo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn39@2020_3/2021/05/01/06-42-16-617_8c53c44f5586ccc5.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1619851311496},{"createdTime":"2021-05-01 14:41:51","updatedTime":"2021-05-01 14:41:51","title":"‘F9’ Explores Dom Toretto’s Origins, Will Revisit a Scene From the First Film (Plus: Which Big Actor is Joining the Franchise Next?)","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=669351","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-669376 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Toretto-origins-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"Toretto origins\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Toretto-origins.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Toretto-origins-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>After a huge delay, we&#8217;re finally only a few months away from the release of <em><strong>F9</strong></em>, which will be coming out 20 years after 2001&#8217;s <em>The Fast and the Furious</em>. And according to producer/star <strong>Vin Diesel</strong>, this new sequel has a special connection to the film that kicked off this franchise: <em>F9</em> actually goes back in time and gives audiences a peek into the origins of his Dominic Toretto character. Plus, Diesel revealed that <em>F9</em> will revisit a scene from the original movie from a different angle. And did he just reveal a big surprise about who is going to show up in <em><strong>Fast 10</strong></em>? Get the details below.<span id=\"more-669351\"></span></p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve ever wondered more about what Dom Toretto was like before we caught up with him in the original film, <em>F9</em> is going to answer that question.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The whole world has this excitement about this movie coming out, but for those who have been with the franchise, it&#8217;s even more special,&#8221; Diesel said in an interview with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up4bt4ofJtg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Entertainment Weekly</a>. &#8220;Because if you can remember the first movie, you are now going to go before the first movie and understand the first movie even more&#8230;that&#8217;s cool stuff. I&#8217;m a [Dungeons &#38; Dragons] head, so that&#8217;s like origins stuff. To see family members you never thought you would have seen – it&#8217;s gonna kind of blow your mind. We&#8217;ve been wanting to know: where was Dom before he became Dom? Who were his influences? That&#8217;s going to be really rich with story, and a lot of fun to see.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Elsewhere in the interview, Diesel talked about <em>The Fast and the Furious</em> scene we&#8217;re going to see from a different angle in <em>F9</em>. It takes place in the aftermath of Diesel&#8217;s Dominic Toretto beating Paul Walker&#8217;s Brian in their first race in the streets of L.A., when Brian smirks and says, &#8220;I almost had you.&#8221; Here&#8217;s the exact quote from Diesel: &#8220;What&#8217;s so exciting about <em>F9</em> is we revisit that moment from a different perspective.&#8221; The question, of course, is whose perspective is it? Could Dom&#8217;s estranged brother Jakob (John Cena) have been lurking in the crowd during that moment, keeping an eye on his brother as Dom pontificated about the nature of winning?</p>\n<p>And near the end of the interview, Diesel possibly blew a surprise casting reveal. He was asked: if he had a time machine, which actor – either from the franchise or someone he thinks would have been a great fit – would he choose to drop back into the first film to help build out the mythology of the <em>Fast</em> franchise. &#8220;I guess if I were to think where we&#8217;re going with the next chapter – <strong>Michael Caine</strong>,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I might have found a way – you&#8217;re saying if I could have redesigned the mythology or added little elements of the mythology – I could have done something with Helen Mirren and Michael Caine&#8217;s character and played something out. I could have introduced something [for] the future.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Caine has not appeared in any of the <em>Fast</em> movies yet, but it&#8217;s a safe bet that he will be playing the father of Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) in the final two movies in the franchise – or he might even appear in <em>F9</em>. This is a really cool piece of casting, considering Caine starred in one of the most famous car-related movies in cinematic history: the original 1969 version of <em>The Italian Job</em>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/toretto-origins/\">&#8216;F9&#8217; Explores Dom Toretto&#8217;s Origins, Will Revisit a Scene From the First Film (Plus: Which Big Actor is Joining the Franchise Next?)</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=CuuFd-MZagw:R_JoICqGGeA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=CuuFd-MZagw:R_JoICqGGeA:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=CuuFd-MZagw:R_JoICqGGeA:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=CuuFd-MZagw:R_JoICqGGeA:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=CuuFd-MZagw:R_JoICqGGeA:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=CuuFd-MZagw:R_JoICqGGeA:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/CuuFd-MZagw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 30 Apr 2021 20:00:21 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Toretto-origins-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"74d69f9d4f92a6ecf3872957a349275b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn38@2020_6/2021/05/01/06-42-05-829_76f5ee9a4ab0e3ac.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":27739,"destBytes":16860,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Toretto-origins-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn38@2020_6/2021/05/01/06-42-05-829_76f5ee9a4ab0e3ac.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn63@2020_5/2021/05/01/06-42-16-370_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=CuuFd-MZagw:R_JoICqGGeA:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn79@2020_4/2021/05/01/06-42-16-816_4bdaf7855ee97750.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn84@2020_6/2021/05/01/06-42-16-819_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=CuuFd-MZagw:R_JoICqGGeA:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn48@2020_3/2021/05/01/06-42-16-323_344fa3de26d3c44d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/CuuFd-MZagw":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn72@2020_6/2021/05/01/06-42-16-381_eab9c5e05f5cc143.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1619851311500},{"createdTime":"2021-05-01 14:41:51","updatedTime":"2021-05-01 14:41:51","title":"‘Star Wars: The Bad Batch’ Featurette Recaps What the Characters Did Before the Disney+ Series","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=669199","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-669202\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-bad-batch-1-700x326.jpg\" alt=\"the bad batch recap\" width=\"700\" height=\"326\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-bad-batch-1-700x326.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-bad-batch-1-360x168.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-bad-batch-1-768x357.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/the-bad-batch-1.jpg 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>What do you remember about the first time The Bad Batch showed up?

Romero</strong>&#8216;s zombie series, is in the works four years after Romero&#8217;s death. Romero was reportedly developing the film when he passed away in 2017, and now his widow <strong>Suzanne Romero</strong> is working to get the film made. Suzanne Romero has been working with screenwriters on the script and is now hoping to start meeting with directors for the project, which continues and concludes the saga Romero started back in 1968 with <em>Night of the Living Dead</em>.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-669375\"></span></p>\n<p>During his life, George A. Romero made six films in his <em>Dead</em> series – <em>Night of the Living Dead</em>, <em>Dawn of the Dead</em>, <em>Day of the Dead</em>, <em>Land of the Dead</em>, <em>Diary of the Dead</em>, and <em>Survival of the Dead</em>. Quality varies (everyone at least agrees that the first three are the best), but the series remains iconic and influential. And now, in true <em>Dead</em> fashion, it looks like the saga will continue even after the demise of its creator. Per <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/twilight-of-the-dead-george-a-romeros-final-zombie-movie-in-the-works\">THR</a>, Romero was quietly working on yet another <em>Dead</em> film titled <em>Twilight of the Dead</em> when he died in 2017.</p>\n<p>Since then, Romero&#8217;s wife Suzanne Romero has been working with screenwriters to get the film made, and now she&#8217;s ready to start meeting with filmmakers. The film is said to be &#8220;a concluding chapter intended to be his final statement on the genre,&#8221; and &#8220;set in a decimated world. Life has all but disappeared. But there still may be hope for humanity.&#8221;</p>\n<p>George A. Romero wrote a treatment for <em>Twilight of the Dead</em> with <strong>Paolo Zelati</strong>. After Romero&#8217;s death, Zelati asked Suzanne if he could continue with the script. Suzanne agreed, and Zelati then worked with writers <strong>Joe Knetter</strong> and <strong>Robert L. Lucas</strong>. The project is a direct sequel to <em>Land of the Dead</em>, which means it&#8217;ll be ignoring <em>Diary of the Dead</em> and <em>Survival of the Dead</em>.</p>\n<p>To be fair, continuity was never this franchise&#8217;s strong point, and <em>Diary of the Dead</em> is technically a reboot of <em>Night of the Living Dead</em>, so it makes sense to ignore it and <em>Surivval</em> if <em>Twilight</em> is meant to be connected to the original series. In <em>Land of the Dead</em>, one of the zombies – nicknamed Big Daddy – evolved to the point of being much more intelligent than his lumbering undead brethren, and that left Zelati wondering: &#8220;Where do the zombies go at the end of <em>Land of the Dead</em>?&#8221; Zelati added: &#8220;It is no secret that <em>Diary </em>and <em>Survival</em> were not the way he envisioned the series ending and George knew it very well. <em>Twilight of the Dead</em> was his goodbye to the genre he created and wanted to go out with a powerful film.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Suzanne added: &#8220;We had a solid treatment and the beginning of the script.

Nanjiani and Gordon are set to write <strong><em>The Doubtful Guest</em></strong>, based on the illustrated book by the late Edward Gorey, with <em>It </em>director<strong> Andy Muschietti</strong> set to direct.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-669342\"></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://variety.com/2021/film/news/kumail-nanjiani-emily-v-gordon-doubtful-guest-andy-muschietti-1234963894/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Variety</a> reports that Nanjiani and Gordon are teaming up with sibling duo <strong>Andy and Barbara Muschietti</strong> (The<em> It</em> movies) for <em>The Doubtful Guest</em>. Nanjiani is also set to star in the adaptation of the 1957 absurdist illustrated book by Edward Gorey, which follows a mysterious penguin-like creature who shows up unannounced at a family&#8217;s home to stir up trouble and chaos.</p>\n<p>Here is the synopsis for <em>The Doubtful Guest</em> book (via <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/205981.The_Doubtful_Guest\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GoodReads</a>):</p>\n<blockquote><p>The doubtful guest shows up unannounced and unwelcome, yet its presence is accepted after only a brief interlude of screaming. The staid, pale, Victorian inhabitants of the mansion alternately stare and glare at the doubtful guest as it tears out whole chapters from books, peels the soles of its white canvas shoes, and broods while lying on the floor (&#8220;inconveniently close to the drawing-room door&#8221;). Strangely, or rather, typically, as this <i>is</i> a Gorey book, the stymied occupants never ask the guest to leave – and in 17 years it has still &#8220;shown no intention of going away.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>In addition to co-writing the script, Gordon and Nanjiani are serving as executive producers. Andy and Barbara Muschietti, whose newly launched production company Double Dream is developing <em>The Doubtful Guest</em>, are producing the movie alongside Dani Bernfeld. Steven Spielberg’s Amblin Entertainment is also producing, with Jeb Brody and John Buderwitz overseeing for the company.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s unclear whether <em>The Doubtful Guest</em> will be a live-action or animated film, or a hybrid of the two à la <em>Paddington</em>, possibly with Nanjiani voicing the strange penguin creature. Based on the description of the book, which reads more like a surrealist gag than a story that could be transformed into a feature film, <em>The Doubtful Guest</em> might make for a good animated comedy. That would be a departure for Muschietti for sure, who is best known for his horror films like <em>Mama,</em> <em>It</em>, and <em>It: Chapter 2</em>. But it might be a fun role for Nanjiani — though a waste of his newly ripped bod that he had to get for Marvel&#8217;s <em>The Eternals</em> — who has been absent from the comedy scene recently.</p>\n<p>Nanjiani will next appear in the Disney+ series <em>Obi-Wan Kenobi</em>, while Gordon is writing the screenplay for the Netflix movie <em>Ball and Chain</em>, a superhero movie starring Emily Blunt and Dwayne Johnson. The last time the married couple paired up together professionally was to executive produce the Apple TV Plus series <em>Little America</em>, so it&#8217;ll be exciting to see what they could come up with next as a follow-up to <em>The Big Sick</em>, which was based on their own real-life romance.</p>\n<p><em>The Doubtful Guest</em> is owned by the Edward Gorey Charitable Trust, a non-profit organization that backs animal welfare causes. Trustees Eric D. Sherman and R. Andrew Boose will be executive producers on the big-screen adaptation.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/the-doubtful-guest-movie-kumail-nanjiani-emily-v-gordon/\">Kumail Nanjiani and Emily V.

Now, it&#8217;s been revealed Waititi will appear in the series as well, playing infamous pirate Blackbeard. The series is inspired by the true story of Stede Bonnet, &#8220;a pampered aristocrat who abandoned his life of privilege to become a pirate.&#8221; <strong>Rhys Darby</strong> is set to play Bonnet.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-669388\"></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/taika-waititi-blackbeard-our-flag-means-death-hbo-max/\">The Wrap</a>, and others, are reporting that not only is Taika Waititi directing the pilot episode and producing <em>Our Flag Means Death</em>, but he&#8217;s also co-starring in the HBO Max pirate series as well. Waititi will play notorious pirate Blackbeard, who was a real guy named Edward Teach. Teach reportedly didn&#8217;t like to use violence and instead preferred to scare people into submission with a fearsome image he deliberately played up, going so far as to stick lit fuses under his hat. After a few years of pirating, Teach was killed by soldiers and sailors hired by Alexander Spotswood, the Governor of Virginia, who&#8217;d had enough of Blackbeard and his bullshit.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our Blackbeard is a legend, a lover, a fighter, a tactical genius, a poetic soul, and quite possibly insane. Only one man could play this role, and that is the great Taika Waititi. We&#8217;re thrilled beyond measure he’s decided to don the beard,&#8221; said <em>Our Flag Means Death</em> creator <strong>David Jenkins</strong>, who also serves as showrunner.</p>\n<p><em>Our Flag Means Death</em> is loosely based on the true story of Stede Bonnet, played by Rhys Darby, a character described as &#8220;a pampered aristocrat who abandoned his life of privilege to become a pirate.&#8221; Bonnet used his wealth to have his own fancy pirate ship built, which he named <em>Revenge</em>. Bonnet teamed up with Blackbeard at one point, but the two pirates had a falling out. That&#8217;s just how things go in the pirate world, folks. At one point, Bonnet was pardoned for his piracy and even received clearance to go privateering against Spanish shipping. However, he was apparently <em>so</em> addicted to being a pirate that he returned to that life using an alias, Captain Thomas, with hopes that he wouldn&#8217;t lose his pardon.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A series concept like this jumps off the page and you can instantly envision every moment,&#8221; said <strong>Sarah Aubrey</strong>, HBO Max&#8217;s head of original content, when the series was first announced. &#8220;David and Taika’s unique take on Bonnet’s rollicking misadventures on the high seas are sure to thrill and delight audiences everywhere.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/our-flag-means-death-cast/\">&#8216;Our Flag Means Death&#8217; Will Feature Taika Waititi as Blackbeard</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ByPg8pWXC60:2Ud_wufZyCI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ByPg8pWXC60:2Ud_wufZyCI:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ByPg8pWXC60:2Ud_wufZyCI:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ByPg8pWXC60:2Ud_wufZyCI:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=ByPg8pWXC60:2Ud_wufZyCI:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ByPg8pWXC60:2Ud_wufZyCI:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/ByPg8pWXC60\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 30 Apr 2021 22:00:41 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Our-Flag-Means-Death-Cast-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"82eaa65901a01391382d31737ca0bf1e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn12@2020_2/2021/05/01/06-42-03-958_764c31c80d2488b1.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":36236,"destBytes":21534,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Our-Flag-Means-Death-Cast-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn12@2020_2/2021/05/01/06-42-03-958_764c31c80d2488b1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn63@2020_5/2021/05/01/06-42-16-370_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ByPg8pWXC60:2Ud_wufZyCI:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn60@2020_5/2021/05/01/06-42-16-682_fa9b4b370c4e9479.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn84@2020_6/2021/05/01/06-42-16-819_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=ByPg8pWXC60:2Ud_wufZyCI:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn32@2020_2/2021/05/01/06-42-16-328_dbae28935034ca18.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/ByPg8pWXC60":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn8@2020_3/2021/05/01/06-42-16-408_4f18d9620ff39677.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1619851311494},{"createdTime":"2021-05-01 14:41:51","updatedTime":"2021-05-01 14:41:51","title":"Universal’s VelociCoaster Ride Features the Return of Your Favorite ‘Jurassic Park’ Character: Mr. DNA","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=669322","description":"<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-669337\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mr-dna-jurassic-park-700x350.jpeg\" alt=\"jurassic world velocicoaster\" width=\"700\" height=\"350\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mr-dna-jurassic-park-700x350.jpeg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mr-dna-jurassic-park-360x180.jpeg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/mr-dna-jurassic-park-768x384.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>The <strong>Jurassic World VelociCoaster</strong> is coming to <strong>Islands of Adventure</strong> at the <strong>Universal Orlando Resort</strong> this summer to unleash the full ferocity of the velociraptors and&#8230;Mr. DNA?

Wong</strong> all reprise their roles from the <em>Jurassic World</em> movies in the queue to Florida&#8217;s fastest and tallest launch coaster, which will send riders 155 feet in the air with a catapult speed of 70mph. But no one knew that they would be accompanied by another familiar face from the <em>Jurassic Park</em> movies&#8230;Mr. DNA. Mr. DNA appears as the host to the Jurassic World VelociCoaster queue, helping the others to set up the story and tie it directly to the movies.</p>\n<p>Mr. DNA is an unexpected host for several reasons: first, he&#8217;s an animated living DNA strand designed to emulate those cheesy (and cheap) science educational programs, whose goofy scene deliberately stood at odds with the rest of the intense 1993 action movie. Second, who was asking for Mr. DNA to come back? But back he is, and in glorious CGI to introduce the riders of the VelociCoaster to their certain doom.</p>\n<p>Here is how Universal Orlando Resort described the entrance to the immersive attraction, which is designed to feel like it takes place within <em>Jurassic World</em> itself:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Once inside, guests are greeted by Dr. Wu as they learn about the cutting-edge new coaster, which Jurassic World is touting as its newest &#8220;carnivore expansion.&#8221; Along the way, they’ll hear the screams of fellow riders as they rapidly roar by with Blue, Delta, Charlie and Echo right on their heels – and even come face-to-face with a few hungry Velociraptors who are anxiously awaiting being released from their stables.

Centineo exits the role after joining the film <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/masters-of-the-universe-cast/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">two years ago</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Masters of the Universe</em> would&#8217;ve been the first major Hollywood lead role for Centineo, who catapulted to teen heartthrob status after his appearances in Netflix&#8217;s <em>To All the Boys</em> films. The young actor has popped up in supporting roles in films like <em>Charlie&#8217;s Angels</em> – and has apparently been held captive in Netflix&#8217;s basement so that he can star in 50 of their movies – but <em>Masters of the Universe</em> was primed to be his big leading-man break.</p>\n<p>Traditionally, <em>Masters of the Universe </em>follows Prince Adam of Eternia, who is able to transform into the mighty He-Man with his Power Sword. With the help of his allies Teela, Man-at-Arms, Orko and The Sorceress, He-Man defends the kingdom from the evil Skeletor (because he has a skeleton face, yet it?).Based on Mattel’s hugely successful 1980s toy line, the material was previously adapted into a 1987 B-action movie starring Dolph Lundgren as Adam/He-Man, and Frank Langella as Skeletor. Hollywood has been trying to launch a reboot since at least 2007, when John Woo was set to direct.</p>\n<p>The <em>Masters of the Universe</em> reboot has changed creative hands several times since 2007. The project was originally at Warner Bros, before landing at Sony. At one point, McG was announced as a director for the film. McG eventually left the project, and David S. Goyer was announced as writer and potential director. That fell apart as well, and the <strong>Nee Brothers</strong> are currently attached to direct, with <strong>Art Marcum</strong> and <strong>Matt Holloway</strong> writing the script.</p>\n<p>A spokesperson for Centineo told The Wrap that the actor was no longer part of the project, though no further reason was given. No actor has yet been announced to replace him.</p>\n<p>With <em>Masters of the Universe</em> in limbo for as long as it was, it&#8217;s not a surprise that Centineo grew impatient and left to find other means for his career to take off. And he already has that in the bag, with a major part in Warner Bros.&#8217; <em>Black Adam</em> as Adam Smasher, starring opposite Dwayne Johnson and Aldis Hodge. <em>Black Adam</em> is scheduled to hit theaters on July 29, 2022.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/noah-centineo-masters-of-the-universe-cast-he-man/\">Noah Centineo is No Longer Playing He-Man in &#8216;Masters of the Universe&#8217;</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=qTipfQ5uIXI:8lozKWlPxWk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=qTipfQ5uIXI:8lozKWlPxWk:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=qTipfQ5uIXI:8lozKWlPxWk:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=qTipfQ5uIXI:8lozKWlPxWk:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=qTipfQ5uIXI:8lozKWlPxWk:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=qTipfQ5uIXI:8lozKWlPxWk:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/qTipfQ5uIXI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 30 Apr 2021 16:30:06 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/noah-centineo-e1619791887591-700x299.jpeg","linkMd5":"9515e2c63e68d52500510ce5a7d56626","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn15@2020_4/2021/05/01/06-42-03-707_b8b3c7804c507633.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":299,"sourceBytes":19853,"destBytes":10298,"author":"Hoai-Tran Bui","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/noah-centineo-e1619791887591-700x299.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn15@2020_4/2021/05/01/06-42-03-707_b8b3c7804c507633.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn63@2020_5/2021/05/01/06-42-16-370_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=qTipfQ5uIXI:8lozKWlPxWk:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn4@2020_5/2021/05/01/06-42-16-565_ae876c33673c2a82.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn84@2020_6/2021/05/01/06-42-16-819_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=qTipfQ5uIXI:8lozKWlPxWk:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn3@2020_4/2021/05/01/06-42-16-313_9f26343453902d82.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/qTipfQ5uIXI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn6@2020_2/2021/05/01/06-42-16-219_e3dbb98b54126245.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1619851311498},{"createdTime":"2021-05-01 14:41:51","updatedTime":"2021-05-01 14:41:51","title":"‘Black Panther 2’ is “Respectful of the Loss” of Chadwick Boseman, Says Lupita Nyong’o","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=669354","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Black-Panther-2-Lupita-Nyongo.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-669372\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Black-Panther-2-Lupita-Nyongo-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"Black Panther 2 Lupita Nyong'o\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Black-Panther-2-Lupita-Nyongo-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Black-Panther-2-Lupita-Nyongo-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Black-Panther-2-Lupita-Nyongo-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Black-Panther-2-Lupita-Nyongo.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong><em>Black Panther 2</em></strong> is a highly-anticipated sequel that&#8217;s bound to also be difficult for many people. The sudden death of star<strong> Chadwick Boseman</strong> has left the film with an unfillable absence, and many are wondering just how director <strong>Ryan Coogler</strong> will continue the series in the wake of Boseman&#8217;s passing. Coogler has already spoken about the challenges involved with moving forward, and now co-star <strong>Lupita Nyong&#8217;o</strong> is speaking about what it&#8217;s going to be like to make the sequel without Boseman.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-669354\"></span></p>\n<p>Talking with <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/lupita-nyongo-super-sema-youtube-black-panther-2-chadwick-boseman-150021866.html?guccounter=1\">Yahoo</a>, Nyong&#8217;o, who plays Nakia in the <em>Black Panther</em> series, revealed some of her thoughts and feelings about continuing on without star Chadwick Boseman, who died in 2020. &#8220;People will ask me, ‘Are you excited to go back?’ Excitement isn’t the word,&#8221; Nyong&#8217;o said. &#8220;I feel like I’m in a very pensive and meditative state when it comes to <em>Black Panther 2</em>. His passing is still extremely raw for me. And I can&#8217;t even begin to imagine what it will be like to step on set and not have him there.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Rather than recast Boseman&#8217;s role, or bring him back via digital trickery, <em>Black Panther 2</em> is instead moving on without him. It&#8217;s unclear exactly how that will work at the moment, but according to Nyong&#8217;o, writer-director Ryan Coogler&#8217;s approach to the sequel is respectful to Boseman&#8217;s loss. &#8220;But at the same time we have a leader in Ryan, who feels very much like we do, who feels the loss in a very, very real way as well,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And his idea, the way which he has reshaped the second movie is so respectful of the loss we’ve all experienced as a cast and as a world. So it feels spiritually and emotionally correct to do this. And hopefully, what I do look forward to, is getting back together and honoring what he started with us and holding his light through it. Because he left us a lot of light that we&#8217;re still going to be bathing in. I know that for sure.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In a previous interview, Coogler <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/black-panther-2-update/\">said</a>: &#8220;You’ve got to keep going when you lose loved ones. I know Chad wouldn’t have wanted us to stop. He was somebody who was so about the collective. <em>Black Panther</em>, that was his movie. He was hired to play that role before anybody else was even thought of, before I was hired, before any of the actresses were hired. On that set, he was all about everybody else. Even though he was going through what he was going through, he was checking in on them, making sure they were good. If we cut his coverage, he would stick around and read lines off-camera [to help other actors with their performances]. So it would be harder for me to stop. Truthfully. I&#8217;d feel him yelling at me, like, &#8216;What are you doing?&#8217; So you keep going.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>Black Panther 2</em> is scheduled to arrive on <strong>July 8, 2022</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/black-panther-2-lupita-nyongo/\">&#8216;Black Panther 2&#8217; is &#8220;Respectful of the Loss&#8221; of Chadwick Boseman, Says Lupita Nyong&#8217;o</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=SO5F90ahI1o:gD0gMd8CYjY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=SO5F90ahI1o:gD0gMd8CYjY:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=SO5F90ahI1o:gD0gMd8CYjY:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=SO5F90ahI1o:gD0gMd8CYjY:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=SO5F90ahI1o:gD0gMd8CYjY:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=SO5F90ahI1o:gD0gMd8CYjY:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/SO5F90ahI1o\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 30 Apr 2021 21:00:18 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Black-Panther-2-Lupita-Nyongo-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"f9f243aeaf05ba8bd20462cb9dd0bc36","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn34@2020_6/2021/05/01/06-42-03-797_91754dc8d86da96c.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":33910,"destBytes":20776,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Black-Panther-2-Lupita-Nyongo-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn34@2020_6/2021/05/01/06-42-03-797_91754dc8d86da96c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn63@2020_5/2021/05/01/06-42-16-370_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=SO5F90ahI1o:gD0gMd8CYjY:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn23@2020_1/2021/05/01/06-42-16-844_d46b40b966796aba.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn84@2020_6/2021/05/01/06-42-16-819_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=SO5F90ahI1o:gD0gMd8CYjY:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn75@2020_3/2021/05/01/06-42-16-796_d46e42c06b3ead2d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/SO5F90ahI1o":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn87@2020_5/2021/05/01/06-42-16-040_b18b34c13d4f4459.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1619851311494},{"createdTime":"2021-05-01 14:41:51","updatedTime":"2021-05-01 14:41:51","title":"‘Green Lantern’ HBO Max Series Casts Finn Wittrock as Hot-Headed Lantern Guy Gardner, New Plot Details Revealed","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=669321","description":"<p><a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/green-lantern-HBO-Max-series-cast.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-669327\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/green-lantern-HBO-Max-series-cast-700x321.jpg\" alt=\"green lantern HBO Max series cast\" width=\"700\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/green-lantern-HBO-Max-series-cast-700x321.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/green-lantern-HBO-Max-series-cast-360x165.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/green-lantern-HBO-Max-series-cast-768x352.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/green-lantern-HBO-Max-series-cast.jpg 948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></p>\n<p>The HBO Max <strong><em>Green Lantern</em></strong> series has found one of its members of the Green Lantern Corps. <strong>Finn Wittrock</strong> is joining the cast as Guy Gardner, the rebel of the group and second Earthling to join the corps. The series is being written by <strong>Greg Berlanti</strong>, <strong>Marc Guggenheim</strong>, and <strong>Seth Grahame-Smith</strong>, and will span multiple decades and focus on multiple Lanterns. Hopefully, none of them will be wearing weird CGI suits like in the Ryan Reynold <em>Green Lantern</em> movie.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-669321\"></span></p>\n<p>Deadline has the scoop that Finn Wittrock will play Green Lantern Corps member Guy Gardner in the upcoming HBO Max <em>Green Lantern</em> series. Wittrock&#8217;s credits include <em>American Horror Story</em>, <em>Ratched</em>, <em>The Last Black Man in San Francisco</em>, <em>American Crime Story</em>, and more.</p>\n<p>Their story also came with additional plot details, noting that the series &#8220;reinvents the classic DC property through a story spanning decades and galaxies, beginning on Earth in 1941 with the very first Green Lantern, secretly gay FBI agent Alan Scott, and 1984, with cocky alpha male Guy Gardner (Wittrock) and half-alien Bree Jarta. They’ll be joined by a multitude of other Lanterns — from comic book favorites to never-before-seen heroes.&#8221; Deadline also adds that Gardner is &#8220;a hulking mass of masculinity, and, as rendered in the comics, an embodiment of 1980s hyper-patriotism. And yet, Guy is somehow likable.&#8221; If you say so!</p>\n<p>In the comics (per the <a href=\"https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Guy_Gardner_(New_Earth)\">DC Wiki</a>), Gardner is:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;&#8230;a top member of the Green Lantern Corps, and the second one to be chosen from Earth. His sheer willpower and his complete refusal to back down from any fight have made him one of the greatest warriors in the universe. This has also given him a notorious reputation in the superhero community as an obnoxious butthead. Despite the disapproval from his peers for his unrelenting offensive tendencies, he has always kept his chin up and refused to let the opinions of others stop him from doing what he knows is the right thing. A bit of a wild card in terms of attitude, and unwilling to listen to the strict restrictions that bind most of his fellow Lanterns, his determination, skill, and unpredictability have made him one of the most feared and respected lawmen in the universe.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Greg Berlanti, Marc Guggenheim, and Seth Grahame-Smith are writing the series and executive producing. Other executive producers include Geoff Johns, Sarah Schechter, David Madden, and David Katzenberg, with Elizabeth Hunter and Sara Saedi co-executive producing. This isn&#8217;t the first time Warner Bros. has tried to bring the <em>Green Lantern</em> saga to live-action. They previously attempted a movie in 2011 with Ryan Reynolds, and pretty much everyone – including Reynolds – hates it. Recently, Zack Snyder revealed he wanted Green Lantern to show up at the end of <em>Zack Snyder&#8217;s Justice League</em>, but Warner Bros. strongly objected to the idea – likely because they had this series in the works, and they didn&#8217;t want Snyder to introduce a Lantern who isn&#8217;t part of the show.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/green-lantern-hbo-max-series-cast/\">&#8216;Green Lantern&#8217; HBO Max Series Casts Finn Wittrock as Hot-Headed Lantern Guy Gardner, New Plot Details Revealed</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=jcWrN1TlMzI:jl6bj36syzc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=jcWrN1TlMzI:jl6bj36syzc:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=jcWrN1TlMzI:jl6bj36syzc:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=jcWrN1TlMzI:jl6bj36syzc:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=jcWrN1TlMzI:jl6bj36syzc:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=jcWrN1TlMzI:jl6bj36syzc:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/jcWrN1TlMzI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 30 Apr 2021 15:37:55 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/green-lantern-HBO-Max-series-cast-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"44f05bbe1b014e983d4e8b5fab18ee34","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn21@2020_2/2021/05/01/06-41-51-873_f87fa91205b5d545.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":40099,"destBytes":25870,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/green-lantern-HBO-Max-series-cast-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn21@2020_2/2021/05/01/06-41-51-873_f87fa91205b5d545.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn63@2020_5/2021/05/01/06-42-16-370_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=jcWrN1TlMzI:jl6bj36syzc:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn79@2020_4/2021/05/01/06-42-16-856_2bff69250e89fe22.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn84@2020_6/2021/05/01/06-42-16-819_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=jcWrN1TlMzI:jl6bj36syzc:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn52@2020_3/2021/05/01/06-42-16-744_591b10ab59100edc.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/jcWrN1TlMzI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn55@2020_2/2021/05/01/06-42-16-447_6c0d8be1b3ce0fa0.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1619851311500},{"createdTime":"2021-05-01 14:41:51","updatedTime":"2021-05-01 14:41:51","title":"7 Things We Learned About ‘The Falcon and the Winter Soldier’ From Marvel’s ‘Assembled’ Documentary","link":"https://www.slashfilm.com/?p=669324","description":"<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-669364 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/falconandthewintersoldier-cap-cameras-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"The Falcon and The Winter Soldier\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/falconandthewintersoldier-cap-cameras.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/falconandthewintersoldier-cap-cameras-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<p>Now that <em><strong>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</strong></em> has come to a close, Marvel Studios is <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/assembled-the-making-of-the-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier-trailer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">digging into the making</a> of the show with another installment of their documentary series <strong><em>Assembled</em></strong>.

Much of it was done as a frame of reference to create the scene itself, which included actual divers in wingsuits and a stuntman in a full Falcon costume flying through the air. But there are a handful of shots from the cameras strapped to the skydivers that made it into the final cut of the show. Even though the flying through canyons was inspired by a real team of skydivers who can actually soar through peaks and valleys, that had to be done in post-production.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-669362 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/falconandthewintersoldier-bucky-truck-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"The Falcon and The Winter Soldier\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/falconandthewintersoldier-bucky-truck.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/falconandthewintersoldier-bucky-truck-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>The Semi-Truck Fight</h2>\n<p>You&#8217;ve probably already assumed that the semi-truck fight sequence with Sam Wilson, Bucky Barnes, John Walker, and Lemar Hoskins fighting Karli Morgenthau and the Flag Smashers wasn&#8217;t actually done on real trucks. But what&#8217;s interesting is that the original visual effects plan for the sequence had to be overhauled because the background plate shots that were completed in Atlanta looked so far removed from Germany that the entire environment around the trucks needed to be created digitally.</p>\n<p>From the fields and mountains in the background to the roads the trucks are traveling on, nearly everything had to be replaced in post-production. Even the shot when John Walker gets knocked off the truck and rolls onto the road needed to have the entire background replaced with a digital environment. In fact, Walker falls off the back of the truck in Atlanta, rolls into a shot completed in Prague, and both backgrounds had to be replaced to look like Germany. Magic!</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-669366 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/falconandthewintersoldier-sharoncarter-cargo-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"The Falcon and The Winter Soldier - Emily VanCamp\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/falconandthewintersoldier-sharoncarter-cargo.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/falconandthewintersoldier-sharoncarter-cargo-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>Sharon Carter Almost Came Back in Infinity War and Endgame</h2>\n<p>Marvel Studios originally wanted to have Sharon Carter involved in <em>Avengers: Infinity War</em> and <em>Avengers: Endgame</em> in some capacity after her prominent role in <em>Captain America: Civil War</em>. However, with so many characters being a part of both <em>Avengers</em> films, they couldn&#8217;t figure out a way to fit her into the story. It ended up working in their favor though, because <em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em> afforded them an opportunity to explain her absence and take her character in a whole new direction.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-669368 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/falconandthewintersoldier-madripoor-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"The Falcon and The Winter Soldier\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/falconandthewintersoldier-madripoor.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/falconandthewintersoldier-madripoor-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>Madripoor is in Atlanta</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s no secret that real locations on film sets often double as another place entirely. You&#8217;d be surprised how many times Vancouver has filled in for New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. And when it comes to Madripoor, the assassin island location was created in a series of back alleys in Atlanta, Georgia, inspired by a real backstreet in Hanoi, Vietnam. With plenty of set dressing, a rundown city street was turned into a neon haven for shady characters.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-667047 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/falconandthewintersoldier-sam-bucky-citysquare-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"The Falcon and the Winter Soldier Cameo Explained\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/falconandthewintersoldier-sam-bucky-citysquare.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/falconandthewintersoldier-sam-bucky-citysquare-360x154.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>Earthquakes in Puerto Rico Led to Production in Prague</h2>\n<p><em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em> had to stop production in Prague just one week into shooting last spring because of the fast-spreading coronavirus pandemic. But what you might not know is that the show was slated to shoot all of the Prague sequences in Puerto Rico before that. Even after an earthquake had devastated parts of the island, the crew was still confident they could safely accomplish what they needed to there. But when a second earthquake hit, they no longer felt safe about shooting in the area and had to find a new international location.</p>\n<p>Prague ended up being a fine replacement, and they found locations that were strikingly similar to those they had already scouted in Puerto Rico. But then the coronavirus pandemic came along and ruined everything again. During the eight month hiatus, the crew had to figure out how to safely shoot back in Prague, which meant convincing the government to let an American crew back into the country during a pandemic. It wasn&#8217;t easy since America was being famously stubborn about the situation while Prague had handled the pandemic much better. But with some virtual scouting and new safety measures, they pulled it off.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-669363 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/falconandthewintersoldier-cap-goggles-cowl-vfx-700x280.jpg\" alt=\"The Falcon and The Winter Soldier - VFX Goggles and Cowl\" width=\"700\" height=\"280\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/falconandthewintersoldier-cap-goggles-cowl-vfx.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/falconandthewintersoldier-cap-goggles-cowl-vfx-360x144.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>Falcon/Captain America&#8217;s Goggles and Cowl Required VFX</h2>\n<p>Some of the best visual effects are the ones that you don&#8217;t even register as being there. When it comes to the costume worn by Anthony Mackie as both Falcon and the new Captain America, there are some details that needed to be completed in post-production to perfect the ensemble.</p>\n<p>First up, the red lenses in Sam Wilson&#8217;s goggles aren&#8217;t even part of the practical costume most of the time. They&#8217;re a reflective surface and can make lighting situations tricky, so the VFX team would end up having to remove certain reflections from them anyway. So it&#8217;s easier to just remove the lenses entirely and add them in post-production. For example, in the big speech that Captain America gives in the finale, every shot had the lenses added with visual effects.</p>\n<p>Similarly, Sam&#8217;s new Captain America suit required a little bit of touching up around the cowl. It&#8217;s a bit of an awkward headpiece, and there&#8217;s no material they had that would allow it to fit snugly on his head without moving weirdly around his neck. Occasionally, depending on how Anthony Mackie turns his head, there would be these weird flaps that folded out, and it just looked sloppy. So the visual effects team had to make those disappear so the suit look tight and clean.</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-669367 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/falconandthewintersoldier-danielbruhl-suitkovia-700x317.jpg\" alt=\"The Falcon and The Winte Soldier - Daniel Bruhl\" width=\"700\" height=\"317\" srcset=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/falconandthewintersoldier-danielbruhl-suitkovia-700x317.jpg 700w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/falconandthewintersoldier-danielbruhl-suitkovia-360x163.jpg 360w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/falconandthewintersoldier-danielbruhl-suitkovia-768x347.jpg 768w, https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/falconandthewintersoldier-danielbruhl-suitkovia.jpg 1041w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></p>\n<h2>Shop at Suit-kovia</h2>\n<p>Even though <em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em> takes plenty of serious turns, Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan and Daniel Brühl are quite the amusing trio. When the cameras aren&#8217;t rolling, these guys are cracking jokes at each other up and clearly having a good time. At one point in the doc, Anthony Mackie spouts a variation of lyrics from a Mystikal song to Sebastian Stan.</p>\n<p>But the best part of all their shenanigans is that the crew took the time to have Daniel Brühl, in-character as Baron Zemo, film a makeshift commercial for a clothing store called Suit-kovia. It&#8217;s shot in a single take on the set of the Brass Monkey nightclub in Madripoor, and it&#8217;s easily the best thing to come out of this entire documentary. If you want to see it right now, head to the 34:14 mark and enjoy.</p>\n<p><em>Assembled: The Making of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em> is available on Disney+ right now.</p>\n<p>The post <a

I&#8217;m just guessing here.</p>\n<p><strong>Jaume Collet-Serra</strong>, the director of <em>Orphan</em>, <em>The Shallows</em>, and more, is directing <em>Black Adam</em>, which focuses on the DC comics antihero/sometimes enemy of Shazam. In the film, Black Adam is a member of an ancient civilization chosen by the Council of Wizards – the same Council of Wizards that assisted young Billy Batson in <em>Shazam!</em> – to become a superhero and save his people. But Black Adam uses unconventional methods that are considere cruel and villainous, and the council decided they&#8217;d had enough of his bullshit and imprisoned him for 5000 years.</p>\n<p>Of course, Black Adam eventually escapes from his prison, and he&#8217;s probably understandably a little ticked off. To stop him this time, a team of superheroes known as the Justice Society is formed. That team consists of <strong>Aldis Hodge</strong> as Hawkman, <strong>Noah Centineo</strong> as Atom Smasher, <strong>Quintessa Swindell</strong> as Cyclone, and <strong>Pierce Brosnan </strong>as Doctor Fate. <strong>Marwan Kenzari</strong> is also part of the cast, playing the movie&#8217;s villain, and <strong>James Cusati-Moye</strong> is in the film as well, and so is <strong>Bodhi Sabongui</strong>.</p>\n<p>Johnson has been circling the role of Black Adam since at least 2007. At one point the plan was to have Black Adam appear in the <em>Shazam!</em> movie, but after Johnson met with DC&#8217;s Geoff Johns it was decided to make a <em>Black Adam</em> standalone movie in addition to a <em>Shazam!</em> movie. The plan is to eventually have Shazam and Black Adam meet up in a future film, but for now, there&#8217;s a standalone <em>Black Adam</em> movie on the way as well as a <em>Shazam!</em> sequel, <em>Shazam: Fury of the Gods</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Black Adam</em> is set to open on <strong>July 29, 2022</strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/black-adam-cast-uli-latukefu/\">&#8216;Black Adam&#8217; Cast Adds &#8216;Young Rock&#8217; Actor Uli Latukefu</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=29Orhk9jfaI:PfOSEIphTHE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=29Orhk9jfaI:PfOSEIphTHE:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=29Orhk9jfaI:PfOSEIphTHE:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=29Orhk9jfaI:PfOSEIphTHE:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=29Orhk9jfaI:PfOSEIphTHE:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=29Orhk9jfaI:PfOSEIphTHE:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/29Orhk9jfaI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 30 Apr 2021 18:30:46 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/black-adam-cast-Uli-Latukefu-700x321.jpg","linkMd5":"3151fc8b856907e46cebb028467b5718","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn8@2020_5/2021/05/01/06-42-05-880_0a4ae4e5efd82dd7.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":321,"sourceBytes":39336,"destBytes":26186,"author":"Chris Evangelista","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/black-adam-cast-Uli-Latukefu-700x321.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn8@2020_5/2021/05/01/06-42-05-880_0a4ae4e5efd82dd7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn63@2020_5/2021/05/01/06-42-16-370_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=29Orhk9jfaI:PfOSEIphTHE:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn89@2020_6/2021/05/01/06-42-16-263_8df1b77bdc528ff0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn84@2020_6/2021/05/01/06-42-16-819_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=29Orhk9jfaI:PfOSEIphTHE:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn23@2020_1/2021/05/01/06-42-16-096_5b391493e5fd4799.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/29Orhk9jfaI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn56@2020_4/2021/05/01/06-42-16-645_3852c3605e960e66.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1619851311497},{"createdTime":"2021-05-01 14:41:51","updatedTime":"2021-05-01 14:41:51","title":"‘The Mighty Ducks’ Franchise Writer Steven Brill Talks the Future of ‘Game Changers’, Reunion Challenges, and…a Broadway Musical?

But the reunion isn&#8217;t quite as chipper as you might expect, and that&#8217;s exactly how franchise writer <strong>Steven Brill</strong> likes it.</p>\n<p>For the <em>Mighty Ducks</em> reunion episode of <em>Game Changers</em>, we sat down to talk with Steven Brill, the writer of all three original movies and executive producer/writer of the new Disney+ series (who also directs the reunion episode). In our conversation, find out about the development of <strong><em>Mighty Ducks 4</em></strong> before <em>Game Changers</em> came along, who missed out on the reunion due to the coronavirus pandemic, staying true to the show&#8217;s dramatic roots, and some of the hopeful plans for the future of <em>Game Changers</em>, including the return of more original Mighty Ducks teammates. Oh, and did you know that a <em>Mighty Ducks</em> musical could be in the cards?<span id=\"more-669281\"></span></p>\n<p><b>Before <em>Game Changers</em> came along, was there ever any movement on a fourth Mighty Ducks movie or anything like that?</b></p>\n<p>Well, I’d always thought about it. I didn’t think we were done with the franchise after the third one because everything was pretty much intact. I thought for years and years about how to update it. Even as the kids got older, we wondered if we should play with the original <em>Mighty Ducks</em> and see them through their adult life and check in with them as 40-year olds. Would that be a tragedy? Because they’ve gotten older, maybe they can’t play?</p>\n<p>Another idea I wanted was to turn it into a musical, a Broadway musical with songs. I thought a version of <em>Mighty Ducks</em>, maybe a little hybrid with <em>D2</em>, would be a really fun way to do the series. So that got me excited. Kids on ice. And gotta fly. And quack quack quack would be a great musical moment.</p>\n<p>But because of streaming, the idea came to do a longer movie. Everyone says on streaming they’re doing long movies, but in our case, it really is. Because of streaming, we get to do this five-hour version of <em>Mighty Ducks 4</em>, and this is exactly what I think a fourth <em>Ducks</em> movie would be.</p>\n<p><b>That’s good to hear, because it seems like Disney doesn’t really make movies like <em>The Mighty Ducks</em> anymore. Was there any challenge in convincing them that this would work for today’s audiences? </b></p>\n<p>That’s a good question. It’s just part of the way the movie industry has evolved. But over the past 10 years, when I started thinking about <em>Mighty Ducks 4</em>, it became more about Marvel and Pixar and bigger tentpole movies. The smaller sports movie just wasn’t something they were making because the culture had shifted away from making mid-level budget movies. I think the last one they tried was <em>Million Dollar Arm</em> with Jon Hamm or another one of those. They did fine, but not big enough. It seemed like the genre was being squeezed out from all movie studios, not just from Disney, in the theatrical arena.</p>\n<p>So when streaming came along, it really felt like a savior. It wasn’t me having to pitch them. They saw the format as a way to explore the franchise, and I was really happy to get that five-hour stretch to do whatever we wanted as far as telling the story.</p>\n<p><b>What is it about<em> The Mighty Ducks</em> that has allowed it to endure? It’s not the first slobs vs. snobs story we’ve seen, especially in sports, so what has made it so memorable after all this time?</b></p>\n<p>I’ve thought about that, and I have stock answers, which I don’t know if they’re true or not. Because people really get hooked in. But I always thought, even before it was successful, that it was the idea of watching this team, which was a surrogate family essentially, and that connection people long for and want. Then the coach being the father figure, going through trials together. Ducks fly together and “The Flying V,” I thought that was part of the hook. The actual good-naturedness of it, and the actual emotion was the hook too, along with hockey, which I always thought would create an interesting dynamic and cinematic thing that would hit all the buttons. Between hockey and that emotion, I think that’s what carries it forward. But I could be wrong. It could be just the music, I don’t know. [laughs]</p>\n<p><b>The score is definitely one of the more iconic themes to come out of these kind of movies. It’s instantly recognizable. </b></p>\n<p>Yeah, I love that. I didn’t know that, and then we kept using it more and more. I get really energized by the original score, which is something that a lot of TV shows don’t do. But that’s our streaming approach to making this like a movie. We scored it like a movie. We didn’t score it like an episodic TV show where they have commercials you have to get in and out of. We scored it lush and full-bodied, along with good needle drops from contemporary songs when appropriate. But I love that old school full score.</p>\n<p><b>Can you talk about making “Spirit of the Ducks” episode a little more dramatic endeavor than some fans might be expecting? There’s definitely an upbeat side of the reunion, but it takes a darker turn. </b></p>\n<p>Yeah, I think that was just the way to go. It does turn into a celebration together, but I had to add some tension there because I think that makes sense for the characters. Bombay, because he retreated, there’s a level of disconnection between him and the other team. I thought that this would be a cool way to play it. Plus, me and [co-showrunner and executive producer ] Josh Goldsmith, we don’t argue, but we tease each other because he says the show’s a comedy, and I think it’s a drama. He thinks it’s a comedy with drama, and I think it’s a drama with comedy. So to my point, as a drama with comedy, it makes sense that we would do the episode this way.</p>\n<p><b>Is there anybody you had hoped would be part of the reunion but couldn’t get on board for one reason or another, whether it was scheduling or complications from the pandemic? </b></p>\n<p>Yeah, we had restrictions. It was not great to not be able to get everybody that we wanted. Sometimes it was because, like <strong>Aaron Lohr</strong> [who played Dean Portman, one of the Bash Brothers], was a counselor at a facility, and he couldn’t leave for a month to do this quarantine in order to shoot for two weeks. A lot of these people have other lives. <strong>Mike Vitar</strong> [who played Luis Mendoza] is a firefighter, and even during COVID, it wasn’t possible. A lot of those people we couldn’t get. I would have made it a 40-person reunion. I would have gotten every single person from <em>The Mighty Ducks</em>, and we even set up the format so that anyone who was ever a Duck could be in the episode. There were restrictions, sadly. But that’s what season two is for, to touch base with everybody else. It probably would have gotten to unwieldy and we wouldn’t have gotten to spend as much time as we did with each character. So I think we got the right balance, but there’s definitely a lot more storylines and people I want to bring back.</p>\n<p><b>So the plan is to bring back some of the other Mighty Ducks in a future season?</b></p>\n<p>Yes! The mythology is the same.<strong> Joshua Jackson</strong> and [Emilio Estevez] have a really interesting backstory we have to explore. Many of these people still live in Minneapolis or St. Paul, and they should be part of the fabric of the show. As we go forward, they should be able to be there. One person works for the city, and one person is a substitute teacher, another drives a limo. There’s all sorts of characters I’d love to keep on tap and also re-introduce.</p>\n<p><b>You mentioned the relationship between Charlie and Gordon, can you give us any hint as to the kind of complications that exist between them at this point in their lives? Is that something we’ll learn about this season or is it being saved for another season?</b></p>\n<p>I’m saving it, because if we’re able to do it, I always thought that Charlie/Josh should come back in a real way, where we get to spend time with him. Not just a cameo or an episode, which would be fun. And <strong>Kenan [Thompson]</strong>, to a certain degree, when we talked to him, we said, “We’d love to be able to use you in a real way and have you come in and not just be a cameo but come in and actually do some storylines.” So that’s the hope for the future for sure. I think Kenan’s Russ Tyler character went off to be on <em>Saturday Night Live</em>, strangely enough, and that’s what Kenan did, so when Russ comes back, he could be a guy who was on <em>Saturday Night Live</em>. That makes perfect sense.</p>\n<p><b>I’m sure you know about the unfortunate situation with Shaun Weiss (Greg Goldberg), and I was wondering if there was any hope of getting him to come back now that he’s getting on the right track again.  </b></p>\n<p>Yeah, 100%. The door is open. I’m so happy that he’s in recovery and seems to be doing well, and it’s important to reintroduce him and get him back when he is physically and technically ready to come. I can’t wait. It would be great. He’s Goldberg. No matter what, he’s Goldberg.</p>\n<p><strong>How much has a series like <em>Cobra Kai</em> influenced <em>Game Changers</em>? Do you have multiple season arcs planned so you know where these characters are heading to continue the legacy of <em>The Mighty Ducks</em>?</strong></p>\n<p>It’s funny, <em>Cobra Kai</em> is a great show, but I developed the ideas for this show, similarly with the Ducks being the bad guys, and then I saw <em>Cobra Kai</em> made a move like that in their own franchise with great success. And that made me happy. That seemed to work and the audience didn’t totally rebel, so we had parallel thinking on that line. But then when we became a real show, I stopped watching <em>Cobra Kai</em> because I don’t want to be influenced by anything they do. But they seem to be doing great. I actually don’t know how they arc out their seasons, but I think Josh, [co-showrunner and executive producer Cathy Yuspa] and I have a few cards up our sleeve for which way we wanna go for the next season, and then the season after that, I sort of think of it like the movies. The whole team sort of moves into another adventure together. They could stay in Minneapolis and just be more rooted in the stories there. We gotta figure that out, but eventually, they should go to Europe and play. In like season four, they should go to Europe. When it opens up, we should definitely go to Europe and play in an international tournament.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\n<p><em>The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers</em> is available to stream on Disney+, and “Spirit of the Ducks” is out today.

He has not made another Hollywood movie since <em>The Artist</em> had its big moment in the sun (not that making Hollywood movies is the end-all, be-all of filmmaking), but if this remake becomes an international crossover hit like the original Japanese movie, I&#8217;ll be curious to see if Hollywood comes calling.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/one-cut-of-the-dead-remake/\">&#8216;One Cut of the Dead&#8217; is Getting a French Remake From the Director of &#8216;The Artist&#8217;</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com\">/Film</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=fS7wxUQO6fg:mUaYXuI5FiA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=fS7wxUQO6fg:mUaYXuI5FiA:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=fS7wxUQO6fg:mUaYXuI5FiA:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=fS7wxUQO6fg:mUaYXuI5FiA:I9og5sOYxJI\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?a=fS7wxUQO6fg:mUaYXuI5FiA:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=fS7wxUQO6fg:mUaYXuI5FiA:EGzC5_Ws_ZE\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/fS7wxUQO6fg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 30 Apr 2021 23:00:37 +0000","feedId":21,"bgimg":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/One-Cut-of-the-Dead-remake-700x300.jpg","linkMd5":"c358820821fbad2dd48d876427ffefa3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn3@2020_4/2021/05/01/06-42-03-839_35b9ce1dc55957ce.webp","destWidth":700,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":41575,"destBytes":28736,"author":"Ben Pearson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/One-Cut-of-the-Dead-remake-700x300.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn3@2020_4/2021/05/01/06-42-03-839_35b9ce1dc55957ce.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn63@2020_5/2021/05/01/06-42-16-370_9a442e8760d02cd4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=fS7wxUQO6fg:mUaYXuI5FiA:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn88@2020_2/2021/05/01/06-42-16-559_05130fa05790db9f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?d=I9og5sOYxJI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn84@2020_6/2021/05/01/06-42-16-819_879c5505f034c3d2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/slashfilm?i=fS7wxUQO6fg:mUaYXuI5FiA:EGzC5_Ws_ZE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn86@2020_3/2021/05/01/06-42-16-154_51f88c07f29c7712.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/slashfilm/~4/fS7wxUQO6fg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn24@2020_1/2021/05/01/06-42-16-217_86d96c15ba60dcce.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1619851311498}],"record":{"createdTime":"2021-05-01 14:41:51","updatedTime":"2021-05-01 14:41:51","feedId":21,"fetchDate":"Sat, 01 May 2021 06:41:51 +0000","fetchMs":54,"handleMs":293,"totalMs":26160,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":20,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"245d88d7b2d8f26704713c23b090d029","hostName":"us-021*","requestId":"9e7affddacf949caa76633b2208eae3e_21","contentType":"text/xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":888972,"bgimgsTotal":20,"bgimgsGithubTotal":20,"articlesImgsTotal":96,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":96,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx8":4,"myreaderx14":3,"myreaderx7":4,"myreaderx15":3,"myreaderx16":3,"myreaderx6":3,"myreaderx32":3,"myreaderx10":4,"myreaderx4":4,"myreaderx33":4,"myreaderx11":3,"myreaderx3":3,"myreaderx2":4,"myreaderx12":4,"myreaderx13":4,"myreaderx1":3,"myreaderx30":2,"myreaderx31":3,"myreaderx18":4,"myreaderx19":3,"myreaderx":3,"myreaderx25":4,"myreaderx27":2,"myreaderx21":3,"myreaderx22":4,"myreaderx23":4,"myreaderx24":3,"myreaderx5oss":2,"myreaderx29":3},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-05-30 17:21:38","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 09:23:23","id":21,"name":"/Film","url":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/slashfilm","subscriber":null,"website":null,"icon":"https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/cropped-ZZ46A5EC75-32x32.jpg","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx64/cdn36@2020_2/2020/09/01/01-23-09-121_cba84478f5ca776d.jpg","description":"Movie News and Reviews This feed is for non commercial use.
