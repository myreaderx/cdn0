A: We’re Not Sure!","link":"https://kottke.org/20/11/q-what-is-a-hole-a-were-not-sure","description":"<p>How many holes does a donut have? That’s pretty easy: one. What about a straw? Two (one at each end) or just one? (Isn’t a straw just an elongated donut?) Does a coffee mug have one hole or two? Does a bowl have a hole? If no, then what about a hole in the ground or a hole in a wall that doesn’t pass all the way through? Does a basketball have a hole? A Reddit user asked 1600 people how many holes were in various objects and <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/jiaqsu/oc_i_asked_16k_people_how_many_holes_certain/\">the results are fantastically all over the place</a>.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/how-many-holes.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"850\" border=\"0\" alt=\"How Many Holes\" /></p> \n<p>This is a trivial question, but it reveals something interesting about people’s perceptions. <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hole\">The dictionary definition of “hole”</a> includes two main meanings for the purposes of this question: “an opening through something” and “a hollowed-out place”. Mathematics offers <a href=\"https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Hole.html\">another possible meaning</a>:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>A hole in a mathematical object is a topological structure which prevents the object from being continuously shrunk to a point. When dealing with topological spaces, a disconnectivity is interpreted as a hole in the space. Examples of holes are things like the “donut hole” in the center of the torus, a domain removed from a plane, and the portion missing from Euclidean space after cutting a knot out from it.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>But a hole isn’t clearly defined in math or topology. From <a href=\"https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/roots-of-unity/what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-holes/\">What We Talk about When We Talk about Holes</a> in Scientific American:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>Here’s my short answer that is also the reason I’m not an algebraic topologist. If you can put it on a necklace, it has a one-dimensional hole. If you can fill it with toothpaste, it has a two-dimensional hole. For holes of higher dimensions, you’re on your own.</p> \n <p>That answer isn’t very satisfying. Is there a better way to describe holes? I talked with some of my topologist friends and discovered two things: topologists don’t all agree on what a hole is, and it’s fun and interesting to think about different interpretations of a word whose mathematical definition isn’t completely settled. I think my larger conclusion, in the spirit of the season, is that holes are like Santa Claus: the true meaning is in your heart.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>No wonder those poll results are all over the place. But at the same time, it’s interesting that many more people say that donuts have a hole than washers or rubber bands. I guess donut holes have better marketing? As for straws — reason tells me they only have one hole but I know in my heart they have two.

Rome), that looks at ancient self-governing democracies and republics in the Greek and Roman world and describes how they fell into crisis and, crucially, how they were able to recover to avoid losing that self-governance.</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>But in that large sample size, we also get a sense of what solutions succeed and what solutions fail to hold together a self-governing community in these sorts of pressures. Beset by repeated political crises from 494 to 287 (known as the Struggle of the Orders), the Roman Republic repeatedly survived and grew stronger through compromise and by constructive, inclusive redefinition of the republic to include a broader range of people (not merely the patrician elite, but also the plebeian elite). In no small part, that success seems to have been motivated by the avowed need of elite patricians for the support of the plebeian commons in order to campaign, since the plebeians made up most of the army.</p> \n <p>In stark contrast, the effort by conservative (in the general sense, not in the American sense) elements of the Roman senate to ‘hold the line’ and permit no compromise on questions of land reform and citizenship in the Late Republic led quite directly to the outbreak of civil war in 91 (with the Italian allies) and in 88 (between Romans) and consequently to the collapse of the Republic. Initially, the influence and raw power of the elite was sufficient to squash efforts at reform (including the murder of some prominent reformers), but in the long run the discontent those crackdowns created laid the fertile ground for the rise of demagogic military leaders to supplant the Republic entirely, culminating in first Caesar and then Octavian doing just that. In an effort to compromise on nothing, the Roman elite lost everything.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>Devereaux then draws a parallel to the 2020 election:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>In short, Joe Biden is running on a platform of compromise and a constructive, inclusive redefinition of the polity which explicitly welcomes past opponents to join him at the table. To me, reasoning from historical example, that seems like the correct answer to the current moment.</p> \n <p>On the other hand, we have a different candidate (and current President) who is running on a promise to ‘win’ the stasis by main force, to dominate and to win, indeed, until he (or we) get tired of winning, to escalate the tensions to the final victory of the faction. This is exactly the approach that I think a sober reading of historical examples warns us is likely doomed to failure, regardless of what one thinks of the underlying policy aims (which might well have been achieved without the rhetoric and practice of escalation). I cannot help but think that, as happened in the last decades of the Roman Republic, rewarding this sort of rhetoric and behavior will produce more of it from both parties and put our republic on a dangerous path.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<strong>Tags:</strong> \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/2020%20election\">2020 election</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Bret%20Devereaux\">Bret Devereaux</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/politics\">politics</a>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 09 Nov 2020 21:32:33 +0000","feedId":33,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"6a7b18dc8e7a017e729f61bac340a2e7","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jason Kottke","publishedOrCreatedDate":1605375001193},{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:01","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:01","title":"Initial Data Shows Covid-19 Vaccine Is More than 90% Effective","link":"https://kottke.org/20/11/initial-data-shows-covid-19-vaccine-is-more-than-90-effective","description":"<p>In a press release (and not a paper in a peer-reviewed journal) based on a preliminary outside review of data from its phase 3 trial, Pfizer says its Covid-19 vaccine <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/09/health/covid-vaccine-pfizer.html\">was more than 90% effective in preventing the disease</a>.</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>The company said that the analysis found that the vaccine was more than 90 percent effective in preventing the disease among trial volunteers who had no evidence of prior coronavirus infection. If the results hold up, that level of protection would put it on par with highly effective childhood vaccines for diseases such as measles. No serious safety concerns have been observed, the company said.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>I really hope this analysis holds up when more data from the study is released:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>The data released by Pfizer Monday was delivered in a news release, not a peer-reviewed medical journal. It is not conclusive evidence that the vaccine is safe and effective, and the initial finding of more than 90 percent efficacy could change as the trial goes on.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>The world, and the United States, could really really use some good news like this about the pandemic.</p> \n<p><strong title=\"Nov 09, 2020\">Update:</strong> Here’s <a href=\"https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-announce-vaccine-candidate-against\">Pfizer’s press release</a>. And <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nataliexdean/status/1325820512946302977\">a thread from Dr. Natalie Dean</a> on how she is interpreting this news (“Celebrate, but let the process play out over time as intended.”)</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>Pfizer’s first analysis was planned for 32 events, which they pushed back after discussions with FDA. But by the time they analyzed the data, 94 had accrued. This shows how quickly trials can generate results when placed in hotspots (and how much transmission is ongoing!).</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>These vaccines are tested until a certain number of infections happen. So you have this interesting paradoxical situation where if a potential vaccine is more successful at curbing infection, the longer it takes for the study to conclude. You get a better vaccine but wait longer for it. Countering that are the rising transmission counts in the US — more community transmission will get you to the target number of infections more quickly.</p> \n<p><strong title=\"Nov 10, 2020\">Update:</strong> From virologist Dr. Florian Krammer, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/florian_krammer/status/1325887332428505090\">a thread</a> about what Pfizer and other companies will be looking for in terms of the efficacy of vaccines in a number of different situations. Overall, he is optimistic about these preliminary results. And here’s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/09/health/pfizer-covid-19-vaccine.html\">a FAQ about the vaccine</a> from the NY Times.</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>Another open question is whether children will get protection from the vaccine. The trial run by Pfizer and BioNTech initially was open to people 18 or older, but in September they began including teenagers as young as 16. Last month, they launched a new trial on children as young as 12 and plan to work their way to younger ages.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p><strong title=\"Nov 11, 2020\">Update:</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Literature_Lady/status/1325973514499874818\">A very simplified explanation</a> of Pfizer’s RNA-based vaccine.</p> \n<strong>Tags:</strong> \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/COVID-19\">COVID-19</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Florian%20Krammer\">Florian Krammer</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/medicine\">medicine</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Natalie%20Dean\">Natalie Dean</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Pfizer\">Pfizer</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/science\">science</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/vaccines\">vaccines</a>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 09 Nov 2020 12:53:05 +0000","feedId":33,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"04bee1aa7ada44b8dd81e4072444c611","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jason Kottke","publishedOrCreatedDate":1605375001192},{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:01","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:01","title":"AlphaGo - The Movie","link":"https://kottke.org/20/11/alphago---the-movie","description":"<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WXuK6gekU1Y\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p> \n<p>I missed this back in March (I think there was a lot going on back then?) but the feature-length documentary <a href=\"https://www.alphagomovie.com/\">AlphaGo</a> is now available to stream for free on YouTube.

We have accepted, so to speak, a second Bill of Rights under which a new basis of security and prosperity can be established for all — regardless of station, race, or creed.</p> \n <p>Among these are:</p> \n <p>- The right to a useful and remunerative job in the industries or shops or farms or mines of the nation;</p> \n <p>- The right to earn enough to provide adequate food and clothing and recreation;</p> \n <p>- The right of every farmer to raise and sell his products at a return which will give him and his family a decent living;</p> \n <p>- The right of every businessman, large and small, to trade in an atmosphere of freedom from unfair competition and domination by monopolies at home or abroad;</p> \n <p>- The right of every family to a decent home;</p> \n <p>- The right to adequate medical care and the opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health;</p> \n <p>- The right to adequate protection from the economic fears of old age, sickness, accident, and unemployment;</p> \n <p>- The right to a good education.</p> \n <p>All of these rights spell security. And after this war is won we must be prepared to move forward, in the implementation of these rights, to new goals of human happiness and well-being.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>After WWII, many countries in Europe came to similar conclusions and enacted reforms to offer these rights to their citizens.

The task force, he said, would quickly consult with state and local health officials on how to best prevent coronavirus spread, reopen schools and businesses, and address the racial disparities that have left communities of color harder hit than others by the pandemic.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>From Biden’s transition website, here’s <a href=\"https://buildbackbetter.com/priorities/covid-19/\">the Biden-Harris administration’s seven-point plan to beat COVID-19</a> (which is the first item in the site’s “Priorities” menu). The seven points are:</p> \n<ol>\n <li>Ensure all Americans have access to regular, reliable, and free testing.</li> \n <p><li>Fix personal protective equipment (PPE) problems for good.</li></p> \n <p><li>Provide clear, consistent, evidence-based guidance for how communities should navigate the pandemic — and the resources for schools, small businesses, and families to make it through.</li></p> \n <p><li>Plan for the effective, equitable distribution of treatments and vaccines - because development isn’t enough if they aren’t effectively distributed.</li></p> \n <p><li>Protect older Americans and others at high risk.</li></p> \n <p><li>Rebuild and expand defenses to predict, prevent, and mitigate pandemic threats, including those coming from China.</li></p> \n <p><li>Implement mask mandates nationwide by working with governors and mayors and by asking the American people to do what they do best: step up in a time of crisis.</li></p>\n</ol> \n<p>This looks like what the plan should have been from the beginning. Of particular note, under the point about testing:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>Stand up a Pandemic Testing Board like Roosevelt’s War Production Board. It’s how we produced tanks, planes, uniforms, and supplies in record time, and it’s how we will produce and distribute tens of millions of tests.</p> \n <p>Establish a U.S. Public Health Jobs Corps to mobilize at least 100,000 Americans across the country with support from trusted local organizations in communities most at risk to perform culturally competent approaches to contact tracing and protecting at-risk populations.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>Over the past week, as Americans voted and then held their breath for the results of the election, over 750,000 Americans tested positive for Covid-19. Based on <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/mortality-risk-covid\">the current case fatality rate of 2.4%</a>, over 18,000 of those people will die in the days and weeks ahead. Many more will suffer long-term health effects because of the disease and struggle emotionally, financially, and spiritually in the months ahead. I really <em>really</em> hope there’s enough of a spirit of togetherness and cooperation left in America for a science-based plan like this to work in controlling a disease that’s killed almost 230,000 people.

You film actors in front of a green or blue screen and then use digital editing technology to replace the solid color with any background you’d like. But as Phil Edwards explains in this video, the effects teams for some movies and shows (like Disney’s The Mandalorian) have swapped green screens for virtual sets. In lieu of block colored backgrounds, the actors are surrounded by massive LED panels that display the background and background action so everything can be filmed in one go.</p> \n<p>It’s a pretty cool technique. Among the benefits of such a system: you get the “natural” light from the LEDs falling on the actors and other objects in the scene, so you don’t need to add it in later digitally or use extra on-set lighting.</p> \n<strong>Tags:</strong> \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/movies\">movies</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/The%20Mandalorian\">The Mandalorian</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/TV\">TV</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 13 Nov 2020 21:40:24 +0000","feedId":33,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"b51fef1babd786ce9617cfda88a481ca","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jason Kottke","publishedOrCreatedDate":1605375001192},{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:01","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:01","title":"Powell’s Books Is Releasing a Fragrance that Smells Like a Bookstore","link":"https://kottke.org/20/11/powells-books-is-releasing-a-fragrance-that-smells-like-a-bookstore","description":"<p><img src=\"https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/powells-fragrance.jpg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"682\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Powell's Books fragrance\" /></p> \n<p>Beloved Portland indie bookseller Powell’s Books is <a href=\"https://www.powells.com/book/powells-unisex-fragrance-1110000347670\">selling a unisex fragrance that smells like a bookstore</a>.</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>This scent contains the lives of countless heroes and heroines.

Viewing the solution to these problems as simply electing Joe Biden and Kamala Harris both underestimates the depth of the problems and trivializes the remedies necessary to undo the damage.

Bridges has a new book out today called <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/2966/9780593378526\">This Is Your Time</a>.</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>Written as a letter from civil rights activist and icon Ruby Bridges to the reader, This Is Your Time is both a recounting of Ruby’s experience as a child who had no choice but to be escorted to class by federal marshals when she was chosen as one of the first black students to integrate New Orleans’ all-white public school system and an appeal to generations to come to effect change.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/11/07/932091148/60-years-later-ruby-bridges-tells-her-story-in-this-is-your-time\">In a segment on NPR’s Weekend Edition</a>, Bridges shared some of her story from the book.</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>The first day that I arrived with federal marshals, they rushed me inside of the building. And 500 kids walked out of school that first day and they never returned.</p> \n <p>[Making friends] did not come easy because I heard kids, there were days when I would go into this coat closet to hang up my coat and I could hear kids laughing and talking, but I never saw them. Later on, I came to realize that they were being hidden from me in another classroom.</p> \n <p>And that was because there were some white parents who actually crossed that picket line and brought their kids to school. But the principal who was part of the opposition, she would hide them. And even though I was complaining — or at least mentioning it to Mrs. Henry, she would never say anything to me, but she was actually going to the principal and saying, if you don’t allow those kids to come together, because the law has now changed, then I’m going to report you to the superintendent. And so I think after months of that, we were allowed to come together.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>Bridges is only 66 years old today — this was all not so long ago.</p> \n<p><strong title=\"Nov 11, 2020\">Update:</strong> Sad news: Ruby’s mother, Lucille Bridges, <a href=\"https://www.wfxrtv.com/news/national/lucille-bridges-mother-of-activist-ruby-bridges-dies-at-86/\">died yesterday at the age of 86</a>.</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>Her daughter went on to become an icon of the Civil Rights Movement, memorialized in Norman Rockwell’s famous painting “The Problem We All Live With” which depicts a tiny Ruby in a white dress carrying her notebooks and a ruler surrounded by much taller U.S. Marshals. But Ruby Bridges once credited her parents as the forces behind her history-making achievement.</p> \n <p>“My parents are the real heroes,” the U.S. Marshals Service once quoted her as saying during a ceremony at an art gallery showing the painting. “They (sent me to that public school) because they felt it was the right thing to do.”</p>\n</blockquote> \n<strong>Tags:</strong> \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/art\">art</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/books\">books</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/education\">education</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Normal%20Rockwell\">Normal Rockwell</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/racism\">racism</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Ruby%20Bridges\">Ruby Bridges</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/This%20Is%20Your%20Time\">This Is Your Time</a>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 10 Nov 2020 18:38:44 +0000","feedId":33,"bgimg":"https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/the-problem-we-all-live-with.jpg","linkMd5":"0fcd7f9a68cd132082a6c3dabbbbc5a5","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn12@2020_5/2020/11/14/17-30-03-701_7337e551905b1379.webp","destWidth":1000,"destHeight":617,"sourceBytes":236964,"destBytes":124186,"author":"Jason Kottke","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://kottke.org/plus/misc/images/the-problem-we-all-live-with.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn12@2020_5/2020/11/14/17-30-03-701_7337e551905b1379.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605375001196},{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:01","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:01","title":"How Soy Sauce Is Made Using Traditional Methods","link":"https://kottke.org/20/11/how-soy-sauce-is-made-using-traditional-methods","description":"<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/P6bk_AGu5mw\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p> \n<p>Since 1789, <a href=\"https://kinbue.jp/en\">Fueki Syoyu Brewing</a> has been making soy sauce using simple ingredients, big wooden barrels for aging, and traditional methods handed down through the generations to ensure the signature richness and taste of their product.

Last month, the first documents using the new design <a href=\"https://www.schengenvisainfo.com/news/norway-introduces-new-safer-passports/\">were released</a>. You can <a href=\"https://neue.no/work/norwegian-passports/\">see them here</a>.</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>Aside from a design that makes the passport safer, the passport also has details from Norwegian nature used both as a background illustration and a security element.</p> \n <p>When the pages of the passports are placed under UV light, the reproduction of the Norwegian landscape will change from day to night, with, among other things, beautiful northern lights and clouds.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>You can see the appearance of the northern lights under UV in the third image above — what a great detail! And I liked this explanation regarding the shared ownership of the passport:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>The documents need to ensure identification for its holder and for controlling authorities — domestically as well as abroad. This implies that the ID documents are both a private and a public matter. The document’s holder should feel proud ownership, thus treating the documents carefully and with respect.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>When we can all travel again, I will be on the lookout for these sharp-looking documents. And how does one get Norwegian citizenship…?

González undoubtably performed Tchaikovsky’s Swan Lake hundreds or even thousands of times. González passed away recently — perhaps from complications due to her Alzheimer’s, which can affect a person’s memory and movements in profound ways — but she had one last chance to revisit her ballet days before she died. In the video above, you can see how, as she starts to listen to Swan Lake in a pair of headphones, she reanimates and begins performing the dance choreography in her wheelchair. Clips from what I’m assuming is her past Swan Lake performance are interspersed throughout the video.

Leaders and parties can engage in voter suppression and break norms with some degree of bipartisan cooperation across the government. In combination, these features allow for players to engage in a hardball kind of minority rule: Remember that no Republican president has won the popular vote since 2004, and that the Senate is structurally prone to domination by a minority. Yet Republicans have tremendous power. This dynamic occurs at the local level, too, where gerrymandering allows Republicans to inflate their representation in state legislatures.</p> \n <p>The situation is a perfect setup, in other words, for a talented politician to run on Trumpism in 2024. A person without the eager Twitter fingers and greedy hotel chains, someone with a penchant for governing rather than golf. An individual who does not irritate everyone who doesn’t already like him, and someone whose wife looks at him adoringly instead of slapping his hand away too many times in public. Someone who isn’t on tape boasting about assaulting women, and who says the right things about military veterans. Someone who can send appropriate condolences about senators who die, instead of angering their state’s voters, as Trump did, perhaps to his detriment, in Arizona. A norm-subverting strongman who can create a durable majority and keep his coalition together to win more elections.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>You should also read <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zeynep/status/1324788938423361542\">Tufekci’s related thread</a>, where she responds to some comments and criticism of the piece.</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>This isn’t some rare thing that just happened because of weird circumstances. This is a playbook that works. This is a global playbook on the rise. This is a playbook found in America’s past, too. Realism is the true basis for hope.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>We have to keep pushing to make sure no populist authoritarians ever get their hands on the Presidency again.</p> \n<strong>Tags:</strong> \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/politics\">politics</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/USA\">USA</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Zeynep%20Tufekci\">Zeynep Tufekci</a>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 09 Nov 2020 16:41:28 +0000","feedId":33,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"5dea62c1a4d3017fc1e5289ebd8bc0c5","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Jason Kottke","publishedOrCreatedDate":1605375001187},{"createdTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:01","updatedTime":"2020-11-15 01:30:01","title":"Awkward, a Short Film about Uncomfortable Moments","link":"https://kottke.org/20/11/awkward-a-short-film-about-uncomfortable-moments","description":"<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-lNE0EZHbpw\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p> \n<p>Awkward is an animated short film from animator/illustrator <a href=\"https://notofagus.com/\">Nata Metlukh</a> about some of life’s less graceful moments — the “after you” dance of bumping into someone on the street, a disliked haircut in the barber chair, incorrect assumptions, and mistakenly waving hello to someone you don’t know.
