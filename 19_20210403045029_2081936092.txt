The only thing new here is the change in defendants; rather than consumers, Hagens Berman&#8217;s client is a bookstore.</p>\n<p>Folks, as I have said before, I would love to see the agency contracts broken, but I just don&#8217;t see how Hagens Berman is going to win this case. If they have any evidence of a conspiracy, they did not put it in their filings.</p>\n<p>Did I miss something?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">image by <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/60588258@N00/\">steakpinball</a> via <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/60588258@N00/3293465641/\">Flickr</a></p>\n<p>You just finished reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://the-digital-reader.com/2021/03/28/booksellers-file-antitrust-lawsuit-against-amazon-publishers/\">Booksellers File Antitrust Lawsuit Against Amazon, Publishers</a> which was published on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://the-digital-reader.com\">The Digital Reader</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?a=lz4YPlarw4c:lV_sMRP0Lg8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?a=lz4YPlarw4c:lV_sMRP0Lg8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?a=lz4YPlarw4c:lV_sMRP0Lg8:JUhcmGiK9AQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=JUhcmGiK9AQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheDigitalReader/~4/lz4YPlarw4c\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 28 Mar 2021 15:00:25 +0000","feedId":19,"bgimg":"https://i2.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3293465641_2c6a27cfc1_k.jpg?resize=620%2C300&ssl=1","linkMd5":"442c08f1d0ec53d516fd0eb10de164bb","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn10@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-49-02-928_26b8c2b8c28f0557.webp","destWidth":620,"destHeight":300,"sourceBytes":20438,"destBytes":20438,"author":"Nate Hoffelder","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i2.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3293465641_2c6a27cfc1_k.jpg?resize=620%2C300&ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn10@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-49-02-928_26b8c2b8c28f0557.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn71@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-49-52-896_bfba24e96f332be8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn7@2020_4/2021/04/03/04-49-52-234_2057f12fa508c741.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=JUhcmGiK9AQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn52@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-49-52-294_1d48e1fa3d04ed80.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheDigitalReader/~4/lz4YPlarw4c":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn95@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-49-52-805_f72235ad38466e32.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425328493},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:48:48","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:48:48","title":"16 Gmail Hacks Every Writer Can Use","link":"https://the-digital-reader.com/?p=142790","description":"<p>The new year is traditionally a time for self-improvement.

Read on to save time, avoid mistakes, and add a dash of style to your inbox.</p>\n<p>And BTW, these tricks are all intended for Gmail in the web browser. The Gmail app is frustratingly limited.</p>\n<p><em>Note: I have an older post on <a href=\"https://the-digital-reader.com/2017/05/18/dozen-awesome-gmail-hacks/\">a dozen Gmail hacks</a>. The following post (mostly) covers different tricks, and has been significantly updated.</em></p>\n<h2>1. Unhide the promotions, social, and other category tags</h2>\n<p>Did you know that Gmail has category tags? And did you know that Gmail is hiding some of your emails in those tags and is not putting the emails in your inbox?</p>\n<p>A few years back Google “helpfully” added category tags to Gmail. Their intention was to make it easier for you to sort your emails, but things didn’t quite go as planned. Many users ignored the tags because we either had our own systems or did not need them, but that didn’t stop Gmail from automatically using the tags to sort our incoming emails.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year I discovered there were thousands of emails which Gmail had tagged as Social, Update, Forums, or Promotion. None of these emails made it into my main Inbox, which means I missed out on countless important messages.</p>\n<p>My solution to this problem was to find the options menu for each of the category tags, and tell Gmail to show all emails in my Inbox.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/one.jpg?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-142796\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/one.jpg?resize=538%2C382&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"538\" height=\"382\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/one.jpg?w=538&#38;ssl=1 538w, https://i0.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/one.jpg?resize=250%2C178&#38;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/one.jpg?resize=150%2C107&#38;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 538px) 100vw, 538px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<h2>2. Schedule an email to be sent later</h2>\n<p>In this age of notifications setting off phone alarms, we have to be careful about sending emails too late in the day. You don’t want to wake someone up in the middle of the night with an email that could wait until morning. On the other hand, sometimes you also want to make sure you don’t forget to send the email.</p>\n<p>With the Chrome extension Boomerang, you can schedule emails to be sent in the future and set up reminders to send an email. The extension adds an extra menu bar to Gmail’s Compose window where you can specify how long to wait before the email is sent.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can find the extension in the </span><a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/boomerang-for-gmail/mdanidgdpmkimeiiojknlnekblgmpdll?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chrome web store</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/two.jpg?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-142802\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/two.jpg?resize=620%2C349&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"349\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/two.jpg?resize=620%2C349&#38;ssl=1 620w, https://i0.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/two.jpg?resize=250%2C141&#38;ssl=1 250w, https://i0.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/two.jpg?resize=150%2C84&#38;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/two.jpg?resize=768%2C432&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/two.jpg?w=1366&#38;ssl=1 1366w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<h2>3. Unsend emails</h2>\n<p>And then there are the times you wish you could take back an email you just sent — perhaps you found a typo a second too late, or regret writing the email when upset.</p>\n<p>Luckily, there’s a way to avoid this issue. Gmail has a feature called Undo Send. When enabled, it gives you 5, 10, 20, or 30 seconds to stop Gmail from sending an email.</p>\n<p>You can find this option by first clicking the Gear menu button in the upper right corner of the Gmail screen, and then selecting the Settings menu option. There, you’ll find a section labeled Undo Send. This feature is automatically enabled in the new Gmail interface, so all you have to do is specify in the Send cancellation period section just how long you want Gmail to wait before it sends an email.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/three.jpg?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-142800\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/three.jpg?resize=620%2C349&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"349\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/three.jpg?resize=620%2C349&#38;ssl=1 620w, https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/three.jpg?resize=250%2C141&#38;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/three.jpg?resize=150%2C84&#38;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/three.jpg?resize=768%2C432&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/three.jpg?w=1366&#38;ssl=1 1366w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<h2>4. Use Gmail offline</h2>\n<p>The Gmail website is a great way to get work done while you’re online, but did you know that you can also use it offline (just like you do the apps)? Google has released a Chrome extension which lets you keep on writing drafts, deleting emails, and so on, even though you have no connection to the internet.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can find the Gmail offline extension in the </span><a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chrome Web Store</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<h2>5. Use “Tasks” to add emails to your to-do lists</h2>\n<p>When you get an email that requires action on your part, and you can’t get to it right away, look at the menu bar above your emails. If you’re in the reading view, you’ll see a button marked More.</p>\n<p>Click that button and select the Add to Tasks option. This adds the email to a little to-do list.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/five.jpg?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-142794\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/five.jpg?resize=299%2C346&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"299\" height=\"346\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/five.jpg?w=299&#38;ssl=1 299w, https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/five.jpg?resize=216%2C250&#38;ssl=1 216w, https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/five.jpg?resize=130%2C150&#38;ssl=1 130w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 299px) 100vw, 299px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<h2>6. Automatically archive a sent email</h2>\n<p>Inbox Zero is a popular productivity hack where you strive to keep your inbox empty — or almost empty – at all times. This isn’t always a practical goal — in fact, the best I can get is Inbox Thirty — but in principle aspiring to Inbox Zero is a great way to reduce the clutter in your inbox so that you can focus on the important emails.</p>\n<p>One way you can work towards Inbox Zero is to enable Gmail’s Send and archive feature.</p>\n<p>You can enable this feature by first clicking the Gear menu button in the upper right corner of the Gmail screen, and then selecting the Settings menu option. There, you’ll find a section labeled “Send &#38; Archive”. Click the radio button next to show “Send &#38; Archive” button in reply.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/six.jpg?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-142798\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/six.jpg?resize=620%2C349&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"349\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/six.jpg?resize=620%2C349&#38;ssl=1 620w, https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/six.jpg?resize=250%2C141&#38;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/six.jpg?resize=150%2C84&#38;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/six.jpg?resize=768%2C432&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/six.jpg?w=1366&#38;ssl=1 1366w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<h2>7. Pause your inbox</h2>\n<p>Studies show that limiting yourself to checking email only a few times a day can reduce stress and boost productivity. If you need to temporarily remove distractions so you can focus on the task at hand, you can use Boomerang to pause your inbox. This won’t block emails from arriving, but it will stop emails from appearing in your inbox until you’re ready for them.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can find the Boomerang extension in the </span><a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/boomerang-for-gmail/mdanidgdpmkimeiiojknlnekblgmpdll?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chrome Web Store</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/seven.jpg?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-142797\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/seven.jpg?resize=550%2C208&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"208\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/seven.jpg?w=550&#38;ssl=1 550w, https://i2.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/seven.jpg?resize=250%2C95&#38;ssl=1 250w, https://i2.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/seven.jpg?resize=150%2C57&#38;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<h2>8. Use smarter searches</h2>\n<p>Everyone knows that you can use the Gmail search bar to look for emails to and from specific names (To: and From:) or under specific labels (label:) but did you know you can also exclude labels, senders, and recipients?</p>\n<p>It’s true!</p>\n<p>If you want to exclude a sender from a search in Gmail, simply add a hyphen “-” before the “From” tag. For example, “-from:authorearnings@gmail.com ” will exclude that from any search results. The same trick works for the “To” tag and the “label “tag.</p>\n<h2>9. Hide the email tags when not in use</h2>\n<p>Instead of folders, Gmail lets you create labels to organize your inbox. Experienced users know to set up a label for every topic, client, or ongoing project, but that can cause problems. If you use Google for more than a few years then you will end up with a long column of labels cluttering up the left menu panel.</p>\n<p>The clutter can render the label area almost unusable, but luckily there is a fix for this problem.</p>\n<p>Gmail will let you show or hide each label, and even better, you can choose to only show labels that have unread messages.</p>\n<p>You can manage the show/hide options by first clicking the Gear menu button in the upper right corner of the Gmail screen, and then selecting the Settings menu option. Select the Labels tab in the Settings menu. Scroll down and you’ll find a section labeled Labels. This is where you can select which labels are shown in the left menu panel.</p>\n<p>I have almost all the labels set to show if unread. I find that to be the best trade-off between minimizing clutter and maximizing usability.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/nine.jpg?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-142795\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/nine.jpg?resize=620%2C306&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"306\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/nine.jpg?resize=620%2C306&#38;ssl=1 620w, https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/nine.jpg?resize=250%2C123&#38;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/nine.jpg?resize=150%2C74&#38;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/nine.jpg?resize=768%2C379&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/nine.jpg?w=1366&#38;ssl=1 1366w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<h2>10. Stop senders from tracking you</h2>\n<p>It’s a fact of life that mailing lists and many other senders of emails will track whether recipients open the emails they get. (This is even an automated feature in Mailchimp and other email marketing services.)</p>\n<p>I don’t know about you, but I would rather not let senders know when I open an email – it might inspire one of them to pester me about not responding. That’s why I use a couple Chrome extensions to block senders from tracking my activity.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://uglyemail.com/\">Ugly Email</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pixelblock/jmpmfcjnflbcoidlgapblgpgbilinlem?ref=producthunt\">Pixel Block</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The two plugins basically do the same thing, and I use them both for the sake of redundancy.</p>\n<h2>11. Save space by deleting only the largest emails</h2>\n<p>Here’s a trick I picked up from a music producer that got a lot of emails with MP3 attachments.</p>\n<p>Google gives each user a generous 15GB of free storage, but that has to be shared among all of a user’s Google services. This means that if you use Gmail long enough and are in the habit of saving everything (even the emails with large attachments) then chances are you will find yourself having to free up space so you can upload more files to Google Drive.</p>\n<p>One way to address this problem by deleting old emails, but there is a better solution: Find and delete only the largest emails.</p>\n<p>I used to use a service called FindBigMail to identify large emails, but that service shut down in 2019. Luckily for us, Gmail built a similar feature we can use instead.</p>\n<p>There’s a search trick for Gmail which you can use to identify the emails that take up the most space. Some will have huge attachments, but others might just be really long email chains with new versions of the same file attached to each email.</p>\n<p>In either case, you can find the larger emails by entering “larger:5m” into the Gmail search bar. This search term will return only the emails larger than 5MB, and it also works for other sizes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/eleven.jpg?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-142803\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/eleven.jpg?resize=620%2C122&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"122\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/eleven.jpg?resize=620%2C122&#38;ssl=1 620w, https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/eleven.jpg?resize=250%2C49&#38;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/eleven.jpg?resize=150%2C30&#38;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/eleven.jpg?w=767&#38;ssl=1 767w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<h3>12. Mute conversations</h3>\n<p>Have you ever found yourself subscribed to a mailing list, and been inundated by emails on a topic that has no relevance to you or your work? (I have this problem with discussions in certain FB groups.)</p>\n<p>If you don’t want to unsubscribe from the list, and you don’t want to have to keep deleting the unwanted emails, you can easily stop the friendly spam with the Gmail mute function.</p>\n<p>Simply select the conversation, open the More menu, and select the mute option. This will automatically archive all new emails in the conversation. They won’t be deleted, and you can find them under the All Mail option in the left menu panel.</p>\n<p>The muted conversation will stay muted until you find it again and un-mute it; it will also un-mute itself if your address appears in the To or CC box in the message header.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/twelve.jpg?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-142801\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/twelve.jpg?resize=299%2C346&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"299\" height=\"346\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/twelve.jpg?w=299&#38;ssl=1 299w, https://i2.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/twelve.jpg?resize=216%2C250&#38;ssl=1 216w, https://i2.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/twelve.jpg?resize=130%2C150&#38;ssl=1 130w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 299px) 100vw, 299px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<h2>13. Change the style with themes</h2>\n<p>I was a little dismayed when I saw the new Gmail interface in 2018. I was shown a theme that had dark text on a light gray background. This made it hard for me to read the emails, but luckily for me there is a fix for this issue.</p>\n<p>Google offers a selection of color themes. You can’t bring back the old interface, but you can change the colors of the new interface so it is easier on your eyes.</p>\n<p>Look in the upper right corner of the Gmail screen for the Gear menu button. One of the options under that menu is the Themes menu. You can change the background to any one of dozens of images or colors. This feature is particularly useful if you maintain multiple Gmail accounts. You can give each one a different theme and save yourself from sending a personal email from the work account.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/thirteen.jpg?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-142799\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/thirteen.jpg?resize=620%2C349&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"349\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/thirteen.jpg?resize=620%2C349&#38;ssl=1 620w, https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/thirteen.jpg?resize=250%2C141&#38;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/thirteen.jpg?resize=150%2C84&#38;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/thirteen.jpg?resize=768%2C432&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/thirteen.jpg?w=1366&#38;ssl=1 1366w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<h2>14. Make the Font Size Larger</h2>\n<p>One trick I wish more people would adopt is using a larger default font size in their emails. A lot of us have older eyes, and a larger font size is easier to read. (Plus, the fact that I&#8217;m one of the few people using this trick means that I can quickly tell which text in an email chain was written by me.)</p>\n<p>If you click on the gear button in the upper right corner of Gmail, and then click the &#8220;all Settings&#8221; button, you&#8217;ll find that one of the options in that email is font size. (You can also choose the font face &#8211; serif or san serif.)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/font-size.png?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-142805\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/font-size.png?resize=620%2C219&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"219\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/font-size.png?resize=620%2C219&#38;ssl=1 620w, https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/font-size.png?resize=250%2C88&#38;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/font-size.png?resize=150%2C53&#38;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/font-size.png?resize=768%2C271&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/font-size.png?resize=1536%2C543&#38;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/font-size.png?resize=2048%2C724&#38;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/font-size.png?w=2280&#38;ssl=1 2280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<h2>15. Auto-Translate Emails</h2>\n<p>This is more of a Chrome trick than a Gmail trick, and it&#8217;s most of the reason I keep using Chrome.</p>\n<p>Google&#8217;s web browser has an auto-translate feature which you can use to translate the content on almost every web page. It works almost every, including in Gmail. I like to use it to to read all the non-English emails I get each week.</p>\n<h2>16. Track whether your emails are opened</h2>\n<p>I used to hate it when senders would track the emails they sent me, but then I started doing it, and I realized how useful this feature could be.</p>\n<p>While email tracking can be misused as a tool to stalk people, I use it to better help my clients. For example, if someone opens an old email, it might mean that they are about to send me an email with a question, so I try to make time to respond. Also, if someone never opens an email, I know that I need to send a follow up just in case the earlier email got lost.</p>\n<p>The service I use for this is <a href=\"https://mailtrack.io/en/\">MailTrack</a>. I like it because it adds a notice to the end of each email informing users that the email is being tracked. I think that makes the act of tracking emails less creepy, and more polite.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">* * *</p>\n<p>What about you, authors? Have you ever wanted to unsend an email?

My files were backed up online, Best Buy was opening in a few hours, and I had a credit card, so I figured I would be back online by the end of the day.</p>\n<p>And I was right; I was back to work in about 4 hours, and all it took was spending $1600 on a new Dell laptop. I kicked myself for having to pay retail when I could have planned ahead and saved several hundred dollars, but I got back to work quickly, and that was what really mattered.</p>\n<p>But then the laptop started to crash &#8211; a lot.</p>\n<p>I didn’t really notice the high frequency of the blue screens of death until I had owned the laptop for 17 days, when it crashed for the 4th time. This was 2 days past the Best Buy return window, which did not worry me much because it was a brand new laptop and had a next business day warranty. The worst that could happen was that Dell would have to fix it, or replace it.</p>\n<p>Or so I thought.</p>\n<p>When I got tired of the crashes, I visited Dell’s website and tried to file a support ticket. Much to my dismay, I found that my only options were calling Dell or using the support chat. I have hearing issues and do my best to avoid phone calls, and since the website chat feature didn’t work, I decided to try to solve it myself by running the diagnostic tests recommended by Dell’s site. When that didn’t find anything, I reached out to Dell on Twitter.</p>\n<p>My initial suggestion was that they give me a credit, I’d ship them the lemon, and I’d buy a new laptop on their site. This was shot down. Instead they told me to re-run the diagnostics, install software updates, and install more updates.</p>\n<p>This did not help. When the laptop crashed less than a week later, I told them they needed to either send someone to fix it, or replace it. They said I had to continue to do their work for them (call their advanced diagnostics dept), which I declined to do. We did after all have a diagnosis; there was a software issue.</p>\n<p>After a few rounds of this, I lost my cool and told Dell that my next moves would be to file a BBB complaint and look into filing a lawsuit (I did end up filling the BBB complaint, but the lawsuit was an empty threat).</p>\n<p>This was apparently enough to trigger a promise to forward my complaint to an “escalation” team. I was asked for my contact info, and Dell promised someone would contact me in 24 hours. Then, the next day, I was told the escalation team would contact me shortly.</p>\n<p>I have yet to make contact with that so-called team; the closest I have come was a garbled voicemail message. Nevertheless, Dell continued to tell me on Twitter that I should work with the escalation team now that I was in contact with them. I was later told that the escalation team had reported I said the problems were fixed. And I was told I should refer to the email the escalation team sent me, that they would take care of everything.</p>\n<p>Folks, none of that was true. I still have not made contact with that so-called team, much less communicated with them.</p>\n<p>I have given up on working this out, and I am now insisting on a refund. (Given Dell’s track record, I realize that probably isn’t going to happen.)</p>\n<p>In fact, I’ve already bought a replacement laptop from Lenovo. It arrived on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>TL;DR My experience with Dell tech support consisted of them trying to get me to do their jobs for them, stalling when I complained, and then lying to me and gaslighting me.</p>\n<p>P.S. Does anyone want to up a $1600 paperweight?</p>\n<p>P.P.S. Now that I think about it, it would be a waste to let such an expensive device collect dust. I should probably find a local computer tech who can take a look, and fix the issue. If Dell’s warranty were worth anything, they would have already done this, but since it’s not I am going to have to pay the cost myself.</p>\n<p>You just finished reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://the-digital-reader.com/2021/03/03/a-dell-warranty-is-worth-the-paper-it-isnt-printed-on/\">A Dell Warranty is Worth the Paper It Isn’t Printed On</a> which was published on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://the-digital-reader.com\">The Digital Reader</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?a=g_C6efCjWdE:cuQL7qXjcmk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?a=g_C6efCjWdE:cuQL7qXjcmk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?a=g_C6efCjWdE:cuQL7qXjcmk:JUhcmGiK9AQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=JUhcmGiK9AQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheDigitalReader/~4/g_C6efCjWdE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 03 Mar 2021 12:41:45 +0000","feedId":19,"bgimg":"https://i2.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/dell-hell.jpg?resize=620%2C426&ssl=1","linkMd5":"166dbf70a254c4deb74af5a889da18fc","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn6@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-49-08-926_750007b35af15c17.webp","destWidth":620,"destHeight":426,"sourceBytes":9744,"destBytes":9744,"author":"Nate Hoffelder","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i2.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/dell-hell.jpg?resize=620%2C426&ssl=1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn6@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-49-08-926_750007b35af15c17.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn71@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-49-52-896_bfba24e96f332be8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn7@2020_4/2021/04/03/04-49-52-234_2057f12fa508c741.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/TheDigitalReader?d=JUhcmGiK9AQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn52@2020_6/2021/04/03/04-49-52-294_1d48e1fa3d04ed80.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheDigitalReader/~4/g_C6efCjWdE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn91@2020_5/2021/04/03/04-49-52-899_4a928ecb7e4c832e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617425328486},{"createdTime":"2021-04-03 12:48:48","updatedTime":"2021-04-03 12:48:48","title":"Morning Coffee – 15 March 2021","link":"https://the-digital-reader.com/?p=142832","description":"<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/morning-coffee-wednesday-1.png?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-130006\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/morning-coffee-wednesday-1.png?resize=620%2C310&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"310\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/morning-coffee-wednesday-1.png?resize=620%2C310&#38;ssl=1 620w, https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/morning-coffee-wednesday-1.png?resize=150%2C75&#38;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/morning-coffee-wednesday-1.png?resize=250%2C125&#38;ssl=1 250w, https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/morning-coffee-wednesday-1.png?resize=768%2C384&#38;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/morning-coffee-wednesday-1.png?resize=20%2C10&#38;ssl=1 20w, https://i1.wp.com/the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/morning-coffee-wednesday-1.png?w=1024&#38;ssl=1 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are a few stories to read this morning.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jonathan Bailey has uncovered a new scam <a href=\"https://buff.ly/2OPaoha\">targeting website owners</a>. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amazon will no longer sell <a href=\"https://buff.ly/3qNB5A9\">transphobic books</a>. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The book &#8220;Naked in Cyberspace&#8221;

This is a question I get a lot, and I am always happy to answer it, but it&#8217;s been a while since I last wrote out my recommendations.</p>\n<p>I <a href=\"https://writesitehosting.com/\">of course host websites for my clients</a>, but that is more of a side business than one of my core activities. When asked about hosting, I usually mention four companies.</p>\n<p>These recommendations are for hosting a single WordPress site; if you want to host multiple sites, or want to talk about competing platforms like Squarespace, that would be a whole other discussion.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://Wordpress.com\">WordPress.com ($60)</a></h2>\n<p>There are some web designers who would call me crazy for saying this, but WordPress.com can be a good place to host your author or publisher website. It is rather limited in features at the cheaper pricing tiers (no plugins, and no third-party services) but if you just need a simple site then you can&#8217;t go wrong at $60 per year.</p>\n<p>You can build that site using free Gutenberg page templates and have a very nice looking site for almost no effort.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://PeoplesHost.com\">PeoplesHost ($110)</a></h2>\n<p>There are many budget website hosting companies. A lot of them, including big name companies such as GoDaddy and Bluehost, are simple terrible, but there are any number of companies with excellent service and reliable servicers.</p>\n<p>PeoplesHost is one of those reliable companies. I have my server there, and I have been very happy with their tech support and customer service. I have also sent a number of clients there, and several have remarked on how great the support is.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s even better about this price is that you can easily keep several websites on one account without running out of resources.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://Siteground.com\">Siteground ($180)</a></h2>\n<p>Siteground is a little more expensive than its budget-priced competitors, but it offers services that most of those competitors do not. SG has its own optimization, speed, and caching tools which make SG&#8217;s fees worth the price.</p>\n<p>Seriously, whenever I work on a WP site hosted on Siteground, my first step is to activate the SG Optimizer plugin and enable all of its recommended settings. This one step has a visible impact on site performance.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://WPEngine.com\">WPEngine ($300 plus)</a></h2>\n<p>WPEngine provides gold-standard service, but they also cost a mint. You can host one site there for only $25 per month, but if you need several sites (up to ten) you will soon be paying WPEngine more for hosting than I currently pay for my server.</p>\n<p>That fee is worth it, though; WPEngine sets a high standard for security, stability, and speed. basically, WPEngine  will handle things for your site that I have to take care of myself for my own sites.</p>\n<p
