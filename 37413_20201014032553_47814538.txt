Instead, use this strategy:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://productionadvice.co.uk/how-loud/\">How loud ? The simple solution to optimizing playback volume online – and everywhere else</a></p>\n<p>This method will get you great-sounding, future-proof results <strong>and</strong> ensure your music isn&#8217;t turned down too far, anywhere online.</p>\n<p><strong>Do</strong> check that it&#8217;s really working in practise though, by testing with the <a href=\"http://www.loudnesspenalty.com\">Loudness Penalty</a> website or <a href=\"http://www.meterplugs.com/loudness-penalty\">plugin</a>, and in particular watch out for any difference between the results for YouTube and TIDAL.</p>\n<p>Why do I say that ? If they&#8217;re similar (only a dB or so apart, say) then you&#8217;re in good shape. Provided you&#8217;re happy with the sound when you Preview them against similar reference tracks, your work is done. <strong>BUT </strong>if you see a larger difference between the Loudness Penalty values for YouTube and TIDAL, I recommend you pay close attention. Here&#8217;s why:</p>\n<h4>Current performance is no guarantee of future success</h4>\n<p>The <strong>overall</strong> difference in level between the loudest songs on YouTube and TIDAL right now is only 1 dB or less, but all songs aren&#8217;t matched in the same way, because of the platforms&#8217; different methods of measuring loudness.</p>\n<p>So if the values for an individual song on YouTube and TIDAL right now are similar, it&#8217;s probably no big deal. Both normalization methods will give a result you&#8217;re likely to be happy with, even after YouTube make the move to using LUFS. People won&#8217;t hear much of a change.</p>\n<p>But if you&#8217;re seeing a <em>larger</em> difference, the end result will be more unpredictable. The loudness of your song compared to everything else might go up, or it might go down &#8211; and that will affect how people feel about it in comparison to everything else.</p>\n<p>For example, there&#8217;s one song I noticed yesterday where currently YouTube only turns it down by 1 dB, but TIDAL turns it down by 4 dB. When YouTube finally switches over to LUFS for good, that song is going to seem 3 dB quieter than in comparison to other songs than it does right now, there.</p>\n<p><em>(And yes, I&#8217;m talking about a major artist, not some obscure edge-case !)</em></p>\n<p>Whereas if your song is currently being turned down by 4 dB on YouTube and only 1 dB on TIDAL, it will actually end up sounding 3 dB <em>louder</em> in comparison to other material than it does right now after YouTube make the switch.</p>\n<h4>Does it matter ?</h4>\n<p>Good question &#8211; it depends on your point of view.</p>\n<p>If you aren&#8217;t at all concerned about how your music sounds compared to other material on the streaming platforms, maybe not.</p>\n<p>But if you want your music to stand up well against everything else in terms of loudness online, and not change dramatically in future then it probably <strong>does</strong> matter, yes ! Especially since my prediction is that all the platforms will start using LUFS eventually.</p>\n<h4>So what about Spotify ?</h4>\n<p>Spotify also gives an overall result of approximately -14 LUFS – they even say this <a href=\"https://artists.spotify.com/faq/mastering-and-loudness#how-does-spotify-calculate-loudness\">on their website</a> – but they <em>don&#8217;t</em> use LUFS either, at the moment &#8211; currently they use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReplayGain\">ReplayGain</a> to measure loudness. This can give results that are different to LUFS for individual songs, so all the comments above apply to Spotify, as well.</p>\n<p>For maximum consistency and future-proof-ness, you want to see similar <a href=\"http://www.loudnesspenalty.com\">Loudness Penalty</a> values for your loudest songs on YouTube, Spotify <em>and</em> TIDAL. If you don&#8217;t, they may not come across with the same impact on all the platforms, and the results will change when YouTube and Spotify inevitably make the switch to LUFS at some future point.</p>\n<p><em>(Why do I say it&#8217;s inevitable ? Because LUFS is an internationally recommended standard, and the <strong>Audio Engineering Society (AES)</strong> <a href=\"http://www.aes.org/technical/documents/AESTD1004_1_15_10.pdf\">recommends</a> using it. Also ReplayGain version 2 uses LUFS !) </em></p>\n<h4>Summary</h4>\n<p>Normalization is here to stay, and the future of normalization is LUFS.</p>\n<p>If online loudness matters to you and you see different results on streaming platforms that don&#8217;t currently use LUFS (only TIDAL and <a href=\"http://productionadvice.co.uk/amazon-music-loudness-normalization/\">Amazon Music</a> do, right now) then you may want to pay attention to the differences and tweak your results. This can ensure more consistent results across all platforms today, and avoid future changes to the way your music is perceived as the use of LUFS becomes more widespread.</p>\n<p>The good news is that it&#8217;s perfectly possible to achieve this ! Use the strategy I linked to above and check the results with <a href=\"http://www.loudnesspenalty.com\">Loudness Penalty</a>. I  do this myself, and see similar values on all the &#8220;big three&#8221; platforms with nothing getting turned down too much.</p>\n<p>Which is great, because it means you can stop worrying about loudness altogether and focus on what <em>really</em> matters &#8211; <strong>making the music sound great.</strong></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://productionadvice.co.uk/whats-going-on-with-normalization/\">What&#8217;s going on with loudness normalization ?!?</a> is a post from Ian Shepherd's: Production Advice Subscribe to the newsletter for great content from the archives, special offers and a free interview - for more information, click here</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 20 Sep 2019 11:04:34 +0000","feedId":37413,"bgimg":"http://productionadvice.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/YouTube-Loudness-Change.jpg","linkMd5":"795ce9b9c18a6bb3384ff4b00c8b3321","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn47@2020_5/2020/10/14/03-25-52-365_77ad0d83acc3fe4e.webp","destWidth":911,"destHeight":620,"sourceBytes":69477,"destBytes":21202,"author":"Ian Shepherd","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://productionadvice.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/YouTube-Loudness-Change.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn47@2020_5/2020/10/14/03-25-52-365_77ad0d83acc3fe4e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602645951617}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-10-14 11:25:51","updatedTime":"2020-10-14 11:25:51","feedId":37413,"fetchDate":"Wed, 14 Oct 2020 03:25:51 +0000","fetchMs":12698,"handleMs":15677,"totalMs":30189,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"e157b37912535cfa8094d5657cd163af","hostName":"europe-57*","requestId":"9870081eb0fd42289ad7a4404ebb40ff_37413","contentType":"application/rss+xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":21202,"bgimgsTotal":1,"bgimgsGithubTotal":1,"articlesImgsTotal":1,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":1,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx8":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 03:10:50","updatedTime":"2020-10-13 05:25:12","id":37413,"name":"Production Advice","url":"http://productionadvice.co.uk/feed/","subscriber":86,"website":null,"icon":"https://productionadvice.co.uk/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":null,"description":"make your music sound great","weekly":null,"link":"https://productionadvice.co.uk"},"noPictureArticleList":[],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":21202,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1602645923175,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":12765,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":15677,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":0,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"}]},"extra5":1,"extra6":1,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[{"code":1,"isDone":false,"source":"http://productionadvice.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/YouTube-Loudness-Change.jpg","sourceStatusCode":200,"destWidth":911,"destHeight":620,"fixedGithubDest":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn47@2020_5/2020/10/14/03-25-52-365_77ad0d83acc3fe4e.webp","sourceBytes":69477,"destBytes":21202,"targetWebpQuality":75,"feedId":37413,"totalSpendMs":1564,"convertSpendMs":30,"createdTime":"2020-10-14 11:25:51","host":"us-020*","referer":"http://productionadvice.co.uk/?p=9755","linkMd5ListStr":"795ce9b9c18a6bb3384ff4b00c8b3321,795ce9b9c18a6bb3384ff4b00c8b3321","githubUser":"myreaderx8","githubHttpCode":201,"extra22GetBytesInfo":"1、没有Referer字段","extra23historyStatusCode":[200],"sourceSize":"67.8 KB","destSize":"20.7 KB","compressRate":"30.5%"}],"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx8":1},"failGithubMap":{}}
