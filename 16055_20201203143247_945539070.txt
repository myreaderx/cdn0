Some say that equating our attention span to that of a goldfish is a <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/health-38896790\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">myth.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing&#8217;s for sure, though &#8211; the way we&#8217;re processing information online is changing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-gb/marketing-strategies/video/how-capture-attention-six-seconds/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">YouTube UK industry manager Paddy Collins writes </a>that our attention span is like a muscle. With the deluge of data and information, our attention span muscles have developed this reflex of diverting itself elsewhere if it knows what will happen next and doesn&#8217;t like it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, your audience has learned to shut off their attention muscle if your information is irrelevant to them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://c1.sfdcstatic.com/content/dam/web/en_us/www/documents/e-books/state-of-the-connected-customer-report-second-edition2018.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">2018 survey from Salesforce Research</a> also supports this idea.

Whether it&#8217;s for <a href=\"https://www.jeffbullas.com/need-animated-explainer-video-business/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">explainer videos</a> or a Twitter gif, motion graphics make your visual feel more life-like, which engages and delights your audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ryan McLeod writes in <a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/designco-web-assets/uploads/2019/05/animationhandbook.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><em>Invision&#8217;s </em>Animation Handbook </a>that animation is like umami in creating tasty, nourishing food. While a dash of umami can transform bland food into a delicious meal, motion graphics transform content into a more satisfying experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are 5 reasons you should start using motion graphics as umami for your existing (or new!) content marketing efforts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Motion graphics make your content memorable</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As a marketer, you want people to engage with you and share your content. It could be a challenge if you have a lackluster brand recall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you see a video that resonates with you, you share it with your friends. It&#8217;s human nature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding motion to your visual content aids in information retention and brand recall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With motion graphics, you can grab your audience&#8217;s attention and make it easier for them to recall more details about a topic, a product, an event, or even a brand. As a result, the motion graphics in your content can help prospects consider your product or services.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Motion graphics highlight the most important parts of your content</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding motion graphics to your content marketing arsenal can help highlight your unique value proposition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Catching your reader&#8217;s eyes with animated graphics can also help potential customers decide whether or not your business or service is precisely what they&#8217;re looking for.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Motion graphics make your content entertaining and easy to understand.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s one thing to catch someone&#8217;s attention, but it&#8217;s another for the person to look at your content and stay interested.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With motion graphics, animators can tell a story in the quickest, most straightforward way possible. The digestible chunks format of motion graphics can pique reader interest, which can lead to more engagement.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. Motion graphics are versatile pieces of content</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another benefit of using motion graphics is that they&#8217;re versatile. Use them in an explainer video to highlight your product&#8217;s benefits or use them on social media and encourage people to share your content. From serious, academic topics to fun, lighthearted beats, motion graphics always bring out the best in your content.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>5. They can be used more than once</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Motion graphics are easy to repurpose. You can cut an explainer video into 10-second gifs or transform an animated infographic into a static infographic.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to use motion graphics in content marketing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you&#8217;re aware of the motion graphics benefits to your marketing campaigns, here are 5 ways you can use them. Give them a try and watch your engagement soar in the next few months!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Logo animations</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding motion in logos is a great way to spruce up your branding materials, event booths, and email signatures. An animated logo will not only pique your audience&#8217;s interest, but it’s also a great <a href=\"https://www.jeffbullas.com/brand-awareness-tools/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">brand awareness tool</a>. Spotify Live’s animated logo below is a great example!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-created-with-cloudapp\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<a href=\"https://share.getcloudapp.com/5zuw6r6P\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow external noopener\"><img src=\"https://p127.p0.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/5zuw6r6P/Spotify%20Live%20logo.gif\" alt=\"Spotify Live logo.gif\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" /></a>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Source: Michael Brekka</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Social media GIFs</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>GIFs, or animated images, have become a huge part of social media and popular culture and it would make perfect sense to add them to your content marketing arsenal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only do they capture attention, but they also come in a form that most people recognize and enjoy. Plus, animated gifs help your brand seem more approachable, relatable, and memorable!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-created-with-cloudapp\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<a href=\"https://share.getcloudapp.com/NQu1Pjqj\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow external noopener\"><img src=\"https://p127.p0.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/NQu1Pjqj/easelly_world_health_day_2%20%281%29.gif\" alt=\"easelly_world_health_day_2 (1).gif\" width=\"800\" height=\"850\" /></a>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Explainer videos</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you want to share the origin story of your business? Or would you like to highlight how your products are manufactured?&#160; You should consider explainer videos!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you want to upload it on your YouTube channel or have your sales team use it every time they&#8217;re interacting with a potential customer, explainer videos translate complex ideas in a fun, more engaging way.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Show Don&#039;t Tell in Marketing: A Quick Guide\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/K7Lh-ZPk_BU?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1&#038;origin=https://www.jeffbullas.com\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. Facebook ads</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of paying thousands for a full-length video that you can feature on social media such as Facebook, <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1006874066021923?id=603833089963720\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">motion graphics for your Facebook ads</a> are a good alternative. The good news is that video content can bypass the text amount restriction on Facebook ads because only the thumbnail image counts.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://p127.p0.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/7Ku85kwB/carbon%20dioxide%20emissions%20fb%20ads.gif?source=viewer&#38;v=adba0587cdd8d0ee761a6c52e767bc60\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>5. Animated infographics</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>An <a href=\"https://www.easel.ly/blog/what-is-an-infographic/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">infographic</a> is already a great way to present various types of information, but adding motion and movement creates a whole new content experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An animated infographic&#8217;s moving elements will draw the reader&#8217;s eyes to details that need the most attention. Plus, <a href=\"https://www.easel.ly/blog/do-i-need-an-animated-infographic/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">animated infographics</a> are inexpensive to produce in contrast to videos.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-photo is-provider-created-with-cloudapp\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<a href=\"https://share.getcloudapp.com/xQuAXxBA\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow external noopener\"><img src=\"https://p127.p0.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/xQuAXxBA/easelly_casestudy_ChildhoodCancerFacts.gif\" alt=\"easelly_casestudy_ChildhoodCancerFacts.gif\" width=\"500\" height=\"739\" /></a>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>The takeaway</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>From banners to Twitter GIFs to explainer videos to animated infographics, motion graphics in your content are the perfect tool to share an exciting brand story, communicate product value in less than a minute, and engage your audience. Most of all, thoughtful movement and motion in your graphics makes your content more human, authentic, and relatable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Guest author: </strong>Kai Tomboc is the resident wordsmith for <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow external\" href=\"https://www.easel.ly/\" target=\"_blank\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Easelly</a>, makers of a simple infographic maker tool, and an information design service studio.
