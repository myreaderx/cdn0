In this article, we're taking a closer look at C-Log3 and how it differs from the existing C-Log profile. In doing so, we hope to make clear why cameras sometimes offer multiple Log profiles, to help you decide which one to use.</p> \n<h3>Why Log?</h3> \n<p>To understand why cameras have different Log profiles, it's worth going back to basics to explain why videographers shoot Log at all.</p> \n<p>In stills photography we generally choose between JPEG files (a small and efficient compressed format but one that has limited editing flexibility), and Raw files (larger but retaining the greatest flexibility). Log is an attempt at a middle ground between these two: it's subject to a lot of the processing and compression that a JPEG file is, but has been expressly designed to retain enough information about the original capture to remain flexible. Crucially, it tends to be relatively small, which is valuable in video: when you're measuring file sizes in data per second, then the clock is ticking from the moment you hit the [REC] button.</p> \n<p>The simplest way to think of Log files is like JPEGs but with tone curves designed to share their data values out more equally between the number of stops you captured. Colors are also desaturated, to reduce the risk of saturated parts of the scene clipping and hence losing flexibility when color grading.</p> \n<h3>Why are there different versions of Log?</h3> \n<p>In the previous section I wrote that Log curves are designed to retain similar amounts of information about every stop of light you captured. This isn't quite correct. More precisely, Log curves are designed to encode a pre-determined number of stops of light. And there are a number of reasons why more is not always better.</p> \n<p>Firstly, there's simply no point using a Log curve that encodes 15 stops of light if you sensor can only capture 12 before the signal becomes indistinguishable from noise. For a start, it would mean that the bottom three stops of your file would be a noisy mess, but it would also encourage you to use an inappropriate exposure.</p> \n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"images noCrop singleNoBorder center\" data-image-height=\"\" data-image-width=\"590\"> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td class=\"image\" style=\"width: 590px;\"><a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/3873565570/C_Log_graph.png\" target=\"article-3873565570\"><img border=\"0\" data-thumbnail-height=\"0\" data-thumbnail-width=\"1180\" height=\"404\" src=\"https://3.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS1180x0~articles/3873565570/C_Log_graph.png\" width=\"590\" data-filename=\"C_Log_graph.png\" /></a></td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td class=\"caption\" style=\"width: 590px;\">C-Log is designed to accommodate around 11 stops of DR. In order to capture around 2EV more highlights than a standard JPEG, it's supposed to be exposed as ISO 400 (rather than the ISO 100 that's the base setting for the Standard color mode). Canon Log 3's base ISO setting is rated as 800, to capture an additional stop.</td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p>If we assume the Log curve is designed to incorporate another two stops of highlights over what a standard sRGB JPEG would include, you'd need to reduce exposure by two stops to capture this additional highlight information. A two-stop reduction in exposure means a two-stop increase in noise in all those tones that overlap with the standard color mode.</p> \n<p>The final consideration is data availability. Your camera can only record a certain number of brightness values. If you try to share those values roughly equally between 11 stops of light, you retain more information about each one than if you try to squeeze 15 stops into the file. This is less of a problem on higher-end cameras that shoot 10-bit footage (and so have 1024 values to share), but is worth considering if your camera only captures 8-bit Log, and hence has only 256 values available.</p> \n<p>This should start to explain why there are multiple Log options: you want to find a Log curve that's well suited both to the capabilities of your camera and to the scene you're shooting.</p> \n<h3>C-Log vs C-Log3</h3> \n<p>We took a closer look at the Canon Log and Canon Log 3 curves and what difference they make. The first thing you may notice upon engaging C-Log3 is that the base ISO rating jumps to 800: one stop higher than the existing C-Log mode. We've checked, and there's no change in amplification: that one stop change in ISO rating is solely an instruction to give the camera one stop less exposure, to capture more highlights.</p> \n<div class=\"contentTable\"> \n <table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"contentTable\"> \n  <tbody> \n   <tr> \n    <th width=\"33.333333333333336%\">Mode</th> \n    <th width=\"33.333333333333336%\">Base ISO rating</th> \n    <th width=\"33.333333333333336%\">Difference from sRGB<span class=\"green\">*</span></th> \n   </tr> \n   <tr> \n    <th width=\"33.333333333333336%\">Standard (sRGB)</th> \n    <td width=\"33.333333333333336%\">100</td> \n    <td width=\"33.333333333333336%\">0</td> \n   </tr> \n   <tr> \n    <th width=\"33.333333333333336%\">Canon Log</th> \n    <td width=\"33.333333333333336%\">400</td> \n    <td width=\"33.333333333333336%\">+2EV</td> \n   </tr> \n   <tr> \n    <th width=\"33.333333333333336%\">Canon Log 3</th> \n    <td width=\"33.333333333333336%\">800</td> \n    <td width=\"33.333333333333336%\">+3EV</td> \n   </tr> \n  </tbody> \n </table> \n</div> \n<p>Here are the waveforms of C-Log and C-Log3, exposed with this change in ISO rating taken into account.

Look closely at the noise floor, represented by the thick white band at the bottom of the waveform. At first glance, this appears taller (noisier) for C-Log3. But this shouldn't be the case, since we gave identical exposure to both modes.</p> \n<p>Look closer and you'll see that the noise in C-Log3 mode extends the same distance above and below the 128 marker line, which is what you'd expect: noise is variation above and below the 'true' value. But in C-Log mode, it extends upwards by the same amount as C-Log3, but cuts off cleanly just below a value of 128. Canon is using a very high black clipping level to make the darkest tones appear less noisy.</p> \n<p>The impact of this can sometimes reveal itself when you try to grade the footage: C-Log will sometimes plug-up blacks, which look unnatural if they're brightened during color grading. C-Log3 doesn't clip its blacks so aggressively, so there's less risk of the darker tones looking strange when lifted.</p> \n<div class=\"beer-slider-container\">\n <div id=\"slider2\" class=\"beer-slider\" data-beer-label=\"C-Log3 (Cine)\">\n  <img src=\"https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS1180x0~articles/3873565570/Jordan_CL3_LUT.jpeg\">\n   <div class=\"beer-reveal\" data-beer-label=\"C-Log (EOS)\">\n    <img src=\"https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS1180x0~articles/3873565570/Jordan_CL1_LUT.jpeg\" />\n   </div></img>\n </div>\n</div> \n<div class=\"caption\">\n It's also worth noting that C-Log3 gives you a choice of Cine or Rec 709 color response (rather than the EOS or Neutral options for Canon Log), making it compatible with the LUTs Canon has created for its Cinema EOS cameras, and giving a more interesting starting point.\n</div> \n<p>So C-Log3's greater processing flexibility comes from more than just the additional stop its tone curve is designed to provide. However, given how noisy the shadows get, it should be pretty clear that it's already pushing at the limits of what the EOS R5 is able to capture.</p> \n<p>This makes sense: the R5 creates its video from a 12-bit sensor readout. And, although the process of downscaling from 8K to 4K will boost the number a bit, it's never going to significantly exceed 12 stops of DR capture. As such, the C-Log3 curve seems a pretty good match for the camera, and it's unlikely that Canon will add the even wider DR C-Log2 profile.</p> \n<h3>When should I use it?</h3> \n<p>Canon Log 3 offers a little more dynamic range than Canon Log, but it's also less prone to clogged-up shadows and is more readily compatible with the LUTs designed for Canon's Cinema EOS cameras. Both of these factors make it more useable than the existing C-Log profile.</p> \n<p>If you're worried about the additional noise and don't need the additional stop of dynamic range, there's no reason you can't overexpose C-Log3 by a stop and pretend you're still shooting with a slightly more sophisticated version of C-Log. The wider DR captured does seem to slightly increase the risk of posterization, though.</p> \n<div class=\"beer-slider-container\">\n <div id=\"slider1\" class=\"beer-slider\" data-beer-label=\"C-Log3 (matched exposure)\">\n  <img src=\"https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS1180x0~articles/3873565570/Scene_CL3_LUT.jpeg\">\n   <div class=\"beer-reveal\" data-beer-label=\"C-Log\">\n    <img src=\"https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS1180x0~articles/3873565570/Scene_CL1_LUT.jpeg\" />\n   </div></img>\n </div>\n</div> \n<div class=\"caption\">\n This scene was given the same exposure (ignoring the different ISO ratings) and with curves adjustment applied to the C-Log3 footage before the LUT was applied to give a matched starting point.

This decision ‘proved to be prophetic in 2020, as the effects of Covid-19 began to creep into the world economy in March 2020.’ Specifically, Backblaze says its decision to diversify helped to ‘manage [its] supply chain through the manufacturing and shipping delays prevalent in the first several months of the pandemic.’</p> \n<p>As a whole, Backblaze’s annualized failure rates for 2020 was 0.93%, which is less than half the 1.89% annualized failure rate it incurred in 2019.

The textured plastic leatherette provides a pleasing amount of 'grippyness'. And despite feeling a bit plasticky, nothing about the Mini 40 feels cheap.</p> \n<p>Size and weight-wise, the Mini 40 is a match for most other Instax Mini models, which is to say it's fairly lightweight and compact. However, it is a bit chunkier than the <a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/buying-guide-best-instant-camera/2\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Instax Mini 70</a>, our pick for the <a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/buying-guide-best-instant-camera\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">best Instax camera in 2021</a>.</p> \n<h2>Instax Mini 40 - design &amp; handling cont.</h2> \n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"images noCaptions single center\" data-image-height=\"null\" data-image-width=\"520\"> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td class=\"image\" style=\"width: 520px;\"><a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/4877731670/Instax-Mini-40-2.jpeg\" target=\"article-4877731670\"><img border=\"0\" data-aspect-ratio=\"4x3\" data-thumbnail-height=\"0\" data-thumbnail-width=\"520\" height=\"390\" src=\"https://4.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TC4x3S520x0~articles/4877731670/Instax-Mini-40-2.jpeg\" width=\"520\" data-filename=\"Instax-Mini-40-2.jpeg\" /></a></td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p>The camera is operated in the vertical orientation.

To turn the camera off, simply push the lens back in.</p> \n<p>The Mini 40 is fully automatic with a flash that always fires, and exposure is adjusted by the camera via a variable-speed shutter (1/2 - 1/250 sec). The maximum flash range is 2.7 m / 8.85 ft and the recycle time is about 6.5 secs. There's no need to set or adjust the focus with the Mini 40, it has a fixed focus range of 0.3 m to infinity.</p> \n<h2>Instax Mini 40 - selfie mode and mirror</h2> \n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"images noCaptions single center\" data-image-height=\"null\" data-image-width=\"520\"> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td class=\"image\" style=\"width: 520px;\"><a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/4877731670/Instax-Mini-40-9.jpeg\" target=\"article-4877731670\"><img border=\"0\" data-aspect-ratio=\"4x3\" data-thumbnail-height=\"0\" data-thumbnail-width=\"520\" height=\"390\" src=\"https://3.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TC4x3S520x0~articles/4877731670/Instax-Mini-40-9.jpeg\" width=\"520\" data-filename=\"Instax-Mini-40-9.jpeg\" /></a></td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p>Like some of its siblings, the Mini 40 offers a selfie/close-up mode that can be activated by pulling the front of the lens outward (which takes some force).

Keep in mind though, the more depleted your batteries are, the longer the flash will take to recycle between shots.</p> \n<p>Instax Mini film is sold in single and double packs, as well as larger bulk packs including those with 60 and 100 exposures.

The 3D-printed lens allows compatible cameras to shoot stereoscopic wiggle photography. Essentially, by combining multiple frames shot with the lens, you can create a motion picture that appears to be 3D.</p> \n<p>Moua's stereoscopic wiggle lens incorporates a trio of 30mm lens to project three images with slightly different perspectives across the image sensor. The wiggle lens creates a parallax shift in between each frame, such that when you combine them into an animated sequence, there's a visual sense of depth in the animated frame.</p> \n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"images noCrop singleNoBorder center\" data-image-height=\"null\" data-image-width=\"590\"> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td class=\"image\" style=\"width: 590px;\"><a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/1238704821/wiggle-lens-full-frame-sony.jpeg\" target=\"article-f17e19d227384b2086a45f75c673a8bd\"><img border=\"0\" data-thumbnail-height=\"0\" data-thumbnail-width=\"590\" height=\"387\" src=\"https://4.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS590x0~articles/1238704821/wiggle-lens-full-frame-sony.jpeg\" width=\"590\" data-filename=\"wiggle-lens-full-frame-sony.jpeg\" /></a></td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td class=\"caption\" style=\"width: 590px;\">George Moua's full-frame stereoscopic wiggle lens includes three lenses, which project a roughly 1:2 ratio image across the 3:2 aspect ratio image sensor.</td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p>The full-frame version, seen in Moua's video below, extends as far as possible into the lens mount without interfering with the shutter or IBIS mechanisms. However, the baffles can't touch the image sensor, so there is some slight light leakage in between each frame. This is easily corrected in post, as we'll see in a second video. The lens also uses a breech-lock mounting system rather than a standard bayonet lens mount, which means that the lens is attached to the camera using a rotating ring that tightens the lens to the body. Moua has also crafted a bayonet mount version, although it offers poorer performance.</p> \n<div class=\"video\">\n <iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"326\" id=\"videoFrame\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/flX9ZyU1X9A?rel=0&amp;autohide=1&amp;wmode=transparent&amp;enablejsapi=1\" width=\"580\"></iframe>\n</div> \n<p>Creating a wigglegram is not as simple as just capturing the image. Moua has created a video showing his workflow to create wigglegrams using Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop. Moua shoots with a Sony A7, so it's a 3:2 aspect ratio. Using a 1:2 crop ratio, Moua crops three frames from a single image. He exports each crop as a .DNG file and then imports them back into Lightroom. Once the individual frames are in Lightroom, he edits them such that they have the same appearance, as there is sometimes variation in brightness, contrast and color across the three frames. When the images are matched, he opens them as layers in Photoshop. To see how Moua creates a wigglegram in Photoshop, check out the tutorial below.</p> \n<div class=\"video\">\n <iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"326\" id=\"videoFrame\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WltDW2eOjP4?rel=0&amp;autohide=1&amp;wmode=transparent&amp;enablejsapi=1\" width=\"580\"></iframe>\n</div> \n<p>Unfortunately, preorders for the full-frame Sony E-mount, APS-C E-mount and APS-C Fujifilm X mount stereoscopic wiggle lenses have sold out. However, Moua intends to make STL files available for sale once he has fulfilled his preorders. The lenses sold for $80 for the full-frame version and $70 for the APS-C versions. Moua will be using his profits to purchase a Canon EOS RP to finish work on a Canon full-frame version of his stereoscopic wiggle lens. He is going to work on a Nikon version down the road as well.

One of my goals was to take a photo of them underwater, but it was a lot harder than I first thought. Although they didn't care about me, when they were on land they were much more cautious when they were underwater.</p> \n<p>I didn't want to bother them so my tactic was patience. I waited in the water for hours, next to the rock where they were roosting and from which I assumed they would jump and submerge. But in contrast to my expectations, I found they swam away to find a group of fish and only then would they dive. I was starting to lose patience and almost gave up.</p> \n<p>However, eventually my persistence paid off: encouraged to dive by a nearby swimmer, one of the Shags jumped into the water in front of me and dived after a few meters. I followed the bird under the water and took a few pictures of it almost blindly. I was very happy with the result. My favorite thing about this image is that you can see the sparkly spot lit by the setting sun where the bird submerged.</p> \n<p><strong>Specs:</strong> Nikon D500 with Tokina 10-17mm f/3.5-4.5 lens. 16mm focal length; 1/400th second; f/5.6; ISO 400.</p> \n<h2>Finalist: 'White-tailed sea-eagle' by <a href=\"https://fahadphoto.com/about/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Fahad Alenezi</a></h2> \n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"images noCaptions noCrop single center\" data-image-height=\"null\" data-image-width=\"520\"> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td class=\"image\" style=\"width: 520px;\"><a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/2282996842/BPOTY-2021-Finalists-14.jpeg\" target=\"article-b5d5696a56994f71932f7f91085d45e2\"><img border=\"0\" data-thumbnail-height=\"0\" data-thumbnail-width=\"520\" height=\"292\" src=\"https://3.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS520x0~articles/2282996842/BPOTY-2021-Finalists-14.jpeg\" width=\"520\" data-filename=\"BPOTY-2021-Finalists-14.jpeg\" /></a></td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p><strong>Artist Statement:</strong> In winter, food for most animals is in short supply in northern latitudes and many species, including this Red Fox, take greater risks than they would normally do to survive.

These flightless birds breed in the winter and after a courtship lasting several weeks, the female lays a single egg then leaves! Each penguin egg's father balances it on his feet and covers it with his brood pouch, a very warm layer of feathered skin designed to keep the egg cozy.</p> \n<p>There the males stand, for about 65 days, through icy temperatures, cruel winds, and blinding storms. Finally, after about two months, the females return from the sea, bringing food which they regurgitate to feed the now-hatched chicks. The males eagerly leave for their own fishing session at sea, and the mothers take charge of parental care for a while.</p> \n<p>As the young penguins grow, adults leave them in groups called crèches while they go off to fish. Five years later, if they survive their time at sea, those young penguins will return to become parents themselves. There is a reason for the timing of Emperor Penguins' hatching. By December, when the Antarctic weather has warmed somewhat, the ice the penguins occupy begins to break up, bringing open waters closer to the nesting sites.</p> \n<p>To take this image, I was lying flat on the ground. I did this because objects lower than penguin height are less intimidating to the birds. Consequently, they spent plenty of time beside me, meaning I could capture some beautiful shots. On this particular trip, I walked an average of eight hours each day in search of a perfect image.</p> \n<p><strong>Specs:</strong> Nikon D5 with Nikon 400mm f/2.8 lens. 400mm focal length; 1/5,000th second; f/3.5; ISO 280.</p> \n<h2>Finalist: Black-and-white Warbler' by <a href=\"http://rayhennessy.com\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Raymond Hennessy</a></h2> \n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"images noCaptions noCrop single center\" data-image-height=\"null\" data-image-width=\"520\"> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td class=\"image\" style=\"width: 520px;\"><a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/2282996842/BPOTY-2021-Finalists-16.jpeg\" target=\"article-b5d5696a56994f71932f7f91085d45e2\"><img border=\"0\" data-thumbnail-height=\"0\" data-thumbnail-width=\"520\" height=\"346\" src=\"https://1.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS520x0~articles/2282996842/BPOTY-2021-Finalists-16.jpeg\" width=\"520\" data-filename=\"BPOTY-2021-Finalists-16.jpeg\" /></a></td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p><strong>Artist Statement:</strong> Backlit by dawn light, the breath of this Black-and-White Warbler shows the subtle colors of the rainbow as it drifts off in the cold morning air.

On my eighth attempt, I finally did photographic justice to the calling birds, with their breath vaporised by the cold air.</p> \n<p><strong>Specs:</strong> Canon 1DX Mark ll with Canon 100-400mm f/4.5-5.6 II lens and 1.4x teleconverter. 560mm focal length; 1/1,600th; f/8; ISO 1,000.</p> \n<h2>Finalist: 'Great Grey Owl' by Scott Suriano</h2> \n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"images noCaptions noCrop single center\" data-image-height=\"null\" data-image-width=\"520\"> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td class=\"image\" style=\"width: 520px;\"><a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/2282996842/BPOTY-2021-Finalists-12.jpeg\" target=\"article-b5d5696a56994f71932f7f91085d45e2\"><img border=\"0\" data-thumbnail-height=\"0\" data-thumbnail-width=\"520\" height=\"374\" src=\"https://1.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS520x0~articles/2282996842/BPOTY-2021-Finalists-12.jpeg\" width=\"520\" data-filename=\"BPOTY-2021-Finalists-12.jpeg\" /></a></td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p><strong>Artist Statement:</strong> While exploring the Northwoods of Minnesota, I found myself caught in a sudden heavy snow squall. Thinking that this weather episode might deter the Great Grey Owls from hunting, I considered packing it up and calling it a day. To my surprise, however, this particular owl took to the skies and began scanning the meadow for its next meal.</p> \n<p>With a sudden and acrobatic downward turn, it sliced through the heavy white flakes and crashed head first into the snow-blanketed field below. Within moments, I watched as it launched off into the distance with its freshly caught vole. It was a great reminder that to be successful you have to sometimes fully commit and dive in head first into the unknown.</p> \n<p><strong>Specs:</strong> Canon 1DX Mark II with Canon 400mm f/2.8 lens and 1.4x teleconverter. 560mm focal length; 1/1,250th second; f/4; ISO 1,250.</p> \n<h2>Finalist: 'European Shag' by <a href=\"https://www.brianmatthewsphoto.com\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Brian Matthews</a></h2> \n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"images noCaptions noCrop single center\" data-image-height=\"null\" data-image-width=\"520\"> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td class=\"image\" style=\"width: 520px;\"><a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/2282996842/BPOTY-2021-Finalists-2.jpeg\" target=\"article-b5d5696a56994f71932f7f91085d45e2\"><img border=\"0\" data-thumbnail-height=\"0\" data-thumbnail-width=\"520\" height=\"329\" src=\"https://4.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS520x0~articles/2282996842/BPOTY-2021-Finalists-2.jpeg\" width=\"520\" data-filename=\"BPOTY-2021-Finalists-2.jpeg\" /></a></td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p><strong>Artist Statement:</strong> Is there any food left?

This means the image quality and, in some cases, performance of the X-E4 will be a match for the best that Fujifilm has to offer in its X-mount lineup. The camera's body and controls have also been slimmed down relative to its predecessor, but we'll delve into those details in the next section.</p> \n   <p>That 26MP sensor brings with it really solid image quality, a native base ISO of 160 (down from 200 on the X-E3), and super-fast readout speeds that let the X-E4 fire away images at 20 fps with the electronic shutter (or 30 fps if you opt for a 1.25x crop). You also get super-fast electronic shutter readout that tops out at 1/32,000 sec, which is handy for shooting wide-open in bright daylight if that's your thing.</p> \n   <div class=\"beer-slider-container\"> \n    <div id=\"slider2\" class=\"beer-slider\" data-beer-label=\"Classic Neg\"> \n     <img src=\"https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS1180x0~articles/0601644611/DSCF0134.jpeg\"> \n      <div class=\"beer-reveal\" data-beer-label=\"Provia (standard)\"> \n       <img src=\"https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS1180x0~articles/0601644611/DSCF0109.jpeg\" /> \n      </div></img> \n    </div> \n   </div> \n   <div class=\"caption\">\n     We've found that Fujifilm's film simulation options can really alter the 'feeling' of a scene.

With the new XF 27mm F2.8 R WR lens attached, the X-E4 is lighter than Fujifilm's own fixed-lens X100V.</p> \n     <p>In use, we found that the camera itself is reasonably comfortable in the hand with just a wrist strap as long as you're sticking to a compact lens.

A threaded shutter button is always a nice touch, and the dials have just the right amount of resistance.</p> \n     <p>Unfortunately, Fujifilm makes no claims of any weather resistance on the X-E4, despite doing so for its XF 27mm F2.8 R WR kit lens. On our test model at least, the 'Menu/OK' and 'Disp/Back' buttons on the rear plate are a little too mushy and a little too shallow.

In the end, we enabled the touch-swipe for custom functions to get a little more control, meaning you can swipe up, down, left or right on the rear screen to trigger a function. It works pretty well.</p> \n     <p>Lastly, Fujifilm's Auto ISO behavior is unchanged, meaning that you can set upper and lower bounds on ISO values, and then either specify a minimum shutter speed threshold or select 'Auto.' But there's still no way to bias 'Auto' to be faster or slower than half the focal length, as you can on most other competitors. On the other hand, you do get three banks of separate Auto ISO settings you can quickly swap between.</p> \n     <table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"images noCaptions noCrop singleNoBorder center\" data-image-height=\"\" data-image-width=\"590\"> \n      <tbody> \n       <tr> \n        <td class=\"image\" style=\"width: 590px;\"><a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/0601644611/Product/Fujifilm-X-E4-Top.jpeg\" target=\"article-0601644611\"><img border=\"0\" data-thumbnail-height=\"0\" data-thumbnail-width=\"1180\" height=\"393\" src=\"https://4.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS1180x0~articles/0601644611/Product/Fujifilm-X-E4-Top.jpeg\" width=\"590\" data-filename=\"Product/Fujifilm-X-E4-Top.jpeg\" /></a></td> \n       </tr> \n      </tbody> \n     </table> \n     <p>The X-E4 also has a new 'P' mode on its shutter speed dial.

And, probably thanks to increased processing efficiencies, the X-E4's rating puts it at the front of its pack in this regard. You can also charge the battery via the camera's USB-C port.</p> \n     <blockquote class=\"pullQuote\">\n       The UHS-I slot means you won't get any speed benefits if you use faster UHS-II cards \n     </blockquote> \n     <p>The X-E4 uses SD cards for storage; they're inexpensive and ubiquitous, but the X-E4 only supports UHS-I speeds. You can of course use UHS-II cards in the camera, you just won't see any performance benefit beyond a certain point.</p> \n     <p>Informal testing with a SanDisk Extreme Pro UHS-I U3 card shows that you can shoot losslessly compressed Raw and Fine JPEG images for between 1 and 1.5 seconds of burst shooting at 20fps, and wait then a little under 10 seconds for the buffer to clear. Shooting JPEG-only gets you around 2.5 seconds of shooting before the buffer fills, and then it clears after around 8 seconds.</p> \n     <p><a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/fujifilm-x-e4-review-small-size-big-image-quality#top\"><strong>Back to top</strong></a></p> \n     <hr> \n      <h2 id=\"imagequality\" style=\"margin-top: 8%;\">Image Quality</h2> \n      <table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"images noCrop singleNoBorder center\" data-image-height=\"\" data-image-width=\"590\"> \n       <tbody> \n        <tr> \n         <td class=\"image\" style=\"width: 590px;\"><a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/0601644611/DSCF0295.jpeg\" target=\"article-0601644611\"><img border=\"0\" data-aspect-ratio=\"4x3\" data-thumbnail-height=\"0\" data-thumbnail-width=\"590\" height=\"443\" src=\"https://3.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TC4x3S590x0~articles/0601644611/DSCF0295.jpeg\" width=\"590\" data-filename=\"DSCF0295.jpeg\" /></a></td> \n        </tr> \n        <tr> \n         <td class=\"caption\" style=\"width: 590px;\"> <p>The X-E4 offers a wide range of JPEG color profiles – both color and B&amp;W – meant to emulate traditional analog film stocks.

For those wishing to avoid the fuss of color-grading in post, the Eterna/Cinema profile might be just what you need, offering flat contrast and rich tones.</p> \n        <div class=\"video\"> \n         <iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"326\" id=\"videoFrame\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rrdvhuIuoiI?rel=0&amp;autohide=1&amp;wmode=transparent&amp;enablejsapi=1\" width=\"580\"></iframe> \n        </div> \n        <div class=\"caption\">\n          Jump to \n         <a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/videos/0943385178/dpreview-tv-fujifilm-x-e4-review#\">video performance</a> in our DPReviewTV video review, above. \n        </div> \n        <p>AF modes are limited when shooting video, compared to stills. While you still get face and eye-detection for human subjects, the standard autofocus subject tracking mode – where you place an AF box over your subject and initiate AF to lock-on – is absent. Face and eye detect work ok, but can occasionally the camera will lose the subject, leading to a focus rack.</p> \n        <p>There's no dedicated video record button, though one of the three custom buttons can be assigned to this function. To capture video out-of-the-box, you'll need to switch to video mode via the 'drive' button and hit the shutter release. The body has a full-size microphone port and an included USB-C-to-audio jack provides support for audio monitoring; you can adjust audio levels and add wind or low cut filters from within the camera's menus.</p> \n        <p>It's worth reiterating that, unlike the its oh-so-similar SLR-style sibling,<a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/fujifilm-x-s10-review#Video\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> the X-S10</a>, the X-E4 has no in-body image stabilization to aid in hand-held shooting (nor is there any form of digital IS). So if you're already tempted by the X-E4, but like shooting video, the X-S10 may be a better choice for you.</p> \n        <h3>Video performance</h3> \n        <div id=\"reviewImageComparisonWidget-16879797\" class=\"imageComparisonContainer\"></div> \n        <script type=\"text/javascript\">$(document).ready(function() { ImageComparisonWidget({\"containerId\":\"reviewImageComparisonWidget-16879797\",\"widgetId\":811,\"initialStateId\":null}) })</script> \n        <p>Video quality from the X-E4 is identical to that of its siblings, the X-S10 and X-T30; which is to say, quite good. <span class=\"linkish imageComparisonLink\" id=\"icl-5412-891980078\">Full HD footage</span><script type=\"text/javascript\">$(document).ready(function() { $(\"#icl-5412-891980078\").click(function() { ImageComparisonWidgetLink(5412); }); })</script> offers nice detail, though it is somewhat prone to moiré. <span class=\"linkish imageComparisonLink\" id=\"icl-5408--1512120132\">4K footage </span><script type=\"text/javascript\">$(document).ready(function() { $(\"#icl-5408--1512120132\").click(function() { ImageComparisonWidgetLink(5408); }); })</script> looks excellent – whether shooting UHD or DCI – offering significantly more detail than the <span class=\"linkish imageComparisonLink\" id=\"icl-5409-435580251\">Canon EOS M6 II</span><script type=\"text/javascript\">$(document).ready(function() { $(\"#icl-5409-435580251\").click(function() { ImageComparisonWidgetLink(5409); }); })</script>, a bit more detail than the <span class=\"linkish imageComparisonLink\" id=\"icl-5410-1577335602\">Nikon Z50</span><script type=\"text/javascript\">$(document).ready(function() { $(\"#icl-5410-1577335602\").click(function() { ImageComparisonWidgetLink(5410); }); })</script>, and similar amounts to <span class=\"linkish imageComparisonLink\" id=\"icl-5411-97269786\">Sony a6000-series</span><script type=\"text/javascript\">$(document).ready(function() { $(\"#icl-5411-97269786\").click(function() { ImageComparisonWidgetLink(5411); }); })</script> cameras.</p> \n        <p><a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/fujifilm-x-e4-review-small-size-big-image-quality#top\"><strong>Back to top</strong></a></p> \n        <hr> \n         <h2 id=\"conclusion\" style=\"margin-top: 8%;\">Conclusion</h2> \n         <table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"images noCaptions noCrop singleNoBorder center\" data-image-height=\"\" data-image-width=\"590\"> \n          <tbody> \n           <tr> \n            <td class=\"image\" style=\"width: 590px;\"><a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/0601644611/Product/Fujifilm-X-E4-Screen.jpeg\" target=\"article-0601644611\"><img border=\"0\" data-thumbnail-height=\"0\" data-thumbnail-width=\"1180\" height=\"393\" src=\"https://3.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS1180x0~articles/0601644611/Product/Fujifilm-X-E4-Screen.jpeg\" width=\"590\" data-filename=\"Product/Fujifilm-X-E4-Screen.jpeg\" /></a></td> \n           </tr> \n          </tbody> \n         </table> \n         <div class=\"contentTable\"> \n          <table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"contentTable\"> \n           <tbody> \n            <tr> \n             <th width=\"50%\">What we like</th> \n             <th width=\"50%\">What we don't like</th> \n            </tr> \n            <tr> \n             <td width=\"50%\"> \n              <ul> \n               <li>Excellent image quality, pleasing JPEG color</li> \n               <li>Nice classic styling and compact design</li> \n               <li>Strong video feature set with good-quality Full HD and 4K video</li> \n               <li>The tilting touch screen is highly-responsive</li> \n               <li>Can use USB-C port for headphones with included dongle</li> \n               <li>In-camera charging</li> \n               <li>Good battery life</li> \n              </ul> </td> \n             <td width=\"50%\"> \n              <ul> \n               <li>Autofocus tracking performance lags behind the competition</li> \n               <li>No animal detection AF mode</li> \n               <li>We miss having a rear dial and focus mode selector (like on X-E3)</li> \n               <li>More custom buttons would be nice</li> \n               <li>The camera is slippery without accessory grip</li> \n               <li>No in-body stabilization</li> \n               <li>No weather-sealing</li> \n              </ul> </td> \n            </tr> \n           </tbody> \n          </table> \n         </div> \n         <p>Fujifilm has positioned the X-E4 as the <a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/fujifilm-x100v-review\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">X100V</a>'s twin with interchangeable lenses. But unlike previous generations of X-E and X100 cameras, this is not quite a fair positioning. The two share a lot of technology, but the X-E4 comes up a tad short next to its <a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/fujifilm-x100v-review/8\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">gold-award-winning</a> sibling in several regards.

The 3\" tilting touchscreen is highly responsive and enjoyable to use, especially for street photography. And the 2.36M-dot EVF, while not jaw-dropping in resolution, should offer plenty of detail for most users. The camera is also quite handsome, not to mention compact, even if we found it rather slippery without its $90 accessory grip or $70 thumbrest. The paring down of control points left us frustrated, though. We wish Fujifilm hadn't removed the front focus mode selector and rear dial found on its <a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/fujifilm-x-e3-review\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">predecessor</a>. We also wish it had more than just three physical custom buttons.</p> \n         <table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"images noCrop singleNoBorder center\" data-image-height=\"null\" data-image-width=\"590\"> \n          <tbody> \n           <tr> \n            <td class=\"image\" style=\"width: 590px;\"><a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/0601644611/Samples/DSCF1194.acr.jpeg\" target=\"article-0601644611\"><img border=\"0\" data-thumbnail-height=\"0\" data-thumbnail-width=\"1180\" height=\"393\" src=\"https://2.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS1180x0~articles/0601644611/Samples/DSCF1194.acr.jpeg\" width=\"590\" data-filename=\"Samples/DSCF1194.acr.jpeg\" /></a></td> \n           </tr> \n           <tr> \n            <td class=\"caption\" style=\"width: 590px;\"> <p>Converted from Raw in Adobe Camera Raw.</p> <p>ISO 160 |F2.8 | 1/450 sec | Tokina 23mm F1.4 <br><em>Photo: Dan Bracaglia</em></br></p> </td> \n           </tr> \n          </tbody> \n         </table> \n         <p>In terms of image quality output, the X-E4 is highly capable, thanks to its excellent pedigree.

Fujifilm's latest X-Trans BSI CMOS 4 sensor is capable of excellent Raw files with good detail capture and lots of editing latitude.

That said, AF performance using a single point or zone in AF-C works very well and the AF joystick is highly responsive.</p> \n         <blockquote class=\"pullQuote\">\n           We suspect the X-E4 is going to make a lot of photographers happy, especially those craving a near-pocket-size X-mount body with Fujifilm's latest IQ performance \n         </blockquote> \n         <p>Ultimately, the X-E4 is a camera with a lot to offer and we suspect it is going to make a lot of photographers happy, especially those craving a near-pocket-size X-mount body with Fujifilm's latest IQ performance. For those upgrading from other Fujifilm bodies, the lack of buttons will likely take some getting used to, but don't let that be a deal-breaker.

Both cameras are rangefinder-style in design, and while we prefer the touchscreen and control points of the X-E4, we find the autofocus system of the a6400 far more capable. Both cameras offer good image and video quality, and you'll get great Raw files from both, but we find Fujifilm's JPEGs more pleasing.</p> \n         <p>Another competitor with similar specs is the SLR-style <strong><a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/nikon-z50-review\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Nikon Z50</a></strong>. Both it and the X-E4 are well-rounded cameras offering plenty of capability. We prefer the Nikon's ergonomics and control points, but appreciate Fujifilm's considerably larger family of native APS-C lenses. You'll get a bit more resolution from the X-E4, but not an earth-shattering amount, along with slightly more detailed 4K. But your choice between these two may ultimately come down to preference between SLR- or rangefinder-style.</p> \n         <p>The <a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/canon-eos-m6-ii-review\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Canon EOS M6 Mark II</strong></a> is also a natural competitor to the X-E4, sporting similar specs. The most notable difference: the Canon doesn't have a built-in EVF, but it does offer an accessory unit for the hotshoe making it more expensive. Both are highly capable in the image quality department, though the Canon does offer more resolution. But on the video side, we much prefer the X-E4's output and feature set. We think the Fufjilm is a better looking camera than the Canon, but appreciate that latter's hardy grip and ample control points. But there's a lot more native glass available for the X-E4 than the M6 II, and the X-E4 offers superior battery life.</p> \n         <p>The<a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/fujifilm-x-s10-review\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong> Fujfiilm X-S10</strong></a> is also a sensible competitor to the X-E4. It's essentially the same camera under the hood, but in an SLR-shaped body with a deeper, more comfortable grip, better controls, and in-body image stabilization. All that comes with a slightly higher price tag, though.</p> \n         <p><a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/fujifilm-x-e4-review-small-size-big-image-quality#top\"><strong>Back to

It's also capable of strong video performance, though there's no in-body stabilization for hand-held shooting.

Texas-based photographer <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mir_or_image/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mir-or-Image </a>believes they can. In his ongoing video series, '<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtPGdFzLX1a5JwqbYpSsKbTDPqev_M_AD\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Photo Mode Perspective</a>,' Mir plays popular video games and uses their built-in photo modes to help viewers learn the basics of photography, including principles of composition, how shutter speed and aperture impact the look and feel of an image, and more. Mir loves video games and photography. With his educational video series, he combines these two passions in a distinct and educational way.</p> \n<p>Photo modes in video games have become increasingly more sophisticated. For example, in the PlayStation 4 game 'God of War,' the included photo mode includes sliders for the field of view and focal length, which are, of course, interconnected. As you increase the field of view, the focal length decreases. This is something that experienced photographers take for granted, but for beginners, understanding how focal length changes perspective in a scene is important.</p> \n<p>Likewise, for seasoned shooters, you understand how aperture changes the depth of field, all else equal. Still, the photo mode in 'God of War' and other games offers a helpful visual representation of how the plane of focus changes with aperture. Put in simple terms, 'Here's something to note with f-stop, the smaller the number, the blurrier the background gets,' Mir says in the video below. Using 'God of War,' Mir also discusses ways to crop images and edit brightness, contrast and colors, and more.</p> \n<div class=\"video\">\n <iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"326\" id=\"videoFrame\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CvMZxVjkp0g?rel=0&amp;autohide=1&amp;wmode=transparent&amp;enablejsapi=1\" width=\"580\"></iframe>\n</div> \n<p>Another PlayStation game with a very capable built-in photo mode is 2020's 'Ghost of Tsushima.' The game, developed by Sucker Punch Productions, is set on Japan's Tsushima island during the first Mongol invasion of Japan. Some creative liberties are taken in the game for narrative and gameplay purposes, but it nonetheless provides a stunning backdrop for taking in-game photos.</p> \n<p>Like 'God of War,' 'Ghost of Tsushima' includes focal length and aperture sliders for your virtual lens. If you want to shoot a portrait of the main character, Jin, you can use a virtual 85mm f/1.8 lens, for example. You can even direct your subject, in a sense, by changing the character's pose and facial expression. To add creative flair, you can adjust exposure compensation (bias), add particle effects, change the lighting, color grade your image and more. Also, as a warning, 'Ghost of Tsushima' is a violent video game and there is some virtual blood in the video below.</p> \n<div class=\"video\">\n <iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"326\" id=\"videoFrame\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hAbNBbQlCSU?rel=0&amp;autohide=1&amp;wmode=transparent&amp;enablejsapi=1\" width=\"580\"></iframe>\n</div> \n<p>Over at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmJZXtZIXw2EDPWhyUO2cpg\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mir's YouTube channel</a> you can also see his 'Photo Mode Perspective' videos for two more video games, 'Cyberpunk 2077' and 'Spider-Man: Miles Morales.' To view Mir's real-world photography, follow him on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mir_or_image/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a> and visit his <a href=\"https://www.mir-or-image.com/home\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>. The photography bug bit Mir during a trip to Europe in 2018. He enjoyed using his smartphone in manual mode, and when he returned home to Texas, he went out and bought an interchangeable lens camera. He is now a professional car photographer based in Houston.</p> \n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"images noCrop singleNoBorder center\" data-image-height=\"null\" data-image-width=\"590\"> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td class=\"image\" style=\"width: 590px;\"><a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/1633276520/forza-horizon-4-image.jpeg\" target=\"article-620e6d19e21840849d36eeeab8ec6f38\"><img border=\"0\" data-thumbnail-height=\"0\" data-thumbnail-width=\"590\" height=\"330\" src=\"https://4.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS590x0~articles/1633276520/forza-horizon-4-image.jpeg\" width=\"590\" data-filename=\"forza-horizon-4-image.jpeg\" /></a></td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td class=\"caption\" style=\"width: 590px;\">I captured this image in 'Forza Horizon 4' on Xbox.

For example, professional automotive photographer Sam Dobbins <a href=\"https://altdriver.com/gaming/video-professional-car-photographer-used-forza-game-to-plan-magazine-photoshoot/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">used Forza Motorsport on Xbox to plan out a real-world photoshoot</a>. Others, such as Instagram user <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jk_fh4_pics/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">jk_fh4_pics</a> has an entire account dedicated to photography from the game 'Forza Horizon 4.' In some cases, game developers even hold photography contests using their games, which is something that Playground Games does with Forza Horizon and Rockstar Games does with Red Dead Redemption 2.</p> \n<div class=\"video\">\n <iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"326\" id=\"videoFrame\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/e-e-lev6iiA?rel=0&amp;autohide=1&amp;wmode=transparent&amp;enablejsapi=1\" width=\"580\"></iframe>\n</div> \n<p>If you're like Mir and love both video games and photography, you may be able to combine your interests like him. 'New Pokémon Snap' arrives on Nintendo Switch later this month, and the entire purpose of that game is to capture photos of Pokémon in their virtual habitats.</p> \n<p>The upcoming Switch title will allow Pokémon shutterbugs to edit and share their images online with other gamers. A similar game is a PlayStation 3 title from 2008, 'Afrika,' in which the player assumes the role of a photojournalist hired to take photos on an African safari. It's a difficult game to find these days, but I remember importing a copy from Japan when I became interested in photography in high school. It wasn't an amazing game, but it was a lot of fun to take wildlife photographs of animals I've never seen in real life.</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 06 Apr 2021 16:01:00 +0000","feedId":70,"bgimg":"https://1.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS590x0~articles/1633276520/mir-or-image-photo-mode-banner.jpeg","linkMd5":"7e023dd141eb1885b46483e81ef3409a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn53@2020_6/2021/04/07/17-38-14-593_a038c162d3038048.webp","destWidth":590,"destHeight":307,"sourceBytes":47741,"destBytes":24600,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://1.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS590x0~articles/1633276520/mir-or-image-photo-mode-banner.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn53@2020_6/2021/04/07/17-38-14-593_a038c162d3038048.webp","https://4.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS590x0~articles/1633276520/forza-horizon-4-image.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn96@2020_6/2021/04/07/17-38-32-479_a95762eea231bb84.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617817093461},{"createdTime":"2021-04-08 01:38:13","updatedTime":"2021-04-08 01:38:13","title":"A filmmaker melted his DJI Mavic 2 Pro drone to get these incredible shots of an active volcano","link":"https://www.dpreview.com/news/0301768182/a-filmmaker-melted-his-mavic-2-pro-drone-to-get-these-incredible-shots-of-an-active-volcano","description":"<div class=\"video\"> \n <iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"326\" id=\"videoFrame\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KJ-dutQXUtg?rel=0&amp;autohide=1&amp;wmode=transparent&amp;enablejsapi=1\" width=\"580\"></iframe> \n</div> \n<p>Last month, we <a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/news/8105733216/video-incredible-footage-of-a-drone-flying-over-an-erupting-volcano-in-iceland\">shared a video</a> that showed pilot Bjorn Steinbekk flying a DJI FPV drone over the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fagradalsfjall\">Fagradalsfjall volcano</a>, located near Reykjavik, Iceland.

Canon’s statement came in the form of its <a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/news/7035809882/canon-annual-financial-results-show-drop-net-sales-increase-profits-point-positive-2021\">full-year 2020 financial results presentation</a>, while Sigma’s statement came directly from Sigma CEO Kazuto Yamaki, who said in a <a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/news/5000050197/sigma-ceo-confirms-rf-z-mount-possibility-estimates-camera-industry-stabilize/1\">recent interview</a> that he expects the camera market ‘will reach its minimal size [in 2020]’ and be ‘pretty stable’ going forward.</p> \n<p>While this might’ve been difficult to imagine, especially after the impact COVID-19 had on the global economy throughout 2020, it seems the predictions are holding true, so far. Based on CIPA data, which tracks the global production and shipment of camera models from <a href=\"https://www.cipa.jp/stats/documents/e/list_e.pdf\">these camera manufacturers</a>, production and shipment numbers are tracking the best it’s been since 2017.</p> \n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"images noCrop singleNoBorder center\" data-image-height=\"null\" data-image-width=\"590\"> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td class=\"image\" style=\"width: 590px;\"><a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/8487085806/10E50C2D-B6F3-4B84-8D1D-57562C74FCDD.jpeg\" target=\"article-a45c525d03d046e38d99e49de34ce507\"><img border=\"0\" data-thumbnail-height=\"0\" data-thumbnail-width=\"590\" height=\"437\" src=\"https://2.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS590x0~articles/8487085806/10E50C2D-B6F3-4B84-8D1D-57562C74FCDD.jpeg\" width=\"590\" data-filename=\"10E50C2D-B6F3-4B84-8D1D-57562C74FCDD.jpeg\" /></a></td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td class=\"caption\" style=\"width: 590px;\">This chart from CIPA shows total digital stills camera shipments in 2019 (purple, circles), 2020 (black, triangles) and 2021 (orange, squares).

If you look at the data for interchangeable lens cameras, shipments are down just 6.2% by volume and up 17.3% by value, year-over-year (YoY) for January and February.</p> \n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"images noCrop singleNoBorder center\" data-image-height=\"null\" data-image-width=\"590\"> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td class=\"image\" style=\"width: 590px;\"><a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/8487085806/063C14A5-7AFA-4037-876A-F93E18CE6279.jpeg\" target=\"article-a45c525d03d046e38d99e49de34ce507\"><img border=\"0\" data-thumbnail-height=\"0\" data-thumbnail-width=\"590\" height=\"438\" src=\"https://4.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS590x0~articles/8487085806/063C14A5-7AFA-4037-876A-F93E18CE6279.jpeg\" width=\"590\" data-filename=\"063C14A5-7AFA-4037-876A-F93E18CE6279.jpeg\" /></a></td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td class=\"caption\" style=\"width: 590px;\">This chart from CIPA shows total interchangeable lens shipments in 2019 (purple, circles), 2020 (black, triangles) and 2021 (orange, squares).</td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p>Break that number down even further and you’ll see that, much like compact cameras shipments are affecting the total digital camera market, DSLR cameras are dragging down the average for interchangeable lens cameras.

Still though, the YoY numbers are some of the best we’ve seen in a while from CIPA and the data backs up what some of the major camera companies have emphasized over the past years in their interviews and financial result presentations for investors; the camera market is beginning to stabilize as the drop-off at the lower end of the market has more or less reached a plateau and hobbyist and professional photographers—who are less likely to trade out their dedicated cameras for smartphones—are starting to once again make up the majority of the market.</p> \n<p>Considering March 2020 is when the COVID-19 pandemic really started to impact the global economy, contextualizing the rest of CIPA’s 2021 data will prove to be more difficult. Specifically, we’re going to see high YoY numbers for both production and shipments, due to both being limited in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but in future reports we’ll do our best to contextualize CIPA’s data to ensure we have a solid macro-level view of the photography market.</p> \n<p>You can view CIPA’s February data (and all historical data) on <a href=\"https://www.cipa.jp/stats/dc_e.html\">its website</a>.</p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 05 Apr 2021 14:19:00 +0000","feedId":70,"bgimg":"https://4.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS590x0~articles/8487085806/FA5B3722-6EF9-4FBC-B7B9-C1A9A4610496.jpeg","linkMd5":"9ea03b800a420fbc2356046384137c83","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn46@2020_3/2021/04/07/17-38-14-321_16c758d370647024.webp","destWidth":590,"destHeight":393,"sourceBytes":71691,"destBytes":36552,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://4.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS590x0~articles/8487085806/FA5B3722-6EF9-4FBC-B7B9-C1A9A4610496.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn46@2020_3/2021/04/07/17-38-14-321_16c758d370647024.webp","https://2.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS590x0~articles/8487085806/10E50C2D-B6F3-4B84-8D1D-57562C74FCDD.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn34@2020_3/2021/04/07/17-38-31-842_fc01cf61aee22274.webp","https://4.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS590x0~articles/8487085806/063C14A5-7AFA-4037-876A-F93E18CE6279.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn11@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-38-44-629_cde64fcde1493d16.webp","https://3.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS590x0~articles/8487085806/353D1537-ED6A-4035-A603-144383A5C945.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn20@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-38-32-703_872cdf0a167d8662.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617817093449},{"createdTime":"2021-04-08 01:38:13","updatedTime":"2021-04-08 01:38:13","title":"Hubble scientists revisit an incredible image of Veil Nebula, showing off new details","link":"https://www.dpreview.com/news/5134615536/hubble-scientists-revisit-an-incredible-image-of-veil-nebula-showing-off-new-details","description":"<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"images noCaptions noCrop singleNoBorder center\" data-image-height=\"null\" data-image-width=\"590\"> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td class=\"image\" style=\"width: 590px;\"><a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/5134615536/hs-2021-veil-nebula-banner.jpeg\" target=\"article-5134615536\"><img border=\"0\" data-thumbnail-height=\"0\" data-thumbnail-width=\"590\" height=\"442\" src=\"https://2.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS590x0~articles/5134615536/hs-2021-veil-nebula-banner.jpeg\" width=\"590\" data-filename=\"hs-2021-veil-nebula-banner.jpeg\" /></a></td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p>In 2015, the <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/main/index.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Hubble Space Telescope</a> captured an <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/veil-nebula-supernova-remnant\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">image</a> of the Veil Nebula.

You can see enhanced details of emissions from doubly ionized oxygen (seen in the image as blue colors), ionized hydrogen, ionized sulfur (green) and ionized nitrogen (seen as reds in the photo).</p> \n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"images noCrop singleNoBorder center\" data-image-height=\"null\" data-image-width=\"590\"> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td class=\"image\" style=\"width: 590px;\"><a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/5134615536/hs-2021-veil-nebula.jpeg\" target=\"article-d69170a007c5413db223f7a52c152cc0\"><img border=\"0\" data-thumbnail-height=\"0\" data-thumbnail-width=\"590\" height=\"413\" src=\"https://3.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS590x0~articles/5134615536/hs-2021-veil-nebula.jpeg\" width=\"590\" data-filename=\"hs-2021-veil-nebula.jpeg\" /></a></td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td class=\"caption\" style=\"width: 590px;\">This close-up <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/potw2113a.jpg\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">image</a> of the Veil Nebula was first captured in 2015.

In 1904, Herschel's work was followed by Williamina Fleming's discovery of a fainter portion of the nebula, known as Pickering's Triangle, named after the director of the Harvard College Observatory where Fleming worked. If you'd like to view the Veil Nebula for yourself, the best observation time is early autumn in the northern hemisphere and early spring in the southern hemisphere. The nebula is not visible to the naked eye, but it can be seen through a telescope or binoculars under dark sky conditions. If you have a nebula filter, it will help brighten the Veil's appearance and allow you to see additional detail.</p> \n<p>The Veil Nebula is a visible portion of the Cygnus Loop, which is the remnant of a supernova formed about 10,000 years ago. The Veil Nebula formed through the death of a massive star, which possessed roughly 20 times the mass of the Sun. Like other stars of that size, it had a relatively short lifespan and died with a massive release of energy. The energy and debris from this supernova form the Veil Nebula's tendrils of ionized gas.</p> \n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"images noCrop singleNoBorder center\" data-image-height=\"null\" data-image-width=\"590\"> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td class=\"image\" style=\"width: 590px;\"><a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/5134615536/hs-2015-29-veil-nebula.jpeg\" target=\"article-d69170a007c5413db223f7a52c152cc0\"><img border=\"0\" data-thumbnail-height=\"0\" data-thumbnail-width=\"590\" height=\"393\" src=\"https://2.img-dpreview.com/files/p/E~TS590x0~articles/5134615536/hs-2015-29-veil-nebula.jpeg\" width=\"590\" data-filename=\"hs-2015-29-veil-nebula.jpeg\" /></a></td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td class=\"caption\" style=\"width: 590px;\">The 2015 version of the image of the Veil Nebula.

The entire nebula is 110 light-years across, covering about six full moons' worth of the night sky as viewed from Earth. The section we see in the shot from Hubble, which is a six-image composite, is about two light-years across.</p> \n<p>Back in 2015, when showing off its new image of the Veil Nebula, NASA also shared a couple of neat videos. The videos haven't been redone with the latest processed image, but they're nonetheless worth checking out again.</p> \n<div class=\"video\"> \n <iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"326\" id=\"videoFrame\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/27PErpOJ7VA?rel=0&amp;autohide=1&amp;wmode=transparent&amp;enablejsapi=1\" width=\"580\"></iframe> \n</div> \n<div class=\"video\"> \n <iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"326\" id=\"videoFrame\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rsqZlXREz2E?rel=0&amp;autohide=1&amp;wmode=transparent&amp;enablejsapi=1\" width=\"580\"></iframe> \n</div> \n<p>You can learn more about the Veil Nebula by <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/caldwell-34\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">visiting Hubble's Caldwell catalog</a>.
