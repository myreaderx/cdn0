It is found that asymmetric electrical\r\nboundary conditions have a significant effect on the formation of vortex domain structures and play\r\na deterministic role in manipulating the vortex chirality by a homogeneous electrostatic field. The\r\nresults indicate that the critical electric field for vortex switching can be greatly reduced by\r\nengineering the asymmetric surface screening conditions in a ferroelectric nanodot with a regular\r\nstructure and uniform composition.","descriptionType":"text/plain","publishedDate":"Thu, 29 Apr 2021 23:00:00 +0000","feedId":12251,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"252086011ccb39fdb730c4cb171e17a0","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"P C Xiong, S Yuan, Y L Liu and B Wang","publishedOrCreatedDate":1619853161199}],"record":{"createdTime":"2021-05-01 15:12:41","updatedTime":"2021-05-01 15:12:41","feedId":12251,"fetchDate":"Sat, 01 May 2021 07:12:41 +0000","fetchMs":46780,"handleMs":4,"totalMs":46787,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"af0629e1ae74a27744b4cbd27b40a78e","hostName":"us-028*","requestId":"efc68223333c4aac8bbfe5252851310a_12251","contentType":"application/xml;charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":0,"bgimgsTotal":0,"bgimgsGithubTotal":0,"articlesImgsTotal":0,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":0,"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 04:37:28","updatedTime":"2020-09-06 13:01:58","id":12251,"name":"Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics - latest papers","url":"http://iopscience.iop.org/0022-3727/?rss=1","subscriber":253,"website":null,"icon":"http://iopscience.iop.org/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx62/cdn57@2020_5/2020/09/06/05-01-57-779_89e2c9662d839ba1.ico","description":"Latest articles for Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics","weekly":null,"link":null},"noPictureArticleList":[],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1619853114413,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":46782,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":4,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":0,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"},{"spend":0,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"}]},"extra5":0,"extra6":0,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[],"successGithubMap":{},"failGithubMap":{}}
