Of these, five uses combined the phrase\nwith Xi’s banner term (旗帜语), the political\ncatchphrase meant to subsume all of his ideas and stand as the monument to his\nlegacy. Like the headline of the article itself, these five instances talked\nabout “Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New\nEra <strong>and</strong> Xi Jinping Thought on a Strong Military” (习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想和习近平强军思想). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the laws of CCP discourse – remembering that in the formulation of language at the highest levels, nothing is taken lightly – this should be a serious error on the part of Xinhua, and then again on the part of CCTV. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://chinamediaproject.org/2020/10/14/raising-up-the-general-secretary/\">we\nhave previously written</a>, Xi’s banner term, “Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism\nwith Chinese Characteristics for a New Era” (习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想),\nwhich first appeared in October 2017 at the 19th National Congress of the CCP, is\non a winding path toward formalization as the shortened and more potent “Xi\nJinping Thought” (习近平思想), putting Xi on par with\nMao Zedong. Despite some rather careless and premature <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&#38;as_sdt=0%2C5&#38;q=%22Xi+Jinping+Thought%22&#38;btnG=\">references\nin academic literature</a> and mainstream news reports outside China to “Xi Jinping\nThought,” it is worth remembering that “Xi Jinping Thought” has in fact not yet\nemerged, not formally, and this is a distinction that certainly has not escaped\nXi and his acolytes at senior levels, who are busy trying to achieve this\ntransformation. &#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Xi Jinping Thought” is the\nend game, and when we see the emergence of a host of subordinate permutations\nof Xi thoughts in various policy areas, including “Xi Jinping Thought on a\nStrong Military” and “Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy” (习近平外交思想), these are meant to help pave the way toward “Xi\nJinping Thought.” Think of it as a rhetorical game of crossing the river by\nfeeling the stones. In 2018, at least 10 such sub-forms of Xi thought appeared\nin official sources. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the point of Xi Jinping’s\nbanner term is to <em>subsume</em> all of Xi’s ideas. There is meant to be one\nbanner, the umbrella phrase under which all lesser banners fly. And any suggestion\nof equivalence between the lesser thoughts and their parent phrase would serve\nto diminish the gravity of “Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese\nCharacteristics for a New Era.” This is the serious problem in the Xinhua\narticle, the “<strong>and</strong>” drawing an equivalence between Xi’s banner term and “Xi\nJinping Thought on a Strong Military.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The term “Xi Jinping Thought on a Strong Military” appears in military-related sources, such as the <em>People’s Liberation Army Daily</em>, but is generally marked as being subordinate to the overarching banner term. When Party media in China <a href=\"http://www.xinhuanet.com/politics/leaders/2020-11/13/c_1126735392.htm\">reported on the release last month</a> of the “People’s Liberation of China Joint Operation Outline (中国人民解放军联合作战纲要), they stressed that “the ‘Outline’ is guided by Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism With Chinese Characteristics for the New Era, and thoroughly implements Xi Jinping Thought on a Strong Military.” </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img data-attachment-id=\"46657\" data-permalink=\"https://chinamediaproject.org/2020/12/03/thoughts-on-a-high-level-error/proper-use/\" data-orig-file=\"https://chinamediaproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/proper-use.jpeg\" data-orig-size=\"1536,864\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&#34;aperture&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;credit&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;camera&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;caption&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;created_timestamp&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;copyright&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;focal_length&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;iso&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;shutter_speed&#34;:&#34;0&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;orientation&#34;:&#34;0&#34;}\" data-image-title=\"proper-use\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://chinamediaproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/proper-use-500x281.jpeg\" data-large-file=\"https://chinamediaproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/proper-use-1024x576.jpeg\" src=\"https://chinamediaproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/proper-use-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-46657\" width=\"533\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://chinamediaproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/proper-use-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, https://chinamediaproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/proper-use-500x281.jpeg 500w, https://chinamediaproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/proper-use-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://chinamediaproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/proper-use-1080x608.jpeg 1080w, https://chinamediaproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/proper-use.jpeg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px\" /><figcaption>A November 27, 2020, news release from Xinhua clearly shows use of &#8220;Xi Jinping Thought on a Strong Military&#8221; given secondary emphasis following &#8220;Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism With Chinese Characteristics for the New Era.&#8221;</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The proper juxtaposition of these two phrases should have been something more like: “ . . . with Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era as the guide, thoroughly implementing Xi Jinping Thought on a Strong Military” (以习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想为指导, 深入贯彻习近平强军思想). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>How did this low-level error happen at Xinhua?
