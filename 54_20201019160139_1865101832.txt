Here, the painter uses explosions of different colors to simulate the action-packed beginning of Earth.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/9%20Australian%20Websites%20That%20Will%20Inspire%20Your%20Design-3.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n</div> \n<p style=\"font-size: 10px; text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https://painting-artisan.blogspot.com/2018/03/most-famous-paintings-australia.html\" style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Image Source</a></em></p> \n<p>But Australia's colorful, energetic art aesthetic doesn't stop at art museums. Today, it can be seen in architecture, graphic design, and online. In fact, many Australian brands exemplify the region's immersive or eye-popping artistic techniques in web design and user experience.</p> \n<p>Whether you're an international marketer learning how to design a unique web experience for visitors around the world, or an Australian designer hoping to get a leg up on the local competition, we've compiled a list of nine stunning Australian company websites you can learn from.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h2>Examples of Australian Websites</h2> \n<h3><a href=\"https://www.vbreathe.com/\">Vbreathe</a></h3> \n<p>Vbreathe, which sells a high-tech, compact air detoxification system for homes,leverages a full video experience on the homepage of its website.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/breatheasy-1.gif?width=600&amp;name=breatheasy-1.gif\" alt=\"vbreathe australian website demo\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>When you enter Vbreathe's site, you instantly see a silent video that uses animations and special effects to demonstrate how the detoxifier works. Then, when you click on the video's overlaid play button, you enter a full-screen product demo video that explains how the product works and why consumers should consider it.</p> \n<p>After viewing the silent or full-screen video, visitors can scroll down to find more text-based product details and links to content air detoxification.</p> \n<p>All in all, Vbreathe's site does a great job of combining stunning images, videos, and text-based content that educate visitors about in-home air quality and give them the information they need to justify making a purchase.</p> \n<h3><a href=\"https://kuacoffee.co/\">Kua Coffee</a></h3> \n<p>Kua Coffee pulls visitors into its website with an interactive homepage scale that simply asks, \"How many coffees do you have a day?\"</p> \n<p>When you click an amount of coffee you drink on the scale and press \"GO,\" you're sent through a slide show that calculates interesting measurements related to the amount of coffee you drink and explains where that coffee would be sustainably sourced from if you purchase brews from Kua.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/kua%20coffee.gif?width=600&amp;name=kua%20coffee.gif\" alt=\"kua coffee australian website demo\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>Once you complete Kua's slideshow, you can scroll through a page that informs you more about the impact of environmentally-friendly coffee brewing and where <a href=\"https://kuacoffee.co/get-kua-coffee/\">Kua's ingredients are sourced from</a>.</p> \n<p>Kua Coffee's site is a great example of how a brand can create an interactive experience that allows a visitor to think about how they use or consume a product, learn more about how that type of product is made, and find out why a particular brand's product is better than its competition.</p> \n<h3><a href=\"https://www.slaventorline.com.au/\">Slaven Torline</a></h3> \n<p>While some designers might find it difficult to create a memorable site around something as logistical as financial planning, Slaven Torline -- an Australian firm that advises struggling companies -- embraces whitespace and simple animations to create an intriguing, effective, and professional website.</p> \n<p>On Slaven Torline's homepage, all you'll find a brief mission statement, an image with a sphere and a cube, and a headline asking \"How can we help?\"</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Slaven%20Torline.gif?width=600&amp;name=Slaven%20Torline.gif\" alt=\"Slaven Torline australian website demo\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>When you hover over the sphere, you'll see the word \"Insolvency\" appear with a few list items to the side explaining how the business can help. When you hover over the square, you'll see something similar around the word \"Restructuring.</p> \n<p>When you click \"Learn more\" for either Insolvency or Restructuring, the page expands with the associated shape moving down to a lower corner. From there, the shape's shadow will change based on where your mouse is moving, adding light interactivity to the page.</p> \n<p>Overall, Slaven Torline's a great example of how a corporate or B2B company with less visual offerings can still leverage a clever -- yet professional -- aesthetic to create a memorable, interesting, and smooth user experience for its visitors.</p> \n<h3><a href=\"https://www.seemakeplay.com.au/\">SeeMakePlay</a></h3> \n<p>SeeMakePlay is a company that coordinates and teaches arts and crafts to children in schools or at parties. When you visit the site, you'll see a colorful SeeMakePlay logo surrounded by colorful animated characters. And, on the lower-right, you can click a color and a pencil icon which enables you to scribble all over the page and characters.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/seemakeplay.gif?width=600&amp;name=seemakeplay.gif\" alt=\"seemakeplay australian website demo\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>As you scroll down, you continue to see playful animations, testimonials, and images of happy children, as well as an explanation of how the business works. You can also find an inquiry form allowing you to learn more about the brand.</p> \n<p>With SeeMakePlay's website, visitors can experience the fun and excitement of arts and crafts at the top of the homepage, scroll to learn more about the business, and ultimately find out where and how to schedule a class when they reach the bottom. This is an excellent way to pull a visitor <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-for-every-funnel-stage\">through the flywheel</a> as the design attracts, engages, and delights them.</p> \n<h3><a href=\"https://velo.pacvac.com/\">PacVac</a></h3> \n<p>PacVac, an Australian vacuum company, offers its homepage visitors a highly visual and somewhat interactive experience that highlights the major value points of its Velo vacuum cleaner.</p> \n<p>When you enter the site, you see a simple image of a woman vacuuming her home. Then as you scroll, you begin to see product shots of the Velo, which pop in front of a white background.</p> \n<p>Just when you think this is a standard product site, you might notice that the product shots are animated. For some of them, you can twist and move the Velo in different directions with a simple swipe of your mouse, allowing you to get an interactive 360-degree view of the product.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/pacvac.gif?width=600&amp;name=pacvac.gif\" alt=\"pacvac australian website demo\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>From there, the animations continue to get more advanced with each scroll. At one point you can scroll to see how each piece of Velo's inner machinery works.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/pacvac%202.gif?width=600&amp;name=pacvac%202.gif\" alt=\"pacvac australian website demo\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>Essentially the home-page of this site feels like a self-paced, interactive video demonstration that shows a visitor everything they need to know about a vacuum without completely overwhelming them. The more you scroll, the more complex the details and animations get.</p> \n<p>The progression of VacPac's homepage content lines up well with <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-for-every-funnel-stage\">the average buyer's journey</a>. When a prospect is doing initial research, they might just skim a site for light product information. But, as they get more serious about purchasing a product, they'll look for a <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/content-for-every-funnel-stage\">longer list of details and specifications</a> before making an informed decision.</p> \n<h3><a href=\"https://www.therocks.com/\">The Rocks Markets</a></h3> \n<p>The Rocks Markets is a retail and dining space in Sydney, Australia. While this business could easily place static food shots and basic information on its site and still get great foot traffic as a notable tourist destination, the web designers used the site to embrace color, video, and a sense of movement with each scroll.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/The%20Rocks.gif?width=600&amp;name=The%20Rocks.gif\" alt=\"The Rocks australian website demo\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>When you land on the homepage, you can see that the background is a video of delicious foods from different vendors at The Rocks Market. As you scroll, you'll continue to see photos and notice that the page navigation shrinks to give space to the beautiful food photography.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/The%20Rocks%20Menu-1.gif?width=430&amp;name=The%20Rocks%20Menu-1.gif\" alt=\"The Rocks Menu australian website demo\" width=\"430\" style=\"width: 430px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>The Rocks Markets' site is a great example of how a brand can highlight product videos and imagery, text-based content, a detailed navigation bar, and other information without making a homepage look too busy or overwhelming to understand. When visiting this site, you feel like you've learned almost everything you need to know about the Rocks Market, but still know exactly where to click if you have remaining questions before your visit.</p> \n<h2>Australian Shopping Sites</h2> \n<h3><a href=\"https://www.boydblue.com/\">Boyd Blue</a></h3> \n<p>Boyd Blue is a women-fun ecommerce site and store chain that sells a wide range of Australian-made home products -- from furniture to decor.</p> \n<p>While many other sites on this list have amped up interactivity, Boyd Blue's designers aired on the side of simplicity by focusing each web page's format around large, high-resolution images of products in natural home settings.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Boyd.gif?width=600&amp;name=Boyd.gif\" alt=\"Boyd Blue australian website demo\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>Aside from its beautiful homepage, Boyd Blue's website also features an ecommerce store with a design and UX that's also simple and easy to navigate for quick, frictionless purchases:</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/9%20Australian%20Websites%20That%20Will%20Inspire%20Your%20Design-2.png?width=600&amp;name=9%20Australian%20Websites%20That%20Will%20Inspire%20Your%20Design-2.png\" alt=\"boyd blue australian website demo\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>Rather than burying basic product shots in a page design with tons of descriptive text, the image-centered, light-text design allows users to get an accurate idea of what products will look like in real life, while also enjoying a smooth, aesthetically pleasing web experience.</p> \n<div>\n <a href=\"https://queengarnet.com/\">Queen Garnet</a>\n</div> \n<p>Queen Garnet is an Australian brand that sells plum-based health and wellness products such as supplements, powders, and beverages.</p> \n<p>Like a Queen Garnet plum, which has been dubbed a \"queen of antioxidants,\" the QueenGarnet.com's homepage is purple, decorative, and uses regal-looking imager and fonts. When you enter the homepage, you'll see a short, but memorable automatic video that presents one of Queen Garnets products in a castle with a moat surrounding it.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/queengarnet.gif?width=600&amp;name=queengarnet.gif\" alt=\"queen garnet australian website demo\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>As you scroll down the homepage, you'll see light animations that show each recent Queen Garnet product and basic information about it.

The site's royal-purple theme is not only fun and vibrant, but it could also be very memorable to visitors sifting through a handful of health and wellness sites for the perfect product.</p> \n<h3><a href=\"https://www.birdsnest.com.au/\">Birdsnest</a></h3> \n<p>Birdsnest is an ecommerce clothing site that allows you to skim through product listings or get automated product recommendations based on your interests.</p> \n<p>The ecommerce brand's website design balances whitespace with colorful product shots to give off a simplistic, friendly, care-free aesthetic.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/birdsnest.gif?width=600&amp;name=birdsnest.gif\" alt=\"birdsnest australian shopping website demo\" width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>What's most memorable about Birdsnest's site is its user experience.</p> \n<p>If you're a first time visitor, you can browse products using search filters, or shop by categories including body type, occasion, and even personality.

In fact, most of the remote organizations didn't even offer team bonding activities.</p>  \n<p>While we've all probably participated in various holiday parties and team bonding events, those might not have been virtual.</p> \n<p>Hosting a virtual team bonding or holiday party can seem daunting. How can you plan activities online? What logistics are involved?</p> \n<p>If you're planning a virtual holiday party this year, don't stress.</p> \n<p>Let's review some tips from HubSpot's remote workforce on how to host a virtual holiday party.</p> \n<p></p> \n<h3>1. Use a spreadsheet to organize your activities.</h3> \n<p>Planning a virtual holiday party requires plenty of logistics. That's why you should use a spreadsheet to stay organized.</p> \n<p>Kara Korosec, a remote senior customer success manager at HubSpot, says, \"I used to coordinate Secret Santa at my last company, a 100% remote company. I set up a spreadsheet where everyone listed some of their interests, then we used a random generator to assign secret Santas. Everyone had a budget of $50 and used the spreadsheet as inspiration for what to get. After the gifts were mailed, we had a Zoom where we shared our gifts and guessed who our secret Santa was.\"</p> \n<p>Regardless of the activity you're doing, it's important to stay organized so it's clear who's running the activities and when the deadlines are.</p> \n<h3>2. Make it interactive.</h3> \n<p>Virtual events might automatically feel \"hands-off.\" However, these events can still be interactive. In Korosec's secret Santa example, they opened the gifts on a live Zoom call.</p> \n<p>The goal here is to be creative.</p> \n<p>Eimear Marrinan, a director of culture at HubSpot, says, \"There are a ton of amazing remote vendors and minority-owned businesses that we partner with in the Culture Team. They are doing amazing work. If your budget allows for it, consider outsourcing to the experts. A few brilliant events I have seen: Ski Chalet Experience, Walkthrough Christmas Markets, Cocktails in a Winter Wonderland!\"</p> \n<p>There are several online games and activities you can use for your virtual holiday party. Below are some of our favorite interactive remote activities:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Virtual MasterChef: Ask one person to host and send out a list of ingredients (or modified ingredients for dietary restrictions) and supplies. On the cooking night, have everyone dial into the Zoom to cook the same meal together as the host walks them through the recipe. Once the recipe is ready, sit down and have a virtual dinner together!</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.jackboxgames.com/\">Jack Box Games</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.airbnb.com/s/experiences/online\">Airbnb Experiences</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.patchworkadventures.com/\">Patchwork Adventures</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.pinturillo2.com/\">Pinturillo</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://tea-vs-coffee.com/\">Virtual Tea &amp; Coffee Tasting </a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://alicestable.com/events\">Virtual Floral Arrangement Class with Alice's Table: </a>They deliver farm-fresh flowers to your door.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://artsandculture.google.com/partner/musee-dorsay-paris?hl=en\">Travel to Paris and tour the Musée d'Orsay</a> or <a href=\"https://britishmuseum.withgoogle.com/\">pop over to London and tour The British Museum </a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.sweetfarm.org/goat-2-meeting\">Goat 2 Meeting: Virtual Farm Tours &amp; Animal Cameos in Zoom Meetings</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://twobitcircus.com/events/\">Two Bit Circus</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://splashthat.com/\">Splash</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.on24.com/\">ON24</a></li> \n</ul> \n<h3>3. Incorporate food.</h3> \n<p>When you have an event in person, usually the meal is provided. With remote holiday parties, don't forget about this element.</p> \n<p>Emily Tong-Sanchez, a remote revenue operations specialist at HubSpot, says, \"Let people comp their meal!\"</p> \n<p>This gives people a reason to celebrate and enjoy the party.</p> \n<p>Marrinan adds, \"Ask questions if you're incorporating food. Are there allergies or preferences? If you're arranging a cocktail hour, does everyone drink alcohol? This is all about being inclusive in how you're arranging your event.\"</p> \n<p>If you're sending food, it's important to be aware of any restrictions so your event is inclusive of all participants.</p> \n<h3>4. Encourage people to dress up.</h3> \n<p>Holiday parties are usually fun events where everyone can dress up and celebrate. Being remote shouldn't change this.</p> \n<p>Tong-Sanchez says, \"Encourage people to dress up. We like having a reason to put on fancy clothes!\"</p> \n<h3>5. Always lead with an inclusive mindset.</h3> \n<p>A major obstacle with remote meetings is that it's hard to feel included.</p> \n<p>Marrinan remarks, \"We are working in a distributed and remote world right now, so when thinking through a holiday event for you and your team think big &amp; think global. Will the timezone work for all on your team? Do ‘The Holidays' resonate across the globe? Make sure you plan something fun, and inclusive that everyone can get involved in!\"</p> \n<h3>6. Plan in advance.</h3> \n<p>If you're planning a virtual holiday party, it's important to plan in advance.</p> \n<p>Marrinan says, \"The end of the year is busy. Really busy! Give people advanced notice and book time in advance. A lot of people are juggling right now, so being protective of time is important! Similarly, be mindful of caregivers on your team, or anyone that may have blocked time in their day.\"</p> \n<h3>7. Send something physical.</h3> \n<p>Just because your event is remote, doesn't mean you can't include a physical element in your virtual holiday party.</p> \n<p>\"Can you send something out to the team in advance to spur some excitement? This doesn't have to be a physical gift -- maybe it is a handwritten card or a note of gratitude,\" Marrinan remarks. \"A holiday event doesn't have to be a big, big thing. Sometimes it's the simple acts of kindness that go a long way for people.\"</p> \n<h3>8. Pick a goal.</h3> \n<p>When you're planning your holiday party, it's important to decide what your goal is. For example, it's hard to play a game while also getting to know each other.</p> \n<p>Caroline Merewether, a strategy and operations manager at HubSpot, says, \"The biggest takeaway is to figure out if it's more about deepening relationships or playing a game.\"</p> \n<p>One of Merewether's favorite events her team put on was an Airbnb experience which was a virtual escape room.</p> \n<p>\"That was fun to do something different and it was a fun mental shift. But it wasn't great for getting to know people because we were trying to solve for clues. For our next party, we wanted to drive conversation between us,\" she adds.</p> \n<p>For her team's next virtual holiday party, they're going to send international candies that will be a great conversation starter for breakout rooms. Then, they're going to do a costume contest and online trivia.</p> \n<p>Jeff Boulter, an engineering lead at HubSpot, decided to combine the interactive activity with a way of getting to know each other via an interactive trivia game.</p> \n<p>To start, Boulter sent out a Google Form with a mixture of icebreaker questions. A few examples included:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>What was your first online handle or email address?</li> \n <li>What course did you do the worst at college?</li> \n <li>What's the weirdest job you've ever had?</li> \n <li>What's your least favorite song?</li> \n <li>What's your favorite conspiracy theory?</li> \n <li>What's an unusual skill you have?</li> \n <li>Star Wars or Star Trek?</li> \n <li>Yanni or Laurel?</li> \n <li>If you could commit any crime and get away with it, what would it be?</li> \n <li>What's the worst gift you've ever received?</li> \n <li>Who would get eaten first if we all got stuck in the 1C elevator?</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Then, they used a free online trivia site called <a href=\"https://myquiz.org/\">MyQuiz</a>. Here, the answers were either picking one person from their squad (who's least favorite song is \"It's a Small World\", for example) or picking the correct answer amongst 3 other made-up answers. They ended up with 54 questions. See the picture below for what this looked like.</p> \n<div>\n <img src=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/How%20to%20Host%20a%20Virtual%20Holiday%20Party%20%26%20Bond%20With%20Your%20Team-1.png?width=319&amp;name=How%20to%20Host%20a%20Virtual%20Holiday%20Party%20%26%20Bond%20With%20Your%20Team-1.png\" alt=\"A virtual trivia game.\" width=\"319\" style=\"width: 319px; display: block; margin: 0px auto;\">\n</div> \n<p>Ultimately, planning a virtual holiday party takes some planning. But with a little research, you could end up with a fun, interactive game.</p> \n<p>As a remote leader, your holiday party can be just as fun and interactive as an in-person event.
