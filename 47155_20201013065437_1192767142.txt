A well-defined outcome provides a focal point for the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.producttalk.org/2018/10/continuous-discovery-mindsets/\">product team</a> and serves as a guiding light for their <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.producttalk.org/2017/02/evolution-product-discovery/\">discovery efforts</a>. It helps the team quickly identify and conserve their time and energy for the initiatives that matter most.</p>\n<p>However, when we begin to work with a new product team through our 12-week discovery coaching program, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.producttalk.org/coaching\">Continuous Discovery Habits</a>, we often find that teams are responsible for driving business outcomes. We rarely see teams that are responsible for driving product outcomes. To clarify the difference between these two terms: A business outcome is a metric that moves the business forward, while a product outcome is a metric that helps us understand if the product is moving the business forward.</p>\n<blockquote><p>A business outcome is a metric that moves the business forward, while a product outcome is a metric that helps us understand if the product is moving the business forward. – <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ctt.ac/bFB8A\">Tweet This</a></p></blockquote>\n<h2>Why Business Outcomes Are Often Assigned to Product Teams</h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_2395\" style=\"width: 560px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.producttalk.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Piggy-bank.jpeg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2395\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2395\" src=\"http://www.producttalk.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Piggy-bank.jpeg\" alt=\"A piggy bank with a hand dropping a coin into it.\" width=\"550\" height=\"367\" srcset=\"https://www.producttalk.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Piggy-bank.jpeg 550w, https://www.producttalk.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Piggy-bank-300x200.jpeg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2395\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Business outcomes are often assigned to product teams because they give executives and investors language to track their progress.</p></div>\n<p>Businesses exist to create a financial outcome for their investors.

He quotes <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Rumelt\">Richard Rumelt</a>, author of <em>Good Strategy Bad Strategy</em>: “Good strategy works by focusing energy and resources on one, or a very few, pivotal objectives whose accomplishment will lead to a cascade of favorable outcomes.”</p>\n<p>Many companies lack a defined strategy because executives, teams, and investors want to leave their options open for achieving their desired financial outcomes. They want to place multiple bets to achieve their financial goals, just like they would in a diversified portfolio investment strategy. But the lack of a focused strategy (where you will play, how you will compete, and why you will win) creates real tension for product teams. They need focus and clarity to wisely invest their finite time and resources. If they spread themselves too thin or invest in the wrong product changes, the team, their company, and its investors will bear the real opportunity costs of the path not chosen.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The lack of a focused strategy (where you will play, how you will compete, and why you will win) creates real tension for product teams.

By the time we see them, it&#8217;s too late to do anything about them.</p></div>\n<p>What is a lagging indicator? It’s something that already happened. By the time you see revenue (or a lack of it)—whether it&#8217;s in a dashboard, cash in the bank, or a cancellation notice from a churned customer—it&#8217;s too late to take corrective action. Your <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.producttalk.org/2018/10/continuous-discovery-mindsets/\">product team</a> or company already made the choices that led to this moment.</p>\n<p>Let’s focus on revenue as an example. If your company goal is to increase revenue, someone on the executive team must have a theory of how and why your revenue will increase. This should be captured in your company strategy—again, where you will play, how you will compete, and why you will win. All business is a bet on future human behavior, so leaders need to define whose behavior will change, how, and how will that lead to more revenue. Here are a few questions to help you imagine different scenarios:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Will you grow revenue because you will have more products to sell that capture more of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_addressable_market\">Total Addressable Market</a>?</li>\n<li>Will you grow revenue because you can command a higher price for your products this year vs. last but maintain your current win rate or conversion rate?</li>\n<li>Will you grow revenue because your company will take a share of new markets and new budgets/wallets?</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p>All business is a bet on future human behavior, so leaders need to define whose behavior will change, how, and how that will lead to more revenue. – <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ctt.ac/fh3cd\">Tweet This</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>Leaders must articulate their theory of which humans and/or which behaviors will change, resulting in an increase in revenue.</p>\n<p>Some human changes may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>People from new countries will buy (from US to UK/Australia/Canada).</li>\n<li>People who speak different languages will buy (from English to Spanish).</li>\n<li>We will sell into new customer segments (from SMBs to Enterprises or from parents to grandparents).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some behavior changes may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They buy sooner than they currently do so we earn revenue faster (this year instead of next year).</li>\n<li>They buy more (more products, more licenses, more months).</li>\n<li>They’ll spend more for the same product (they will pay more upon renewal or we can charge for trial access).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Leading indicators measure a specific change in behavior. And leading indicators eventually drive lagging indicators. If the company’s leaders aren’t sure or have many theories or wishes, then the product team has to do the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.producttalk.org/2017/02/evolution-product-discovery/\">discovery legwork</a> to identify the most likely human behavior changes that will positively impact the lagging business indicator. In this example, that would be revenue.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Leading indicators measure a specific change in behavior.

In his book <em>Outcomes Over Output</em>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.joshuaseiden.com/about\">Josh Seiden</a> recommends teams start with the question “What are the customer behaviors that drive business results?” This helps product teams because product outcomes become things people do, which are observable and measurable.</p>\n<p>That behavior-change paradigm shift enables product teams to translate each type of lagging business outcome into desired human behavior. That new or different human behavior becomes the product outcome that focuses the work of a product team.</p>\n<p>For another example, let&#8217;s imagine a product team working on a B2C subscription product. The executives&#8217; desired business outcome is “Reduce churn/Increase retention.” If the product team has customers on monthly recurring billing cycles, well-instrumented product analytics, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.producttalk.org/2017/02/evolution-product-discovery/\">continuous discovery</a> with their current and lost customers, they likely can see behaviors that indicate a customer is likely to churn.</p>\n<p>But what about a product team with longer renewal cycles, perhaps a B2B SaaS product on annual or multiyear contracts? This product team will have fewer clear signals because the events and decision to renew or not renew is made infrequently and could be the result of both in-product and out-of-product factors. The product team will likely need to explore both causal and correlated factors they can observe and influence that will also contribute to higher retention rates or reduced churn.</p>\n<p>This may appear in an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.producttalk.org/opportunity-solution-tree/\">opportunity solution tree</a> like this:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2392\" style=\"width: 560px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.producttalk.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1-Business_Outcomes_to_Opportunities_no_green-1.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2392\" class=\"wp-image-2392\" src=\"http://www.producttalk.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1-Business_Outcomes_to_Opportunities_no_green-1.jpg\" alt=\" An opportunity solution tree with the desired outcome of increasing customer retention.\" width=\"550\" height=\"250\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2392\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">An opportunity solution tree showing how a B2B SaaS company might increase retention and reduce churn. Click on the image to enlarge.</p></div>\n<p>The illustration reveals multiple factors which contribute to whether a customer is likely to churn or renew. This illustration can help focus a cross-functional leadership team who shares the business outcome goal to determine which leading indicator outcomes each functional team will own.</p>\n<p>In this example, let’s say the product team believes that the opportunities in green are most within their control or influence.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2394\" style=\"width: 560px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.producttalk.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/3-Business_Outcomes_to_Opportunities.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2394\" class=\"wp-image-2394\" src=\"http://www.producttalk.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/3-Business_Outcomes_to_Opportunities.jpg\" alt=\"An opportunity solution tree with the desired outcome of increasing customer retention.

This product team may decide that to achieve 25% improvement in retention they will rely on the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://blog.growthhackers.com/using-product-market-fit-to-drive-sustainable-growth-58e9124ee8db\">Product-Market Fit metric</a> as a means to understand which customers are likely to churn/retain. If this is a new concept for you, the Product-Market Fit (PMF) metric relies on a simple but powerful question to current users, “How would you feel if you could no longer use [Product name]?”</p>\n<p>Let’s assume our product team decides they need to move from 5/10 (baseline) customers who would be disappointed if they could no longer access the product to 7/10 (desired). By establishing this product outcome goal, the team starts to measure this sentiment at different points in their customer journey (just purchased, after first use, after heavy use or infrequent use, or after a critical event) to size and prioritize as a team. They begin to see opportunities to improve the product experience which will in turn drive the desired outcome, illustrated here:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2393\" style=\"width: 560px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.producttalk.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2-Product_Outcomes_to_Product_Opportunities.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2393\" class=\"wp-image-2393\" src=\"http://www.producttalk.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2-Product_Outcomes_to_Product_Opportunities.jpg\" alt=\"An opportunity solution tree with the desired outcome of increasing retention.

For example, customer churn resulting from customers going out of business will directly impact the retention outcome, but isn’t within the realm of influence for the product team.
