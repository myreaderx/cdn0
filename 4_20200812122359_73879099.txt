Google <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/30/20746885/google-android-auto-2019-review-features-app-phone\">previously removed the Calendar app from its last redesign in 2019</a>, replacing it with a button that simply read your appointments out loud using the Google Assistant instead of showing you anything on the screen.</p>\n<p id=\"Drfg6E\">The new update also adds relevant shortcuts to the Calendar app — so if you need to pick up a birthday cake, for instance, you will have the option to either call the bakery or pull up directions to get there.
