But I have found this harder to do with games. Most games are, obviously, a very interactive experience, and when the scares are happening to you, rather than someone you are watching, it is less conducive to comfortable toasty-toe Octobering. </p>\n<p>At the same time, I have been pootling around in <a href=\"http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game/the-sims-4\">The Sims 4</a>, restlessly starting and canning new builds in a fit of pique. But then I realised that my two interests can be combined: I can indulge in some classic horror, play a game at the same time, and I don&#8217;t even have to do any work because other Sims builders have already done it! That&#8217;s my favourite kind of work! And lo and behold, there are loads of recreations of famous scary buildings knocking about on <a href=\"https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/pc/gallery\">The Sims 4 Gallery</a>. I&#8217;ve linked a few of my favourites that I found below. Sure, you could search the gallery for them yourselves, but the gallery UI is the worst thing in the entire world, so this will save you time. </p>\n<p> <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2020/10/20/add-hill-house-and-the-bates-motel-to-the-sims-4-for-the-season-of-pumpkins/#more-901433\" class=\"more-link\"><span aria-label=\"Continue reading Add Hill House and the Bates Motel to The Sims 4 for the season of pumpkins\">(more&#8230;)</span></a></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?a=aynq0lD0-mc:EXZH1tPI2Nc:nQ_hWtDbxek\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=nQ_hWtDbxek\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?a=aynq0lD0-mc:EXZH1tPI2Nc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RockPaperShotgun/~4/aynq0lD0-mc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 16:00:13 +0000","feedId":46,"bgimg":"https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2020/10/the-sims-4-gary-oldman-dracula.jpg","linkMd5":"cd1b07dc481e3988644e5f92143a96b6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn53@2020_5/2020/10/20/16-11-39-614_702818b6d7fb0150.webp","destWidth":744,"destHeight":410,"sourceBytes":21557,"destBytes":15010,"author":"Alice Bell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2020/10/the-sims-4-gary-oldman-dracula.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn53@2020_5/2020/10/20/16-11-39-614_702818b6d7fb0150.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=nQ_hWtDbxek":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn20@2020_1/2020/10/20/16-11-40-767_4c56023a3ecf3679.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/RockPaperShotgun?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn25@2020_2/2020/10/20/16-11-40-870_8be694f2d9c61abe.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RockPaperShotgun/~4/aynq0lD0-mc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn28@2020_1/2020/10/20/16-11-40-849_f0db1d6de6d11509.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603210261529},{"createdTime":"2020-10-21 00:11:01","updatedTime":"2020-10-21 00:11:01","title":"The Sims 4 hits the slopes in new expansion Snowy Escape, with a trailer reveal today","link":"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/?p=901375","description":"<p><a href=\"https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2020/10/the-sims-4-snowy-escaper-header.jpg\"><img src=\"https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2020/10/the-sims-4-snowy-escaper-header.jpg\" alt=\"One of the Sims from the Snowy Escape Sims 4 DLC teaser.
