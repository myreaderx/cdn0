The new Butterfly iQ+ features better imaging capabilities, improved ergonomics, and longer battery life. Clinicians can utilize the portable, handheld ultrasound in a variety of situations and clinical fields to image the heart, lungs, bladder, and other organs and tissues. It even has Needle Viz technology that aids with imaging a needle during in-plane guided procedures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The entire ultrasound is the size of a conventional transducer and it relies on a smartphone for the controls and to display the images generated. This is thanks to the company&#8217;s &#8220;Ultrasound-on-Chip&#8221; technology that produces little noise while using a small amount of electricity. A new field programmable gate array that also eats little energy helps to keep the battery functioning longer. Overall, Butterfly Networks promises a 20% greater battery life and the new ultrasound can even function twice as long as the previous generation when used in certain presets. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/butterfly-iq.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1499289\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/butterfly-iq.jpg 466w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/butterfly-iq-256x300.jpg 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 466px) 100vw, 466px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>To improve the image, the Butterfly iQ+ uses digital micro-beam forming right on the chip to improve frame rates by 15% and achieve a 60% higher frequency of pulse repetition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The entire probe is 10% shorter and its probe head is 15% smaller than the previous generation Butterfly iQ.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since it&#8217;s expected to be used throughout the day by clinicians visiting multiple patients, as well as in the field, the new device has been tested to MIL-STD-810G, faring well after 4 foot drops and experiencing 100G shock pulses. It is also rated at IP67 for resilience against dust and water.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Two years ago, Butterfly introduced the world&#8217;s first handheld, single-probe, whole-body ultrasound system. Since then, the device has been used by tens of thousands of medical professionals across the globe with significant clinical, economic and societal impact,&#8221; said Laurent Faracci, Butterfly Network&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer, in the announcement. &#8220;We have collaborated with the Butterfly community of users to define our innovation path. The first result in that journey is the new Butterfly iQ+, a big step forward for point-of-care ultrasound, with our most advanced chip ever and a number of amazing innovations and improvements that our talented team and partners developed.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a video the manufacturer released introducing the new iQ+: </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Butterfly iQ+: Product Overview\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3yX6AUlgdT4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Product page: <a href=\"https://www.butterflynetwork.com/iq\">Butterfly iQ+</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Flashbacks: <a href=\"https://www.medgadget.com/2019/11/butterfly-network-expands-applications-for-smartphone-connected-ultrasound-interview.html\">Butterfly Network Expands Applications for Smartphone-Connected Ultrasound: Interview</a>; <a href=\"https://www.medgadget.com/2019/04/butterfly-iq-multi-purpose-pocket-sized-ultrasound-now-available-in-europe.html\">Butterfly iQ Multi-Purpose Pocket-Sized Ultrasound Now Available in Europe</a>; <a href=\"https://www.medgadget.com/2017/10/butterfly-iq-whole-body-ultrasound-fits-pocket.html\">Butterfly iQ, a Whole Body Ultrasound That Fits in a Pocket</a>; <a href=\"https://www.medgadget.com/2020/05/butterfly-teleguidance-for-remote-ultrasound-exams-during-covid-pandemic.html\">Butterfly TeleGuidance for Remote Ultrasound Exams During COVID Pandemic</a></p>\n<!--TrendMD v2.4.8--><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=d4b3uYl7Aag:2nX_c-BAT50:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=d4b3uYl7Aag:2nX_c-BAT50:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=d4b3uYl7Aag:2nX_c-BAT50:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=d4b3uYl7Aag:2nX_c-BAT50:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/d4b3uYl7Aag\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 07 Oct 2020 16:31:39 +0000","feedId":42,"bgimg":"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/iq.jpg","linkMd5":"1c019f78962ecf896e06cf5993bf5a58","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn63@2020_2/2020/10/09/03-32-43-869_2a4517d2881ac16d.webp","destWidth":770,"destHeight":513,"sourceBytes":253613,"destBytes":36194,"author":"Medgadget Editors","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/iq.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn63@2020_2/2020/10/09/03-32-43-869_2a4517d2881ac16d.webp","https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/butterfly-iq.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn6@2020_6/2020/10/09/03-33-22-268_749d1ad354d41d60.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn84@2020_6/2020/10/09/03-33-23-050_1c7ac23360fb6722.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn21@2020_3/2020/10/09/03-33-22-168_03dfa0a5030dd052.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=d4b3uYl7Aag:2nX_c-BAT50:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn68@2020_3/2020/10/09/03-33-22-233_ba24071bdd854567.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/d4b3uYl7Aag":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn87@2020_5/2020/10/09/03-33-23-083_0bf538afcc5983bf.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602214361698},{"createdTime":"2020-10-09 11:32:41","updatedTime":"2020-10-09 11:32:41","title":"Abbott’s Tiny Freestyle Libre 3 Cleared in EU","link":"https://www.medgadget.com/?p=1499012","description":"\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Libre-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1499023\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Libre-3.jpg 770w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Libre-3-300x199.jpg 300w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Libre-3-768x511.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Abbott has received CE Mark approval for the Freestyle Libre 3 continuous glucose monitor, meaning it can now be marketed in Europe. Abbott has substantially changed the design for the first time since the launch of the initial Freestyle Libre.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/libre-3-3-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1499025\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/libre-3-3-1.jpg 443w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/libre-3-3-1-300x155.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 443px) 100vw, 443px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The company claims that the Libre 3 is the thinnest and smallest continuous glucose monitor in the world, at the size of two stacked U.S. pennies. Being so small, it&#8217;s a lot more discreet than its predecessors. However, the price of the sensor has not changed, and Abbott aims to keep it affordable to maximize the number of people who can access and use the technology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Since we launched the first disposable glucose sensor in 2014, we&#8217;ve always believed all people with diabetes should have access to high-quality, accurate and affordable diabetes technologies,&#8221; said Jared Watkin, senior vice president, Diabetes Care, Abbott, in a press release about this latest European approval. &#8220;That&#8217;s why Abbott disrupted the traditional notion that CGMs have to sacrifice quality or accuracy for affordability, and we built our FreeStyle Libre family of products to deliver unparalleled results at a lower cost than any other CGM available.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/libre-3-app-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1499027\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/libre-3-app-1.png 466w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/libre-3-app-1-241x300.png 241w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 466px) 100vw, 466px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The sensor is self-applied to the skin on the back of the upper arm. Users can set up alarms on their smartphone so that they can be alerted when glucose levels are out of range, and can take a look at their phone at any time for a real-time glucose reading, which is updated every minute. The self-applied sensor provides readings for up to 14 days, which is longer than many other CGMs on the market, which typically top out at 10 days.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Abbott won&#8217;t stop innovating when there&#8217;s room to raise the bar. We&#8217;ve done that again with FreeStyle Libre 3, the smallest sensor that delivers life-changing benefits and best-in-class accuracy,&#8221; said Watkin. &#8220;People living with diabetes are at the center of our design process, and we made our next-generation technology even more discreet for a better user experience to make managing diabetes as easy and seamless as possible.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>See a video about the Freestyle Libre 3, below.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"FreeStyle Libre 3 System Receives CE Mark\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2QyepFDrPAo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Via: <a href=\"https://abbott.mediaroom.com/2020-09-28-Abbotts-FreeStyle-R-Libre-3-System-Receives-CE-Mark-Features-Worlds-Smallest-Thinnest-Sensor-with-Best-in-Class-Performance-at-the-Same-Low-Cost-for-People-with-Diabetes\">Abbott</a></p>\n<!--TrendMD v2.4.8--><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=cNaL6unMYpU:tFeKGziTqO8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=cNaL6unMYpU:tFeKGziTqO8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=cNaL6unMYpU:tFeKGziTqO8:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=cNaL6unMYpU:tFeKGziTqO8:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/cNaL6unMYpU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 05 Oct 2020 17:02:19 +0000","feedId":42,"bgimg":"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Libre-3.jpg","linkMd5":"f33de217c40ef539dad26b0818a23182","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn72@2020_4/2020/10/09/03-32-58-829_06377b2bfd29068f.webp","destWidth":770,"destHeight":512,"sourceBytes":300287,"destBytes":38548,"author":"Conn Hastings","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Libre-3.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn72@2020_4/2020/10/09/03-32-58-829_06377b2bfd29068f.webp","https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/libre-3-3-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn33@2020_3/2020/10/09/03-33-22-861_e2f1f1d8af20565b.webp","https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/libre-3-app-1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn45@2020_1/2020/10/09/03-33-22-184_d591ac9f8f33f40b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn84@2020_6/2020/10/09/03-33-23-050_1c7ac23360fb6722.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn21@2020_3/2020/10/09/03-33-22-168_03dfa0a5030dd052.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=cNaL6unMYpU:tFeKGziTqO8:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn61@2020_1/2020/10/09/03-33-22-153_c057d628f09a15df.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/cNaL6unMYpU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn99@2020_2/2020/10/09/03-33-22-169_5c7c7b8430d2a3ba.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602214361700},{"createdTime":"2020-10-09 11:32:41","updatedTime":"2020-10-09 11:32:41","title":"Sensor Rapidly Detects SARS-CoV-2, Antibodies, and Inflammatory Markers","link":"https://www.medgadget.com/?p=1498970","description":"\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/covid-sensor.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1498996\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/covid-sensor.jpg 770w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/covid-sensor-300x157.jpg 300w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/covid-sensor-768x402.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Researchers at Caltech have developed a low-cost multiplex test that can rapidly provide three different types of data on COVID-19. The test can detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2, antibodies against the virus (potentially indicating a level of immunity), and inflammatory markers that could indicate the severity of COVID-19. Using blood or saliva, the test can provide a result in as little as 10 minutes. The researchers hope that it could soon be used by people at home to assess their COVID-19 status.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing is a cornerstone in the fight against COVID-19, whether the test is to determine whether the virus is present, or to see whether someone may have immunity to it. However, testing supplies have been stretched in many countries, and getting access to a timely test can be challenging. Having easy-to-use tests that provide an immediate answer at home could help with the situation.  </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/covid-sensor-diagram.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1498998\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/covid-sensor-diagram.jpg 466w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/covid-sensor-diagram-300x206.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 466px) 100vw, 466px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>This challenge inspired researchers at Caltech to develop a new test that could potentially be used at home. Their new device can provide three different types of data for those worried that they may have COVID-19, or for those who wish to see whether they had it in the past.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Containing a porous graphene layer with a large surface area, the team’s sensor is highly sensitive to small amounts of the target molecules, meaning that a saliva or blood sample is sufficient, and it is not necessary to undergo invasive swabbing.

Approximately 15% of the population suffers from it, but the nature of this malady makes it difficult to study and find therapeutic options. Now, a multinational collaboration of researchers has shown that a neurostimulation system made by Neuromod Devices Limited, an Irish company, can significantly reduce the symptoms of tinnitus. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The technology is based on a finding that stimulating the trigeminal nerve, which scientists believe is related to the auditory system, seems to have an effect on tinnitus. Coupling this effect with delivering sounds into the ears that are within the frequency range of those that people hear during tinnitus, was the idea for the Lenire system from Neuromod Devices. Last year <a href=\"https://www.medgadget.com/2019/10/neuromodulation-for-tinnitus-relief-interview-with-neuromod-devices-ceo-dr-ross-oneill.html\">we interviewed</a> Dr. Ross O&#8217;Neill, the CEO of Neuromod Devices and one of the lead developers of the technology. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The system consists of Bluetooth headphones and an electrode device that attaches to the tongue. The tongue attachment is designed to stimulate the trigeminal nerve at the proper frequencies and at a low enough power level not to produce pain. Each therapy session lasts less than an hour as the tinnitus sufferer listens to different sounds emanating from the headphones and sucks on the &#8220;tongue tip&#8221;. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a newly released study of the Lenire system, involving more than 300 people with the condition, the researchers showed that more than 80% of the participants had an improvement in their tinnitus symptoms. Moreover, after a year of follow-up 80% still showed substantial improvements in how often they heard hearing in their ears. Although similar technologies have been tried in the past, this is the first time that such a substantial improvement has been noted over a long period of time.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/tonguetip.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1499401\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Study in <em>Science Translational Medicine</em>: <a href=\"https://stm.sciencemag.org/content/12/564/eabb2830\">Bimodal neuromodulation combining sound and tongue stimulation reduces tinnitus symptoms in a large randomized clinical study</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>More from <em>Science News</em>: <a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/10/electric-shocks-tongue-can-quiet-chronic-ringing-ears\">Electric shocks to the tongue can quiet chronic ringing ears</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Flashbacks: <a href=\"https://www.medgadget.com/2018/01/device-delivers-sound-electric-stimulation-reduce-tinnitus.html\">Device Delivers Sound and Electric Stimulation to Reduce Tinnitus</a>; <a href=\"https://www.medgadget.com/2014/03/video.html\">Electric Stimulator Guides Neuroplasticity to Treat Tinnitus</a>; <a href=\"https://www.medgadget.com/2011/01/electric_vagus_nerve_stimulation_show_promise_for_treatment_of_noiseinduced_tinnitus.html\">Electric Vagus Nerve Stimulation Shows Promise for Treatment of Noise-Induced Tinnitus</a>; <a href=\"https://www.medgadget.com/2014/12/mutebutton-multi-sensory-stimulation-system-to-treat-tinnitus.html\">Mutebutton Multi-Sensory Stimulation System to Treat Tinnitus</a>;</p>\n<!--TrendMD v2.4.8--><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=_DWQtOd7524:tPzawSRJm1c:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=_DWQtOd7524:tPzawSRJm1c:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=_DWQtOd7524:tPzawSRJm1c:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=_DWQtOd7524:tPzawSRJm1c:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/_DWQtOd7524\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 08 Oct 2020 19:14:21 +0000","feedId":42,"bgimg":"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/tongue-stimulation.jpg","linkMd5":"5c1c38715077429971eb70e9d0fbad7b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn48@2020_3/2020/10/09/03-33-00-448_817d1eee14384aae.webp","destWidth":770,"destHeight":573,"sourceBytes":261177,"destBytes":28972,"author":"Medgadget Editors","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/tongue-stimulation.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn48@2020_3/2020/10/09/03-33-00-448_817d1eee14384aae.webp","https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/tonguetip.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn96@2020_1/2020/10/09/03-33-22-110_86d8bf496982a619.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn84@2020_6/2020/10/09/03-33-23-050_1c7ac23360fb6722.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn21@2020_3/2020/10/09/03-33-22-168_03dfa0a5030dd052.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=_DWQtOd7524:tPzawSRJm1c:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn79@2020_3/2020/10/09/03-33-23-098_e414f881b5c8fc53.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/_DWQtOd7524":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn35@2020_5/2020/10/09/03-33-22-170_8780d950670ffa48.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602214361702},{"createdTime":"2020-10-09 11:32:41","updatedTime":"2020-10-09 11:32:41","title":"Electronic Blood Vessels to Replace Diseased Vasculature","link":"https://www.medgadget.com/?p=1499113","description":"\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/electronic-blood-vessels.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1499138\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/electronic-blood-vessels.jpg 770w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/electronic-blood-vessels-300x199.jpg 300w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/electronic-blood-vessels-768x511.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Researchers based in China and Switzerland have jointly developed electrically conductive artificial blood vessels that may serve as implants to replace diseased native vessels. The flexible and biodegradable constructs consist of a metal-polymer conductive membrane, and an electric current can be passed through the vessel when it is implanted in the body. The electric stimulation appears to encourage the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells, and may improve the integration of the implanted vessel with the surrounding tissue. It can also be used to deliver gene therapy or drugs into those tissues.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/new-blood-vessels-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1499140\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/new-blood-vessels-1.jpg 466w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/new-blood-vessels-1-232x300.jpg 232w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 466px) 100vw, 466px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Developing artificial replacements for diseased blood vessels is an active area of research within tissue engineering, especially given the huge toll that cardiovascular disease has on society. However, these constructs are typically passive in nature and can provoke inflammation in surrounding tissues, and so far they have not been able to adequately and safely replace native blood vessels. &#8220;None of the existing small-diameter tissue engineered blood vessels has met the demands of treating cardiovascular diseases,&#8221; said Xingyu Jiang, a researcher involved in creating the new devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The aim of this research was to create an artificial blood vessel with increased functionality, in the hope that this might make it more suitable for long-term implantation as a blood vessel replacement. &#8220;We take the natural blood vessel-mimicking structure and go beyond it by integrating more comprehensive electrical functions that are able to provide further treatments, such as gene therapy and electrical stimulation,&#8221; explained Jiang.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new artificial blood vessels consist of a cylindrical membrane that contains metal and a polymer, poly(L-lactide-co-ε-caprolactone). Strikingly, the electrical charge delivered by the construct can stimulate the migration and growth of endothelial cells, which should be helpful in allowing the vessels to integrate with the body. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The researchers also tested the vessels in their ability to deliver genetic material, since an electrical charge can help to make cell membranes more permeable, allowing DNA and RNA to enter them. When coupled with an electroporation device, the membrane successfully delivered genetic material into three different types of cells found in blood vessels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, the artificial blood vessels have been tested in rabbits and they functioned as a successful replacement for the carotid artery. The implanted constructs allowed sufficient blood flow, did not produce an inflammatory response, and did not show evidence of narrowing over a period of three months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In the future, optimizations need be taken by integrating it with minimized devices, such as minimized batteries and built-in control systems, to make all the functional parts fully implantable and even fully bio-degradable in the body,&#8221; said Jiang.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Study in <em>Matter:</em> <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/matter/fulltext/S2590-2385(20)30493-8?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2590238520304938%3Fshowall%3Dtrue#%20\">Electronic Blood Vessel</a></p>\n<!--TrendMD v2.4.8--><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=4gmKczD27lc:uITAefEmPTA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=4gmKczD27lc:uITAefEmPTA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=4gmKczD27lc:uITAefEmPTA:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=4gmKczD27lc:uITAefEmPTA:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/4gmKczD27lc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 06 Oct 2020 16:23:30 +0000","feedId":42,"bgimg":"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/electronic-blood-vessels.jpg","linkMd5":"122c8c1f42a727b4558d51c9d2b0a737","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn36@2020_1/2020/10/09/03-32-48-918_4d1ee326a831b649.webp","destWidth":770,"destHeight":512,"sourceBytes":128708,"destBytes":16992,"author":"Conn Hastings","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/electronic-blood-vessels.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn36@2020_1/2020/10/09/03-32-48-918_4d1ee326a831b649.webp","https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/new-blood-vessels-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn28@2020_6/2020/10/09/03-33-22-719_12ba6dd585e7fa7f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn84@2020_6/2020/10/09/03-33-23-050_1c7ac23360fb6722.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn21@2020_3/2020/10/09/03-33-22-168_03dfa0a5030dd052.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=4gmKczD27lc:uITAefEmPTA:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn47@2020_6/2020/10/09/03-33-22-284_583befe66b0b064d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/4gmKczD27lc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn32@2020_5/2020/10/09/03-33-22-279_80476c933910808c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602214361700},{"createdTime":"2020-10-09 11:32:41","updatedTime":"2020-10-09 11:32:41","title":"Jet Suit Paramedic Reaches Stricken Hikers in Seconds","link":"https://www.medgadget.com/?p=1498723","description":"\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/jet-suit-paramedic-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1498727\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/jet-suit-paramedic-2.jpg 770w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/jet-suit-paramedic-2-300x201.jpg 300w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/jet-suit-paramedic-2-768x515.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Arriving as quickly as possible to the site of a medical emergency is a critical goal for any paramedic.

Helicopters can fly around but landing is often a big challenge because of the uneven surfaces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The organization partnered with Gravity Industries, a company that develops jet suits, to test out the technology for emergency medical applications and as seen in the following video, there&#8217;s clearly a great deal of potential.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the experiment, &#8220;stricken&#8221; individuals were located about a 25 minute hike up a hill. Using the jet suit, a paramedic was able to reach them in less than two minutes, easily landing nearby on a rocky surface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The jet suit used has five turbines that generate more than 1,000 horsepower. It can reach 85 miles per hour and can be powered using either jet fuel or diesel. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a video showing how a jet suit paramedic would assist a medical emergency:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Paramedic Mountain Response!\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gtvCnZqZnxc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>More from the <em>BBC</em>:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><iframe src=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/av/embed/p08svj5w/54331994\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\"></iframe></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Via: <a href=\"https://www.greatnorthairambulance.co.uk/our-work/how-we-do-it/leading-innovation/jet-suit/\">Great North Air Ambulance Service</a></p>\n<!--TrendMD v2.4.8--><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=iN3lRPNDDOM:Lpsbida1f3o:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=iN3lRPNDDOM:Lpsbida1f3o:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=iN3lRPNDDOM:Lpsbida1f3o:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=iN3lRPNDDOM:Lpsbida1f3o:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/iN3lRPNDDOM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 29 Sep 2020 17:08:18 +0000","feedId":42,"bgimg":"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/jet-suit-paramedic-2.jpg","linkMd5":"a2c2e593dae2ae03979b79106c381a75","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn60@2020_1/2020/10/09/03-33-03-182_9cdd1a080263dd3e.webp","destWidth":770,"destHeight":516,"sourceBytes":328089,"destBytes":94548,"author":"Medgadget Editors","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/jet-suit-paramedic-2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn60@2020_1/2020/10/09/03-33-03-182_9cdd1a080263dd3e.webp","https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/jet-suit-on-ground-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn96@2020_1/2020/10/09/03-33-23-263_3cba8351d3cbd91e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn84@2020_6/2020/10/09/03-33-23-050_1c7ac23360fb6722.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn21@2020_3/2020/10/09/03-33-22-168_03dfa0a5030dd052.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=iN3lRPNDDOM:Lpsbida1f3o:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn82@2020_3/2020/10/09/03-33-22-125_c26733292f61dd06.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/iN3lRPNDDOM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn43@2020_3/2020/10/09/03-33-22-094_152c7d54315a4ac9.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602214361706},{"createdTime":"2020-10-09 11:32:41","updatedTime":"2020-10-09 11:32:41","title":"At-Home Clinical ECG: Now and After The Pandemic – Interview with Dr. Ruey-Kang Chang, CEO, QT Medical","link":"https://www.medgadget.com/?p=1499040","description":"<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\">\n  <img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/qt-device-full-package.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1499053\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/qt-device-full-package.jpg 700w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/qt-device-full-package-300x203.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" />\n </figure>\n</div> \n<p>Many fields of medicine are undergoing a transformation due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as patients are kept away from clinics as much as possible.

But receiving a clinical grade electrocardiogram (ECG) normally involves office visits, putting some of the most vulnerable at risk of exposure to the virus. Consumer devices simply don’t provide the complex signal information that the heart generates that cardiologists require to produce confident diagnoses.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.qtmedical.com/\">QT Medical</a>, a firm based outside of Los Angeles, California recently made available the PCA 500 system that allows patients themselves to conduct comprehensive ECG exams. The tracings that are produced rival those that are generated by hospital ECG machines, and so can be used just as reliably by cardiologists. Patients can conduct exams on their own at home and the data automatically shared with their doctors for a close review. QT Medical even setup a service called Xpress ECG that provides 12-lead ECG tests physicians can order for their patients to receive in the mail.</p> \n<p>We had a chance to speak with Dr. Ruey-Kang Chang, CEO of QT Medical, about the PCA 500 system, its capabilities, and what it can offer cardiologists working during the ongoing pandemic.</p> \n<p><strong><em>Medgadget:</em></strong> <em>QT Medical’s device allows patients to perform 12-lead ECG tracings on their own. What was the motivation behind this goal?</em></p> \n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <figure class=\"alignright size-large\">\n  <img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/dr-chang-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1499052\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/dr-chang-1.jpg 300w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/dr-chang-1-214x300.jpg 214w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" />\n </figure>\n</div> \n<p><strong>Dr. Ruey-Kang Chang, CEO of QT Medical:</strong> What we initially set out to do was to create an ECG system that is pediatric friendly, especially for babies. During the process of development, we found a better way to do a 12-lead ECG test, and reinvented the ECG with PCA 500 for the 21<sup>st</sup> century.&nbsp;We have two goals for our ECG: to&nbsp;set a new standard on how 12-lead ECG tests are performed, and to democratize 12-lead ECG to all patients who can benefit from personalized heart disease management.</p> \n<p><strong><em>Medgadget:</em></strong> <em>Compare the quality of tracings that a patient can produce using your device versus what a cardiologist can achieve at the hospital.</em></p> \n<p><strong>Dr. Chang:</strong> The market is filled with all kinds of single-lead ECG devices for personal use.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>There are also some that claim to be 12-lead, but use fewer electrodes and calculation algorithms to “create” a 12-lead ECG. PCA 500 is a true medical standard 12-lead ECG: not only do the electrode placements follow the AHA guidelines, the electrode sensors and materials are also of hospital quality.</p> \n<p>We conducted an “equivalence study” which showed that PCA 500 produced ECGs, read by 3 blinded cardiologists, no different than that of the Philips Pagewriter TC70. One of the comments we often get from cardiologists is that the signal quality from patients’ ECG recordings at home using PCA 500 are often better than ECGs performed by technicians in the hospital. </p> \n<p>Here are a few key points that illustrate why our ECG signal quality is better: First, a lot of noises and artifacts come from the cables and leadwires. Our electrode strip has no cable or leadwires. Second, when the chest electrodes are in one piece, they help to stabilize each other and decrease noises from muscles and movements. Third, we did extensive studies to identify noises from a home environment and created proprietary algorithms to remove the noises.</p> \n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <figure class=\"alignright size-large\">\n  <img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/recorder-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1499396\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/recorder-1.jpg 466w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/recorder-1-273x300.jpg 273w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 466px) 100vw, 466px\" />\n </figure>\n</div> \n<p><br><strong><em>Medgadget:</em></strong> <a href=\"https://www.medgadget.com/?p=1499040/Medgadget:\"></a><em>Please describe the workflow when using your device.</em></br></p> \n<p><strong>Dr. Chang:</strong> As said, PCA 500 is a medical grade 12-lead ECG for professional and for personal use. When PCA 500 is used in a physician’s office, it offers several advantages:</p> \n<ol type=\"1\">\n <li>Minimal personnel training is required, which also makes staffing easier;</li>\n <li>All ECGs are managed centrally in the cloud and digital copies of ECG reports in PDF are EMR compatible;</li>\n <li>Single-use pre-positioned electrodes eliminate the cables and leadwires, thus minimizing the risks for COVID transmission, and make disinfection of the ECG machine between patients much easier.</li>\n</ol> \n<p>In response to the surge of needs for telehealth and remote patient monitoring in the pandemic, we now offer the Xpress ECG service. Xpress ECG is an on-demand or periodic 12-lead ECG test the physician orders for his or her patients. First, the physician sets up an online dashboard account with QT Cloud at no cost.&nbsp;From the dashboard, the physician can order Xpress ECG tests and manage all the ECG studies and reports.&nbsp;When the physician’s office orders an Xpress ECG test for a patient, QT Medical receives the order and ships out an Xpress ECG kit, which includes a PCA 500 recorder, an electrode strip, printed instructions, and a postage-paid return envelope.&nbsp;When the patient completes the ECG test, the physician will receive a notification via email with a link to the dashboard. On the dashboard, the physician can review the ECG results, finalize the report, and make management decisions.</p> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">\n <img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/workflow-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1499394\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/workflow-2.jpg 770w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/workflow-2-300x114.jpg 300w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/workflow-2-768x291.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" />\n</figure> \n<p><strong><em>Medgadget:</em></strong> <em>How and for whom is it prescribed? What are the use cases?</em></p> \n<p><strong>Dr. Chang:</strong> PCA 500 is a medical standard 12-lead ECG that can be used in conventional healthcare settings such as clinics, urgent care centers, and nursing homes. There are many other places where a 12-lead ECG is needed, but often there is no trained personnel to perform the test, such as airlines, cargo ships, mining sites, oil rigs, remote locations, jails and prisons, schools and clinical trials. PCA 500 can fill the gap.&nbsp;</p> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">\n <img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/clinical-apps.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1499393\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/clinical-apps.jpg 770w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/clinical-apps-300x222.jpg 300w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/clinical-apps-768x569.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" />\n</figure> \n<p>There are many patients who benefit from using PCA 500 at home, but the cost may be prohibitive and insurance may not cover the purchase. To make PCA 500 accessible and affordable to patients, we believe Xpress ECG is the right solution. Xpress ECG is also the right 12-lead ECG solution for physicians who are starting or expanding their telehealth practice.&nbsp;For patients seen in virtual visits who need an ECG test, Xpress ECG delivers high quality 12-lead ECG tests in just a few days. Xpress ECG can be an alternative to ECG tests done in physician’s offices as well. Using Xpress ECG to get ECG tests done at a patient’s home instead of in the office will enhance workflow in clinic visits, reduce the risks for infection, and lower the cost.&nbsp;Furthermore, the reimbursement for Xpress ECG using CPT code 99457 is 3 times higher than the reimbursement for office ECG using CPT code 93000.&nbsp;Using the same code 99457, Xpress ECG can also be used for monthly remote patient monitoring.</p> \n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\">\n  <img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/PCA-500-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1499045\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/PCA-500-1.jpg 770w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/PCA-500-1-300x152.jpg 300w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/PCA-500-1-768x388.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" />\n </figure>\n</div> \n<p><strong><em>Medgadget:</em></strong> <em>How has the COVID-19 pandemic affected cardiac care of patients, and what is your technology’s role to address this now and in the post-pandemic future?</em></p> \n<p><strong>Dr. Chang:</strong> PCA 500 electrodes offer a new way of performing a 12-lead ECG test—the electrode placements will be fast, accurate, consistent and standardized. In addition to reducing variations, errors and personnel cost, the single-use PCA 500 electrodes with no cables greatly lower the risks for coronavirus transmission and the time spent on dis-infecting the equipment. We hope PCA 500 is not only an alternative to conventional ECGs in the pandemic, but it will become the standard for all 12-lead ECG testing in the future.</p> \n<p>Patients with heart disease are at much higher risks for COVID-related morbidity and mortality. It has been a challenge to many physicians to continue providing quality care while minimizing the risks of exposure to potential infection. Xpress ECG offers the solution to telecardiology visits and the increasing needs for remote patient monitoring. The need for a 12-lead ECG solution will go beyond the pandemic, as the importance and needs for telehealth, home care and monitoring continue to rise.</p> \n<p><strong><em>Medgadget:</em></strong> <em>Do you foresee that an app may one day be able to automatically review ECG tracings and provide analyses beyond spotting cardiac arrhythmias?</em></p> \n<p><strong>Dr. Chang:</strong> Excellent question! We currently provide preliminary ECG interpretation by computer algorithms which are cloud based.&nbsp;Once an ECG is done, the signals are sent to the user’s cloud account, and our cloud algorithms process the signals, filter out the noises, then measure and analyze the ECG patterns. The current algorithms can detect arrhythmias, such as afib, SVT, and structural findings, such as hypertrophy or ST segment elevation.&nbsp;We are now working on machine learning algorithms to make more accurate and extensive ECG analysis and interpretation.&nbsp;I believe a comprehensive 12-lead ECG assessment will not only be diagnostic but also prognostic or predictive in the future. With machine learning, ECGs will soon be able to detect ventricular dysfunction (measure ejection fraction), predict the risk for developing afib, heart attack, or heart failure in the short term and possibly even the long term.</p> \n<p><strong><em>Medgadget:</em></strong> <em>What challenges and opportunities do you foresee in bringing your technology to wider use?</em></p> \n<p><strong>Dr. Chang:</strong> The challenges are the same as everyone else, needing more time and money. It is more so in the tech startup because you are running against the clock, trying to get things done before the money runs out, or before competing products emerge in the market.Our biggest challenges in the market are the amount of efforts needed to educate the doctors and patients, raise brand awareness and demonstrate product effectiveness in improving patient outcomes. We are creating a new product category—12-lead ECG for personal use, which is our biggest opportunity as a market disruptor.</p> \n<p><strong><em>Medgadget:</em></strong> <em>Is it challenging for ECG device companies to scale in revenue?</em> </p> \n<p><strong>Dr. Chang:</strong> Yes, there are challenges to scale in revenue. Since the ECG is a century-old technology, the differentiation among products often is not so clear; there are also many ECG players out there. Thus, establishing a trustable brand among industry giants such as GE and Philips is a huge obstacle but not insurmountable. As said, we will initially focus on certain niche markets, to generate more product traction and raise brand awareness, then gradually establish ourselves penetration of Xpress ECG into the mass market.</p> \n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n <figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\">\n  <img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/divider-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1499041\" />\n </figure>\n</div> \n<p>Here’s a video showing how to do a personal ECG using the PCA 500:</p> \n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\">\n <div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\"> \n  <iframe title=\"How to Record an ECG with PCA 500\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/447071441?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay;

The system uses magnets to provide a stretching force on a 3D culture of breast cancer cells, and the researchers hope that the technology could lead to new insights into metastases and how to treat them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The mechanical forces acting on a cell can have significant effects. Certain tissues are in near constant motion, such as the heart and lungs, providing a unique environment for the cells that grow there. This is of interest to scientists in the context of cancer metastases, in which cancer cells migrate to distant tissues and then begin to proliferate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;One of the key features of breast cancer is that most patients survive if the disease stays local, but there is a greater than 70% drop in survival if the cells have metastasized,&#8221; said Luis Solorio, a researcher involved in the study. &#8220;However, once the cells leave the primary tumor, they are often no longer responsive to the drugs that initially worked for the patient. We wanted to develop a system that could help us better understand how the physiology of a new tissue space effected tumor cells upon invasion into the new organ.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The researchers developed a cell culture device to mimic a breast cancer metastatic tumor in the lungs, in which tissue undergoes repeated stretching forces during breathing. Their device includes a 3D culture of breast cancer cells grown on an extracellular matrix protein that is commonly found in early-stage lung metastases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using magnets, the system applies strain to the cultured cells, at the amplitude and rate that occurs in the lungs during breathing. Interestingly, the breast cancer cells stopped growing when cultured under this actuation regimen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Never before has the concept of motion been interrogated as a component of the tumor microenvironment,&#8221; said Michael Wendt, another researcher involved in the study. &#8220;We now understand that healthy organs utilize motion to resist metastatic colonization. The development of this microactuator system will not only continue to yield increased biological understanding, of metastasis, but it will also serve as a platform for us to better evaluate pharmacological inhibitors of the most lethal aspect of cancer progression.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Study in <em>Advanced Functional Materials</em>: <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adfm.202005021?_ga=2.114061189.328572185.1602068729-902306429.1573726861\">High‐Throughput Magnetic Actuation Platform for Evaluating the Effect of Mechanical Force on 3D Tumor Microenvironment</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Via: <a href=\"https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2020/Q4/novel-testing-platform-designed-for-breast-cancer-cells.html\">Purdue</a></p>\n<!--TrendMD v2.4.8--><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=9HGHXEo5OCA:c2Vss93uIhU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=9HGHXEo5OCA:c2Vss93uIhU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=9HGHXEo5OCA:c2Vss93uIhU:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=9HGHXEo5OCA:c2Vss93uIhU:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/9HGHXEo5OCA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 07 Oct 2020 14:05:19 +0000","feedId":42,"bgimg":"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/cyclic-actuation-1.jpg","linkMd5":"2491cfd3081915fbd8b21dc4f44c94cd","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn39@2020_3/2020/10/09/03-32-41-934_1159aa23692d613e.webp","destWidth":446,"destHeight":411,"sourceBytes":205367,"destBytes":41304,"author":"Conn Hastings","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/cyclic-actuation-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn39@2020_3/2020/10/09/03-32-41-934_1159aa23692d613e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn84@2020_6/2020/10/09/03-33-23-050_1c7ac23360fb6722.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn21@2020_3/2020/10/09/03-33-22-168_03dfa0a5030dd052.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=9HGHXEo5OCA:c2Vss93uIhU:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn99@2020_1/2020/10/09/03-33-23-153_d08fb5011fef0b2f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/9HGHXEo5OCA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn90@2020_3/2020/10/09/03-33-22-067_88268146bd790e0a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602214361702},{"createdTime":"2020-10-09 11:32:41","updatedTime":"2020-10-09 11:32:41","title":"FDA Clears Masimo’s Go Anywhere Pulse Oximeter and Respiration Rate Monitor","link":"https://www.medgadget.com/?p=1498862","description":"\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/masimo-measuring.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1498863\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/masimo-measuring.jpg 400w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/masimo-measuring-149x300.jpg 149w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Masimo won FDA clearance for its Rad-G pulse oximeter, a rugged device developed with the help of The Bill &#38; Melinda Gates Foundation. Originally created to spot-check patients for SpO2 (oxygen saturation), respiration rate from the plethysmograph (RRp), pulse rate (PR), perfusion index (Pi), and pleth variability index (PVi<sup>®</sup>), this latest generation of the Rad-G allows for continuous monitoring as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to the new Rad-G sensor, the oximeter can be used on both adults and children, allowing the same device to be used on all patients without having to switch the sensor. However, the Rad-G can use any of Masimo&#8217;s other disposable or reusable patient sensors, so its applications go beyond what initially comes in the box.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The batteries inside the device allow it to work continuously for 24 hours, something particularly useful for emergency response, field applications, and in low-resource settings where electricity may not be available. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A rubber wrapping protects the Rad-G from damage and because it&#8217;s light and compact it can be taken and used just about anywhere, including field emergencies, physician offices, long-term care facilities, and outpatient settings. Clinicians can set audible alarms and monitor the continuous pleth waveform on the high-resolution display, as well as check the other patient parameters that the device can keep track of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;With the Rad-G Pulse Oximeter, we set out to create an accessible, high-quality care solution that clinicians can rely on in a multitude of care settings,&#8221; said Joe Kiani, CEO of Masimo. &#8220;We are bringing our expertise in pulse oximetry to a smaller, more lightweight, rugged, and versatile handheld device – without sacrificing any of the advantages that help provide clinicians with critical insights into patient status. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, it&#8217;s more imperative than ever that caregivers have access to the most accurate and reliable pulse oximetry monitoring technologies. We are proud to offer Rad-G among our suite of solutions powered by the breakthrough technology, SET<sup>®</sup> pulse oximetry.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Via: <a href=\"https://www.masimo.com/company/news/news-media/#1272452b-5f46-4c21-8381-4fdfb7e6dd24\">Masimo</a></p>\n<!--TrendMD v2.4.8--><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=kR1BZB56N-c:-ZYH5miOL3c:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=kR1BZB56N-c:-ZYH5miOL3c:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=kR1BZB56N-c:-ZYH5miOL3c:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=kR1BZB56N-c:-ZYH5miOL3c:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/kR1BZB56N-c\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 01 Oct 2020 14:48:00 +0000","feedId":42,"bgimg":"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/masimo-measuring.jpg","linkMd5":"9b7420160548b4def6f37f086cd59e79","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn68@2020_5/2020/10/09/03-32-42-747_c3b9e5bb91782885.webp","destWidth":400,"destHeight":803,"sourceBytes":104141,"destBytes":20214,"author":"Medgadget Editors","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/masimo-measuring.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn68@2020_5/2020/10/09/03-32-42-747_c3b9e5bb91782885.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn84@2020_6/2020/10/09/03-33-23-050_1c7ac23360fb6722.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn21@2020_3/2020/10/09/03-33-22-168_03dfa0a5030dd052.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=kR1BZB56N-c:-ZYH5miOL3c:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn54@2020_5/2020/10/09/03-33-22-185_751ad497267702f9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/kR1BZB56N-c":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn14@2020_5/2020/10/09/03-33-22-121_12c9fba627f29f1d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602214361705},{"createdTime":"2020-10-09 11:32:41","updatedTime":"2020-10-09 11:32:41","title":"True Digital Surgery’s Robotic Digital Microscopy: Interview with Chairman and CEO Aidan Foley","link":"https://www.medgadget.com/?p=1498875","description":"\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Aesculap-Aeos-Photo-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1498882\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Aesculap-Aeos-Photo-1.jpg 770w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Aesculap-Aeos-Photo-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Aesculap-Aeos-Photo-1-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.aesculapusa.com/en/healthcare-professionals/or-solutions/Aesculap-Aeos-digital-microscope.html\">Aesculap Aeos Robotic Digital Microscope</a> from <a href=\"https://www.truedigitalsurgery.com/\">True Digital Surgery</a> and <a href=\"https://www.aesculapusa.com/en.html\">Aesculap</a> is now available in the United States.

One of the most relevant features is the heads-up video display, which helps to unify the surgical team by allowing everyone in the O.R. to see the procedure in 3D on a 4K resolution monitor. The TDS display also relieves ergonomic stress on the surgeon by removing the need to look into eyepieces that require him/her to move with the microscope. Aeos seamlessly integrates a digital microscope, fluorescence imaging, a six-degree-of-freedom robotic arm, and multiple means of remote control, all in one compact mobile cart. Additionally, robotic-assisted features that include location presets called WayPoints allow automated camera relocation to and from preset locations. The Lock-to-Target feature enables manual adjustment of the microscope position while maintaining focus on a surgical point of interest. Surgeons are also able to blend 3D surface views and sub-visible structures using Aeos’s advanced fluorescence imaging capability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Medgadget: </em></strong><em>What are the advantages of a digital microscopy system compared with a traditional optical system?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Aidan Foley:</strong> The Aesculap Aeos overcomes critical limitations of traditional optical systems. First and foremost, Aeos digital microscopy leverages HDR image processing. This enhanced visual range increases the surgeon’s ability to simultaneously see both light and dark details which is critical to imaging deep cavities typical in brain surgery. Furthermore, the Aeos removes the need for the surgeon to look directly into the microscope oculars which can require the surgeon’s head to stay in very non-ergonomic positions and lead to long term back pain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Medgadget:</em></strong><em> How does the system facilitate surgery in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/group-microscope-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1498886\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/group-microscope-1.jpg 466w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/group-microscope-1-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 466px) 100vw, 466px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Aidan Foley:</strong> In the current COVID-19 environment, the use of personal protective equipment, or PPE can be crucial.

While surgeons can’t wear face shields when using an optical microscope, the Aeos system allows them to do so without issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Medgadget: </em></strong><em>Surgeons can frequently experience back pain after a long day of surgery. How does the system help with surgical ergonomics?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Aidan Foley:</strong> Back pain has been an issue with surgeons for years, and is therefore a consideration among surgeons who use operating microscopes. The Aeos system is a game changer in this respect because it utilizes a heads-up display instead of traditional microscope oculars, freeing the surgeon to position his head in a comfortable and ergonomic position throughout the surgical procedure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Medgadget: </em></strong><em>Please tell us about your collaboration with Aesculap, Inc.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Aidan Foley:</strong> Aesculap is a highly respected medical device company with a history dating back over 150 years. It’s a division of B. Braun, the renowned global organization founded in 1839. They are our distribution partner on a global basis for neurosurgery, ENT and spine. In addition, their longstanding relationships have provided input that has helped TDS refine many aspects of the Aeos system and will continue to do so for many years to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>TDS’s novel image processing techniques enhance dynamic range, differentiate colors of clinical interest and improve adaptation to constantly-changing scene conditions. The combination of TDS’s expertise in digital image processing, robotics and display technology with Aesculap’s clinical experience has led to truly outstanding results. The 3D image on the Aeos heads-up 4K monitor display is useful in microsurgery which is evident by recent sales successes against large well-established surgical microscope players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Medgadget: </em></strong><em>How will this latest launch in the US market help with increasing the reach and influence of the system?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Aidan Foley:</strong> The U.S. is clearly one of the largest medical device markets in the world, so we are obviously thrilled to be launching here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to its market size, the U.S. is also home to many key opinion leaders. Getting the support of these KOLs, based at established medical facilities as well as at teaching hospitals, will have a tremendous impact on earning market share. Our goal is to earn the trust of these respected professionals who wield significant influence on strategic advancements in surgical technology at their institutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/divider.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1498878\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Product page: <a href=\"https://www.aesculapusa.com/en/healthcare-professionals/or-solutions/Aesculap-Aeos-digital-microscope.html\">Aesculap Aeos digital microscope</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Links: <a href=\"https://www.truedigitalsurgery.com/\">True Digital Surgery</a> and <a href=\"https://www.aesculapusa.com/en.html\">Aesculap</a>&#8230;</p>\n<!--TrendMD v2.4.8--><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=IBHRyTxzD-g:yVA4SyE8S74:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=IBHRyTxzD-g:yVA4SyE8S74:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?a=IBHRyTxzD-g:yVA4SyE8S74:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=IBHRyTxzD-g:yVA4SyE8S74:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/IBHRyTxzD-g\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 01 Oct 2020 20:40:01 +0000","feedId":42,"bgimg":"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Aesculap-Aeos-Photo-1.jpg","linkMd5":"7c988bc50038c29c60a9998c810d0961","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn43@2020_2/2020/10/09/03-32-48-395_d35ac2314e4932d2.jpg","destWidth":0,"destHeight":0,"sourceBytes":2526144,"destBytes":2526144,"author":"Conn Hastings","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Aesculap-Aeos-Photo-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn43@2020_2/2020/10/09/03-32-48-395_d35ac2314e4932d2.jpg","https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/aesculap-microscope-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn39@2020_4/2020/10/09/03-33-22-951_da1933b69efe7d60.webp","https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Aidan-Foley-Headshot.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn70@2020_2/2020/10/09/03-33-22-226_38aa370c9f8118ba.webp","https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn64@2020_6/2020/10/09/03-33-22-278_5ae013c0eecc399e.webp","https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/group-microscope-1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn52@2020_5/2020/10/09/03-33-24-231_604a575bb4aa4b94.webp","https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/divider.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn20@2020_2/2020/10/09/03-33-22-189_16f1dcef611ef5e2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn84@2020_6/2020/10/09/03-33-23-050_1c7ac23360fb6722.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn21@2020_3/2020/10/09/03-33-22-168_03dfa0a5030dd052.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/Medgadget?i=IBHRyTxzD-g:yVA4SyE8S74:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn75@2020_4/2020/10/09/03-33-22-319_0331c23e6bd6db63.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Medgadget/~4/IBHRyTxzD-g":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn78@2020_1/2020/10/09/03-33-22-066_b2cb015779efe9b5.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602214361706},{"createdTime":"2020-10-09 11:32:41","updatedTime":"2020-10-09 11:32:41","title":"Discovery of Hepatitis C Wins Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine","link":"https://www.medgadget.com/?p=1499007","description":"\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/nobel-medicine.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1499008\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/nobel-medicine.jpg 209w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/nobel-medicine-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 209px) 100vw, 209px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Medgadget </em>would like to congratulate Harvey J. Alter, Michael Houghton, and Charles M. Rice on receiving the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work in discovering the hepatitis C virus. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hepatitis C, a virus that infects liver cells and causes inflammation, certain cancers, and lymphomas, is fairly widespread among certain groups of people, and until its discovery it was impossible to screen donated blood for its presence. People were getting infected with something that resembled hepatitis B, but screening for hepatitis B would not detect this still unknown agent. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the National Institutes of Health, the hepatitis A virus was identified and it was also shown, though not identified, by Harvey J. Alter that another infectious agent was responsible for other cases of hepatitis. Alter also showed, that this agent was able to infect chimpanzees and that it was probably a virus as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/discovery-of-hep-c.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1499018\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/discovery-of-hep-c.jpg 770w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/discovery-of-hep-c-300x107.jpg 300w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/discovery-of-hep-c-768x274.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This virus was eventually isolated by a team headed by Michael Houghton at a firm called Chiron Corporation, based in Emeryville, California. This team was able to identify unique cloned viral DNA fragments produced by antibodies of chimpanzees infected by the virus. These fragments were shown to come from the viral <em>Flavivirus</em> family and this particular virus was now known as hepatitis C.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/hepatitis-types.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1499019\" srcset=\"https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/hepatitis-types.jpg 770w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/hepatitis-types-300x185.jpg 300w, https://www.medgadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/hepatitis-types-768x474.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To actually confirm that nothing else causes this type of hepatitis, it took Charles M. Rice and a group at Washington University in St. Louis. As the Nobel Committee describes, researchers identified a &#8220;previously uncharacterized region in the end of the Hepatitis C virus genome that they suspected could be important for virus replication. Rice also observed genetic variations in isolated virus samples and hypothesized that some of them might hinder viral replication. Through genetic engineering, Rice generated an RNA variant of the Hepatitis C virus that included the newly defined region of the viral genome and was devoid of the inactivating genetic variations. When this RNA was injected into the liver of chimpanzees, virus was detected in the blood and pathological changes resembling those seen in humans with the chronic disease were observed.&#8221; This confirmation of the new virus being the only cause of the disease allowed for safe blood screenings and for therapies to finally be developed. These days there are drugs available that completely cure the disease in most patients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a video of the formal announcement of the prize:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure
