For example, adding a Vacation doesn't make sense if you can't link it to the relevant user. Now, you can just add the assigned role field into the Quick Add form, like so:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.targetprocess.com/content/uploads/2021/03/RoleInQuickAdd.gif\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-133622\" src=\"https://www.targetprocess.com/content/uploads/2021/03/RoleInQuickAdd.gif\" alt=\"RoleInQuickAdd\" width=\"800\" height=\"434\" data-zoom=\"https://www.targetprocess.com/content/uploads/2021/03/RoleInQuickAdd.gif\" data-zoom-size=\"[800,434]\" /></a></p>\n<h2>Inbound/Outbound terminology for Relations</h2>\n<p>Now, records for Relations changes in the History tab use Inbound/Outbound terms, instead of confusing and technical Master/Slave:<br clear='none'/>\n<a href=\"https://www.targetprocess.com/content/uploads/2021/03/Screenshot-2021-03-09-at-17.11.49.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-133615\" src=\"https://www.targetprocess.com/content/uploads/2021/03/Screenshot-2021-03-09-at-17.11.49.png\" alt=\"history\" width=\"2116\" height=\"818\" data-zoom=\"https://www.targetprocess.com/content/uploads/2021/03/Screenshot-2021-03-09-at-17.11.49.png\" data-zoom-size=\"[2116,818]\" /></a></p>\n<p>MasterRelations and SlaveRelations objects are taken from the data model meta for the <a href=\"https://md5.tpondemand.com/api/v1/relations/meta\" target=\"_blank\">Relation</a> entity. Now, in Advanced Filters, Visual Encoding rules, custom calculation formulas, and API expressions, please use InboundRelations and OutboundRelations objects instead. Don't worry, all existing filters, rules, formulas, etc., that use MasterRelations and SlaveRelations objects will still work, as we have updated these objects, not removed them at all.</p>\n<h2>Rename existing quick filters</h2>\n<p>Sometimes, the automatically generated name of a quick filter does not reflect its real purpose. Now, you can remedy this by renaming the quick filter. To do this, open the quick filter's setup -&#62; go to the Advanced mode -&#62; update the Name field to the desired name. Note that you no longer have to change a placeholder in filter fields below the Name, as we've untied the filter name from it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.targetprocess.com/content/uploads/2021/03/Rename-Filter.gif\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-133627\" src=\"https://www.targetprocess.com/content/uploads/2021/03/Rename-Filter.gif\" alt=\"Rename quick filter\" width=\"800\" height=\"520\" data-zoom=\"https://www.targetprocess.com/content/uploads/2021/03/Rename-Filter.gif\" data-zoom-size=\"[800,520]\" /></a></p>\n<h2>Multiple selection in filters</h2>\n<p>You may find checkboxes located to the right of the values in Project and Teams selectors and quick filters. When clicking them, the filter will act as a multiple selection field, so that you can select more than 1 item while the popup remains open, until you click outside it. You don't need to hold the Ctrl key anymore. Single selection is more preferable, which is why we've left this behavior by default and didn't place the checkboxes in a familiar place to the left of the values:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.targetprocess.com/content/uploads/2021/03/Quick-filters-multiselect.gif\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-133634\" src=\"https://www.targetprocess.com/content/uploads/2021/03/Quick-filters-multiselect.gif\" alt=\"Multiselection in quick filters\" width=\"800\" height=\"555\" data-zoom=\"https://www.targetprocess.com/content/uploads/2021/03/Quick-filters-multiselect.gif\" data-zoom-size=\"[800,555]\" /></a></p>\n<h2>Minor improvements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Now, there is no need to open a view or a dashboard to clone it.
