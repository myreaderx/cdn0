To make it easier to find information about how and where to vote—regardless of your preferred voting method—we’ve launched <a href=\"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/civics/update-our-2020-us-election-efforts/\">election-related features</a> with information from trusted and authoritative organizations in Google Search.  </p><br/><p>Starting today, when you go to Google Search and Maps for information on where to vote, you’ll find helpful features that show the voting locations closest to you. On Google, search for things like “early voting locations” or “ballot drop boxes near me” and you'll find details on where you can vote in person or return your mail-in ballot, whether you're voting early or on Election Day. It will also include helpful reminders, like to bring your ballot completed and sealed. </p><br/><p>Just as easily, you’ll soon be able to ask, “Hey Google, where do I vote?” and Google Assistant will share details on where to vote nearby on your Assistant-enabled phone, smart speaker or Smart Display.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"Where to vote.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Elections2020_W2V_SF_10_wZDgT0Q.gif\"/></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>After you’ve selected a voting location or ballot drop box in your area, you can click through from Google Search or Google Assistant to Google Maps for quick information about how far it is, how to get there, and voting hours. Similarly, if you search for your voting location in Google Maps you’ll have easy access to the feature in Search to help you confirm where you can cast your vote. </p><br/>The official information in this feature comes from the <a href=\"https://www.votinginfoproject.org/about\">Voting Information Project</a>, a partnership between <a href=\"https://www.democracy.works/about\">Democracy Works</a>, a nonprofit, nonpartisan civic organization, and state election officials. Through the Voting Information Project, we plan to have more than 200,000 voting locations available across the country. For places where voting locations are not yet available, we’ll surface state and local election websites. As more locations become available, or if there are changes, we’ll continue to update the information provided across Google Search, Assistant and Maps.</div></div></body></html><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/InsideSearch/~4/AMerN6dcskE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 10:00:00 +0000","feedId":9463,"bgimg":"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Elections2020_W2V_SF_10_wZDgT0Q.gif","linkMd5":"cab4e29658b304836b0826f27ce2ee41","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Elections2020_W2V_SF_10_wZDgT0Q.gif":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/InsideSearch/~4/AMerN6dcskE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn46@2020_4/2020/10/16/17-09-34-242_d7d5cef6f395e3ec.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1602868052299}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-10-17 01:07:32","updatedTime":"2020-10-17 01:07:32","feedId":9463,"fetchDate":"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 17:07:32 +0000","fetchMs":714,"handleMs":15,"totalMs":274406,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":20,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"2f2e31f84110f5c573417212a13762a1","hostName":"us-010*","requestId":"9d1927a7343843cdab27149355936b0d_9463","contentType":"text/xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":72,"bgimgsTotal":1,"bgimgsGithubTotal":0,"articlesImgsTotal":2,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":1,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx25":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 04:35:08","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:01:32","id":9463,"name":"Search","url":"http://insidesearch.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default","subscriber":null,"website":null,"icon":"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Search_logo.max-100x100.png","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx61/cdn19@2020_4/2020/09/05/08-01-27-186_4f895ce62f4fc57f.png","description":"Search","weekly":null,"link":null},"noPictureArticleList":[{"createdTime":"2020-10-17 01:12:05","updatedTime":"2020-10-17 01:12:05","id":null,"feedId":9463,"linkMd5":"cab4e29658b304836b0826f27ce2ee41"}],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":72,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1602868051565,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":719,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":15,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":121705,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"},{"spend":151878,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"}]},"extra5":2,"extra6":1,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[null,null,null,null,null,null],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{"http://europe66.herokuapp.com/":{"failCount":1,"successCount":1,"resultList":[200,null]},"http://us-003.herokuapp.com/":{"failCount":1,"successCount":0,"resultList":[null]}},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[{"code":1,"isDone":false,"source":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/InsideSearch/~4/AMerN6dcskE","sourceStatusCode":200,"destWidth":1,"destHeight":1,"fixedGithubDest":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn46@2020_4/2020/10/16/17-09-34-242_d7d5cef6f395e3ec.webp","sourceBytes":43,"destBytes":72,"targetWebpQuality":75,"feedId":9463,"totalSpendMs":885,"convertSpendMs":4,"createdTime":"2020-10-17 01:09:34","host":"europe66*","referer":"https://blog.google/products/search/find-voting-and-ballot-drop-box-locations-google/","linkMd5ListStr":"cab4e29658b304836b0826f27ce2ee41","githubUser":"myreaderx25","githubHttpCode":201,"extra22GetBytesInfo":"1、没有Referer字段","extra23historyStatusCode":[200],"sourceSize":"43 B","destSize":"72 B","compressRate":"167.4%"}],"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx25":1},"failGithubMap":{}}
