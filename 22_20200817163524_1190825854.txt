It was as succinct as \"she's mostly a German Shepherd\" and \"she's clear of all the health risks we check for\" and as granular as links to learn how the process is done and breakdowns of what each genetic condition is as well as which breeds it's commonly found in. There are even linked citations in some sections where research was referred to.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Embark dog DNA test is not cheap at $149 ($199 regularly priced), but it's information that could improve or extend the life of your dog &mdash; and for most owners, that's not a bad price to pay.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>All in all, it's a great tool &mdash; and something most dog owners will probably be excited to learn about. Pets are the slobbery, warm-bodied, loving beings that occasionally care more for you than they do for themselves. Figuring out a bit more about how to responsibly return that love and care is an exciting new opportunity.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you have multiple dogs and get tests for them, you can \"add a dog\" to your \"my dogs\" section in your account to keep your family all in one place.</p>\n<h3>Keep reading to see our experience and our dog's results below.&nbsp;</h3><h3>Embark's main point of interest is probably the breed breakdown.

Nearly 1,200 people have to quarantine in Cherokee County, Georgia, after a second grader tested positive for coronavirus, as reported by <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/12/us/georgia-school-coronavirus.html\">The New York Times</a>.</p>\n<p>But the problem may even get worse.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/doctor-schools-reopen-fall-likely-closed-by-end-of-october-2020-8?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=referral\">Business Insider's Lauren Frias</a> interviewed an emergency medicine physician who said because of combination of the coming fall and winter flu season with COVID-19, schools may have to close again as soon as October, citing increased exposure during flu season. The physician also notes the two viruses also share similar symptoms, such as coughing, that could make it harder to identify what a patient has. Per <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2019-01-25/schools-close-as-flu-season-progresses\">US News &amp; World Report,</a> some schools had to close for a few days last year due to a large number of student absences during flu season.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Schools are trying to find safe ways to have students return in person, from <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/nyc-public-schools-plan-to-open-partially-in-the-fall-2020-7?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=referral\">New York City</a> attempting a hybrid model to a school district in Detroit trying out outdoor classrooms, according to reporting by <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/education/tents-yurts-snowsuits-schools-seeking-alternativess-remote-learning-move-classes-n1235809?utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Issue:%202020-08-07%20K-12%20Education%20Dive%20Newsletter%20%5Bissue:28963%5D&amp;utm_term=Education%20Dive:%20K12\">NBC News</a>.</p>\n<p>A review of over 470 school districts conducted by the <a href=\"https://www.educationdive.com/news/just-over-half-of-districts-plan-some-level-of-in-person-instruction-for-fa/582994/?utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Issue:%202020-08-07%20K-12%20Education%20Dive%20Newsletter%20%5Bissue:28963%5D&amp;utm_term=Education%20Dive:%20K12\">Center on Reinventing Public Education</a> found about 40% of districts plan for in-person learning and about 12% plan a hybrid model, while more than half of city school districts plan to teach only remotely at least for one grade level. The report found about 62% of districts will also offer a remote learning option.</p>\n<p>Not every parent is ready to send their child back to school. A survey of 500 parents by Echelon Insights and the <a href=\"https://nationalparentsunion.org/npu-polling/\">National Parents Union</a>&nbsp;found that only 27% feel safe having their child return to in-person school this August or September. Of the parents surveyed, 17% would prefer their child to return later in the fall, while 15% prefer sometime in the spring.</p>\n<p>In a new <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2769634\">national survey</a> published in the peer-reviewed journal JAMA Pediatrics, about 30% of parent respondents plan to keep their child home if schools open in the fall. The percentage varies when looking at different demographics. For instance, 38% of respondents who earn less than $50,000 per year said they would at least probably plan to keep their child home, while 21% of those who make between $100,000 to $150,000 per year said this. Those who also have job flexibility were more likely to say they would keep their child at home compared to those who don't.</p>\n<p>We decided to look at how parents are feeling as some schools near reopening.

Interiors take a contemporary spin on the typical rustic alpine lodge, notably in the lobby. The open-plan space features stone walls, a wood-burning fireplace, and low-slung modern sofas that look out onto surrounding peaks through a wall of windows.</p>\n<p>The excellent Flannel restaurant offers tasty, locally-sourced fare &mdash; be sure to order the cheese plate, with an array of Vermont cheeses, and enjoy it out on the stone terrace with sweeping mountain views.</p>\n<p>Other amenities include indoor/outdoor pools (plus a separate adults-only outdoor pool), an award-winning spa, and indoor/outdoor tennis courts. An on-site gear shop provides arrangements and equipment for outdoor activities from winter skiing to summer mountain biking. Topnotch Stables offers horseback riding and winter sleigh rides, too.</p>\n<p>Rooms and suites are minimal and modern with warm wood furnishings and tartan accents. Entry-level Deluxe King rooms, located on the first and second floors of the hotel, measure around 350 square feet.

Many people are eager to explore the great outdoors since it offers a better opportunity to practice social distancing than crowded cities, and even <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/travel-booking-tips-from-travel-agents-tour-operators?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=referral\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">travel agents are recommending national parks vacations</a> as good options.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, it's still important to consider the risks of <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/is-travel-safe-coronavirus?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=referral\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"20\">travel</a> in general, and of staying in <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/are-hotels-safe-coronavirus?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=referral\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"20\">hotels</a>. Without a vaccine, there is no guarantee of safety and we always recommend following guidelines from organizations like the CDC and WHO. Additionally, it's vital to consider your own safety risks and to check current state travel guidelines and restrictions before booking any trips, especially if traveling to or from a current hot spot area. You'll also want to be up to date on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/hotel-precautions-coronavirus?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=referral\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"20\">new policies from major hotels</a> when considering overnight options.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>All that being said, some of America's greatest treasures are its national parks, offering outdoor enthusiasts the chance to experience the country's breathtaking beauty and natural diversity. Today the National Park Service counts 62 national parks in 29 states and US territories, stretching from the majestic mountain ranges of Alaska to the sprawling subtropical wetlands of Florida's Everglades.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The greatest number of parks are in California, including Yosemite, known for spectacular granite cliffs and ancient giant sequoia groves. In stark contrast, there's also Death Valley, the largest park in the lower 48, made up of 3.4 million acres of desolate, surreal desert landscape.</p>\n<p>Next door, Arizona is home to one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World, the Grand Canyon, and the lesser-known but still fascinating Petrified National Forest, where fossilized trees date back millions of years.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>And&nbsp;Wyoming lays claim to the nation's oldest national park, Yellowstone, famous for hot springs and gushing geysers, while nearby Grand Teton National Park is a stunning alpine wilderness of jagged snowy peaks and glacial lakes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With so many visitors to these magnificent sites (another risk factor to consider before booking), a wide range of hotels are available near most to serve as convenient traveler bases. We've chosen the best hotels near national parks based on their proximity to well-known parks, but also considered other factors such as interesting architecture, history, design, desirable vacation amenities, and value with prices ranging from $125 to $413 to start.
