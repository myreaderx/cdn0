To talk about how The Terrace was brought from the planning stage to the development stage, and then on to being rolled out, Samsung Newsroom met with the product experts who were responsible for bringing The Terrace to fruition.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Below, Samsung Newsroom talks to Giuk Ted Lee (Marketing), BeomEun Kim (Product Planning), Dongoh Kim (Mechanics R&#38;D), Juyong Kim and, Seunghun Lee (Enterprise R&#38;D), to hear exactly what went in to realizing premier outdoor viewing with The Terrace.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>Taking the Viewing Environment Outdoors</strong></span></h3>\n<p>Research conducted by Samsung Electronics has shown that around 50 percent of American households have an outdoor living space such as a terrace or yard. What’s more, across a range of territories, the habit of watching sports and movies outdoors has been becoming more popular.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-118529\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Terrace-Part2_main2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"550\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Terrace-Part2_main2.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Terrace-Part2_main2-768x422.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Speaking to this trend, BeomEun Kim, who was in charge of product planning for The Terrace, said, “Outdoor living spaces in which people can relax and entertain have been gradually growing more prominent. It was this trend that inspired us to come up with The Terrace, which offers the most optimal QLED viewing experiences in a range of outdoor conditions.”</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_118531\" style=\"width: 1010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-118531\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Terrace-Part2_main3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Terrace-Part2_main3.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Terrace-Part2_main3-844x563.jpg 844w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Terrace-Part2_main3-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">BeomEun Kim (Product Planning)</p></div>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>And the outdoor TV market has been developing as well. As reported by market research publisher QY Research, global figures for outdoor TV sales – which stood at around 170,000 units in 2018 – are expected to hit 440,000 units by 2024. <span>Giuk Ted Lee from The Terrace marketing team explained that, “When compared to the indoor TV market, the outdoor TV market previously sold more models that were smaller than 40 inches. However, from this year, the uptake of mid-to-large-sized TVs that are 55 inches or larger is expected to grow rapidly.” </span></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>Optimal Outdoor Picture Quality Through Synergy With Global No.1 Digital Signage Technology </strong></span></h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_118534\" style=\"width: 1010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-118534 size-full\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Terrace-Part2_main4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Terrace-Part2_main4.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Terrace-Part2_main4-844x563.jpg 844w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Terrace-Part2_main4-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Juyong Kim (Enterprise R&#38;D)</p></div>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>When it comes to the outdoor viewing experience, few factors are more important than picture quality. According to Juyong Kim, who was responsible for picture quality development, when viewing a TV outdoors it is difficult to make out what is on the screen with a brightness level lower than 1,000 nits. He emphasized that The Terrace delivers a maximum of 4,000 nits and an average brightness of 2,000 nits, which is three times brighter than the brightness levels offered by indoor TVs. This allows users to enjoy vivid images with original picture quality, even when the TV is viewed in broad daylight.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Thanks to Samsung’s leadership in digital signage market, in which it maintained the number one position globally for 11 straight years &#8211; The Terrace team was able to deliver an optimal outdoor viewing experience. Seunghun Lee, who was in charge of overall product development, related that, “Digital signage, by its nature, must be equipped to maintain its performance while being subjected to a range of different environmental factors. Our experience in developing digital signage has proved extremely helpful in identifying and applying the optimal brightness levels for outdoor TVs.”</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_118532\" style=\"width: 1010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-118532 size-full\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Terrace-Part2_main5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Terrace-Part2_main5.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Terrace-Part2_main5-844x563.jpg 844w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Terrace-Part2_main5-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Seunghun Lee (Enterprise R&#38;D)</p></div>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The Terrace additionally includes the ‘Adaptive Picture’ feature, which allows users to enjoy optimized picture quality that adapts to the surrounding environment. With Adaptive Picture, artificial intelligence analyzes illumination levels in real-time and automatically adjusts screen settings, increasing brightness during the daytime and reducing glare at night and on cloudy days.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The Terrace is also equipped with anti-reflection technology. When watching TV on sunny days, sunlight reflected by the display panel and other surfaces can cause discomfort for viewers, and glare can distort color and picture quality. Thus, The Terrace was designed to minimize discomfort caused by glare even in environments where light is coming from multiple directions. <span>Seunghun Lee explained that this improvement in visibility was achieved by equipping the screen with surface-treated film to reduce glare.</span></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>Durability That Withstands the Elements &#8211; Water, Dust and Heat Protection</strong></span></h3>\n<p>When developing an outdoor television, the issue of exposure to the elements is a key concern. Hence, The Terrace had to undergo rigorous testing during its development phase. <span>Giuk Ted Lee reiterated that, “The Terrace was initially launched in North America, and will be released in a host of other markets soon. Because the outdoor TV will be expected to withstand a broad range of environmental factors, our simulations tested it in the harshest conditions and a range of climates.”</span></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Particular attention was given to water and dust protection, which are essential features for an outdoor TV, as small particles and liquids can enter the device through even the tiniest gaps if it is not properly sealed. Certified with IP 55 water and dust protection, The Terrace maintains its performance even in rainy or dusty conditions.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_118533\" style=\"width: 1010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-118533\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Terrace-Part2_main6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Terrace-Part2_main6.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Terrace-Part2_main6-844x563.jpg 844w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Terrace-Part2_main6-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dongoh Kim (Mechanics R&#38;D)</p></div>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Dongoh Kim from the R&#38;D team said, “All areas where individual parts connect were protected with special materials. We have also sealed all of the gaps in the enclosure with waterproof tape and rubber seals. To facilitate the open cell structure, a thin layer of special adhesive was applied between the front of the enclosure and the cell that composes the TV screen.”</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Heat resistance is equally crucial for outdoor TVs, given that they are exposed to direct sunlight. Thus, the development team enacted numerous ways to ensure that The Terrace remains heat resistant, even under infrared and ultraviolet light. Although one of the most common means of protecting a TV from heat is through the use of a vent, the team had to explore different solutions, given that the inclusion of vents could have impacted the TV’s water and dust resistance.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The team considered multiple heat resistance solutions for the outdoor television. This led to the development of The Terrace’s sealed enclosure technology, which distributes internal heat over the entire product without the need for a heat sink. The result? An outdoor TV that maintains the highest standard of performance up to an external temperature of 50°C.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>Smart Features to Deliver Unique Viewing Experiences</strong></span></h3>\n<p>So how was the user feedback following The Terrace’s launch? <span>Giuk Ted Lee commented that, “The Terrace has been garnering great feedback from consumers in the North American market. Sales levels are good, and the reviews from users are positive as well.”</span></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>While this feedback is encouraging, many markets still exist in which consumers are unfamiliar with outdoor televisions. We asked for tips on how to leverage The Terrace to empower users in every market to use the product to its full potential. <span>BeomEun Kim noted that, “One of the advantages of The Terrace is that it can be easily connected to a smartphone. For instance, users can connect their phones via Bluetooth while listening to music, and the ‘Music Wall’ feature will display a series of patterns on the TV that complement the music. The ‘Multi-View’ feature also allows consumers to continue using their phones while also using them to watch content on their televisions, delivering a whole new experience.” She added that the ‘Tap View’ feature allows mobile content to be mirrored on the TV screen with a single tap of the bezel.</span></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-118535\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Terrace-Part2_main7.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Terrace-Part2_main7.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Terrace-Part2_main7-844x563.jpg 844w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Terrace-Part2_main7-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Despite being pioneers when it comes to the new outdoor television segment, the team responsible for bringing The Terrace to fruition is already up for a new challenge.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><span>“The level of interest in outdoor TVs has been steadily growing.

It will focus on flexible and timely management of product mix and investment to meet changing demand for each application.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>For system semiconductors, the Company will focus on expanding sales of key products such as high-resolution sensors and 5G system-on-chips (SoCs).</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>For the Display Panel Business, a full-fledged rebound in earnings from mobile displays is expected in the fourth quarter, as a recovery in mobile phone demand during the third quarter will likely be limited to mid- and low-end models. For large-sized panels, the Company will accelerate development of quantum-dot (QD) displays as planned.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The Mobile Communications Business plans to unveil new flagship smartphones including the Galaxy Note and a foldable phone, while seeking to expand sales of mid-tier models. The smartphone market is expected to witness intensifying competition amid a gradual recovery in demand in the second half of the year.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Samsung also aims to enhance profitability from the Consumer Electronics Division through sales of premium products, including QLED TVs and the Bespoke home appliance series, and more efficient marketing. HARMAN is expected to benefit from the improving business outlook for automobiles and higher consumer audio sales.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>In the second quarter, Samsung Electronics’ capital expenditure reached KRW 9.8 trillion, including KRW 8.6 trillion spent on semiconductors and KRW 0.8 trillion on displays. Total capital expenditure in the first half was KRW 17.1 trillion, including KRW 14.7 trillion for semiconductors and KRW 1.6 trillion for displays.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Investment in the Memory Business was spent mainly on equipment for finer process technology and capacity expansion in light of expected growth in memory demand. For the Foundry Business, the Company invested mostly in the advanced 5- and 8nm processes to increase its production capacity.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\">Memory Business Drives Semiconductor Earnings, to Strengthen Cost Competitiveness in H2</span></h3>\n<p>The Semiconductor businesses posted KRW 18.23 trillion in consolidated revenue and KRW 5.43 trillion in operating profit in the second quarter.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The Memory Business saw robust demand for cloud applications related to remote working and online education as the impact from COVID-19 continued, while demand for mobile was relatively weak.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>For DRAM, datacenter demand increased as a boost in online activities and video conferencing drove demand for server products. Mobile demand was weak due to seasonality and lockdowns related to COVID-19 in parts of the world including the United States and India. For PC, demand remained solid on the back of low-end laptops, while the impact from manufacturing site closures eased in the second quarter.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>For NAND, server SSD demand continued to grow as new services were introduced by datacenters in the U.S. and as demand for social networking and remote services expanded in China. For mobile, demand remained weak as consumer sentiment was impacted by COVID-19 and as the share of mid- to low-end mobile products rose. For client SSD, demand was robust due to increased production of mid- to low-priced laptops. Overall NAND shipments decreased because of weak mobile demand and a temporary lack of product availability to meet all the demand for some applications.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Looking to the second half, overall demand for DRAM is expected to pick up from new smartphone launches, while uncertainties remain around geopolitical issues including trade disputes and the pace of higher content-per-box adoption. Likelihood of solid server demand continues in the second half, but server customers’ inventory and investment plans remain to be closely scrutinized. For PC, desktop demand is expected to be weak but low-end laptop demand is likely to remain solid. For graphic, demand will continue to see strong growth with the launch of new game consoles.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>As for NAND, mobile demand is expected to recover on the back of growing mid- to low-end products despite continuing uncertainties. For server SSD, demand is likely to remain strong as online services and activities increase. Demand for client SSD is expected to decline on weak PC demand, but there is a possibility of a recovery as content-per-box grows toward the end of the year.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The Company will focus on flexible product mix and investment, while strengthening the technological leadership in DRAM with the full-fledged application of 1Z-nm and EUV-based products. For NAND, the Company will focus on cost competitiveness and accelerate conversion to 6th-generation V-NAND.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, earnings for the System LSI Business decreased due to a decline in demand for mobile components including SoCs. However, the Company continued to diversify the business with the launch of big-pixel image sensors with ultra high-speed autofocus features and the ‘CC EAL6+’ certified security chip solution, which provides strong privacy protection in smart devices. The Company also diversified its global customer base and increased the portion of overseas revenue.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>As for the second half, the number of 5G subscribers and launches of mid- to low-priced 5G smartphones are expected to increase while adoption of high-resolution and triple/quad camera for mobile devices is expected to grow. The Company will seek to expand market opportunities through new products based on its technology leadership.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The Foundry Business achieved record quarterly and half-yearly revenue as customers’ inventory build-ups increased. The Company began mass production of 5nm products and is developing 4nm process technology. The Company also strengthened the foundation for expansion by starting investments in production lines in the Pyeongtaek complex.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>In the second half, while the impact from COVID-19 will persist, the Company plans to mass produce mobile and high-performance computing (HPC) products based on advanced process technology. In addition, the Company plans secure stable sales and improve profitability by diversifying applications beyond mobile products and into HPC and consumer products.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\">Display Earnings Improve on One-off Gain; Demand Expected to Recover in H2</span></h3>\n<p>The Display Panel Business posted KRW 6.72 trillion in consolidated revenue and KRW 0.30 trillion in operating profit for the second quarter. Its earnings improved QoQ thanks to a one-time gain despite weaker demand for overall display panels.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Mobile displays saw unfavorable business conditions persist as the global spread of COVID-19 weighed down smartphone sales globally. For large displays, the operating loss narrowed slightly on increased sales of monitors as more people worked from home.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Looking ahead to the second half, Samsung expects demand to recover for mobile displays as major customers are planning to launch new products while risks remain due to continuing uncertainties from COVID-19.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The Company aims to increase sales and profitability by actively meeting demand from its customers and offering mobile panels with differentiated performance and design. It will also focus on expanding the presence in new applications including displays for foldable phones and other IT devices.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>For large displays, Samsung will continue to meet demand from its LCD customers until the end of the year and accelerate product development based on new technologies such as QD Displays.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\">Mobile Profitability Remains Solid in Q2; Shipments Increase amid Market Competition in Q3</span></h3>\n<p>The IT &#38; Mobile Communications Division posted KRW 20.75 trillion in consolidated revenue and KRW 1.95 trillion in operating profit for the second quarter.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Amid lockdowns in regions including North America and Europe and store closures due to the global impact of COVID-19, overall market demand decreased QoQ and the Company’s smartphone shipment and revenue declined from the previous quarter. However, efficient cost management, including reductions of marketing expenses and offline promotions, helped the Company report solid profits.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Looking ahead to the third quarter, smartphone sales are expected to rise QoQ, backed by a stronger product mix thanks to the launch of new flagship models, including the Galaxy Note and a new foldable phone, to be introduced at the upcoming virtual Galaxy Unpacked event on August 5th.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>For the second half, the overall mobile market is expected to show a gradual recovery. However, uncertainties related to COVID-19 will continue to persist, with market competition expected to intensify as companies strive to make up for weak performance during the first half.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Amid increased market uncertainty, the Company will respond timely to recovering demand in various regions by launching new flagship models as well as strengthening its mass-market lineup. It will also continue efforts to enhance profitability through optimizing product portfolio, building on the improvement in profitability in mass market models since last year.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>As for the Networks Business, investments in 5G services were delayed in both domestic and overseas markets due to the global spread of COVID-19. While there are still uncertainties over network operators’ investment schedules, Samsung will continue to explore new opportunities for business expansion.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\">Appliances, TV Notch Earnings Growth on Premium Products, Supply Chain Management</span></h3>\n<p>The Consumer Electronics Division, comprised of the Visual Display and Digital Appliances businesses, recorded KRW 10.17 trillion in consolidated revenue and KRW 0.73 trillion in operating profit in the second quarter.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Profit for the Visual Display Business rose despite softness in sales as the Company sought new sales opportunities online to overcome difficulties sparked by global lockdowns. The Company also boosted profits by using its diverse locations for sales and production and targeting consumers’ needs for smart TVs. As a result, sales in premium products like QLED and ultra-large models grew both QoQ and YoY in the second quarter. Cost reduction as well as operational efficiency also boosted profits in the second quarter.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The Digital Appliances Business saw earnings in the second quarter improve both on-quarter and over a year earlier as consumer spending in some economies picked up thanks to an easing of lockdowns in some regions. During this bump in demand in the second quarter, the Company expanded sales of premium products including its Grande AI washers and dryers as well as its Bespoke refrigerators. Seasonal demand for air conditioners on top of cost-effective marketing strategies also helped earnings.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>For the second half of the year, both TVs and digital appliances are expected to see better performance in sales versus the first half of 2020 once pent-up demand is released after COVID-19 lockdowns ease and year-end holiday spending. Slowdowns in the global economy, rising unemployment and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates will be risks to earnings for the rest of the year, in addition to the ongoing pandemic. The Company will aim to increase profitability going forward through premium product sales and more efficient marketing.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\">Enhancing Shareholder Communication on ESG</span></h3>\n<p>Samsung remains committed to creating environmental and social value to support sustainable growth, and to communicating transparently with shareholders on ESG issues.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>In Samsung’s 2020 Sustainability Report, the Company enhanced its disclosure of climate actions based on the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosure framework. In the report, published in June, Samsung also introduced Sustainability Accounting Standards Board standards for the first time to share its actions and developments in sustainable management.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 08:41:50 +0000","feedId":13525,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"724f0284818c290ba34f94eb0353e7f0","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Samsung Newsroom","publishedOrCreatedDate":1598323116129},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:38:36","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:38:36","title":"Samsung Raises the Bar for Mobile Experience Innovation Committing to Three Generations of Android OS Upgrades","link":"https://bit.ly/312FUvR","description":"<p>Samsung Electronics reinforced its commitment to offering the best mobile experiences possible for Galaxy users by supporting for three generations of Android operating system (OS) upgrades on millions of Galaxy devices<sup>1</sup>.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Eligible Galaxy devices include<span><sup>2</sup></span>:</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Galaxy S series: Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G, S20 Ultra, S20+ 5G, S20+, S20 5G, S20 in addition to S10 5G, S10+, S10, S10e, S10 Lite and upcoming S series devices</li>\n<li>Galaxy Note series: Galaxy Note20 Ultra 5G, Note20 Ultra, Note20 5G, Note20, Note10+ 5G, Note10+, Note10 5G, Note10, Note10 Lite and upcoming Note series devices</li>\n<li>Galaxy Foldable devices: Galaxy Z Fold2 5G, Z Fold2, Z Flip 5G, Z Flip, Fold 5G, Fold and upcoming Z series devices</li>\n<li>Galaxy A series: Galaxy A71 5G, A71, A51 5G, A51, A90 5G and select upcoming A series devices</li>\n<li>Tablets: Galaxy Tab S7+ 5G, Tab S7+, Tab S7 5G<span><sup>3</sup></span>, Tab S7, Tab S6 5G<span><sup>4</sup></span>, Tab S6, Tab S6 Lite and upcoming Tab S series devices</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>“Samsung is committed to supporting our users to fully enjoy the latest mobile experiences while they are using Galaxy devices,” said Janghyun Yoon, Senior Vice President and Head of Software Platform Team, Mobile Communications Business at Samsung Electronics. “As people hold onto their devices for longer, we are working to bring secure protection and exciting new features to the devices already in their hands.

During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Galaxy users demonstrated increased interest in Goal 3: Good Health &#38; Wellbeing, rising to the third most engaged Goal in March and April.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Over the last year, Galaxy users across the United States, South Korea, Brazil, India, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom and other countries activated the Samsung Global Goals app to contribute to UNDP’s major achievements in its six <a href=\"https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/six-signature-solutions.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Signature Solutions</a>: reduce poverty, strengthen effective, inclusive and accountable governance, enhance national prevention and recovery capacities for resilient societies, promote nature-based solutions for a sustainable planet, close the energy gap and strengthen gender equality.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>With the support of Samsung and the Global Goals app, UNDP has promoted lifelong learning opportunities for people around the world, by improving the conditions and skills of young people with intellectual disabilities in Bolivia, expanding educational opportunities for young Afghan women, and also providing training and startup funding for young entrepreneurs focused on online education in Libya. UNDP has also supported more than $14 million in core resources to fight climate change and strengthen women’s leadership in natural resources management in 97 countries.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-117905\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Samsung-Global-Goals-Anniversary_main_2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"526\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Samsung-Global-Goals-Anniversary_main_2.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Samsung-Global-Goals-Anniversary_main_2-768x404.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>Mobilizing the Galaxy Community</strong></span></h3>\n<p>With just under ten years left to achieve the Global Goals, Samsung and UNDP created the Samsung Global Goals app in August 2019 as <a href=\"https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-global-goals-campaign-how-to-guide-how-to-address-the-issues-that-matter-most-to-you\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a helpful tool</a> to mobilize the Galaxy community to gain a deeper understanding of the Goals and work together for a greater good.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<div class=\"youtube_wrap\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fvoasqoeTTw?rel=0\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><span style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"></span></iframe></div>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Through educational content and a comprehensive guide to each of the 17 Global Goals, Galaxy users learn about the challenges and interconnectivity across the Goals.

Whereas the previously released Galaxy Buds+ were ‘canal-type’ earbuds that catered to those seeking immersive listening experiences, the Galaxy Buds Live are open-type earbuds that can be worn comfortably for long periods of time, making them convenient for users who listen to music, watch videos, or make phone calls for extended periods. Designer Tommy Choi explained that, “Unlike canal-type earbuds, which can become uncomfortable for some when used for longer hours, open-type earbuds sit outside the user’s earflap, facilitating air circulation and providing more comfortable usability. We came up with the current design to satisfy a broad range of users and distinguish our earbuds from other products with their unique form factor,” he added.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>Step 2: Tireless Tweaking for Broad-reaching Comfort</strong></span></h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_118465\" style=\"width: 1010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-118465\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Galaxy-Buds-Live-Designer-Interview_main_3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"335\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Galaxy-Buds-Live-Designer-Interview_main_3.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Galaxy-Buds-Live-Designer-Interview_main_3-768x257.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Rapid prototypes (left) and dummy prototypes (right) were developed to enhance comfortability. Small dots on the dummies mark which parts of the earbuds were covered when inserted into ears.</p></div>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>No matter how good their performance might be, users are likely to avoid using earphones that are uncomfortable. As the Galaxy Buds Live were developed to accompany users throughout their days, a lot of effort was put into ensuring they were as comfortable as possible. “During development, 80 earbud RPs (Rapid Prototypes) were developed to check the product’s optimal size, shape and specifications. We prepared a lot of RPs since even the tiniest difference in form could lead to huge changes in comfortability levels,” said designer Youngsang Jang.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-118466\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Galaxy-Buds-Live-Designer-Interview_main_4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"610\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Galaxy-Buds-Live-Designer-Interview_main_4.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Galaxy-Buds-Live-Designer-Interview_main_4-923x563.jpg 923w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Galaxy-Buds-Live-Designer-Interview_main_4-768x468.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The human ear comes in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, thus finding a fit that satisfies all presents a significant challenge. And this was especially true in the case of the Galaxy Buds Live, which underwent meticulous user testing to ensure they provided a comfortable fit to a broad range of users, regardless of the shape and size of their ears. Designer Joonha Kim elaborated on the testing process, saying that, “At first, subjects used the earbuds for a short period of time and received their feedback on various points. We knew we couldn’t satisfy all the subjects, but we developed the design so as to satisfy as many people as possible. Then, we performed tests in which the subjects used the earbuds for longer period, and tested in a situation with big movements to refine the shape and create a comfortable earbud.”</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>“Setting the standard for comfortability was the most difficult part,” added Choi, who also worked on the testing. “When eight out of 10 subjects responded by saying that the earbuds were comfortable, and only two rated them as uncomfortable, we had to ensure we made modifications that satisfied those two subjects without compromising the satisfaction of the other eight. In order to make a comfortable product for as many users as possible, we tested on around 2000 subjects.”</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>Step 3: Sophisticated, Square-shaped Case for ‘Jewel-like’ Earbuds</strong></span></h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_118467\" style=\"width: 1010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-118467\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Galaxy-Buds-Live-Designer-Interview_main_5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"568\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Galaxy-Buds-Live-Designer-Interview_main_5.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Galaxy-Buds-Live-Designer-Interview_main_5-991x563.jpg 991w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Galaxy-Buds-Live-Designer-Interview_main_5-768x436.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The shape of the Galaxy Buds Live case was chosen after 30 RPs were developed, including ones with a similar shape to Samsung’s early earbud cases</p></div>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Galaxy Buds Live, the first open-type wireless Galaxy earbuds, also come with a revolutionized case design. Whereas up until the Galaxy Buds+ the earbud cases were oval shaped, with the Galaxy Buds Live the case is square with rounded edges. Youngsang Jang explained the reason for the change of shape, saying that, “Based on the idea that it would be nice to make the shiny earbuds look almost like jewelry, we designed the case as a square to make it look somewhat like a jewelry box. The size and shape were determined to allow the case to fit easily into pockets or be held in the hand, while leaving enough room for the powerful battery that provides up to 21 hours of listening time when fully charged.”</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-118468\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Galaxy-Buds-Live-Designer-Interview_main_6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"643\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Galaxy-Buds-Live-Designer-Interview_main_6.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Galaxy-Buds-Live-Designer-Interview_main_6-876x563.jpg 876w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Galaxy-Buds-Live-Designer-Interview_main_6-768x494.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The gap that runs between the upper and lower halves on all sides of the case is also a new feature that makes it easier to open. &#8220;The gap adds convenience when opening the case, and also makes it easier to apply external covers to your earbud case.” explained designer Sangok Sohn. “When applying external covers to previous incarnations of Samsung’s earbuds, double-sided tape had to be used to fix the cover to the case, which would often leave stains on the case itself. However, the addition of the gap that runs around the case allows covers to be attached more easily and removes the need for the tape.”</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-118469\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Galaxy-Buds-Live-Designer-Interview_main_7_F.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"698\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Galaxy-Buds-Live-Designer-Interview_main_7_F.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Galaxy-Buds-Live-Designer-Interview_main_7_F-807x563.jpg 807w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Galaxy-Buds-Live-Designer-Interview_main_7_F-768x536.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>“When designing the product, we thought hard about all the stages of interaction for users &#8211; from the moment they get their first look at the product, to when they open the case and use the earbuds, to when they put them back in the case to charge,” related Choi. “We also considered how the earbuds would look while resting in the case, and how much they should protrude &#8211; and at what angle &#8211; to allow users to take them out easily.”</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>Step 4: Beautiful Colors ­- Eco-Friendly Materials</strong></span></h3>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-118458\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Galaxy-Buds-Live-Designer-Interview_main_8.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"703\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Galaxy-Buds-Live-Designer-Interview_main_8.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Galaxy-Buds-Live-Designer-Interview_main_8-801x563.jpg 801w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Galaxy-Buds-Live-Designer-Interview_main_8-768x540.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-118459\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Galaxy-Buds-Live-Designer-Interview_main_9.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"503\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Galaxy-Buds-Live-Designer-Interview_main_9.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Galaxy-Buds-Live-Designer-Interview_main_9-768x386.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The Galaxy Buds Live come in a range of colors<sup>1</sup> &#8211; including Mystic Bronze, Mystic White, and Mystic Black &#8211; which are tailored to match the five new products that were introduced at Samsung Galaxy Unpacked 2020. “The colors were selected to imply that the Galaxy Buds Live belong to the same family as the other recently released Galaxy products,” explained designer Mingyeong Jang, who was in charge of CMF (Color, Material, Finish) design for the Galaxy Buds Live. “Even though the newly released smartphones and the Galaxy Buds Live are not made of the same materials, we tailored the design to ensure that they express similar colors and textures.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_118460\" style=\"width: 1010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-118460\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Galaxy-Buds-Live-Designer-Interview_main_10.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Galaxy-Buds-Live-Designer-Interview_main_10.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Galaxy-Buds-Live-Designer-Interview_main_10-844x563.jpg 844w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Galaxy-Buds-Live-Designer-Interview_main_10-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A range of mockups with different levels of glossiness were developed and compared</p></div>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Extensive testing to optimize usability and make sure the earbuds and case complimented one another was essential during the CMF design process. “When I first saw the glossy RPs, they seemed very luxurious to me, and the case that looked like a jewelry box only added to this feeling,” said Mingyeong Jang. “Thus, we designed the Galaxy Buds Live to be glossier after studying a broad range of user preferences.”</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The Galaxy Buds Live are also innovative in terms of the materials they are comprised of. According to Jang, “In an effort to reduce the environmental impact caused by plastic waste, the Galaxy Buds Live are made using 20 percent recycled post-consumer materials (PCM). I hope that we see similar eco-friendly changes made in other areas too,” she concluded.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Through the course of designing a totally new kind of wireless earbud, the designers of the Galaxy Buds Live went deep into studying the human ear. Designer Yongseok Bang shared what he aspires to going forward, saying that, “The form factor of the Galaxy Buds Live is unique, and allows users to enjoy the benefits of both canal and open-type earphones. I will be sure to keep learning about the human ear and improving my knowledge and skills to create a design that can satisfy a broad range of people.”</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><sup>1</sup> <em>Colors may vary according to countries or telecommunication service providers.</em></span></p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Fri, 14 Aug 2020 17:30:03 +0000","feedId":13525,"bgimg":"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Galaxy-Buds-Live-Designer-Interview_main_1.jpg","linkMd5":"4cae3d1da290db00b0d2ca67722d34ad","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn70@2020_4/2020/08/25/02-38-37-739_fa06d9c8b68299bd.webp","destWidth":1000,"destHeight":666,"sourceBytes":539221,"destBytes":96388,"author":"Samsung Newsroom","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Galaxy-Buds-Live-Designer-Interview_main_1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn70@2020_4/2020/08/25/02-38-37-739_fa06d9c8b68299bd.webp","https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Galaxy-Buds-Live-Designer-Interview_main_2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn54@2020_6/2020/08/25/02-39-02-878_05aa24f2e701f6e9.webp","https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Galaxy-Buds-Live-Designer-Interview_main_3.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn17@2020_4/2020/08/25/02-39-03-898_cbe25afdaf8b2082.webp","https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Galaxy-Buds-Live-Designer-Interview_main_4.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn94@2020_2/2020/08/25/02-39-03-888_3983cc62a8fa12b4.webp","https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Galaxy-Buds-Live-Designer-Interview_main_5.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn66@2020_1/2020/08/25/02-39-02-791_01fce48e4d9d60e0.webp","https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Galaxy-Buds-Live-Designer-Interview_main_6.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn22@2020_2/2020/08/25/02-39-02-881_84d508bad01fde8b.webp","https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Galaxy-Buds-Live-Designer-Interview_main_7_F.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn90@2020_4/2020/08/25/02-39-05-124_4491c5fbeac7096a.webp","https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Galaxy-Buds-Live-Designer-Interview_main_8.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn14@2020_6/2020/08/25/02-39-03-576_37af35aa0faa38a6.webp","https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Galaxy-Buds-Live-Designer-Interview_main_9.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn89@2020_3/2020/08/25/02-39-05-935_78de6ef9b5896fdf.webp","https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Galaxy-Buds-Live-Designer-Interview_main_10.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn73@2020_1/2020/08/25/02-39-03-737_59f5dca13992d280.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598323116126},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:38:36","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:38:36","title":"[Big-Screen Chronicles] ④ The Secret to Big Screen Ultra-High-Definition TV Experiences: the AI Quantum Processor","link":"https://bit.ly/2D83huX","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-118073\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/BigScreen_4_main1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/BigScreen_4_main1.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/BigScreen_4_main1-728x410.jpg 728w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/BigScreen_4_main1-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The global market for large screen televisions is on a surge. According to global market research firm Omdia, global shipments of TVs with displays over 75-inches are expected to increase by 17% compared to 2019 and 8K TVs are set to increase by 110% this year as well.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Given the market demands, Samsung is doubling down on its efforts to give consumers large screen TVs that not only offer the best picture quality but also the best sound experiences.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>At the heart of that is Samsung’s AI Quantum Processor.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The AI Quantum Processor is a high-performing chip developed using Samsung’s proprietary technologies that can process complex algorithms quickly using machine learning-based upscaling. That gives consumers the ability to stream 8K content in real-time paired with dynamic, location-based acoustics.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Samsung is peeling back the secrets of the AI Quantum Processor to share on how it brings these experiences together to get better resolution, better sound and better picture integrity.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-118074\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/BigScreen_4_main2.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"588\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>One of the leading questions consumers continue to ask about large screen TVs is how to watch ultra HD content in 8K resolution given that it isn’t widely available yet. That’s where Samsung’s AI upscaling technology comes in.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Today, the technology transforms not only 4K content into 8K, but it also works for lower-resolution SD, HD and FHD-quality content as well. The AI Quantum Processor 8K combines the advantages of existing machine learning capabilities with new deep learning technologies to analyze and deliver content at some of the most granular levels possible.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>This hybrid approach helps to remove unnecessary noise and creates life-like textures and smooth edges on upscaled 8K content that only Samsung can deliver. It also adjusts content brightness and darkness levels according to the light and living room conditions the display is set up in.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>AI Quantum Sound for the Most Suitable Audio Experiences</strong></span></h3>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-118075\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/BigScreen_4_main3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"522\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/BigScreen_4_main3.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/BigScreen_4_main3-768x401.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Adding a truly effective audio experience to high-quality picture quality serves to bring about an even deeper sense of immersion to viewers. Samsung’s AI Quantum Sound, bolstered by artificial intelligence, provides a listening experience similar to that of a movie theater right in your living room.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Samsung’s new innovative sound technology Object Tracking Sound+ follows movement on-screen to match the direction of the sound to the action. The technology recognized and analyzes the recorded audio synced to the content in real-time and evenly distributes the audio tracks to the six speakers embedded in the TV.</p>\n<p>And due in part to the Active Voice Amplifier (AVA), users will never miss a word of dialogue, regardless of what is happening around the TV. The feature monitors the sound environment so that if there is noise louder than the TV’s audio, it will increase the volume of just the dialogue audio so as not to overwhelm users while ensuring no word goes unheard. Also, sound will be delivered seamlessly thanks to real-time deep learning audio separation technology, high-performance NPU (Neural Processing Unit).</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>AI Streaming for Minimal Data Loss</strong></span></h3>\n<p>Thanks to the widespread use of the Over the Top (OTT) streaming services, more and more users are taking advantage of their large screen TVs and stream 8K content. However, existing network infrastructures cannot always guarantee image quality that meets users’ high-resolution expectations. This is why at the Samsung Developers’ Conference in 2019, Samsung introduced its AI Scalenet technology, designed to overcome these infrastructure limitations and support effective 8K streaming and low-latency livestreaming.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>AI Scalenet is a CES 2020 Innovation Award-winning AI codec technology that generates resolutions four times higher than conventional technologies without any change to the network infrastructure. It minimizes the data loss that may occur during the compression and playing of videos through deep learning technologies, meaning users can enjoy 8K-quality content regardless of their network infrastructure. Even during peak usage, AI Scalenet dramatically improves image quality and content speed according to the network status and reduces picture breaking and ambient noise.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-118076\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/BigScreen_4_main4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/BigScreen_4_main4.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/BigScreen_4_main4-845x563.jpg 845w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/BigScreen_4_main4-768x511.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>These days, more content than ever can be enjoyed on our TVs, meaning that the expectation for immersive viewing experiences in the home has increased, too.

Alongside the priority that is ‘people’, nurturing talent and harnessing innovation and collaboration to build a better world are other values that Samsung holds dear.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Samsung understands the importance of economic development for emerging nations. However, it also knows that once a country starts benefitting from that development, it is important to ensure that as many people as possible benefit from the new opportunities that are generated as a result.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Since the 1990s, Samsung has been investing in programs to support children from low income families through the Samsung Welfare Foundation. This foundation supports youths – the leaders of tomorrow – while establishing an environment in which women can continue to work, safe in the knowledge that their children are being taken care of. It has facilitated access to quality education for children, and provided young people in need of financial support with self-reliance funds to allow them to focus on their education.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Samsung, which promotes organizational public welfare programs through the Samsung Welfare Foundation and Samsung Life Public Welfare Foundation, created an organization dedicated to Corporate Citizenship in October 1994 to help it invest more in CSR activities. Since then, Samsung has implemented a range of programs to promote social welfare in domestic and international communities, and brought social welfare experts onboard to help streamline its efforts. In 2007, Samsung established ‘Happy Together’ as the objective statement for its CSR activities, with ‘hope’, ‘harmony’ and ‘humanity’ as the main keywords for its vision. It proceeded to launch a number of activities to instill hope in young people, such as its financial support program for children, study room program, and scholarship program.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_118399\" style=\"width: 1010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-118399\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/International-Youth-Day_main2F.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"350\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/International-Youth-Day_main2F.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/International-Youth-Day_main2F-768x269.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Visual Identities of some of Samsung’s CSR initiatives: &#8216;Light of Love, Sharing Star&#8217; (1995) and &#8216;Together for Tomorrow!

In 2012, Samsung launched its Dream Class program, an extracurricular academic program for middle school students, and in the process demonstrated its will to focus more on youth education.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Samsung has also been launching educational programs around the world that take the diverse range of environments seen in different communities into account. For example, Samsung supported Vietnamese schools by replacing their old desks and chairs and provided Thai, Indian, Filipino and other Southeast Asian youths the opportunity to experience advanced digital technology via the ‘Samsung Digital Hope’ program. The company has also nurtured potential track and field athletes in Kenya through the ‘Dream Tree’ project.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>Realizing Potential &#8211; From Elementary Students to Job Seekers</strong></span></h3>\n<p>In February 2019, Samsung announced its new CSR vision, ‘Together for Tomorrow!

Samsung understands that it has a responsibility to foster the development of the future leaders who will help their communities overcome the challenges brought about in the rapidly changing 21st century.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>To build a future where all young people can realize their full potential, regardless of their circumstances, Samsung launched its <a href=\"http://csr.samsung.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Corporate Citizenship website</a> and took action on its goals by shifting its Corporate Citizenship focus towards domestic and overseas youth education programs.

Following the granting of several global AI awards and industry recognition to Samsung researchers around the globe, researchers in Poland and China recently won a set of highly prestigious global AI challenges.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>Spearheading Speech Translation Research</strong></span></h3>\n<p>Samsung R&#38;D Institute Poland and Samsung R&#38;D Institute China-Beijing competed with some of the world’s top universities and research labs to win first place in two separate challenges at the International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation (IWSLT), one of the world’s longest-running workshops on automatic language translation. This year, IWSLT joined the Association for Computational Linguistics conference (ACL), a premier conference in the field of computational linguistics, to cover a broad spectrum of research areas that are concerned with computational approaches to natural language.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>For the Offline Speech Translation task, which assesses the translation of TED talks from English to German, Samsung R&#38;D Institute Poland won first place for the second time with its own research capabilities in audio to text translation. The conferral of this award marks the fourth consecutive year that teams from Samsung R&#38;D Institute Poland have taken first prize in IWSLT challenges, including previous years’ text translation tasks.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>This year’s Offline Speech Translation task allowed participants to submit systems based on either the traditional speech translation pipeline system composed of an automatic speech recognition (ASR) and a machine translation (MT) or an End-to-End (E2E) system. Samsung R&#38;D Institute Poland’s system is based on a single encoder-decoder deep neural network &#8211; an E2E system – capable of both English and German texts.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>In computational linguistics, E2E systems are harnessed to solve the common problem of error accumulation, wherein, in a traditional pipeline, an error in the speech recognition phase can lead to a nonsensical translation. However, research from over the past three years has shown that traditional systems have constantly been outperforming E2E speech translation systems. The Samsung team’s system not only placed first in the E2E category, but also outscored all traditional pipeline system entrants, a remarkable achievement that puts Samsung R&#38;D Institute Poland at the forefront of speech translation research.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_118445\" style=\"width: 1010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-118445 size-full\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/SRC-AI-Challenge_main1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"838\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/SRC-AI-Challenge_main1.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/SRC-AI-Challenge_main1-672x563.jpg 672w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/SRC-AI-Challenge_main1-768x644.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The team from Samsung R&#38;D Institute Poland Team who participated in this year’s IWSLT challenges</p></div>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>Innovative Approaches in the Field of Computational Linguistics AI</strong></span></h3>\n<p>Samsung R&#38;D Institute China-Beijing took part in a second challenge, the Open Domain Translation task evaluating Japanese to Chinese translation capability, ultimately taking first place.

It also introduced what would be the first of many shortcuts designed to help users get things done faster; double tapping the screen while pressing the S Pen’s button would automatically open the S Memo app.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-118114\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/S-Pen-History_main2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"350\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/S-Pen-History_main2.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/S-Pen-History_main2-768x269.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Introduced the following year, the Galaxy Note2 featured a redesigned S Pen that was flattened on one side to offer a more ergonomic grip.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The most notable enhancement from the first to second model was in pressure sensitivity. While the previous version supported up to 256 levels of pressure sensitivity, the new model supported up to 1,024, or four times as much. The improvement enabled users to enjoy a more nuanced and natural writing experience. A brush menu and eye dropper tool, which made it easy to lift colors from within the Note (from an image, for instance), were also added.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-118123\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/S-Pen-History_Banner2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/S-Pen-History_Banner2.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/S-Pen-History_Banner2-768x154.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-118115\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/S-Pen-History_main3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"350\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/S-Pen-History_main3.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/S-Pen-History_main3-768x269.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The improvements in the Galaxy Note3’s S Pen went beyond refining the handwriting experience and drastically enhanced the stylus’s productivity features. The new Air Command menu allowed users to instantly access important features simply by ejecting the S Pen or by clicking its button. The addition of this handy feature simplified making calls, sending emails and messages, adding doodles and notes to captured images, and much more.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-118116\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/S-Pen-History_main4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"350\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/S-Pen-History_main4.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/S-Pen-History_main4-768x269.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The Galaxy Note4’s S Pen enhancements were about fostering a more realistic writing experience and adding more productivity tools.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Samsung started by greatly improving the S Pen’s accuracy, doubling its pressure sensitivity from 1,024 levels to 2,048. A new feature, Smart select, was also added to make it easier for users to share a variety of content. With Smart select, users could use their S Pen to instantly select, share and save content on their screen – no matter the app – and then share it with others via email or message.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-118117\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/S-Pen-History_main5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"350\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/S-Pen-History_main5.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/S-Pen-History_main5-768x269.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The Galaxy Note5’s Screen off memo function was added because you never quite know when inspiration will strike, and when it does, you want to be able to capture it as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The ability to jot memos directly onto the smartphone’s screen – memos that would be instantly saved once the user put the S Pen back into the device – added a new level of convenience to the note-taking experience. To enhance that convenience even further, Samsung simplified how the S Pen was removed. Whereas previous S Pens needed to be pulled out manually via the notch at the end, the Note5’s S Pen ejected with a light press.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-118147\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/S-Pen-History_Banner3F.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/S-Pen-History_Banner3F.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/S-Pen-History_Banner3F-768x154.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-118118\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/S-Pen-History_main6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"350\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/S-Pen-History_main6.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/S-Pen-History_main6-768x269.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Since 2017, many of Samsung’s S Pen enhancements have focused on enabling users to express themselves in fun and meaningful ways.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Introduced with the Galaxy Note8, Live messages are a perfect example of meaningful communication. This feature allows users to use the S Pen to draw their own fun, animated GIFS which can be instantly shared with friends or on social media. Text, drawings and GIFs created with Live message, which offers a diverse range of brushes and pens for users to choose from, can be saved in the Gallery and reused whenever the user likes.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-118119\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/S-Pen-History_main7.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"350\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/S-Pen-History_main7.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/S-Pen-History_main7-768x269.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>By the time the Galaxy Note9 was introduced, the S Pen had evolved into so much more than a stylus. Now, on top of offering a diverse array of note-taking and productivity tools, the S Pen would serve as a convenient remote control for a wide variety of functions.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The addition of Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) technology meant that the Note9’s S Pen could be utilized to, for example, snap a group photo from afar by using the S Pen’s button as a shutter, and to remotely control slides in presentations. The S Pen would automatically start charging once it was placed back in the device, and offered up to 30 minutes of use (or around 200 clicks) once fully charged.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-118120\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/S-Pen-History_main8.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"350\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/S-Pen-History_main8.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/S-Pen-History_main8-768x269.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>With the Galaxy Note10, the S Pen became more than a remote control; it became a magic wand of sorts.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The introduction of S Pen Air actions opened the door for users to remotely control their device using simple gestures. With a press of the S Pen’s button, the user could use these intuitive actions to switch between cameras and shooting modes, zoom in or out of a shot, and execute a variety of other convenient functions, all with customizable gestures. The smartphone also introduced enhancements designed to help users maximize productivity, including a feature that enables handwriting to be instantly converted to text and exported via a variety of formats.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-118125\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/S-Pen-History_Banner4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/S-Pen-History_Banner4.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/S-Pen-History_Banner4-768x154.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-118121\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/S-Pen-History_main9.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"350\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/S-Pen-History_main9.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/S-Pen-History_main9-768x269.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>In a rapidly digitizing world, we can find ourselves missing the analog days every now and then. For those who find themselves longing for that pen-and-paper feel, the Galaxy Note20’s S Pen offers the most true-to-life note-taking experience yet.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>A bevy of enhancements, including AI technology that allows for more accurate coordinate prediction, as well as an improved gyro sensor and accelerometer, have combined to support the most realistic handwriting and drawing experiences possible. Those experiences are amplified by the new S Pen’s greatly reduced latency. The Galaxy Note20 Ultra’s latency has been reduced by nearly 80 percent compared to the Note10. Such responsiveness enable users to enjoy a more lifelike writing experience – one that feels like the real thing.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>In addition, for the Galaxy Note20, Samsung has expanded Air actions’ gesture controls to offer users more convenience. New ‘Anywhere actions’ make navigating your phone fast and easy, no matter which app you’re using. Using them is simple. A gesture resembling a clamp pointing to the right (&#62;) pulls up recently used apps; an upward clamp (^) brings you back to the home screen; a clamp pointing to the left (&#60;) signifies a backward action; and a downward clamp (∨) runs Smart select. Lightly shaking the S Pen automatically activates Screen Write, which instantly captures a screenshot of your screen and displays the S Pen’s annotation tools.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The S Pen’s evolution over the last nine years has been guided by a desire to maximize the usefulness of having a stylus-equipped smartphone. The Galaxy Note20 and its advanced S Pen are the latest products of this unwavering commitment to convenience. Going forward, as we transition to the next normal, Samsung will continue to enrich Note users’ lives by making the S Pen more versatile, powerful and fun to use.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 05 Aug 2020 23:06:05 +0000","feedId":13525,"bgimg":"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/S-Pen-History_Banner1.jpg","linkMd5":"9f9327569b4a7bf61604c273e660c64e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn1@2020_3/2020/08/25/02-38-37-114_2767ef5de97796cc.webp","destWidth":1000,"destHeight":200,"sourceBytes":94290,"destBytes":21608,"author":"Samsung Newsroom","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/S-Pen-History_Banner1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn1@2020_3/2020/08/25/02-38-37-114_2767ef5de97796cc.webp","https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/S-Pen-History_main1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn74@2020_6/2020/08/25/02-39-05-976_7e59ef1da434517f.webp","https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/S-Pen-History_main2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn97@2020_1/2020/08/25/02-39-05-769_6b02c4222a2826ae.webp","https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/S-Pen-History_Banner2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn25@2020_2/2020/08/25/02-39-02-837_fd0c4916e3a0185a.webp","https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/S-Pen-History_main3.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn38@2020_6/2020/08/25/02-39-06-315_6e00d8d760e246a5.webp","https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/S-Pen-History_main4.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn70@2020_1/2020/08/25/02-39-06-549_fab76cae4f714859.webp","https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/S-Pen-History_main5.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn42@2020_5/2020/08/25/02-39-02-791_3655c926c8d0e747.webp","https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/S-Pen-History_Banner3F.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn85@2020_4/2020/08/25/02-39-05-150_b4f0ac0f5a693558.webp","https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/S-Pen-History_main6.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn70@2020_3/2020/08/25/02-39-02-879_9af20e4e094a6597.webp","https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/S-Pen-History_main7.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn97@2020_3/2020/08/25/02-39-03-392_68699f9b15435b99.webp","https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/S-Pen-History_main8.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn18@2020_6/2020/08/25/02-39-03-261_ef962dec08a91bb2.webp","https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/S-Pen-History_Banner4.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn33@2020_5/2020/08/25/02-39-06-972_dc8e5498a101076b.webp","https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/S-Pen-History_main9.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn26@2020_2/2020/08/25/02-39-05-222_466a0c82d1109eab.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598323116128},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:38:36","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:38:36","title":"[Video] A Behind-the-Scenes Look at the Galaxy Note20’s Pro-Grade Camera","link":"https://bit.ly/2XSgWNV","description":"<p>Because smartphone users are shooting and sharing videos more than ever before, Samsung packed the Galaxy Note20 and Note20 Ultra’s cameras with innovations that make it easy to capture cinematic content anytime, anywhere.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>By allowing you to record content in 8K quality, and by offering unprecedented control over your footage with enhanced Pro Video mode, the newest additions to the Note family make creating professional-grade videos nice and simple.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Click on the video below to watch Samsung explain the ins and outs of the cameras’ most exciting upgrades.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<div class=\"youtube_wrap\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2kH1INNXoDg?rel=0\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block;

The competition was open for entries from January 30 to March 30 under the theme ‘Digital Realism’ to show digital arts moving beyond the limits of artistic expression using the innovative display technology of The Wall. Among 494 artwork submissions from 59 countries, the judging panel consisting of professional art consultants and Samsung representatives revealed the winner as<span> <a href=\"https://www.devharlan.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dev Harlan</a></span>. The Brooklyn-based artist who specializes in sculpture, installation and digital media was selected for his animation titled: ‘Areo Gardens I – Attraction’.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>“It is an honor to be selected by Samsung and Niio for this competition and I appreciate the recognition. With the time, energy and research spent producing these works, it is rewarding to have the opportunity to share them with a global audience on such a unique platform. Samsung’s The Wall technology and Niio’s international network create a fantastic digital showcase for artists across the world. I am proud to be part of that community and excited to see what comes next,” said Dev Harlan.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The winning artwork was created to demonstrate the invisible forces that compel large boulders to collide in a desert garden, which formed part of a series reflecting on the surreal and sublime aspects of natural geology throughout the solar system. Each animated short film depicts a stone sculpture garden set on the surface of Mars, apparently defying the laws of physics. The boulders in this particular piece of art were found on a remote hiking trail in Joshua Tree National Park, while the animation is set in a Martian terrain site near Gale Crater, currently being explored by the NASA Curiosity Rover. Digital elevation data was obtained courtesy of the<span> <a href=\"https://mars.nasa.gov/mro/mission/instruments/hirise/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Martian MRO/HiRise satellite program</a></span> managed by NASA, JPL and the University of Arizona.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>In second place for the open call competition were<span> <a href=\"https://www.ohadbenit.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ohad Benit</a></span> and<span> <a href=\"https://roniazgad.com/filter/Art\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Roni Azgad</a></span>, Tel-Aviv-based artists who crafted ‘Ho Me’, a short video exploring the relationship between man and machine, between computer manipulations and their creators. This piece of art evokes the feeling of staring and not being able to tear our eyes away from something beautiful and disturbing at the same time, highlighting humans’ dialectical relationship with the technology that enables us to behold such beauty but at times can cause us to lose contact.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Finally, <span><a href=\"https://www.alxclub.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Alex McLeod</a></span>, a Toronto-based visual artist who creates work about interconnection, life’s cycles, and empathy through the computer as a medium, claimed third place. His moving image artwork, ‘The Gallery’ allows the viewer to experience an environment that at first appears as an art exhibition; however, the pace and audio cues reveal that there is something else on display.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>“We are delighted to announce the winner of our open call competition in collaboration with Niio, showcasing outstanding talent in moving image art,” said Hyesung Ha, Senior Vice President of Visual Display Business at Samsung Electronics. “Samsung is committed to visual display in all forms, while also supporting creativity and the arts.

With its ability to produce rich, immersive surround sound from both the TV speakers and the soundbar, Q-Symphony picked up the ‘Best of Innovation’ award at CES 2020.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Following on from our previous piece exploring <a href=\"https://news.samsung.com/global/the-sound-of-the-future-1-experience-true-audio-immersion-with-the-innovative-sound-technologies-of-samsungs-2020-qled-8k-range\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the sound technologies of Samsung’s QLED 8K TVs,</a> we present Samsung’s soundbar solutions, which are bringing dynamic surround sound to the home entertainment environment.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>Perfect Harmony – The Building Blocks of Q-Symphony</strong></span></h3>\n<p>Until recently, using conventional TV speakers and soundbars simultaneously could lead to the audio playback getting out of sync with the scenes playing on the screen, meaning that TV speakers had to be muted when using a soundbar. However, Samsung’s 2020 QLED TVs are equipped with upper speakers, enabling simultaneous use of TV speakers and a soundbar. Furthermore, Q-Symphony technology has unlocked compatibility between the 2020 Q80T TVs (which include the moving sound feature for models 55 inches and wider) and the 2020 Q Series soundbars.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The idea for Q-Symphony started from an idea to provide higher quality surround sound by using the upper TV speaker in combination with a soundbar. To make this hybrid solution a reality, the sounds from the TV speakers and soundbar had to be synchronized in terms of timing and volume.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Moreover, in the latest technology, the respective roles of the TV speakers and the soundbar have been clearly distinguished to allow for better harmonization of sounds. While the soundbar delivers primary sounds such as human voices, the upper speaker delivers the ambient sound effects. In this way, the two devices avoid interfering with one another, and provide a richer sound experience.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<div class=\"youtube_wrap\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/x0Hbn_dGNh4?rel=0\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><span style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"></span></iframe></div>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Hearing is believing ­- experience the reality of Q-Symphony above.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><strong><span style=\"color: #000080;\">A Top-tier Soundbar – Nine Channels with Just Four Speakers</span> </strong></h3>\n<p>The current top sound specifications for a home theater system are a 9.1.4-channel set-up, which would ordinarily require a total of 14 speakers. However, the top-of-the-line HW-Q950T Soundbar from the 2020 Q Series is capable of realizing these excellent channel specs with only four speakers.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Following the advent of the home theater market in the 1990s, users were afforded the chance to experience surround sound that covered not only the left and right-hand sides, but also the front and rear too. Further down the line, the 2014 introduction of Dolby’s ATMOS technology enabled 3D surround sound that covered sounds from the top and bottom too.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Samsung’s development of premium surround sound hasn’t happened overnight though. In 2016, Samsung released the HW-K950, a soundbar that only required four speakers to provide 5.1.4-channel surround sound. Samsung didn’t stop there though, instead introducing the HW-Q90R, a 7.1.4-channel soundbar that featured a rear surround channel. This year, Samsung took another step forward with its introduction of the HW-Q950T, a 9.1.4-channel soundbar equipped with two additional wide channels.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-117967\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Sound-of-the-Future-Pt2-Soundbar_main_1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"644\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Sound-of-the-Future-Pt2-Soundbar_main_1.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Sound-of-the-Future-Pt2-Soundbar_main_1-874x563.jpg 874w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Sound-of-the-Future-Pt2-Soundbar_main_1-768x495.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>Dynamic Sound from a Wide Range of Angles</strong></span></h3>\n<p>Representing the next stage in the progression from the HW-Q90R soundbar, the aforementioned HW-Q950T 9.1.4-channel soundbar, features two wide channels that deliver sound at angles of 60<span>° </span>to either side of the center. To provide fuller sound, the speakers at the far right and left, which provide the surround sound, have been moved to the edges of the soundbar. Furthermore, two additional speakers that are oriented at an angle that is optimized for wide channel functionality have been incorporated in the far left and right positions.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>With wide channel functionality, users can benefit from sound being emitted from a host of different angles and benefit from a more complete audio experience. This effect additionally provides a broader sense of realism, and, by adding vitality to the movements on the screen, guarantees a better experience when watching content such as concerts, musical performances and films.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-117968\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Sound-of-the-Future-Pt2-Soundbar_main_2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"850\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Sound-of-the-Future-Pt2-Soundbar_main_2.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Sound-of-the-Future-Pt2-Soundbar_main_2-662x563.jpg 662w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Sound-of-the-Future-Pt2-Soundbar_main_2-768x653.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>Maximizing the Audio Experience</strong></span></h3>\n<p>Before being finalized, all of Samsung’s soundbars undergo a final tuning process at Samsung’s Audio Lab in Valencia, California. The high-level expertise of the Samsung Audio Lab are well established, as was demonstrated when three of the lab’s papers were selected among the top 10 papers by the Audio Engineering Society at AES 2019. Likewise, Samsung more broadly is working to optimize users’ audio experiences by applying powerful, innovative technology to its soundbars.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Over recent years, the home audio experience has been constantly evolving and diversifying to offer users increasingly vivid sound experiences.

Within the span of just a decade, data produced by humankind will see a tenfold increase, which means we will see more data created in the next couple of years than has been accumulated over the past decades.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>As more and more data is collected, we are able to access the information we want and enjoy high-quality content anytime, anywhere. Advancements in 5G, AI and 8K technologies, in particular, are further enriching people’s lives, resulting in the generation of a colossal amount of data on a daily basis.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>Energy-Efficient DRAM and SSD</strong></span></h3>\n<p>Most electronic data is stored in data centers which are often called “archives of human knowledge”. Data centers consist of a massive network of servers and are the epitome of cutting-edge information technology. The operation of data centers, naturally, requires a massive amount of electricity, and this is where the potential for the future of energy-efficient memory technology lies.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>HDD or SSD is where data actually gets stored on servers. SSD is a NAND flash memory-based storage device and it delivers higher performance than disk-based HDD while using 50% less energy. With recent developments in technologies, DRAM needed for computing has also been optimized to perform better and consume less electricity.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Replacing HDDs with SSDs across all data center servers released in 2020 can be translated into saving 3 terawatt-hours (TWh) of energy per year. Upgrading server DRAM  from DDR4 to the new DDR5 has the effect of saving 1TWh. These power savings amount to 4TWh, which is large enough to light all the street lights in Korea for an entire year, or power all homes in the country for a month.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Furthermore, additional electricity is required to cool down the tens of thousands of servers hard at work. That is why many data centers are located in Finland, Sweden or Ireland, to give them access to the cooler air and sea water needed for cooling. The less energy used in data center operation by adopting more SSDs and DDR5, the less heat generated, which ultimately leads to less electricity being needed for the cooling process. A total of 3TWh of electricity can be saved per year by following this process. A combined energy saving of 7TWh is enough electricity to replace 2.5 coal-fired power plants. The growing demand for servers driven by rapid growth in data and continued semiconductor innovation are placing a heightened importance on energy-efficient memory solutions.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><strong><span style=\"color: #000080;\">Our Vision for a Sustainable Future</span>                                                </strong></h3>\n<p>When the Paris Agreement was signed to fight climate change in 2015, an international environmental organization singled out electricity as the main culprit of global warming in its report, claiming that the energy sector is responsible for 72.1% of global greenhouse gas emissions. They urged the IT industry to join its efforts in reducing energy consumption given that energy consumption in data centers and networks was forecast to soar.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Samsung Electronics has long been aware of the value and potential of energy-efficient memory. Since it launched its “Green Memory Campaign” in 2009, it has been introducing memory solutions with maximized energy efficiency year after year as a part of its commitment to contribute to environmental protection.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>In addition, our various sustainability initiatives across manufacturing processes and site operations have been recognized. Samsung Electronics became the first company in the semiconductor industry to earn a number of environmental certifications, including the Carbon Footprint and Water Footprint Certifications and the Zero Waste to Landfill Validation of Gold Level.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The path ahead for Samsung Memory is clear: to produce high-performing and energy-efficient products, and in turn, to empower all users to take part in saving the planet.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>As a decades-long global IT leader, Samsung Electronics will continue to work for a more sustainable future as we explore new and innovative approaches to protect our planet.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 16:00:54 +0000","feedId":13525,"bgimg":"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Samsung-Memory-Sustainable-Future_main1.jpg","linkMd5":"b87ce8050bd5dfc3a6916c762341f906","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn38@2020_2/2020/08/25/02-38-37-131_8a6e9e262ad82454.webp","destWidth":1000,"destHeight":667,"sourceBytes":354398,"destBytes":19254,"author":"Samsung Newsroom","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Samsung-Memory-Sustainable-Future_main1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn38@2020_2/2020/08/25/02-38-37-131_8a6e9e262ad82454.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598323116129},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:38:36","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:38:36","title":"5 Features You Might Not Know on the Galaxy Note20 and Note20 Ultra","link":"https://bit.ly/2EnnNYM","description":"<p>The latest additions to the Galaxy Note family, the Galaxy Note20 and Note20 Ultra, are packed with meaningful innovations that to help you maximize your day.

The Galaxy Note20 series removes that pain by allowing you to request Wi-Fi access information from near-field devices with people in your Contacts. Your friends can then share the password with you, making it easy to log in to new Wi-Fi networks.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-118518\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Galaxy-Note20-Five-Features_main3F.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>Find the Highest Quality Wi-Fi Connection</strong></span></h3>\n<p>When connecting to Wi-Fi in public spaces, the Galaxy Note20 series also makes it easy to find the fastest and most stable signal.

Particularly in North America, where a large portion of the population lives in stand-alone houses with areas for outdoor recreation, it is not uncommon to see outdoor TVs installed in spaces such as barbecue areas and terraces.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Starting with the release of The Serif in 2016, Samsung Electronics has been delivering televisions that closely reflect the lifestyles of its users. In May of 2020, Samsung’s first outdoor TV, The Terrace, was launched in the North American market (alongside The Terrace Soundbar) as part of the company’s expanding lifestyle TV portfolio.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>According to market research publisher QY Research, the global numbers for outdoor TV sales – which stood at around 170,000 units in 2018 – are expected to hit 440,000 units by 2024.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>But exactly how different is an outdoor TV from a regular television? Read on for Newsroom’s deep dive into the features and benefits of Samsung’s new The Terrace and The Terrace Soundbar offerings.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>Clean, Sharp Picture Quality in a Range of Conditions</strong></span></h3>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-118418\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Terrace-Part1_main1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Terrace-Part1_main1.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Terrace-Part1_main1-848x563.jpg 848w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Terrace-Part1_main1-768x510.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Walking the streets, it is not uncommon to see people shading their phones from the sunlight and struggling to make out what is on their screens. This happens when the brightness of the phone’s display is not high enough to counter the glare caused by the external light source, and is also an issue that affects outdoor TVs.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>However, with The Terrace delivering an average brightness level of 2,000 nits (and a peak brightness level of 4,000 nits), users can comfortably view content even in broad daylight. With its QLED display, anti-reflection technology that eases glare and Adaptive Picture feature that automatically optimizes the display’s brightness according to the surrounding lighting conditions, both visibility and top-tier picture quality are ensured.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-118419\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Terrace-Part1_main2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Terrace-Part1_main2.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Terrace-Part1_main2-848x563.jpg 848w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Terrace-Part1_main2-768x510.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The Terrace is powered by Tizen, an open-source platform that allows content from Netflix, YouTube, Amazon Prime Video and Disney+ to be streamed with vivid picture quality, regardless of which operating system is being used. This service additionally supports the Apple TV app<sup>1</sup> and AirPlay 2.<sup>2</sup> With built-in Wi-Fi and LAN, The Terrace can be used simply and conveniently without the need for additional purchases or connections.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>There are a host of ways for users to enjoy mobile content on a large screen with The Terrace as well. For instance, Tap View feature allows what is displayed on the user’s Galaxy smartphone to be mirrored on their TV screen with a single tap. What’s more, Multi View feature allows the TV screen to play media from multiple sources, allowing users to watch TV on part of the screen while mirroring their phone screen on another part.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-118420\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Terrace-Part1_main3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Terrace-Part1_main3.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Terrace-Part1_main3-844x563.jpg 844w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Terrace-Part1_main3-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>When it comes to a TV that is intended for use outdoors, resistance to rain, wind and dust is of high importance. The Terrace carries an IP55 certification from the International Electrotechnical Commission, meaning that it delivers reliable water and dust resistance, and ensures peace of mind for users whose televisions are subjected to adverse conditions. The IP Code rates the level of protection a product carries against the ingress of dust, water or contaminants, with IP55 meaning that the product is highly protected against dust and will work without fault in the rain.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>Experience Deep, Rich Sound With The Terrace Soundbar</strong></span></h3>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-118415\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Terrace-Part1_main4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Terrace-Part1_main4.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Terrace-Part1_main4-847x563.jpg 847w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Terrace-Part1_main4-768x511.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>A TV designed for use outdoors must, by necessity, deliver sound differently from those that are used indoors. The Terrace Soundbar was built to accompany The Terrace television and provide rich sound to complete the premium viewing experience. Distortion Cancelling was applied to The Terrace Soundbar to enable it to deliver deep, powerful low-register output without the need for an accompanying subwoofer. A total of four woofers in The Terrace Soundbar create 210 watts of sound to enhance the sense of immersion for the viewer.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>To add convenience to the viewing experience, both The Terrace and The Terrace Soundbar can be controlled by a single remote, which also features support for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth<sup>®</sup>. What’s more, the Tap Sound feature allows users to enjoy music or sounds from their Galaxy smartphone on The Terrace soundbar with a single tap too. The Terrace Soundbar likewise carries IP55 dust and water protection to allow users to enjoy premium television audio in a broad range of conditions, worry-free.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>According to its vision of ‘Screens Everywhere’, Samsung Electronics has been expanding into areas such as ultra-high definition, new form factors and new viewing spaces, and in the process charting new waters as far as the television viewing experience. We expect to see The Terrace make a mark as it stretches the home entertainment experience into the outdoor environment.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><sup>1</sup> <em>Apple’s new video content streaming service, launched in the first half of 2019, which provides access to a range of content including movies and TV series</em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><sup>2</sup> <em>A feature that allows music, videos, and images stored on an Apple device to be streamed or viewed on external devices</em></span></p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 11:00:53 +0000","feedId":13525,"bgimg":"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Terrace-Part1_main1.jpg","linkMd5":"072578000b7d26f80d298f7d8a5367f6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn46@2020_3/2020/08/25/02-38-37-462_b7bc3e45e67e80ee.webp","destWidth":1000,"destHeight":664,"sourceBytes":621581,"destBytes":107036,"author":"Samsung Newsroom","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Terrace-Part1_main1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn46@2020_3/2020/08/25/02-38-37-462_b7bc3e45e67e80ee.webp","https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Terrace-Part1_main2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn41@2020_1/2020/08/25/02-39-06-514_c69d7e0023710133.webp","https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Terrace-Part1_main3.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn9@2020_4/2020/08/25/02-39-06-022_d851670d995a9520.webp","https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Terrace-Part1_main4.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn69@2020_4/2020/08/25/02-39-06-419_22e0b28462578a4b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598323116126},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:38:36","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:38:36","title":"[Infographic] An Up-Close Look at the Galaxy Watch3","link":"https://bit.ly/30uJv5y","description":"<p>Samsung optimized the Galaxy Watch3 inside and out to offer users a much more personal and insightful smartwatch experience.

You’re not alone — according to a recent survey conducted by Samsung Electronics, 76% of respondents say that, since social distancing measures were put in place, they have either started exercising from home or increased the time they had previously spent exercising at home.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>That’s why this May, Samsung Electronics launched the Samsung Health Smart TV app, which allows users to utilize their televisions as portals to help keep their minds and bodies healthy from home.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>So, what helpful and innovative features does Samsung Health offer on your Smart TV? Samsung Newsroom followed a day in the life of a mother and daughter to see firsthand how the Samsung Health Smart TV app was able to keep them moving and motivated from sunrise through sunset. We’ve shared some of the highlights from their day below:</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong># 7:00 AM Waking Up with Sun Salutations</strong></span></h3>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-118005\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Stay-Fit-Samsung-Health-on-Smart-TV_main6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Stay-Fit-Samsung-Health-on-Smart-TV_main6.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Stay-Fit-Samsung-Health-on-Smart-TV_main6-938x563.jpg 938w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Stay-Fit-Samsung-Health-on-Smart-TV_main6-768x461.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Since they started using Samsung Health, this mother and daughter’s morning routine has been completely transformed. Instead of rushing around from the moment they wake up, they now start each day with a yoga flow. Thanks to Samsung’s ‘routines’ feature, they’ve set a daily alarm which triggers a pop-up message at their preferred time to help them maintain consistent with their practice. With a simple click of the ‘start now’ button, users can begin their chosen content without the need for further input.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>On days they wake up feeling energized and want a bit more intensity, they simply open the Samsung Health app to see a host of top-tier recommendations. Samsung Health provides free access to various content from several premium fitness brands, such as barre3, Fitplan, Jillian Michaels, obé fitness and Echelon. What’s more? The suggested programs are systematically classified and organized on the screen, making choosing the right workout program quick and simple, even for beginners.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>After a quick 30- minute yoga routine, they’re ready to start their day.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-117999\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Stay-Fit-Samsung-Health-on-Smart-TV_main3.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"366\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong># 11:30 AM – Taking a Moment to Relax, Focus and Meditate</strong></span></h3>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-118002\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Stay-Fit-Samsung-Health-on-Smart-TV_main4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Stay-Fit-Samsung-Health-on-Smart-TV_main4.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Stay-Fit-Samsung-Health-on-Smart-TV_main4-938x563.jpg 938w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Stay-Fit-Samsung-Health-on-Smart-TV_main4-768x461.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The daughter returns home, excited to share her workout data with her mother and turns on the TV.

Incredibly, this photo took neither specialized equipment nor a professional photographer to shoot, but only required the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra and two office workers—Hyuck-ki Lee and Seok-joon Hong from Samsung’s Mobile Communications Business. Below, we explore their journey into the realm of astrophotography, and find out how the pair managed to capture the grandeur of the Milky Way with the Galaxy S20 Ultra.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>A Young Man’s Journey to Becoming a Self-Made Astrophotographer</strong></span></h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_117917\" style=\"width: 1010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-117917 size-full\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Capturing-Galaxy-with-Galaxy_main_2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Capturing-Galaxy-with-Galaxy_main_2.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Capturing-Galaxy-with-Galaxy_main_2-845x563.jpg 845w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Capturing-Galaxy-with-Galaxy_main_2-768x511.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Galaxy S20 Ultra, set to shoot the night sky</p></div>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>When Hong first started pursuing photography as a hobby, he used a film camera that he had received from his father. As he visited more and more shooting destinations, he found himself becoming increasingly immersed in the world of photography. In 2013, he and Lee traveled to Tanzania, where Hong got his first taste of astrophotography.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>“I’ve always been interested in astronomy, and I even built my own telescope in high school,” Lee related. “I love how, with astrophotography, one day you can be shooting the moon from your living room, and the next you may be capturing a celestial phenomena that has never been caught on camera before. However, the idea that you could capture the night sky in all its glory with only a smartphone was a new concept to me.”</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_117930\" style=\"width: 1010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-117930 size-full\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Capturing-Galaxy-with-Galaxy_main_3_F.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Capturing-Galaxy-with-Galaxy_main_3_F.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Capturing-Galaxy-with-Galaxy_main_3_F-704x563.jpg 704w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Capturing-Galaxy-with-Galaxy_main_3_F-768x614.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Moonlight Park, Uiseong, Gyeongsangbuk-do, Republic of Korea</p></div>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Glimpsing the stars shining bright on a pitch-black night is impressive enough, but actually trying to capture the sight with your camera can prove tricky. First, finding a spot to shoot that is unaffected by the light pollution caused by cities and large towns can prove difficult. Second, if you don’t remain alert and attentive, you risk missing the fleeting moment to get just the shot you’ve been waiting for. Third, you have no choice but to lug your heavy camera gear to whichever far-flung shooting destination you may have chosen.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>But Hong and Lee report that the Galaxy S20 Ultra is going a long way towards alleviating those challenges. “Utilizing the camera on the Galaxy S20 Ultra has saved me from a lot of the difficulties that I thought were unavoidable,” said Hong. “A Galaxy S20 Ultra and a sturdy tripod are all a beginner astrophotographer really needs.”</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_117926\" style=\"width: 1010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-117926 size-full\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Capturing-Galaxy-with-Galaxy_main_4_F.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Capturing-Galaxy-with-Galaxy_main_4_F.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Capturing-Galaxy-with-Galaxy_main_4_F-704x563.jpg 704w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Capturing-Galaxy-with-Galaxy_main_4_F-768x614.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image captured at a wind farm at Maengdongsan Mountain, Yeongyang, Gyeongsangbuk-do, Republic of Korea</p></div>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>How to Take Stellar Pictures on a Smartphone</strong></span></h3>\n<p>The images of the night sky that the pair captured from the valleys and foothills between Jeollabuk-do and Gyeongsangbuk-do were so dazzling that it was hard to believe they were taken with a smartphone camera. “Even when a photograph is taken of the same thing, from the same place, at the same time, different photographers can produce varying products based on their differing perspectives and intentions,” Lee reported. “In many cases, differences in composition and angle combine to create a completely different piece of work.”</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-117912\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Capturing-Galaxy-with-Galaxy_main_5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"360\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Capturing-Galaxy-with-Galaxy_main_5.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Capturing-Galaxy-with-Galaxy_main_5-768x276.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_117928\" style=\"width: 1010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-117928 size-full\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Capturing-Galaxy-with-Galaxy_main_6_F.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"835\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Capturing-Galaxy-with-Galaxy_main_6_F.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Capturing-Galaxy-with-Galaxy_main_6_F-674x563.jpg 674w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Capturing-Galaxy-with-Galaxy_main_6_F-768x641.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Milky Way by Hong (top) and Star Trails by Lee (bottom) demonstrate how each photographer’s style comes through in their work</p></div>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>While taking photographs, it is also important to be familiar with your equipment and make the most of the features it offers. “The Galaxy S20 is definitely superior in terms of portability,” said Hong. “It also has the advantage of offering Pro Mode, which allows you to take photos manually and gives you more control over your settings, and ultimately the final results. I will definitely keep taking the S20 out into the field because of how it complements my DSLR camera.”</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The Galaxy S20 Ultra offers improved low light photography and stability, producing extraordinary nighttime shots with minimal blur and noise. “Capturing good images of the night sky requires long exposure times­, and the Galaxy S20 Ultra is very well-suited to this kind of photography,” emphasized Lee. “Equipped with a 108-megapixel sensor and nona-binning technology for better low light performance, the camera on the Galaxy S20 Ultra is capable of capturing beautiful night-time photos.”</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Hong and Lee also offered tips for those looking to try their hand at astrophotography. Lee recommended that burgeoning photographers start off simple, saying, “Static shots of constellations and the moon are easy to shoot, so are a good place to start. Make sure that you focus on the beauty of what you are trying to capture instead of the resulting pictures, and you will be rewarded with splendid pieces of work.”</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>“These days, chances for socialization are few and far between,” Hong commented. “So, for those looking to pass the time by getting into photography, I strongly recommend taking trips to remote areas with the Galaxy S20 Ultra. You don’t need a high-end DSLR camera to take great-quality pictures of constellations these days. You can also use astronomy apps to help you find constellations to take pictures of as well. From there, simply take out your Galaxy S20 Ultra and start creating special memories with your loved ones.”</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<div style=\"padding: 2em; border: 2px dotted #000080;\">\n<p><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>How to Take Exceptional Night-time Photos with the Galaxy S20 Ultra</strong></span></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 15px;\"><strong>Before You Go</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 15px;\">The best time to photograph the Milky Way is on a moonless night. A good flashlight and a backup phone battery are musts.</span></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 15px;\"><strong>When You G</strong><strong>et</strong><strong> There</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 15px;\">1) Set Up Your Equipment</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 15px;\">When shooting in low light, you will need a tripod and either a remote shutter or timed shutter. The camera needs to be kept as still as possible to allow it to take in light.</span></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 15px;\">2) Use Pro Mode</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 15px;\">Most cameras aren’t automatically set up to take pictures of the stars. Switch from automatic to manual mode in advance so that you can then adjust settings like the ISO and shutter speed yourself between each shot.</span></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 15px;\">3) Fine-tune the Shutter Speed</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 15px;\">Apply a slow shutter speed, as your shutter needs to be open longer than normal in order to receive enough light for the shot. If you leave the shutter open long enough, you will capture star trails.</span></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 15px;\">4) Adjust the White Balance</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 15px;\">The White Balance setting adjusts the color temperature of your camera, ensuring that things that look white to your eye actually show up as white in the final product. A white balance of between 3500 and 4500 generally proves suitable for astrophotography.</span></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 15px;\">5) Manage ISO Sensitivity</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 15px;\">Your ISO setting determines the image sensor’s sensitivity to light.

Users are increasingly looking ahead to a daily life characterized by large capacity, low latency and hyper-connected communication.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>In the age of 5G, in which a wide range of cutting-edge technologies co-exist, Vice President Intaik Park chose ‘softwarization’ as the technology that we should first turn our attention to. “A hardware-based implementation needs replacements every time a new technology emerges,” noted Park. “But a product realized with software on a general-purpose server only requires software updates to implement and enable new technologies. We also anticipate that softwarization can greatly reduce facility investment and operation costs.”</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Many global companies are currently focusing on softwarization, thus gradually expanding the use of technologies. Conventionally, software application was limited just to core network equipment, but it has recently expanded to modem implementations that need to operate in real-time, something that was considered difficult to realize without specialized hardware. “As network-related open-source projects such as Open Network Automation Platform (ONAP) emerge alongside the telecommunication industry’s adoption of open-source systems for container management like Kubernetes from the IT industry, open-source software is spreading extensively throughout the communication industry,” noted Park. He also explained that software development methods are changing too with the use of open-source software.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-118017\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NextGenCommPart3_Main2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NextGenCommPart3_Main2.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NextGenCommPart3_Main2-850x563.jpg 850w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NextGenCommPart3_Main2-768x508.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>As well as softwarization, we also should be turning our attention to the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in communication networks. As communication technologies advance, so does their complexity and variety. This means that the need for AI is increasing, too. There have been many previous attempts to leverage AI for communications, just as with software. But in the next generation of communication, AI is set to emerge as the most indispensable technology.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>As 5G operates on an ultra-high frequency (mmWave), it requires more base stations than LTE (Long Term Evolution) due to its shorter ranges. Furthermore, since base stations equipped with new technologies like network slicing have to adapt to their unique environments, the situation becomes much more complex. “Leveraging AI for base station management so that they can be operated automatically and adjust to changing environments would reduce operation costs and optimize performance,” said Park.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>“Whereas 5G involved implementing AI into communication technologies for efficiency and automation, we plan for AI to be embedded across all system components in 6G networks,” said Park of the future of AI in communications. “We expect AI to play an important role right from the design stages. Our plan is to converge the next-generation communication network with AI to make communication intelligent. Samsung’s software and AI capabilities will have a huge synergizing effect on the industry.”</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_118018\" style=\"width: 1010px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-118018 size-full\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NextGenCommPart3_Main3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NextGenCommPart3_Main3.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NextGenCommPart3_Main3-847x563.jpg 847w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NextGenCommPart3_Main3-768x511.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Researchers at Samsung’s Advanced Communications Research Center’s advanced solutions team are charting the convergence of a variety of technologies</p></div>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>What Needs to be Done to Make 5G Widespread?</strong></span></h3>\n<p>5G is a technology that has only just been introduced, meaning that there still many challenges to overcome. “The key to the wide adoption of 5G technology is to identify applications (apps) that harness the particular advantages of 5G,” noted Park. More apps capable of offering new services and values to people based on the core characteristics of 5G need to emerge.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Such apps that could win over the hearts and minds of users could potentially be realized using 5G’s ultra-low latency characteristic. Latency exists in every form of communication &#8211; for example, watching the live broadcast of a football match on a 4G smartphone will mean that what is displayed is slightly behind the actual game.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>“By drastically reducing latency, apps that could not be realized previously due to a lack of storage or computing resources on devices could be enabled by offloading computation to remote servers in the form of real-time streaming,” explained Park. “Multi-access edge computing (MEC) technology brings the computing resources of a data center that may be physically far away from a user closer to further reduce the delays that have been already reduced thanks to 5G technology’s ultra-low latency. This technology will be recognized as a key communications technology, along with 5G.”</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The telecommunications industry is laboring hard to overcome challenges and provide far-reaching, best-in-class services and values to users of the recently-commercialized 5G network, and Samsung Electronics is no exception. Samsung possesses an excellent foundation with which to create new solutions and services by merit of the company’s wide portfolio of technologies that cover everything from mobile phones to telecommunication equipment. “The development of 5G services and solutions based on both mobile devices and telecommunication equipment will be an area where Samsung can shine with its accumulated experiences in these industries,” highlighted Park.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>Achieving a Competitive Edge With Strong Fundamental Values</strong></span></h3>\n<p>Key players in software and hardware development are now entering the communications industry. Manufacturers of CPU, GPU and other components are actively engaging their technologies through the softwarization of communication equipment. As edge computing such as MEC has taken on a vital role in the industry, cloud providers have also started to join the communications sector. Furthermore, the leaders of the automobile market are also getting involved with the communications market as attention on autonomous driving continues to grow. “Companies from a variety of industries have turned their attention to the communications market, meaning that the market has a huge growth potential,” noted Park. “The competition will be fierce, but we will witness a lot of innovation, too.”</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Within this market landscape, Samsung plans to solidify its leadership through the convergence of its various technologies. “Since the borders between varying industries are breaking down, communications technology is also converging with a wide range of other technologies,” said Park. “We will tailor our software, AI, cloud service and other technologies for the communications industry, one by one. When undergoing such changes, Samsung will firmly maintain its principles of communication while enhancing our competitive edge based on the experience we have gained through a long-time involvement in the ever-changing communications industry.”</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-118019\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NextGenCommPart3_Main4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NextGenCommPart3_Main4.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NextGenCommPart3_Main4-850x563.jpg 850w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NextGenCommPart3_Main4-768x508.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Park, who has worked in the software industry for a long time, is pioneering a new way in the communications industry. “The move from local standards to global standards brought in more players as well as more opportunities,” noted Park. “Now, with softwarization and AI being applied, the industry has become an unpredictable land of opportunity. In the age of hyper connectivity, perhaps even the physical distance between things will fade away once everything converges. Let us see how far we can go to reduce that distance in the future.” With this firm outlook, Park is set for success when facing the next challenges that may arise.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-118020\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NextGenCommPart3_Main5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1281\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NextGenCommPart3_Main5.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NextGenCommPart3_Main5-440x563.jpg 440w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NextGenCommPart3_Main5-768x984.jpg 768w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NextGenCommPart3_Main5-799x1024.jpg 799w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 02 Aug 2020 11:00:01 +0000","feedId":13525,"bgimg":"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NextGenCommPart3_Main1.jpg","linkMd5":"9ba3d8183651be6846f66bfa2c97dfff","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn54@2020_5/2020/08/25/02-38-37-419_3a32a2bf2639af0b.webp","destWidth":1000,"destHeight":1271,"sourceBytes":971684,"destBytes":179558,"author":"Samsung Newsroom","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NextGenCommPart3_Main1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn54@2020_5/2020/08/25/02-38-37-419_3a32a2bf2639af0b.webp","https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NextGenCommPart3_Main2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn53@2020_1/2020/08/25/02-39-04-679_a3b3710c95c5b551.webp","https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NextGenCommPart3_Main3.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn49@2020_5/2020/08/25/02-39-04-899_170ccd12409a10f2.webp","https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NextGenCommPart3_Main4.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn77@2020_3/2020/08/25/02-39-06-478_0fb3dd7e4996f799.webp","https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NextGenCommPart3_Main5.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn46@2020_3/2020/08/25/02-39-06-371_0dcebfb0401dd0a5.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598323116129},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:38:36","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:38:36","title":"The Galaxy S20 Gets Even More Powerful With New Update","link":"https://bit.ly/31nzacc","description":"<p>Packed with unrivaled camera and productivity features, the Galaxy Note20 series has set a new standard for smartphone innovation.

Galaxy Note10 devices have received an accessibility certification from Spain-based NGO Fundación ONCE (the ONCE Foundation). The Amovil seal is part of a project developed by the ONCE Foundation in collaboration with universal accessibility consultancy ILUNION Tecnología y Accesibilidad, whose objective is to provide information about the accessibility features of commercial smartphones.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>A Leader in Accessibility</strong></span></h3>\n<p>Samsung is the first manufacturer to receive the ONCE Foundation&#8217;s seal of accessibility, which affirms that Samsung devices meet universal accessibility standards. This achievement is the result of close collaboration between Samsung and the ONCE Foundation, with the organizations aiming to use technology as a tool to support the autonomy of people living with disabilities and improve their quality of life.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are very proud to be the first to receive the ONCE Foundation seal of accessibility, which is another sign of our efforts to make all our products accessible to as many people as possible,&#8221; said Alfonso Fernández, head of Marketing, Corporate Communication and Institutional Relations at Samsung Electronics Iberia. Meanwhile, Jesús Hernández, head of Universal Accessibility and Innovation at the ONCE Foundation, stressed that, &#8220;This certification has been established to meet the demands of the many institutions that want to know if the technology they purchase is responsible or not. Samsung is well-aware of how important it is to ensure that its devices are accessible to as much of the population as possible.”</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>Striving for Accessibility in the Galaxy S20 and Galaxy Note10</strong></span></h3>\n<p>The Galaxy S20 family, consisting of the Galaxy S20, Galaxy S20+ and Galaxy S20 Ultra, has been certified by the ONCE Foundation as providing accessibility features for people with zero and partial vision, zero and partial hearing, moderate and severe manipulation difficulties, difficulty seeing colors and speech difficulties. In addition, all of the Galaxy S20 models include a comprehensive accessibility menu to help users find the features they’re looking for quickly and easily. Users are also afforded the option to activate accessibility functions – such as the screen reader – when they first turn their devices on. The entire Galaxy S20 range also includes 5G connectivity, which allows users to download content faster, without delays or interruptions, even while conducting video calls or viewing live content.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>In addition, the Samsung Galaxy Note10 incorporates accessibility features for people with zero and partial vision, zero and partial hearing, moderate or severe manipulation difficulties, color blindness, and speech difficulties. It also includes an S Pen that allows users to take notes and create precise sketches, facilitating the completion of a wide range of tasks.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>Samsung’s Broader Commitment to Accessibility</strong></span></h3>\n<p>Samsung Electronics Iberia, S.A.U.&#8217;s commitment to accessibility is part of its corporate &#8220;Tecnología con Propósito&#8221; program, which seeks to positively impact the greatest number of people possible by harnessing technology to break down barriers.

The evolutions of communications technology has enabled us to be more connected than ever before, meaning that information can be shared anytime and anywhere.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>In mobile communication, a business with a well-established global ecosystem, from equipment manufacturers to telecommunications operators, common rule is essential to keeping the ecosystem moving forward collaboratively. This is where the process of standardization comes in, which sets internationally agreed-upon standards to give users access to better products and services at lower prices. A representative example demonstrating the benefits of international standardization is the global roaming service, which allows users travelling to foreign countries to use their mobile devices as they are.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-118351\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Next-Gen-Comm-Interview-Pt4-Jin-Kyu-Han_main_2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Next-Gen-Comm-Interview-Pt4-Jin-Kyu-Han_main_2.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Next-Gen-Comm-Interview-Pt4-Jin-Kyu-Han_main_2-844x563.jpg 844w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Next-Gen-Comm-Interview-Pt4-Jin-Kyu-Han_main_2-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Standardization is one of main driving forces behind the growth of the mobile communication industry since a new generation has been introduced once every decade. “Large-scale investments into mobile communication have been triggered when each new generation of communications is commercialized,” explained Dr. Han. “When certain countries or companies run their businesses with proprietary solutions, the risk of failure increases.” This means that the chance of success can increase only when the stakeholders of the mobile communication ecosystem come together to define the most relevant technologies and discuss aspects like implementation early enough. “Determining communications standards and developing products following these standards is an equitable process,” noted Dr. Han. “These standards are crucial.”</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Standardization is two-fold: the de jure standards obligated by regulators and the de facto standards established by the global communications industry which, while not compulsory, specify unified ways of operation for stakeholders around the world to follow. The Standards Research team of Samsung’s Advanced Communications Research Center oversees both standards.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>“For example, in order to utilize the extremely high frequency band (mmWave) for 5G, de jure standardization is a prerequisite for the commercialization of any device using the band, which includes assigning a set of frequency bands to mobile communication, setting regulated conditions such as maximum transmission power and out-of-band emission, and ensuring its safety for the human body and existing devices,” explained Dr. Han. “We are also simultaneously developing protocol technologies and working on de facto standardization to include these technologies into the standards by participating in standards developing organizations such as 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project) and IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers).” Dr. Han emphasized that both de jure and de facto standards are equally important.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>Working as a Communications Standard Expert</strong></span></h3>\n<p>Frequency bands are a limited resource. It is inevitable that different parties will clash over acquiring such an in-demand resource, which is why each frequency band is already allocated to a specific purpose, e.g. fixed communications, mobile communication, broadcasting, satellite, or other uses. The extremely high frequency band adopted for 5G was an unexplored territory from the perspective of mobile communication. When Samsung initially proposed it, there was pushback at first.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Standards experts are supposed to take the initiative of reserving such new spectrums for the mobile communication industry. “By stressing mobile communication’s contribution to the economy, we managed to persuade the governments of each country, and attracted more supporters by showing them the feasibility of applying this extremely high frequency band to mobile communication,” recalled Dr. Han. “We actively presented many details to justify our claim, including the simulation results of a coexistence study. As a result, we were able to have this extremely high frequency band assigned to 5G.”</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-118352\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Next-Gen-Comm-Interview-Pt4-Jin-Kyu-Han_main_3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Next-Gen-Comm-Interview-Pt4-Jin-Kyu-Han_main_3.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Next-Gen-Comm-Interview-Pt4-Jin-Kyu-Han_main_3-845x563.jpg 845w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Next-Gen-Comm-Interview-Pt4-Jin-Kyu-Han_main_3-768x511.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>“There is no almighty judge when it comes to fairly determining which technology among many candidates should be selected as a part of the standard. Moreover, any technology has its own pros and cons,” said Dr. Han. “There is a decision-making process inherent to standardization. Proposals are first made by companies, intensive and technical debate on each proposal then follows, and participants finally build a consensus to reach a conclusion. We have to avoid sticking to our own interests. Instead, we are trying to communicate with other stakeholders to find the best way forward based on an understanding of the industry as a whole. When we take care of the ecosystem, proposals that we develop to make it healthy and sustainable will be supported by the majority as a result.”</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Similar to the role of the diplomat, standardization experts participate in global standardization conferences and will there represent their company or their country. They are expected to be the best in their own field. “As we are contending at the forefront of these international discussions, technical competitiveness is the key requirement for Samsung delegates,” explained Dr. Han. “Therefore, in our projects, anyone who is most competitive in a certain area is designated as the champion of the area, regardless which team he or she belongs to.”</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>Standardization, the Next Phase of 5G</strong></span></h3>\n<p>4G is a communications technology designed to enable the wireless broadband service for smartphones. In particular, 4G as a universal communications platform aggressively adopted the Internet protocol that was popularly used in past wired packet communications. Therefore, many Internet-based services could easily migrate to cellular systems. 5G, then, is designed to expand its territory from the broadband service for smartphone users to vertical markets including the smart factory, automobile, healthcare, private network, smart city, and more. 4G as a universal solution led to a huge growth of the communications market. On the other hand, 5G aims to create new markets based on its new design principle of customizable networks to fulfill the specific requirements of a particular industry sector.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>To realize the innovations that 5G has promised, Dr. Han and his team have been working on Rel-16, the second version of 5G. “Rel-15, the first version of 5G, laid a new framework for the technology and focused on how to provide differentiated experiences to conventional customers, i.e. smartphone users,” noted Dr. Han. “We joined the global collaboration to develop Rel-16 in order to realize the 5G vision. Rel-16 introduces and enhances 5G’s features for vertical markets. For example, V2X<sup>1</sup> is for connected cars, industrial IoT communications is for smart factories and the data analytics function has been improved for network AI.”</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Even though 5G has been commercialized, the standardization of 5G for further enhancements will never stop. Until the launch of 6G, the 5G standard will continuously evolve in order to improve and expand 5G. “As soon as we concluded the development of 5G’s second version, we immediately began work on the third version, Rel-17,” commented Dr. Han. “We have discovered some areas to improve commercial 5G networks with, including coverage expansion and NR-MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output). These will be amended and enhanced in the upcoming versions. Furthermore, we will continue to discover new features to add in order to enable new 5G applications. Innovations we are looking at include media delivery for AR glasses-type devices and edge computing enablers for low latency services from cloud servers close to users.”</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>Standardization of Edge Computing, Further Enhancement for 5G Services</strong></span></h3>\n<p>Samsung is constantly pushing the boundaries of 5G in order to bring its unique experiences to users. One key characteristic of 5G is its ultra-low latency, brought about by its nine-tenths latency reduction in the radio access link between terminal and base station as compared to the previous generation. In order for users to experience the quality of ultra-low latency services, the end-to-end latency between the user terminal and the cloud server should be reduced. Samsung believes that edge computing will solve the rest of this puzzle, this being latency reduction in the backbone network, by placing the server closer to users. Thanks to 5G and edge computing, users will finally be able to enjoy 5G’s signature service on their devices.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>“The link between a device and its server was out of 3GPP’s scope,” said Dr. Han. “But it is also hard for other standards organizations who are not experts in 5G to develop the standard for edge computing without a complete understanding of 5G systems.” Due to this difficulty, attempts were made to develop edge computing-enabled communication using proprietary solutions – which would lead to serious market fragmentation. “Samsung initiated discussions on edge computing inside 3GPP and persuaded other participating companies. We are now leading the standardization effort for enabling edge computing in 5G systems as one of the key items of Rel-17.”</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>In 2009, Samsung began the early stages of 5G research with the question of “how can we improve cellular networks to be 10 times better than 4G LTE?” Samsung will continue to develop further enhanced technologies for the future of 5G. “Samsung plays various key roles in the influential standardization organization for mobile communications and leads those standards and related technologies,” explained Dr. Han. “Based on our perseverance for over 10 years in this field, we will overcome whatever obstacles we encounter and will make 5G a big success.”</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-118346\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Next-Gen-Comm-Interview-Pt4-Jin-Kyu-Han_main_4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Next-Gen-Comm-Interview-Pt4-Jin-Kyu-Han_main_4.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Next-Gen-Comm-Interview-Pt4-Jin-Kyu-Han_main_4-845x563.jpg 845w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Next-Gen-Comm-Interview-Pt4-Jin-Kyu-Han_main_4-768x511.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>Making a Better World – Through Technology</strong></span></h3>\n<p>Dr. Han began working in this field because when he was a student, he was extremely curious about who made standard specifications, the ground rules that were akin to a communications bible. And today, he is leading the team shaping the future of communications with standards. What resolution has he set?</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>“When we worked on LTE standards, we did not even expect that the term ‘LTE’, back then only used by selective standard engineers, would become a common and popular term,” noted Dr. Han. “This experience reminded me that the technologies we create can change the world and the daily lives of people. We are also aware of high expectation from 5G that we have developed. I firmly believe that our work will benefit the world.”</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Dr. Han is also working on promoting Samsung’s 6G vision to inspire people in this field. “In the future, the main customers in the communications market won’t just be human, but will include robots and other machines, too,” explained Dr. Han. “People will start to enjoy hyper-connected experiences and be able to explore reality in a virtual world without temporal or spatial constraints. 6G will present fundamental technologies for such innovations. We will begin communicating with stakeholders as per Samsung’s 6G White Paper, published on July 14. Our 5G experience and the insights captured in our 6G vision will help us prepare for the long journey toward another success story with 6G.”</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>“Moreover, the sustainable growth of society and the communications industry will be key considerations for shaping 6G.”</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-118347\" src=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Next-Gen-Comm-Interview-Pt4-Jin-Kyu-Han_main_5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1281\" srcset=\"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Next-Gen-Comm-Interview-Pt4-Jin-Kyu-Han_main_5.jpg 1000w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Next-Gen-Comm-Interview-Pt4-Jin-Kyu-Han_main_5-440x563.jpg 440w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Next-Gen-Comm-Interview-Pt4-Jin-Kyu-Han_main_5-768x984.jpg 768w, https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Next-Gen-Comm-Interview-Pt4-Jin-Kyu-Han_main_5-799x1024.jpg 799w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><sup>1</sup> <em>V2X is a technology that supports vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications.</em></span></p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 09 Aug 2020 11:00:51 +0000","feedId":13525,"bgimg":"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Next-Gen-Comm-Interview-Pt4-Jin-Kyu-Han_main_1.jpg","linkMd5":"b61ebb9a78b70f0545ae4259ed5832c1","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn85@2020_3/2020/08/25/02-38-36-563_529904924cc1ab67.webp","destWidth":1000,"destHeight":1274,"sourceBytes":850607,"destBytes":174348,"author":"Samsung Newsroom","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Next-Gen-Comm-Interview-Pt4-Jin-Kyu-Han_main_1.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn85@2020_3/2020/08/25/02-38-36-563_529904924cc1ab67.webp","https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Next-Gen-Comm-Interview-Pt4-Jin-Kyu-Han_main_2.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn50@2020_4/2020/08/25/02-39-06-336_4d3c30a5696d6e8c.webp","https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Next-Gen-Comm-Interview-Pt4-Jin-Kyu-Han_main_3.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn2@2020_2/2020/08/25/02-39-05-691_97d2ccd4335509ce.webp","https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Next-Gen-Comm-Interview-Pt4-Jin-Kyu-Han_main_4.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn65@2020_2/2020/08/25/02-39-05-354_c16ee8c767873abc.webp","https://img.global.news.samsung.com/global/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Next-Gen-Comm-Interview-Pt4-Jin-Kyu-Han_main_5.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn14@2020_1/2020/08/25/02-39-05-336_0dd8db4b606aa77b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598323116126},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 10:38:36","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 10:38:36","title":"Galaxy Unpacked August 2020: Official Trailer #2","link":"https://bit.ly/2XmkRSA","description":"<p>The wait is almost over!</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>A whole new kind of Galaxy Unpacked is just days away, which means it won’t be much longer before a new generation of powerful mobile devices makes its big debut.
