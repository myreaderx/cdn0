When shopping for a TV, there are many different aspects to consider, including size, panel type, resolution, HDR support, smart TV platform, and more.&#160;</p><p>If you're looking for a display with genuine home theater performance in mind, then you'll likely want to opt for a 65-inch- or- larger premium 4K TV. The <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-4k-tv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">best 4K TVs</a> typically use an <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-oled-tv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OLED panel</a>, or a high-end LED panel with quantum dots and local dimming. These display types will provide you with the best contrast, black levels, and brightness performance for dazzling <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-hdr-tv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">high dynamic range</a> (HDR) images.&#160;&#160;</p><p>For buyers who simply want a reliable TV for casual viewing, however, a smaller screen and a more budget-friendly LED panel should get the job done just fine. Though picture quality won't be quite as impressive as more expensive display types, there are many <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-tv-under-500-dollars\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">affordable LED TVs</a> out there with solid performance. And, while 4K resolution and built-in smart TV interfaces were once thought of as premium features, nowadays even entry-level TVs come with 4K panels and smart TV capabilities as default features.&#160;</p><p>Once you've settled on the basics for what you're looking for in a new display, there are plenty of deals readily available from all of the major TV manufacturers, including Sony, Samsung, LG, Vizio, TCL, and Hisense. To help narrow things down, we've rounded up all of the best TV deals available right now.&#160;</p><h2>Here are the best TV deals in October 2020:</h2><ul class=\"summary-list\"><li><a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/196318/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fvizio-65-class-oled-4k-uhd-smartcast-tv%2F6416848.p%3FskuId%3D6416848\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\"><strong>Vizio 65-inch OLED 4K TV (2020 model), $1,900 (originally $2,000) at Best Buy</strong></a><strong> [You save $100]</strong></li><li><a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/196318/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Ftcl-75-class-8-series-led-4k-uhd-smart-roku-tv%2F6377907.p%3FskuId%3D6377907\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\"><strong>TCL 75-inch 8 Series 4K TV, $2,000 (originally $3,000) at Best Buy</strong></a><strong> [You save $1,000]</strong></li><li><a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/196318/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsony-65-class-x900h-series-led-4k-uhd-smart-android-tv%2F6401205.p%3FskuId%3D6401205\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\"><strong>Sony 65-inch X900H 4K TV (2020 model), $1,000 (originally $1,600) at Best Buy</strong></a><strong> [You save $600]</strong></li><li><a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/196318/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Finsignia-39-class-led-hd-smart-fire-tv-editiontv%2F6400439.p%3FskuId%3D6400439\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"60\" data-orig-url=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/196318/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Finsignia-24-720p-hdtv-smart-led%2F6402235.p%3FskuId%3D6402235&subid2=1599685734102aaopdfdq1fdq1\" data-ml-id=\"24\" data-ml=\"true\" data-xid=\"fr1599685737783ijd\" data-uri=\"c4637f52322b6e9f65ba7f0f42f8ee92\"><strong>Insignia 39-inch Fire TV Edition HDTV, $160 (originally $230) at Best Buy</strong></a><strong> [You save $70]</strong></li></ul><p><em>Prices and links are current as of 10/19/2020.

Unlike traditional LED TVs (which use LCD panels), OLED TVs don't require a backlight. Instead, every pixel is able to produce its own light or shut off completely. This enables OLED displays to produce superior black levels, contrast, and viewing angles compared to regular LED models. With that said, OLED panels can't get as bright as LED TVs, and they can be susceptible to burn-in if you leave a static image on the screen for hours on end.</p><p>For most buyers, however, the pros of OLED tech far outweigh the cons. Of course, the high-end picture performance of an OLED TV typically comes with a high price tag. Thankfully, OLED TVs from LG and Sony often go on sale.&#160;</p><p>The best OLED TV deal available right now is for the <a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/196318/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fvizio-65-class-oled-4k-uhd-smartcast-tv%2F6416848.p%3FskuId%3D6416848\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Vizio 65-inch 4K OLED TV</a>, which is currently available at Best Buy for $100 off its full price.

This feature allows the displays to achieve a wide color gamut for more accurate and rich colors. Premium LED TVs typically include full-array local dimming as well, enabling the backlight to dim in specific zones across the screen.

But it has grown to an almost $300 billion industry.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories</a>.</li>\n</ul><p><em>Following is a transcript of the video.</em></p><p><strong>Clancy Morgan: </strong>If you're like me, your freezer is packed full of frozen food that came from a giant frozen section from a factory that freezes millions of pounds of food every year. It's an enormous operation, but all of that actually started with this, or, more specifically, this.</p><p>The story behind this logo is key to understanding how one idea completely changed how we eat and cook and along the way created an almost $300 billion industry.</p><p>To understand how we got this, we have to go back to the early 20th century. Before frozen foods, diets in the US looked a lot like this. They were very meat and potatoes, and I know this kid looks super excited, but it was often really bland.</p><p>To get meat, people would go to a quaint butcher shop, like this one from 1910. And they'd go to a small, often mom-and-pop grocery store, like this one. You'd actually bring a list, and a worker would pick out your items for you. I'm not sure why this lady looks so displeased with that artichoke, though. But anyway, people could keep food cold, but not really frozen.</p><p><strong>Amy Bentley:</strong> You had an icebox, but iceboxes were minimally functional. They tended to be smelly. They could create mold.</p><p><strong>Clancy:</strong> Frozen food at the time actually had a really bad reputation.</p><p><strong>Clip: </strong>Is that right?</p><p><strong>Clancy:</strong> Because it was frozen at temperatures that weren't actually that cold, it sometimes took a day or longer to freeze. This formed large ice crystals, which ruined the taste and texture. Basically, the quality was terrible. But soon that would all change, thanks to this guy. Clarence Birdseye. He invented what we think of as frozen food, and it totally changed the way we eat. I find Clarence Birdseye fascinating.</p><p>He was always inventing things, and he actually has over 100 patents. Here's a photo I printed out of him working on a food dehydrator. And he had a real, like, 20th-century vibe. The editors of his college yearbook actually wrote this quote next to his photo. I don't even know how to say this. \"I ain't afeer'd o'bugs, or toads, or worms, or snakes, or mice, or anything.\" Interestingly, he never actually graduated from college.</p><p>Birdseye spent several years working in Labrador in Northern Canada, where he observed Inuit fishermen freezing fish in the frigid outdoors. The fish froze so quickly they actually retained their taste and texture. So like any good inventor, Birdseye engineered a machine that would replicate this process, quickly freezing small quantities of food between two super-cold metal plates. The plates were later swapped for belts, which was more efficient. The machine used temperatures as cold as 50 degrees below zero, and the food was prepackaged in insulated containers. Birdseye called his product \"frosted food\" to differentiate it from low-quality frozen food.</p><p>Now, obviously Birdseye didn't invent the concept of frozen food, but he did figure out a way to mechanize its production, and it worked great. In 1932, The New York Times described the process as a scientific miracle, having food ready without any \"laborious preparation.\"</p><p><strong>Clip:</strong> ♪ Birds Eye peas [pop] ♪ ♪ Sweet as the moment [pop] ♪ ♪ Sweet as the moment when the pod went pop [pop] ♪</p><p><strong>Clancy:</strong> But there was just one problem. Pretty much no one had a freezer. And I mean no one. When some families did start to get electric refrigerators around the 1930s, it was a really new concept.</p><p><strong>Clip:</strong> Sliding shelves, too. A marvelous convenience.</p><p><strong>Clancy:</strong> But it wasn't just homes. Retailers didn't have freezers that could keep frozen food from thawing, reportedly failing to keep temperatures \"much under 40 degrees Fahrenheit.\" And retailers were also skeptical about this new product. One industry analysis wrote that \"customers not only did not demand quick-frozen foods but probably had never heard of them.\"</p><p>Changing how millions of people eat was a daunting task, and Birdseye's company was running out of money. So in 1929, Birdseye sold his patents and company to Postum for $23.5 million, or over $350 million today. Now, all of that money didn't go directly to Clarence Birdseye, but he did make around a million dollars from it. [pop] And he must have really liked frozen foods, because he stayed on at the company as a consultant.</p><p>Birdseye needed to figure out how to sell frozen food, but he also literally needed to figure out how to sell it. Distribution was cited as \"the quick-frozen-food industry's most serious problem.\" So the most serious solution? The company would not only make the food, but also the freezers and the trucks, then lease hundreds of them to retailers as a proof of concept for frozen food. And it worked. It demonstrated that it could be a popular product. By the end of 1937, 2,000 stores carried Birds Eye frozen food.</p><p>To market frozen food, Birds Eye focused on its freshness and convenience, advertising peas \"as gloriously green as any you will see next summer.\"</p><p><strong>Clip: </strong>Yes, Birds Eye peas are as sweet as that because they are freshest picked, freshest frozen.</p><p><strong>Clancy: </strong>And this entire cookbook was written just to advertise all the ways you can use frozen food. And there's some real gems in here. Like, there's one for French fried asparagus. And this thing called a jellied salmon loaf. But there still wasn't a big need that frozen foods filled.</p><p>In 1937, it was estimated that only around 23% of homes had electric refrigerators. And according to American Heritage, \"In 1945 Americans still bought less than two pounds of frozen food apiece.\" For context, I have, like, 15 pounds right now. But Clarence believed in frozen food. That same year he told The Washington Post, \"I believe we'll see a phenomenal increase in the demands for both home and commercial use.\" And he was right.</p><p><strong>Clip:</strong> And so they joined the stream of family life in the suburbs.</p><p><strong>Bentley:</strong> The 1950s and the '60s is called \"the golden age of food processing.\" Consumers who had been deprived of consumer goods through the 1930s and the '40s, with the war and food rationing, all of a sudden have disposable income. The country is very wealthy. And all of these products are flooding the market.</p><p><strong>Clip: </strong>Miles of checkout counters and endless rows of carts.</p><p><strong>Clancy: </strong>In less than a decade, frozen-food sales grew from $496 million to almost $2 billion. It was the fastest-growing segment of the food industry, according to a 2003 study. During that time, exciting new products like frozen OJ, TV dinners, and even frozen pizza were introduced. And this is when we see the rise of those household-name brands, like Eggo, Hungry-Man, or Ellio's.</p><p><strong>Clip: </strong>And your big Birds Eye buy this week is Birds Eye orange juice.</p><p><strong>Clancy:</strong> Birds Eye itself reportedly offered over 100 different items. You can actually see the Birds Eye logo here in a freezer ad from 1948. And grocery stores went from having a couple of hundred products to a few thousand. This A&#38;P ad from 1950 boasts over 2,400 items.</p><p>But possibly the biggest shift was when families started to move to the suburbs. Now you could drive to the supermarket, buy a ton of food, and store it all in your refrigerator, which actually had a freezer built in now.</p><p><strong>Clip: </strong>A completely separate food freezer that holds 84 pounds of frozen foods. There's simply nothing like it.</p><p><strong>Clancy:</strong> Convenience played a bigger role in American homes, and companies capitalized on it. Birds Eye advertised its frozen spinach as the \"work-free-est, farm-freshest.\"</p><p><strong>Bentley: </strong>And so the cuisine and the culture shifts somewhat, and the technology gets better, and the two converge to create this moment where frozen food is seen as no longer, like, low class or a compromise.</p><p><strong>Clancy:</strong> In 1955, The New York Times wrote, \"frozen foods are no longer a specialty item but an integral part of the grocery business.\" And about a decade later, the microwave made things even more convenient. What I can't get over is the brilliance and the absurdity of Birdseye's invention was that it worked really well, but it was engineered way before retailers or consumers were ready for it, or even wanted it. It took two decades and a world war to catch on. But today, frozen foods are cemented into American society.</p><p><strong>Bentley: </strong>And it's emblematic of all of these values that we have always had about food: shelf stable, predictable, relatively low cost, much of it. We want fresh, local, seasonal food. We value that, but we also value frozen food.</p><p><strong>Clancy: </strong>A lot has changed since the days of the icebox. But you can thank Clarence Birdseye, at least in part, for your Kid Cuisine and your DiGiorno. That was maybe a little too much struggle. I'll do a little in between.</p><p>&#160;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/how-birds-eye-frozen-peas-gave-us-eggo-and-digiorno-2020-10'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=vBNcsgzcBeM:03D4_Se-Fyg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=vBNcsgzcBeM:03D4_Se-Fyg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=vBNcsgzcBeM:03D4_Se-Fyg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=vBNcsgzcBeM:03D4_Se-Fyg:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=vBNcsgzcBeM:03D4_Se-Fyg:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=vBNcsgzcBeM:03D4_Se-Fyg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=vBNcsgzcBeM:03D4_Se-Fyg:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=vBNcsgzcBeM:03D4_Se-Fyg:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/vBNcsgzcBeM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 18:03:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f88aa8ed260780019341b06?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"61a34b4999befacc474b0bba4bb4c0bc","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn11@2020_5/2020/10/20/02-05-14-061_43878438c8dd6cbe.webp","destWidth":1080,"destHeight":810,"sourceBytes":131686,"destBytes":131686,"author":"cmorgan@businessinsider.com (Clancy Morgan)","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn67@2020_3/2020/10/20/02-05-22-757_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=vBNcsgzcBeM:03D4_Se-Fyg:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn84@2020_3/2020/10/20/02-05-20-516_a2c831c4023c39ea.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=vBNcsgzcBeM:03D4_Se-Fyg:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn7@2020_6/2020/10/20/02-05-25-379_e2deb96cab096286.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn79@2020_1/2020/10/20/02-05-18-571_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=vBNcsgzcBeM:03D4_Se-Fyg:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn51@2020_5/2020/10/20/02-05-18-456_c1efe9ff1c2e25f6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/vBNcsgzcBeM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn91@2020_6/2020/10/20/02-05-14-117_bd4018bd8857c46d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603159473340},{"createdTime":"2020-10-20 10:04:33","updatedTime":"2020-10-20 10:04:33","title":"Perdue Chicken faces boycott threats and races to deny connections to Sen.

But, at $75-$100, they're a no-brainer. The company has technically offered lower prices in their Choose What You Pay sale for select colors, but this is the lowest price ever offered for the full range.</p><p>We suggest ordering true to size and buying soon if you want to have the first pick out of all 13 possible color variations.&#160;</p><h3><a

class=\"summary-list\"><li>Eating well on a backpacking trip is often an oxymoron — since the intent is to travel light, bringing food that's fast and easy to prepare is highly preferred.&#160;</li><li>But with the right backpacking stove, you're able to improve the quality of those trail meals without dramatically increasing how much you stow in your backpack.&#160;</li><li>The best backpacking stoves should all have these three features in common: They're portable, reliable in inclement weather, and are fuel-efficient enough to avoid the need for an assortment of gas canisters.</li><li>Our top pick, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/MSR-WindBurner-Personal-Stove-System/dp/B076DVTTVW/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener nofollow sponsored\"><strong>MSR WindBurner</strong></a>, is an all-in-one camp stove that's efficient, lightweight, and dependable — and it's worthy of a spot in anyone's backpack.&#160;</li></ul><p>There's nothing quite like enjoying a hot meal at your campsite following a long day on the trail. Energy bars and trail mix do well to curb hunger during the day but when it's time to relax for the night, you'll want something a bit more substantial. That's where a reliable camp stove opens up the options for meals, snacks, and hot beverages, making your <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/camping-essentials-list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">time in the backcountry</a> much more enjoyable.</p><p>I spend much of the year, regardless of season, either out on a multi-day backpacking trip or planning my next one — and I've learned that prioritizing how and what I'll eat is always a vital consideration. This means making sure I'm able to start each morning with a cup of <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&mi=10248&pw=184534&ctc=biipgf_022720_best-backpacking-camp-stoves&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F123167%2Falpine-start-instant-coffee-package-of-8fee-package-of-8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">instant coffee</a> and a few bites of <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&mi=10248&pw=184534&ctc=biipgf_022720_best-backpacking-camp-stoves&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F175698%2Fmountain-house-scrambled-eggs-with-bacon-single-servingn-single-serving\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">rehydrated scrambled eggs</a> so that I'm replenished enough and able to take on however many grueling miles lay ahead.&#160;&#160;</p><p>Refueling at night is just as important, too. A satisfying evening meal goes a long way to making my legs feel less tired and my body less sore, despite having hauled a 30-pound pack for several hours prior. Satisfying those meal needs always comes down to the type of backpacking stove I bring along. Even on shorter trips, it always finds its way into my pack — it's <em>that</em> important.&#160;</p><p>To find the best currently available, I tested an array of camp stoves from popular brands like MSR and JetBoil (as well as a budget model from BRS). As you'll notice by which stoves ultimately made this guide, those two brands have the backpacking camp stove market almost entirely covered, and recommending another brand just for the sake of it isn't worth it — these are the best for a reason.

What makes this particular stove stand out is that it's an all-in-one option that gives users everything they need in one package. That includes the stove itself, a 1-liter insulated cook pot, a stabilizer, straining lid, and a plastic bowl. The only added extra you'd need is a canister of fuel and you're set.</p><p>Unlike other all-in-one systems, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/MSR-WindBurner-Personal-Stove-System/dp/B076DVTTVW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;linkCode=ll1&#38;tag=biipgf_022720_best-backpacking-camp-stoves-20&#38;linkId=a564b18148f9d981f86c8bded6276881&#38;language=en_US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">WindBurner</a> offers a few extras that make it easier to use.

Very few backpacking stoves are as good in cold and windy conditions, and most use more fuel when preparing a meal. In fact, the WindBurner often gets twice as many uses out of a single fuel canister as its competition. That performance remains surprisingly consistent, too, even when used in a variety of environments or altitudes.&#160;</p><p>Weighing in at 15.2 ounces, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/MSR-WindBurner-Personal-Stove-System/dp/B076DVTTVW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;linkCode=ll1&#38;tag=biipgf_022720_best-backpacking-camp-stoves-20&#38;linkId=a564b18148f9d981f86c8bded6276881&#38;language=en_US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">WindBurner</a> isn't the lightest stove on this list but it is compact enough to comfortably carry inside a backpack, along with each of the add-ons which store inside one another. The entire package is easy to clean and can be set up or taken apart quickly. It also has the ability to boil a liter of water in just four and a half minutes, which is quite fast for a model of this size.&#160;</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Compact, fast, and efficient, the MSR WindBurner is an all-in-one system that backpackers will love</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>No built-in igniter and not as lightweight as some other models</p>\n\tBest ultralight backpacking stove\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5e5821fffee23d246e72ed53?format=jpeg\" alt=\"msr pocketrocket deluxe\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Amazon</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3>Ounce counters will love the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Pocketrocket-Deluxe-Stove-Color-SIZE/dp/B07L5S65HR/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;linkCode=ll1&#38;tag=biipgf_022720_best-backpacking-camp-stoves-20&#38;linkId=0d5fed9ecb0e7addaa8db25c154e9f1e&#38;language=en_US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">MSR PocketRocket Deluxe</a>, which delivers outstanding performance in a tiny package. If you want to travel fast and light, this is the stove you need.&#160;</h3><p>MSR's original PocketRocket is an iconic piece of gear in the outdoor industry, setting new standards for lightweight performance from a backpacking stove. But the new Deluxe model takes things to a new level by adding a push-button starter and a regulator for improved control in cold environments.&#160;</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Pocketrocket-Deluxe-Stove-Color-SIZE/dp/B07L5S65HR/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;linkCode=ll1&#38;tag=biipgf_022720_best-backpacking-camp-stoves-20&#38;linkId=0d5fed9ecb0e7addaa8db25c154e9f1e&#38;language=en_US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">PocketRocket Deluxe</a> tips the scales at a mere 2.9 ounces, making it one of the more svelte stoves on the market. It also measures just 3.3 inches in length, which is considerably smaller than almost any other model. Despite the small size, it still manages to perform well, boiling water at a rapid clip and offering solid fuel efficiency, too. It even has an integrated simmer control and a solid level of wind resistance, which aren't common in similar stoves.</p><p>With this <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Pocketrocket-Deluxe-Stove-Color-SIZE/dp/B07L5S65HR/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;linkCode=ll1&#38;tag=biipgf_022720_best-backpacking-camp-stoves-20&#38;linkId=0d5fed9ecb0e7addaa8db25c154e9f1e&#38;language=en_US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">new-generation of PocketRocket</a>, MSR included an onboard igniter, eliminating the need to carry matches or a lighter. The igniter can be a source of frustration at times, though, as it's not always 100 percent reliable.&#160;</p><p>It's worth pointing out that this stove isn't a full cooking system, meaning you'll need to bring a pot to prepare your meal (and possibly to eat from). Those additional items take up space and add weight to your pack, potentially negating any shaved ounces from using the PocketRocket in the first place. Additionally, the stove's pot supports aren't very large and can create some instability when used on uneven ground.&#160;</p><p>Still, this little stove punches well above its weight class, delivering outstanding all-around performance in a tiny form factor. That alone makes it easy to recommend as the best ultralight backpacking stove available today.</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Weighs less than 3 ounces, yet is still fast, efficient, and powerful</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Built-in igniter can be finicky and pot supports aren't overly large</p>\n\tBest budget backpacking stove\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5e582344fee23d1fbb282d05?format=jpeg\" alt=\"BRS\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Amazon</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/BRS-Ultralight-Camping-Portable-Titanium/dp/B01AKF4USW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;linkCode=ll1&#38;tag=biipgf_022720_best-backpacking-camp-stoves-20&#38;linkId=1812556040fb925062129b949d6b5829&#38;language=en_US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener nofollow\">BRS 3000-T Ultralight</a> stove is a budget-conscious backpacker's dream.

It doesn't have a built-in starter, nor does it include simmer control or a regulator to help maintain performance in cold or windy conditions. The BRS 3000-T is the very definition of a basic backpacking stove, with just the bare minimum of features.&#160;</p><p>With that said, it does weigh less than an ounce and boils a liter of water in roughly three minutes. It also comes with a set of built-in pot holders that do a reasonably good job of maintaining balance even on rough terrain.

It's recommended that backpackers handle it with care as it isn't the most durable. The stove can also perform poorly in windy conditions and its small burner head delivers only average performance.&#160;</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Very inexpensive and lightweight compared to other models</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Not very durable and average performance in all but the best of outdoor conditions&#160;</p>\n\tBest backpacking stove for beginners\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5e582372fee23d2c5b5fa644?format=jpeg\" alt=\"jetboil flash\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Amazon</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Jetboil-Flash-Camping-Cooking-System/dp/B07N8HMPYF/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;linkCode=ll1&#38;tag=biipgf_022720_best-backpacking-camp-stoves-20&#38;linkId=0eb561d9793468c9d076fbc85be18b92&#38;language=en_US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">JetBoil Flash</a> offers excellent all-around performance and great features that make it especially beginner-friendly.

Like the MSR WindBurner, this model is an all-in-one solution that not only provides a stove but also a cooking pot wrapped in a protective outer shell. That's essentially all you need to prepare the dehydrated backpacking meals that have become increasingly popular in recent years.&#160;</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Jetboil-Flash-Camping-Cooking-System/dp/B07N8HMPYF/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;linkCode=ll1&#38;tag=biipgf_022720_best-backpacking-camp-stoves-20&#38;linkId=0eb561d9793468c9d076fbc85be18b92&#38;language=en_US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">JetBoil's</a> ease of use is one of its biggest strengths. Simply fill up the pot with water and you're ready to go. The entire system connects seamlessly to a gas canister, allowing the Flash to bring liquids to a boil in about three and a half minutes. That means you won't have to wait long to get a warm meal or a hot beverage.</p><p>With its built-in heat exchanger, the Flash remains efficient, even in shifting weather conditions and colder temperatures. While not as fuel-efficient as the WindBurner, it still does a decent job of getting as much performance out of a single canister as possible.</p><p>At 13.1 ounces, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Jetboil-Flash-Camping-Cooking-System/dp/B07N8HMPYF/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;linkCode=ll1&#38;tag=biipgf_022720_best-backpacking-camp-stoves-20&#38;linkId=0eb561d9793468c9d076fbc85be18b92&#38;language=en_US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">JetBoil Flash</a> falls into the middle ground concerning size and weight. Smaller stoves, such as the MSR PocketRocket Deluxe, are more compact and less bulky but don't include pots to prepare a meal, making the weight difference much closer than it seems. The Flash's modular design only enhances its reputation as an easy to use option, too.&#160;</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Fast and relatively efficient, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Jetboil-Flash-Camping-Cooking-System/dp/B07N8HMPYF/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;linkCode=ll1&#38;tag=biipgf_022720_best-backpacking-camp-stoves-20&#38;linkId=0eb561d9793468c9d076fbc85be18b92&#38;language=en_US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">JetBoil Flash</a> is extremely easy to operate, making it a great choice for beginners</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>No simmer control means the stove lacks subtle options when cooking a meal and its loss of efficiency in windy conditions is noticeable</p>\n\tBest travel backpacking stove\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5e58255cfee23d2edf335308?format=jpeg\" alt=\"msr whisperlite universal\" height=\"900\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Amazon</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/MSR-WhisperLite-Universal-Canister-Liquid/dp/B005I6P2VS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;linkCode=ll1&#38;tag=biipgf_022720_best-backpacking-camp-stoves-20&#38;linkId=82a679855dd13a33fff8abd0e0206bd8&#38;language=en_US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener nofollow sponsored\">MSR WhisperLite Universal</a> is easy to travel with and uses liquid fuel rather than traditional gas canisters, making it the best backpacking stove for those going abroad.</h3><p>Another mainstay in the MSR line-up, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/MSR-WhisperLite-Universal-Canister-Liquid/dp/B005I6P2VS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;linkCode=ll1&#38;tag=biipgf_022720_best-backpacking-camp-stoves-20&#38;linkId=82a679855dd13a33fff8abd0e0206bd8&#38;language=en_US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener nofollow sponsored\">WhisperLite Universal</a> is without a doubt the best option for backpackers traveling outside the U.S. This stove comes with its own canister which can be filled with a variety of fuels, including white gas, kerosene, or even unleaded gasoline. It even uses standard isobutane-propane canisters when available, allowing this a stove to go anywhere you're able to find a viable fuel source.&#160;</p><p>Compact and easy to carry, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/MSR-WhisperLite-Universal-Canister-Liquid/dp/B005I6P2VS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;linkCode=ll1&#38;tag=biipgf_022720_best-backpacking-camp-stoves-20&#38;linkId=82a679855dd13a33fff8abd0e0206bd8&#38;language=en_US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener nofollow sponsored\">WhisperLite Universal</a> heats up quickly and gets nearly two hours of burn time from a single canister of white gas. Its overall efficiency varies depending on the fuel but it typically boils a liter of water in under four minutes. The stove is also easy to use, supports large pots for feeding groups of campers, and is surprisingly quiet for a liquid gas model.</p><p>The downside of using this type of stove is that it requires routine maintenance to keep it performing optimally. This maintenance isn't particularly difficult but can be daunting and intimidating to newcomers.

When you're carrying your entire allotment of gear inside a backpack, it's vital to go small and lightweight. It's also important to find a stove that's highly fuel-efficient in order to reduce the number of gas canisters you'll need.&#160;</p><p>But those aren't the only features to consider. You'll also want to take into account the number of people the stove supports, the kind of fuel it uses, and how durable it is. As with all outdoor gear, your stove should be extremely reliable and easy to use, as well. After all, there's nothing quite like arriving at your campsite after sunset, exhausted and hungry, only to find your stove won't start.&#160;</p><h3>What else to consider</h3><p>It's also important to think about when and where you'll be using your camp stove. If you go backpacking in cold and windy conditions, you'll want a stove that quickly boils water without using excess fuel. The same holds true when hiking at higher altitudes, where thinner air has a dramatic impact on efficiency.&#160;</p><p>If this sounds too complex or overwhelming, fret not. There are plenty of reliable backpacking stoves to choose from, many of which are lightweight, compact, and fast. In fact, we've field-tested a crop of stoves currently available and came away impressed. There are now options available for just about every type of backpacker with any kind of budget.&#160;</p>\n\tHow we test backpacking stoves\n\t\n\t<p>Each stove featured in this guide went through a series of on-trail tests to see how well it held up across these four categories:&#160;<strong>Portability, weight, dependability,&#160;</strong>and <strong>value</strong>. Here's how each category specifically factored into which backpacking stoves ultimately made this guide:</p><ul><li><strong>Weight:&#160;</strong>For literally anything backpacking-related, weight is perhaps&#160;<em>the</em> most important consideration. Even if you're not an ultralight backpacker, counting down to the ounce is common practice, and your camp stove is no different. During each test, we loaded a backpack with roughly 20 pounds of gear (sleeping bag, clothing, food, headlamps, etc.) and would spend one to two days with the stove in our backpack, and at least one day with it in someone else's. This helped us judge just how much of a difference those ounces truly made.</li><li><strong>Portability:&#160;</strong>Though weight may first come to mind when assessing how portable a camp stove is, we also judged how well the stove packed down, whether into itself or as pieces that were easily packable. A highly portable backpacking stove shouldn't take up much valuable room in your pack, and also shouldn't be so many separate pieces that you feel like you're assembling a jigsaw puzzle each day.&#160;</li><li><strong>Dependability:&#160;</strong>Setting up camp after a grueling day on the trail can turn sour&#160;<em>very</em> quickly if the stove you're about to rely on for sustenance doesn't work (and this is doubly true when the weather starts to turn wet, cold, and windy). We've tested these stoves in hot weather often but also made sure to put them through their paces when the wind and rain picked up. For these, we had to resort to doing so in our backyard, though time spent on-trail this winter will allow for further testing.</li><li><strong>Value:&#160;</strong>The value of a backpacking camp stove isn't just how much it costs but more so a combination of the three categories before it, as well as what it's final sticker price. You want something that's dependable and often that means spending a little more for something you can rely on (as opposed to spending less, more often on an inferior stove).&#160;</li></ul>\n\tCheck out more Insider Reviews Outdoors coverage\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5ebc0550578532722f212f15?format=jpeg\" alt=\"camping trip\" height=\"828\" width=\"1104\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">REI Co-op</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-sleeping-bags\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The best sleeping bags</a></h3><p>Whether you're on the hunt for an ultra-comfy backcountry sleeping bag or need a budget-friendly option to round out your kit, we tested dozens from brands like REI Co-op and Big Agnes to find the industry's best.&#160;</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/camping-essentials-list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The essential camping pack list</a></h3><p>Packing for a camping trip isn't just about throwing a tent and sleeping bag into the back of your car &#8212; it's a science.

href=\"https://www.270towin.com/states/ohio\">six times</a> in the last 12 years and currently possesses 18 electoral votes. But after the state voted Democrat for President Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, it characteristically swung right once again in 2016 and voted for Trump over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton by <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1zxyOQDjNOJS_UkzerorUCf2OAdcMcIQEwRciKuYBIZ4/pubhtml/sheet?headers=false&gid=6587268026802\">8.1 percentage points</a>.&#160;&#160;</p><p>According to election forecasting from <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/ohio/\">FiveThirtyEight</a>, Trump currently has just a 51% chance of winning in Ohio. <a href=\"https://forecast.decisiondeskhq.com/president/P2020OH\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"100\" data-uri=\"edfbe557d3ccde38f66725ce096e16f8\">Similar forecasting</a> from Decision Desk HQ shows Trump with a 55.6% chance of emerging victorious in the state.</p><p>In DDHQ simulations, only 7% of instances where Trump wins a second term in office are accompanied by a loss in Ohio. Conversely, simulations show a second Trump term accompanied by a win in the Ohio 93% of the time.&#160;</p><p>But while Trump is narrowly predicted to win by election forecasters, recent polling shows that Biden may be gaining an edge in the Buckeye State. Polling from October 8 to October 12 by <a href=\"https://poll.qu.edu/georgia/release-detail?ReleaseID=3679\">Quinnipiac University</a> estimates Biden leading Trump by 1 percentage point among likely voters in the state.&#160;</p><p>According to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MediumBuying/status/1318195004578422785\">Medium Buying</a>, a media buying and tracking company based out of Ohio, the Trump campaign recently cancelled scheduled television ads in Ohio. This comes just one week after reports of the Trump <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-campaign-nearly-went-broke-amid-200-million-budget-shortfall-2020-10\">campaign nearly going broke</a>, so campaign officials may be reconfiguring its spending to what it deems to be more crucial at this time, though it is difficult to find a more important race at the moment.</p><p>According to Kiel Williams, an author at DDHQ, losing in Ohio would severely hurt Trump's chances in nearby battleground states.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\"Ohio is also emblematic of the winning coalition Trump assembled in 2016: a Midwestern Rust Belt state, where supercharged rural support propelled Trump to victory following back-to-back Obama wins,\" Williams said. \"If Trump has lost enough support to lose Ohio, he has almost certainly lost Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania as well.\"</p><p dir=\"ltr\">If the Trump campaign is to win over undecided voters in the Rust Belt, it must act quickly before it is too late.</p><p>As of October 19, <a href=\"https://electproject.github.io/Early-Vote-2020G/index.html\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"100\" data-uri=\"92235dcf49c8479097fa7c34970cf487\">over 28 million people</a> have already cast their votes through mail-in and early voting in an election expected to receive the most mailed votes in US history.

tank at Stanford University, has quickly consolidated influence on the task force in recent months as he's advocated for strategies that are more in line with the president's rejection of strict restrictions to mitigate the spread of the virus.&#160;</p><p>The Post reported he's pushed hard for a herd-immunity approach to the pandemic, which occurs when enough of a population develops resistance to a disease, whether through exposure or a vaccine, to interrupt the virus' spread. Top experts have said that allowing COVID-19 to spread through the country unchecked could lead to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/tom-frieden-herd-immunity-wrong-solution-coronavirus/2020/10/16/acb4ae8a-0fe6-11eb-8074-0e943a91bf08_story.html\">half a million US deaths</a> from the virus, which has killed nearly 220,000 Americans as of Monday afternoon.&#160;</p><p>Atlas, who was tapped by Trump to join the task force in August after repeated appearances on Fox News, in a statement to The Post rejected the notion he's advocated a herd-immunity strategy, but <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-coronavirus-scott-atlas-herd-immunity/2020/08/30/925e68fe-e93b-11ea-970a-64c73a1c2392_story.html\">multiple reports suggest otherwise</a>.</p><p>Over the weekend, Twitter removed a tweet from Atlas that misleadingly told the public that face masks don't help to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Trump has also pushed against wearing masks or face coverings, contradicting his advisors and a mountain of evidence that masks are a vital tool in preventing the spread of COVID-19.&#160;</p><p>Atlas' presence on the coronavirus task force has created tension within the unit and seen top advisors like Fauci and Birx increasingly sidelined, according to The Post. Atlas has also challenged the analysis of Birx and other top officials with \"junk science,\" three senior administration officials told The Post.</p><p>The president on Monday <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/anthony-fauci-donald-trump-coronavirus-restrictions-election-2020-10\">attacked Fauci during a campaign call</a> and referred to him as a \"disaster,\" CNN reported.</p><p>\"People are saying whatever. Just leave us alone. They're tired of it. People are tired of hearing Fauci and all these idiots,\" Trump said, according to CNN, adding,&#160;\"If I listened to him, we'd have 500,000 deaths.\"</p><p>A few hours later, Trump also <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-ridicules-fauci-for-worst-first-pitch-in-baseball-history-2020-10\">mocked the infectious-disease expert's baseball skills on Twitter</a>.</p><p>\"Tony should stop wearing the Washington Nationals' Mask for two reasons. Number one, it is not up to the high standards that he should be exposing,\" the president tweeted. \"Number two, it keeps reminding me that Tony threw out perhaps the worst first pitch in the history of Baseball!\"</p><p>Trump was diagnosed with COVID-19 earlier this month and subsequently hospitalized. Top public-health experts have <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/disease-experts-surprised-by-us-response-coronavirus-pandemic-2020-3\">pointed to his response</a> as a key factor in the US outbreak spiraling out of control.

They'd also <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/missing-lemur-was-found-returned-safely-san-francisco-zoo-2020-10\">found evidence of forced entry at the enclosure</a>.</p><p>The search was on for Maki and his suspected kidnapper. San Francisco Police opened a case, and officers and zookeepers called on the public to help them find the ring-tailed lemur – a member of an endangered species whose median life expectancy is around 16 years.</p><p>Zoo officials even offered a $2,100 reward for information leading to Maki's safe retrieval.</p><p>\"We understand that lemurs are adorable animals, but Maki is a highly endangered animal that requires special care. We are asking the public for help in his return,\" Dr. Jason Watters, the zoo's executive vice president of animal behavior and wellness, <a href=\"https://abc7news.com/san-francisco-zoo-missing-lemur-maki-police/7031021/\">told ABC 7</a>.</p><p>Fortunately, the search ended quickly. On Thursday, 5-year-old James Trinh was leaving preschool when he spotted Maki in the parking by his school's playground. Trinh attends the Hope Lutheran Day School in Daly City, just 5 miles from the zoo.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f8df5189e9fe4001900a345?format=jpeg\" alt=\"maki the lemur 2\" height=\"3000\" width=\"2250\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Maki the lemur, December 17, 2018.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Marianne V.

results miss expectations.</p><p><a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/jpm-stock\">JPMorgan</a> held a call with investors last Wednesday to gauge sentiments ahead of Election Day. Many speakers and market participants said they see a so-called blue wave solidifying, with little time left for President Donald Trump to shift momentum in his favor, the bank said in a recap note on Monday.</p><p>Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, has enjoyed a consistent lead in what's shaping up to be \"the most stable election in modern history,\" the bank said, leaving investors to position for a Democratic sweep.</p><p>All eyes are now on Senate races, as stimulus hinges on Congress' makeup. Markets expect frontloaded stimulus as a Biden administration works to pull the US economy out of its virus-induced downturn. The projection marks a stark shift from past months when investors viewed a split Congress as the best outcome.</p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-picks-to-buy-etf-strategy-cathie-wood-ark-invest-2020-10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cathie Wood runs 5 funds that more than doubled broader market returns in the 3rd quarter.

More than 26 million votes had been cast as of Saturday, representing nearly a fifth of all votes cast in the 2016 presidential election. With 21 states able to start counting ballots early, results could arrive on or soon after Election Day on November 3 and allay fears of a significant delay.</p><p>Economists and lawmakers have repeatedly called for fresh stimulus ahead of the election, but the chance of such a deal is fading fast. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Sunday imposed a 48-hour deadline for negotiations with the White House, seeking to fast-track the talks after three months of sluggish progress.</p><p>Even if the two groups reach a deal, Senate Republicans oppose a large bill. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has indicated the body could vote on a $500 billion proposal as soon as Tuesday. But Senate Democrats are poised to block the measure, diminishing hopes for near-term fiscal support.</p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-picks-to-buy-small-companies-recommendations-high-upside-rbc-2020-10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-analytics-position=\"4\" data-analytics-module=\"\">Buy these 7 unheralded stocks right now for near-term upside of at least 25% as growth accelerates to a new level, RBC says</a></em></p><p>Investors still might not get the stimulus boost they're hoping for should a blue wave materialize. Democrats would need at least 60 Senate seats or the elimination of the filibuster to completely control Congress. Participants on the call described stimulus approval in a lame-duck session as \"unlikely,\" JPMorgan said.</p><p>In all, an orderly transfer of power and Senate election outcomes would overshadow the winner of the presidential race, JPMorgan said. A split Congress under a Biden administration is now viewed as the worst outcome for the S&#38;P 500, as it would likely yield the same stimulus stalemate.</p><p>Investors should pay attention to Senate races in swing states and to chatter about a Biden Cabinet, as both would play critical roles in economic policy moving forward, the bank added.</p><p><em><strong>Now read more markets coverage from Markets Insider and Business Insider:</strong></em></p><p><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/investing-strategy-4-stocks-to-buy-market-leaders-nancy-zevenbergen-2020-10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nancy Zevenbergen is in the top 1% of investors over the past 5 years.

There is one more measure in addition to widespread mask wearing, handwashing, and social distancing that is essential to combatting the virus' spread, and preventing more deaths, and it is not being done enough: Get people who've been exposed to the virus away from everybody else, fast.&#160;</p><p>Ryan said this concept, called quarantining, is his single \"golden wish\" to improve the state of the pandemic.&#160;</p><p>\"As a public health physician, if I was asked for one thing that could improve that might change the game here, that is: making sure that each and every contact of a confirmed case is in quarantine for the appropriate period of time, so as to break chains of transmission,\" he said.&#160;</p><h2>Quarantining works.

Its velour tracksuits and matching oversized bags were everything and everywhere. But Juicy went from making $605 million in sales at its peak in 2008 to being sold for less than a third of that five years later. So, what happened?</p><p>Juicy's story begins with these two ladies, Gela Nash-Taylor and Pamela Skaist-Levy. They met while working at a Los Angeles boutique in 1988. When Nash-Taylor became pregnant, she couldn't find any fashionable maternity clothing. As a solution, she started making maternity pants out of her husband's jeans, which inspired her and Skaist-Levy to start a maternity clothing line, Travis Jeans for the Baby in You. The pair's stylish maternity jeans took off, despite their $89 price tag.</p><p>By the early 1990s, it expanded into a full maternity line. But around 1994, after feeling like they lost touch with the maternity market, the pair decided to pivot to something new: developing the perfect luxury V-neck shirt. Nash-Taylor and Skaist-Levy focused on four things: fit, fabric, comfort, and color. They both tried on their samples to make sure the V-neck covered the right part of the arm, didn't plunge too deep, and, overall, made your body look as good as possible, things male designers fitting T-shirts on size 0 models maybe weren't taking into consideration. After perfecting their design, they released it in 26 colors under their new label, Juicy Couture.</p><p>When Juicy first started in 1995, the economy was beginning to recover from the 1990 to 1991 recession, and consumers were hungry for expensive, or at least expensive-sounding, products. So Nash-Taylor and Skaist-Levy wanted the brand name to convey luxury. They also loved the irony of naming their casual T-shirt line \"couture.\" Juicy Couture quickly grew in popularity and expanded to include knit tops, accessories, and a successful Juicy Jeans line. But it wasn't the full-fledged lifestyle brand its founders wanted it to be...yet.</p><p>Nash-Taylor and Skaist-Levy looked to the brands they grew up with during the '60s and '70s for ideas. Both thought terry cloth was \"the most amazing 1970s fabric\" and came up with a line of tops and bottoms made from it.</p><p>The silhouette of what would become Juicy's signature tracksuit was created with the same purpose as the original Juicy V-neck: to be as flattering as possible. The zip-up hoodie was designed with front pockets to hide any stomach pooch and cut with an hourglass shape to nip in your waist. Nash-Taylor and Skaist-Levy also added custom hardware: a J-pull zipper that branded every tracksuit as uniquely Juicy Couture.</p><p>The tracksuit bottoms were originally made with an underwear elastic, but when that proved to be too loose, Juicy's founders switched to a quick cord they'd used for their maternity line. It worked perfectly. Juicy Couture released its now iconic tracksuits in 2001, and they became a phenomenon.</p><p>Not to mention, at $155, Juicy Couture's tracksuits weren't cheap, but they were accessible.</p><p><strong>Julia DiNardo:</strong> The price point was a little bit high for essentially a glorified sweatshirt, but with a little bit of midriff showing, the cool bootleg, and seeing celebrities in some oversized sunglasses wearing it out and about, it kind of met that balance of just-within-reach pricing and somewhat of a luxury item pooled into one.</p><p><strong>Kim:</strong> And it was seeing celebrities wear Juicy Couture that really drove the brand's success. Around the time Juicy Couture launched, tabloid celebrities like Paris Hilton and Lindsay Lohan were becoming a national obsession. Tabloids like Us Weekly and People were documenting everything America's favorite stars were doing, and Juicy was able to take advantage of it. Because its founders didn't have the funds for traditional marketing, they got creative, gifting tracksuits to celebrities.</p><p>While this is pretty common today, Skaist-Levy and Nash-Taylor were one of the first to do it. They didn't find success overnight, but eventually Juicy's tracksuits were being seen on all the right celebrities.</p><p><strong>DiNardo:</strong> The attraction to celebrity culture in the early 2000s is really what contributed Juicy to become such a popular brand. It really was the height of: \"Celebrities! They're just like us.\" Seeing Britney Spears go get a cup of coffee at Starbucks in her Juicy Couture tracksuits, seeing Paris Hilton shopping all over town in her Juicy Couture tracksuit.</p><p><strong>Kim:</strong> Juicy's founders even kept a photo wall of every celebrity who wore their tracksuit. Soon, Juicy Couture was exclusively sold at upscale department stores like Bergdorf Goodman and Saks Fifth Avenue. In 2003, Juicy Couture was purchased by Liz Claiborne, now known as Kate Spade &#38; Company, for $226 million to be paid over a five-year period.</p><p>Juicy was colorful, fun, and covered in logos during a time when people couldn't get enough of showing off the brands they were buying and wearing.</p><p><strong>DiNardo:</strong> It wouldn't be a Juicy product without the Juicy label or insignia or logo of some kind.</p><p><strong>Skaist-Levy:</strong> It makes people happy.</p><p><strong>Nash-Taylor:</strong> Juicy, it is, it's a happy brand. People love it.</p><p><strong>Kim:</strong> Net sales nearly doubled from 2006 to 2007. By 2008, Juicy Couture had 100 stores generating a total of $605 million in sales. The brand also expanded to include jewelry and a successful fragrance line with Elizabeth Arden. But then the recession hit.</p><p>While most brands struggled following the recession, Juicy Couture's flashy branding particularly stopped resonating with customers.</p><p><strong>DiNardo:</strong> So, during the 2008 recession, fashion was at a point where the \"it\" bag was really not an \"it\" thing anymore. It felt a little bit too gregarious, over the top, and proud in the wrong way, so things started to recede; not that people weren't shopping, but they weren't buying things that were so blatant as to what they were and how much they cost.</p><p><strong>Kim:</strong> The recession inspired a movement towards minimalism, which was pretty much the opposite of what Juicy Couture embodied.</p><p><strong>DiNardo:</strong> Juicy as a label was all about that flashiness and that fun. And so, there was a somberness to fashion, a seriousness, after 2008, and it really wasn't on-brand for Juicy.</p><p><strong>Kim:</strong> Sales fell 11% year-over-year in 2009. In 2010, founders Skaist-Levy and Nash-Taylor left the company, citing a loss of ability to help their brand evolve. Sale numbers continued to drop as Juicy failed to keep up with the growing contemporary fashion market. While labels like Alexander Wang and Theory quickly pivoted to add more pieces to their collections, Juicy didn't.</p><p>In 2013, Juicy Couture was officially sold to Authentic Brands Group for $195 million. The company has an eclectic portfolio, including the licensing rights for the estates of Elvis Presley and Marilyn Monroe. The group announced plans to close all of Juicy Couture's US stores but said it would reopen five to 10 as it rebuilds the brand. ABG later made a deal with discount retailer Kohl's to sell Juicy-branded products, effectively abandoning the brand's veneer of luxury for many loyal fans.</p><p>Despite its fall from department store to discount bin, Juicy Couture has been angling for a comeback for years. A 2016 collaboration with cult fashion brand Vetements re-sparked interested and lent Juicy some street cred. <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/kylie-jenner-juicy-couture-2017-1\">Kylie Jenner even posted a picture wearing a pricey tracksuit from the collection.</a></p><p>In 2017, Juicy Couture appointed Hollywood stylist Jamie Mizrahi as its new creative director. The brand debuted its new collection with a New York Fashion Week party with OG Juicy Couture lover and living brand embodiment Paris Hilton. Pieces from the collection were available on Juicy's website, as well as Nordstrom and Bloomingdale's, with prices ranging from $30 to $400. This marked an upscale pivot for the brand after being sold at Kohl's since 2014.</p><p>In 2018, Juicy Couture released its first-ever runway collection to show pieces from its main contemporary line, Juicy Couture Black Label. It also released two new cosmetic collections, which have been met with varying degrees of excitement. As for whether we'll be seeing Juicy's tracksuit everywhere again:</p><p><strong>DiNardo:</strong> I think they could capitalize on those customers that were in their teens or late teens when the brand was popular.

The chart below shows the difference.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>When we get a flu shot, we don't think about the 10-plus years of work that made it possible to inject that syringe into our arm. But the coronavirus pandemic has catapulted the vaccine-development process into the global spotlight, with people around the world tuned into the race between pharmaceutical companies.&#160;&#160;</p><p>That attention has also has brought up questions about how vaccines actually work.</p><p>None of the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-vaccine-timeline-what-to-watch-leading-research-2020-3\">leading vaccine candidates in the US</a> inject the actual virus, SARS-CoV-2, into the body, contrary to popular myth. Instead, they all rely on a harmless segment of the virus to spur the production of antibodies — Y-shaped proteins that ward off infection.</p><p>\"Your immune system is like an antibody factory,\" Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said at a Senate hearing last month. He added:&#160;\"If at some time in the future, the actual virus enters your body, your factory can quickly pull out the blueprints and ramp up production, wiping up that virus before it has a chance to multiply and make you sick.\"</p><p>Vaccines kickstart that antibody factory in people who haven't been exposed to the virus. But there are various ways to do that. The six candidates backed by Operation Warp Speed — the Trump administration's effort to develop, manufacture, and distribute a coronavirus vaccine — rely on three different technologies to stimulate an immune response.</p><p>Two candidates, from Novavax and a Sanofi-GlaxoSmithKline partnership, inject a protein found on the surface of the coronavirus directly into the body. Another two, from AstraZeneca and Johnson &#38; Johnson, introduce a coronavirus gene to the body using a genetically engineered common-cold virus. The final two candidates, from Moderna and Pfizer, use a snippet of the coronavirus' genome to encourage antibody production.</p><p>Here's a rundown of the differences between the three types of vaccines:</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f6e276aa5fb5800198b2e98?format=jpeg\" alt=\"three types of coronavirus vaccines in development infographic\" height=\"1219\" width=\"1667\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Shayanne Gal/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h2>Protein-based vaccine: the slower, traditional method</h2><p>When scientists were developing the hepatitis B vaccine in the 1980s, they discovered that they could grow that virus' surface protein in the lab. Researchers are now attempting to do something similar with the coronavirus.</p><p>The virus consists of four structural proteins, one of which is a spike protein that helps it attach to and invade human cells. A person infected with the coronavirus naturally develops antibodies that neutralize this spike protein, so some vaccines try to mimic that effect.</p><p>Both Novavax and Sanofi-GSK are developing vaccines using a synthesized version of the spike protein, which they grow in insect cells. The protein is then purified and injected into the body. Collins said that process is \"tried and true,\" but it's a bit slower than the technologies used by other candidates.</p><p>Novavax and Sanofi-GSK haven't started phase-three US trials on their protein-based vaccines yet. The former plans to begin a global phase-three study in October, while Sanofi-GSK hopes to start its phase-three trial in December.</p><p>Both vaccines require an adjuvant, a chemical agent that boosts the immune response. This can sometimes cause pain or swelling at the injection site. But the shots' advantage is that they could be stored at regular refrigerator temperature, making them easier to ship than some other leading candidates.</p><h2>Viral vector vaccine: the hearty immune response</h2><p>Instead of directly injecting the spike protein into the body, vector vaccines rely on a middleman: a less harmful class of virus called an adenovirus, which can cause the common cold. Researchers attach a gene for the spike protein to the back of an adenovirus, which then acts as a delivery truck to drop that gene off inside the body. The adenovirus is disabled before it's injected, so it won't replicate inside the body.</p><p>The process triggers the production of the actual spike protein, which our body recognizes as a foreign invader. That leads the immune system to produce antibodies to neutralize it.&#160;</p><p>This approach isn't new — it dates back to the 1980s — but only one viral vector vaccine has been ever been licensed for human use: Sanofi's Dengue vaccine.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f762e6a74fe5b0018a8e908?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Johnson &#38; Johnson coronavirus vaccine clinical trial, volunteer dosed with experimental COVID-19 vaccine\" height=\"4016\" width=\"6016\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A volunteer participates in Johnson &#38; Johnson&#39;s coronavirus vaccine trial.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Janssen</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>One advantage of a vector vaccine is that it can produce a robust immune response without an adjuvant. But developers must strike a careful balance: The vaccine dose should be high enough to induce an immune response, but low enough that the body doesn't overreact with aggressive inflammation.</p><p>The adenovirus used also can't be common, since people with prior exposure would fight it off before it could deliver the spike protein gene. (AstraZeneca's vaccine uses a chimpanzee adenovirus to alleviate that problem.)&#160;</p><p>Though the technology has shown promise, the two leading developers of coronavirus vector vaccines — AstraZeneca and Johnson &#38; Johnson — have both <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-vaccine-timeline-what-to-watch-leading-research-2020-3\">put their US trials on hold</a> to investigate unexplained illnesses in participants. If approved, AstraZeneca's vaccine would require two shots, taken four weeks apart. Johnson &#38; Johnson is testing one shot at the moment, but the company's chief scientific officer, Paul Stoffels, has said <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-johnson-johnson/jj-kicks-off-study-of-single-shot-covid-19-vaccine-in-60000-volunteers-idUSKCN26E27Q\">a second dose could be administered</a> down the line.</p><p>The vector approach may pose challenges for booster shots, though, since the body may recognize the adenovirus and attack it right away.&#160;</p><h2>mRNA vaccine: the new kid on the block</h2><p>RNA vaccines are often referred to as \"the vaccines of the future,\" since the technology is fairly new; early clinical results were <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6446947/\">just starting to emerge</a> before the pandemic. No vaccine using this technology has ever been approved for human use. But now, RNA vaccines are poised to become the first coronavirus shots on the market.</p><p>Moderna and Pfizer's phase-three human trials are currently neck-and-neck. Pfizer hopes to show that its vaccine is effective by the end of this month. Moderna has pinpointed November as the most likely release date for its results.&#160;</p><p>Both vaccines use a small piece of messenger RNA (mRNA) from the coronavirus genome to deliver a gene for the spike protein into the body. The RNA is encased in a lipid molecule that carries it across a cell membrane. From there, it sends a coded message to the body to produce the spike protein.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f1ef660f34d05246811c757?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Nurse Kath Olmstead, right, gives volunteer Melissa Harting, of Harpersville, N.Y., an injection as the world&#39;s biggest study of a possible COVID-19 vaccine, developed by the National Institutes of Health and Moderna Inc., gets underway Monday, July 27, 2020, in Binghamton, N.Y.\" height=\"2991\" width=\"4119\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Nurse Kath Olmstead gives volunteer Melissa Harting an injection of Moderna&#39;s coronavirus vaccine in Binghamton, New York, on July 27.\n<p class=\"copyright\">AP Photo/Hans Pennink</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Unlike vector or protein-based vaccines, mRNA vaccines stimulate the production of killer T cells, which stop the coronavirus from replicating. Another advantage is that mRNA can't cause an infection on its own — though that doesn't mean the vaccine won't have side effects.</p><p>Since the body breaks down mRNA quickly, these vaccines may require a booster shot. Participants in Moderna's trial are receiving two shots 28 days apart. Pfizer is delivering two shots three weeks apart.</p><p>Because mRNA vaccines are grown in test tubes or tanks instead of cells, they should be relatively easy and quick to produce. But there are challenges when delivering and storing them: Pfizer's vaccine needs to be shipped at -94 degrees Fahrenheit and Moderna's at -4 degrees Fahrenheit. In Pfizer's case, that would require vaccination sites to have deep freezers or dry ice on hand.</p><h2>More reliable than a flu vaccine</h2><p>A coronavirus vaccine needs to be at least 50% effective to get emergency authorization from the Food and Drug Administration. But experts hope for better than that: Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he would \"settle\" for a vaccine that's 70% to 75% effective. That may be enough to achieve herd immunity in the US if everyone gets a shot.</p><p>\"The best we've ever done is measles, which is 97% to 98% effective,\" Fauci <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/28/health/fauci-coronavirus-vaccine-contact-tracing-aspen/index.html\">told CNN</a> in June. \"That would be wonderful if we get there. I don't think we will.\"</p><p>Experts anticipate that the coronavirus vaccine will at the very least be more reliable than the yearly flu vaccine, which was <a href=\"https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/932995#:~:text=The%20influenza%20vaccine%20was%2039,a%20meeting%20of%20the%20Advisory\">39% effective</a> this past flu season.</p><p>\"If I had to guess, I would say this is probably a better virus for a vaccine to really work well than the influenza virus, which is a tough one because it's changing every year,\" Collins said.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-not-mutating-to-spread-genetics-show-2020-9\">coronavirus mutates far more slowly</a> than the flu, so researchers think a vaccine will remain effective over a longer time.</p><p>In total, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-vaccine-timeline-what-to-watch-leading-research-2020-3\">193 coronavirus vaccine research projects</a> are in progress worldwide.</p><p>\"Having this mix of strategies is the best insurance against some unexpected problem with safety or efficacy,\" Collins said. \"We hope and expect that more than one of these will succeed.\"</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

The mix is designed to mimic Earth's breathable air.</p><p>But in September 2019, the standard leak rate increased slightly. That wasn't considered any major risk, but in August 2020, that already elevated rate increased fivefold, from 0.6 to 3.1 pounds of air per day, according to Russian news agency <a href=\"https://ria.ru/20201015/mks-1579976642.html\">Ria Novosti</a>. So over the last two months, crew members <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/nasa-roscosmos-found-leak-on-international-space-station-2020-9\">hunted for the leak</a> by isolating sections of the station and monitoring their pressure changes.</p><p>At first, crew members hunkered down in the Zvezda module while they tested the ship's other sections; when they couldn't find evidence of leaks in those sections, they determined the leak was <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/nasa-narrows-source-of-leak-on-space-station-2-areas-2020-9\">likely in Zvezda itself</a>.

But they still couldn't find the leak's exact location.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f74f56c0ab50d00184ad71d?format=jpeg\" alt=\"transferchamber\" height=\"664\" width=\"1000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Astronaut Jeffrey Ashby moves into the International Space Station&#39;s Zvezda Service Module with a video camera on May 25, 2011.\n<p class=\"copyright\">NASA</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Then came the tea-leaf trick.</p><p>\"We believe that we have really identified the probable leakage area,\" Ivanishin said, according to <a href=\"https://tass.com/science/1212465#:~:text=Russian%20cosmonauts%20trace%20air%20leak%20aboard%20orbital%20outpost%20with%20tea%20bag,-The%20tea%20bag's&text=MOSCOW%2C%20October%2015.&text=As%20Russia's%20State%20Space%20Corporation,the%20crew's%20life%20and%20health.0health.\">Russian news agency TASS.</a></p><p>The tape the crew put over the crack can remain stable and sticky across a wide range of temperatures, including the near-absolute zero of space. But the members don't think the tape is likely to hold for long; they hope to replace it with a more reliable patch soon.&#160;</p><p>\"Perhaps we should try hard patches our partners have? We can talk with them. This is because the current patch is not so efficient,\" one crew member said, <a href=\"https://tass.com/science/1212945\">according to TASS</a>.</p><p>Roscosmos did not respond to Business Insider's questions in time for publication, but the agency noted in a tweet that it is \"working out a program of operations to permanently seal the leak location.\"</p><p>NASA spokesperson Daniel Huot told Business Insider that the leak \"continues to pose no immediate danger to the crew at the current leak rate.\"&#160;</p><h2><strong>Not the first problem on the space station's Russian side</strong></h2><p>The leak is one of several recent issues on the space station, which is starting to show its age after outlasting its <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/missions/highlights/webcasts/shuttle/sts110/iss-qa.html\">15-year life expectancy</a> by five years.&#160;</p><p>The station's Russian segment houses some of the station's oldest modules. In the last few months, it has seen <a href=\"https://balthazarkorab.com/2020/10/10/toilet-breaks-in-russian-module-on-iss/\">a toilet go bust</a> and temperatures <a href=\"https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Temperature_Increasing_on_Russian_Zvezda_Module_as_Air_Continues_to_Leak_From_ISS_999.html\">mysteriously increase</a>. Then on Wednesday, the segment's <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/international-space-station-oxygen-supply-system-failure-2020-10\">oxygen supply system broke down</a>. Crew members fixed the system by Saturday, according to Roscosmos.</p><p>But in aggregate, the failures are indications that the Russian side of the ISS is probably in need of upgrades.</p><p>\"All modules of the Russian segment are exhausted,\" cosmonaut Gennady Padalka <a href=\"https://ria.ru/20201015/kosmos-1579901308.html\">told Ria Novosti</a>.</p><p>This latest leak also wasn't the first on the Russian side. In August 2018, crew members <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/international-space-station-small-air-leak-nasa-says-no-danger-2020-8\">discovered a 2-millimeter drill hole</a> in part of a Russian Soyuz spaceship that was docked to the station.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f4ebe03e6ff30001d4e67f3?format=jpeg\" alt=\"drill hole soyuz\" height=\"562\" width=\"1300\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Left: A hole that appears drilled into part of a Soyuz spacecraft at the International Space Station. Right: A patch made by the crew using epoxy.\n<p class=\"copyright\">NASA via Chris Bergin/Twitter</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>The hole seemed to stem from a manufacturing defect; someone on Earth had apparently plugged it with paint, hoping nobody would notice. The paint, it appeared, later broke off. Cosmonauts eventually patched that hole with epoxy sealant.</p><p><em data-stringify-type=\"italic\">Katya Ionova contributed translation assistance for this story.</em></p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/astronauts-cosmonauts-found-space-station-leak-using-tea-leaves-2020-10'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=ERKK9NsLLUA:c7O-RTfEaQE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=ERKK9NsLLUA:c7O-RTfEaQE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=ERKK9NsLLUA:c7O-RTfEaQE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=ERKK9NsLLUA:c7O-RTfEaQE:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=ERKK9NsLLUA:c7O-RTfEaQE:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=ERKK9NsLLUA:c7O-RTfEaQE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=ERKK9NsLLUA:c7O-RTfEaQE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=ERKK9NsLLUA:c7O-RTfEaQE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/ERKK9NsLLUA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 21:31:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f8ddc379e9fe4001900a2a6?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"4392660cf87aa29bcfee2a699bff2e80","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn19@2020_1/2020/10/20/02-05-12-887_c2a6cc3505b0aef8.webp","destWidth":1778,"destHeight":1334,"sourceBytes":175294,"destBytes":175294,"author":"insider@insider.com (Susie Neilson)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5f8ddda69e9fe4001900a2af?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn99@2020_2/2020/10/20/02-05-22-378_984a2ad860b0463f.webp","https://i.insider.com/5f4ebe95e6ff30001d4e67f4?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn100@2020_3/2020/10/20/02-05-21-400_675a0ab66750326b.webp","https://i.insider.com/5f74f56c0ab50d00184ad71d?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn11@2020_6/2020/10/20/02-05-23-054_fd069121f385cb62.webp","https://i.insider.com/5f4ebe03e6ff30001d4e67f3?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn79@2020_6/2020/10/20/02-05-22-860_cd8123b78cf9cb9b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn67@2020_3/2020/10/20/02-05-22-757_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=ERKK9NsLLUA:c7O-RTfEaQE:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn52@2020_5/2020/10/20/02-05-19-401_1ec57d5ab37d4775.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=ERKK9NsLLUA:c7O-RTfEaQE:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn64@2020_1/2020/10/20/02-05-20-406_0f217194453bef40.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn79@2020_1/2020/10/20/02-05-18-571_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=ERKK9NsLLUA:c7O-RTfEaQE:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn4@2020_2/2020/10/20/02-05-22-214_398b4bdc1b87e47a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/ERKK9NsLLUA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn84@2020_4/2020/10/20/02-05-24-385_ed3dac9d409a5312.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603159473358},{"createdTime":"2020-10-20 10:04:33","updatedTime":"2020-10-20 10:04:33","title":"Republicans and Democrats are clashing over another stimulus package.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/mcconnell-stimulus-package-coronavirus-relief-compromise-white-house-democrats-2020-10\">suggested on Thursday</a> that he wouldn't put a brokered deal up for a floor vote.</p><p>Here's a breakdown of seven policy disagreements that are holding up another stimulus package.</p><h2>Cost</h2><p>Democrats have insisted on at least $2.2 trillion in additional spending to prop up people, businesses, and public-health agencies. The House <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/house-democrats-stimulus-plan-congress-unemployment-economy-pass-vote-bill-2020-9\">earlier this month</a> passed a slimmed-down version of the $3.4 trillion Heroes Act from May.

In recent weeks, the White House has increased the amount it's willing to spend.

They've argued that unemployment remains high in an economy displaying renewed signs of weakness, such as slowing job growth.</p><p>The Trump administration offered a $400 weekly federal supplement. Some Republicans are still critical, saying it would disincentivize work and set back the economic recovery.</p><h2>Coronavirus testing</h2><p>Pelosi and <a href=\"https://energycommerce.house.gov/newsroom/press-releases/pallone-on-administration-s-covid-19-relief-proposal\">other Democrats</a> have cited the lack of a national coronavirus testing and tracing strategy as a key reason they rejected the administration's offer.</p><p>Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said that <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-mnuchin/mnuchin-says-still-working-toward-coronavirus-relief-deal-not-hung-up-on-testing-idUSKBN2701TX\">the differences between the sides are \"overblown\"</a> and that the administration would accept the Democratic position with few changes.</p><p>But Democrats dismissed the new legislative language as insufficient and called for bigger changes.</p><h2>Tax credits for low-income Americans</h2><p>As part of their federal rescue package, <a href=\"https://waysandmeans.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/neal-statement-inadequacy-trump-administration-relief-proposal\">Democrats are seeking</a> to widen tax credits for people and families with lower incomes, such as the child tax credit and the <a href=\"https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/what-earned-income-tax-credit\">earned income tax credit</a>.</p><p>The expanded child tax credit would provide a modest monthly payment to people who have smaller incomes or don't earn enough to file taxes.</p><p>The Trump administration's newest plan doesn't include funding to expand either credit, which Democrats have argued is necessary to help struggling families and unemployed people.</p><h2>Aid to states</h2><p>Democrats <a href=\"https://appropriations.house.gov/news/press-releases/lowey-statement-on-trump-administration-s-inadequate-coronavirus-relief-offer\">want to include</a> at least $436 billion in aid to states weathering significant shortfalls in their budgets.

They say a wave of lawsuits could deter employers from reopening and could harm the economy.</p><p>Democrats lambasted this step as an unacceptable measure, with Sen.

While both are likely to underperform riskier investments like dividend stocks or <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/how-to-invest-in-real-estate-make-money\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">real estate</a> in the long-term, they also generally offer more safety and stability.</p><p>Bonds and CDs have a lot in common. But there are times when one may be a better choice than the other.</p><p>It's important to know the differences so that you choose the fixed-income investment that best suits your needs. Here's a rundown of the key features of each, and how to opt for one over the other.&#160;</p><h2>What is a bond?</h2><p>A <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/bonds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bond</a> is a loan that investors make to large entities, like governments or companies. In return for borrowing your money, the bond issuer promises to pay a certain interest rate over a set period of time and to repay the principal when the bond reaches maturity.</p><p>Government bonds are considered very safe investments, especially those issued by the United States Treasury. The US federal government has never defaulted on a debt.&#160;</p><p>State and local governments also issue these debt securities, known as municipal bonds. Their riskiness varies, depending on the state or municipality's credit rating.</p><p>Corporate bonds can be riskier than government or municipal bonds, but may also offer more attractive interest rates. To research a bond's degree of risk, you can check its credit grade assigned by credit-rating agencies like Standard and Poor's, Moody's, and Fitch. Like academic grades, they're letters, ranging from A to F. Any bond that gets ranked BBB or above is considered \"investment grade.\"</p><h2>What is a CD?</h2><p>A <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-a-cd-certificate-of-deposit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">certificate of deposit (CD)</a> is actually a type of savings account offered by banks. With a CD, you promise to keep your money in the account for a specific period of time (usually from a few months to five years).&#160;</p><p>In exchange, the bank promises to pay a fixed interest rate that is often higher than it offers on its <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/best-high-yield-savings-accounts-rates-right-now\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">traditional savings account</a>. Many CDs make interest payments on a monthly basis, but some banks may choose a different schedule (such as quarterly or semi-annually).</p><p>Many CDs will charge an early withdrawal penalty (EWP) if you take out your money before the account's maturity date. However, some banks do offer no-penalty CD products. And keep in mind that some banks will allow customers to withdraw accrued interest from their CDs without triggering an EWP.</p><h2>Bonds vs. CDs: Key differences</h2><p>From a strategic standpoint, what main features differentiate bonds and CDs?&#160;</p><p><strong>1. Bonds trade on markets, CDs don't.</strong><strong>&#160;</strong>While investors can choose to hold their bonds until maturity, many can also be sold beforehand on the secondary market. As a general rule, bond prices have an inverse relationship with interest rates. So when interest rates go down, bond prices tend to go up (and vice versa).</p><p><strong>2. CDs are insured, bonds are not.</strong>&#160;CDs come with FDIC insurance of up to $250,000 per account-holder. And credit unions, which offer their own version of CDs called \"share certificates,\" also carry $250,000 of federal insurance via the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund.</p><p>Municipal and <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/corporate-bond-sales-reach-trillion-fastest-pace-ever-debt-market-2020-5-1029258342\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">corporate bonds</a> don't come with this kind of federal insurance protection. So if you lend money to a company that later finds itself in financial straits, it may be unable to fulfill its debt obligations.</p><p>This means that some bonds are riskier investments than CDs. However, it should be noted that Treasury bonds are backed by the same federal government that funds the FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation). For this reason, federal bonds and CDs carry virtually the same (very low) level of risk.</p><p><strong>3. Bonds are often tax-advantaged, CDs are not.</strong>&#160;CD income is generally taxed as normal income. So, if you happen to be in the 24% <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-tax-bracket-am-i-in-federal-income-tax\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tax bracket</a>, you'd need to pay $24 in taxes for every $100 of CD interest payments you accrue.</p><p>However, bonds issued by the government often come with tax advantages. For example, Treasury bond investors are only required to pay federal taxes on their interest payments, but not state. The exemption from local taxes could provide significant savings for investors who live in high income-tax states.</p><p>Municipal bonds come with great tax-saving benefits too. Income from these bonds is completely exempt from federal taxes and may be excluded from state and local taxes as well (if you buy one from the state you reside and file in).&#160;</p><p><strong>4. CDs typically have shorter maturity dates.</strong>&#160;Many bonds have long-term maturity dates of 10 years or more. For example, Treasury bonds mature in 20 to 30 years. Meanwhile, CDs usually mature within 5 years, with a few banks offering longer CDs of up to 10 years.</p><h2>When to consider CDs</h2><p>Although it isn't necessarily an either/or, CDs have benefits over bonds if:</p><h3>You think that interest rates will soon go up</h3><p>Compared to traditional savings accounts, CDs are not a great place to have your money stashed in an increasing interest-rate environment. Savings accounts can raise their rates at any time, while your <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/who-has-the-best-cd-rates-right-now\">CD rates</a> won't change after account opening.</p><bi-shortcode id=\"related-article-module\" class=\"mceNonEditable\" data-type=\"5dd312be3afd37342b479224\" data-title=\"The best CD rates of October 2020\" data-url=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/who-has-the-best-cd-rates-right-now\" data-thumbnail=\"https://i.insider.com/5dde8f85fd9db257724a8fd4\" data-shortcode-display-text=\"Related Article Module: The best CD rates of October 2020\">&#160;</bi-shortcode><p>But CDs are actually a <em>safer</em> bet than bonds when interest rates are going up. Why? Because the yield for bonds trading on the secondary financial markets will decrease as interest rates rise. But since CDs aren't traded on markets, their yields aren't diminished by rising rates.&#160;</p><p>If you expect rates to rise, buying <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/best-1-year-cd-rates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">short-term CDs </a>for the foreseeable future may be the way to go. In this way, you can lock in your current yield while also giving yourself the flexibility to open new (and, hopefully, higher-yield) CDs each time an account reaches maturity.</p><h3>You don't want to risk losing any principal</h3><p>With a CD, it's highly unlikely that you will lose any of your initial investment. Even if you have to pay an early withdrawal penalty (EWP), the fee is typically calculated as a portion of the interest that you would have accrued over a certain period of time. Depending on how long you've held the account, that forfeiture of interest may not cut into your principal at all.</p><p>Selling bonds before their maturity date, on the other hand, can be trickier. If the current interest rates being offered on bonds are higher than what yours pays, you'll need to sell yours at a discount in order to attract a buyer. If you want complete protection from this kind of volatility, opening a CD account will be your better option.</p><h3>You have a short-term investment horizon</h3><p>It's true that there are some short-term bonds that come with durations of one to four years. But if you expect to withdraw your money that quickly, a CD may be the simpler investment vehicle. Plus, with a CD, you won't have to worry about incurring any trade transaction costs.&#160;</p><h2>When to consider bonds</h2><p>Bonds might be a better play if:</p><h3>You think that think interest rates will soon go down</h3><p>In a decreasing interest rate environment, bond yields typically increase. So if you feel like rates are primed to fall, choosing bonds over CDs could be a smart choice.</p><p>However, it should be noted that <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/fed-interest-rate-cut-zero-bond-holdings-coronavirus-pandemic-economy-2020-3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">in March 2020 the Federal Reserve sets its benchmark interest rate at 0% to 0.25%</a> to provide economic relief during the COVID-19 pandemic.&#160;</p><p>As a result, interest rates across a variety of banking products have hit all-time lows. With this in mind, interest rates (in the short-term) are more likely to stagnate or move up than suffer any type of precipitous fall.</p><h3>You prize liquidity</h3><p>Unlike CDs, you're never locked in with bonds — you can sell at any time, should your goals or needs change. Depending on where prevailing interest rates are, you could even sell it at a premium, realizing a nice little capital gain.&#160;</p><h3>You want to minimize the taxes you pay on your investment income</h3><p>Due to their tax advantages, federal and municipal bonds will leave you with more money in your pocket than a CD offering the exact same interest rate.&#160;</p><p>The difference will be most pronounced for investors in high tax brackets. Be sure to calculate the after-tax returns of bonds and CDs when comparing your options.</p><h3>You have a long-term investment horizon</h3><p>With many bonds having maturity dates of 10 to 30 years, they can be a great \"set it and forget it\" option for long-term investors who want to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-invest-in-bonds-generate-returns-hedge-stock-market-2020-9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">protect themselves against stock market volatility</a>.</p><p>For instance, a 30-year old investor may choose a 70/30 (70% stocks/30% bonds) <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-investing-strategy-asset-allocation-coronavirus-crisis-sebastien-page-2020-5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">asset allocation</a> for their investment portfolio. While this investor could technically continue buying new CDs every 5 to 10 years to provide a similar cushion against market volatility, that would take a lot more work.&#160;</p><p>Plus, investing in bonds over CD is simpler if you're looking to keep all of your retirement funds in the same <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-a-401k\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">401(k)</a> or <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/what-is-a-traditional-ira\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">IRA account</a>.&#160;</p><h2>The financial takeaway</h2><p>Whether you're looking to increase your savings yield or hedge against stock market volatility, both bonds and CDs can be valuable additions to a diversified portfolio. But each has its own advantages and disadvantages. To decide which is right for you, you'll need to consider your income needs, investment time horizon, and your opinion about the future direction of interest rates.</p><p>If you decide that bonds are a better fit for your situation, investing in a diversified bond mutual fund or ETF could be an easy way to start. And if you decide to go with a CD, make sure to shop around for the best rates available, as they can and do vary among banks.</p><h2>Related Coverage in&#160;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/investing-reference\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"100\">Investing</a>:</h2><h3><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-are-junk-bonds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">What are junk bonds?

Wade. When asked whether criminalizing IVF would be constitutional, she <a href=\"https://twitter.com/therecount/status/1316115415832178689https://twitter.com/therecount/status/1316115415832178689\">replied</a> that she couldn't \"answer questions in the abstract.\"&#160;</p><p>Still, Barrett's association with anti-choice groups like Right to Life Michiana — a group whose stance against discarding unused embryos created in the IVF process is considered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/01/amy-coney-barrett-supported-group-fertilization\">extreme even in anti-abortion circles</a> — is enough to raise concern among fertility experts.</p><p>\"The seating of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court threatens those who seek to build a family through in-vitro fertilization,\" Feinberg and co-editors of the journal <a href=\"https://els-jbs-prod-cdn.jbs.elsevierhealth.com/pb/assets/raw/Health%20Advance/journals/fns/oyez.pdf?fbclid=IwAR371uv9GYJrJJ8MwUH_HQZiavrkPDX4GD8_mDnCYI7Qyg5yJAvNJ4XTQF8\">Fertility and Sterility</a> wrote in a letter published last Monday.</p><p>They worry that if Barrett supports legislation that recognizes every embryo created during IVF as a legal person, performing standard procedures involving those embryos could put physicians at risk for criminal violation.</p><h2><strong>Personhood legislation could criminalize genetic testing and freezing embryos</strong></h2><p>It's unlikely that personhood legislation would result in IVF being outlawed entirely, but it would make it \"incredibly difficult\" for physicians to perform assisted reproductive technology to the current standard of care, said Barbara Collura, president and CEO of RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association.</p><p>\"If you are stating that an embryo is a person, then many things that occur in an IVF laboratory become extremely difficult,\" Collura told Business Insider.&#160;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.insider.com/what-is-ivf-2018-12\">In a typical IVF treatment</a>, doctors will try to fertilize as many embryos as possible because not every embryo results in a live birth, Collura said. After fertilizing the embryos in a lab, the doctor will freeze them all and often order genetic testing to rule out abnormalities that could lead to pregnancy loss or stillbirth.</p><p>From there, the doctor would thaw and implant the embryos one at a time until one results in a successful pregnancy.</p><p>If the embryos have the right of legal personhood, standard procedures like genetic testing and cryopreservation, or freezing, could be called into question because there's a small chance of harm to the embryo.&#160;</p><p>Some personhood bills proposed at the state level have been written under homicide statutes, Collura said, meaning that a lab worker who inadvertently damages an embryo while unfreezing it could even be charged with manslaughter.</p><h2><strong>Discarding unused embryos would also be a crime under personhood laws</strong></h2><p>After a family is finished with IVF, they have the option of saving unused embryos for future attempts at pregnancy, donating them to science, or discarding them. Collura said some people just leave the embryos frozen if they can't make a decision.</p><p>In some situations, people may want to discard embryos that have tested positive for a genetic disease that would affect the viability of the pregnancy.</p><p>\"Not every embryo leads to a live birth,\" Feinberg previously told Business Insider. \"I think women who have embryos that are positive for a genetic disease should not be forced to transfer those embryos. And I think that in certain situations, discarding of embryos is morally acceptable.\"</p><p>Certain anti-choice groups, like Right to Life Michiana, equate discarding embryos to abortion.&#160;</p><p>In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/01/amy-coney-barrett-supported-group-fertilization\">an interview with The Guardian</a>, the group's executive director Jackie Appleman said: \"Whether embryos are implanted in the woman and then selectively reduced or it's done in a petri dish and then discarded, you're still ending a new human life at that point and we do oppose that.\"</p><h2><strong>Not all abortion adversaries are against IVF</strong></h2><p>At this point, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/barrett-wont-say-whether-thinks-roe-v-wade-wrongly-decided-2020-10\">no one knows how Barrett would vote on Roe v. Wade</a> and associated personhood bills if she's confirmed to the Supreme Court.</p><p>It's not a given that someone who supports personhood legislation would be against IVF, Collura said. She's spoken with \"staunch, publicly pro-life state legislators\" who, when faced with the implications of personhood for IVF, reevaluated their views.</p><p>\"It just goes to show you that you can have people who are pro-life and have this pro-life record as a legislator, yet, a lot of times, they'll say personhood goes too far,\" Collura said.</p><p><strong>Read more:</strong></p><p><a

When I think of a warm jacket, I usually think of something that has some weight to it. After wearing the jacket a few times, I can say that it's noticeably warmer than other jackets I own of similar weight. I found this to be a great advantage for staying mobile and comfortable overall, whether commuting or adventuring outdoors. It's not bulky, but still has the main features you'd expect from a cold-weather jacket like a high neck collar and a waterproof finish.</p><p>As simple as it may seem, one of my favorite features is the fleece-lined pocket. There's nothing worse than trying to keep your hands warm, only to shove them into freezing cold nylon pockets. I also really like the adjustable drawcords at them. They helped make the jacket fit my body better, and once it really starts to get cold it'll help keep the elements out.

While the new color choices are purely a matter of aesthetics, I consider them to be an improvement because you can wear them a lot more.&#160;</p><p>After experiencing the jacket in both fall and winter seasons, it has kept me warm in moderately cold weather. United By Blue claims the jacket is built for -20<a href=\"https://www.degreesymbol.net/\"></a>° F to 30° F temperatures, but I haven't put it to the test in weather <em>that&#160;</em>cold. If the weather is well below freezing, <a href=\"https://www.degreesymbol.net/\"></a>I tend to choose a heavier parka with a hood. If you're looking for an extreme conditions winter coat, this is not it. With that said, I'm still impressed with how warm the United By Blue Bison Puffer is compared to other jackets that are not quite meant for super cold weather like fleeces, packable down jackets, and sherpas.&#160;</p><p><a href=\"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&merchant_id=7926b4ed-3067-491f-ba95-7b20f93335e9&website_id=9597bdee-ce2a-4552-aa13-419b5f275c06&url=https%3A%2F%2Funitedbyblue.com%2Fproducts%2Fmens-bison-puffer-jacket%3Fvariant%3D31480798019656480798019656\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\"><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5e13b093855cc20dab3a0723?format=jpeg\" alt=\"United By Blue Puffer and Beanie\" height=\"2250\" width=\"3000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Amir Ismael/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></a></p><h2>The bottom line</h2><p>At $112 for the vest and $136 for the jacket, the <a href=\"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&merchant_id=7926b4ed-3067-491f-ba95-7b20f93335e9&website_id=9597bdee-ce2a-4552-aa13-419b5f275c06&url=https%3A%2F%2Funitedbyblue.com%2Fpages%2Fbison-pufferbison-puffer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">United By Blue Bison Puffer Collection</a> has good value.

The health expert also spoke about&#160;his concerns over the president's use of his image in a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/fauci-trump-campaign-harassment-clip-out-of-context-in-ad-2020-10\">recent campaign video</a>.&#160;</p><p>At the time of the baseball pitch, Trump signaled his annoyance by stating that he was also scheduled to throw a pitch at a Yankees game in August. The announcement surprised both the New York baseball team and White House staff, who said they had no knowledge of such an event, which eventually never made it on the calendar, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/27/us/politics/trump-yankees-fauci.html\">The New York Times reported.</a></p><p>Trump also made sure in Monday's tweet to criticize Fauci's \"bad arm.\" And a Washington Post data reporter showed that Fauci's curveball could be ranked as one of the worst in history.&#160;</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet blockquote\" data-lang=\"en\" data-cards=\"\" data-conversation=\"\">&#8212;Christopher Ingraham  (@_cingraham) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mims/statuses/1318257529470644225?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 19, 2020</a></blockquote><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><p>So far, Trump is the only president who has not thrown a ceremonial pitch while in office since the tradition was established in 1910.

When your symptoms are at their peak, skip that intensive exercise session and just take it easy. Stay in bed and sleep, or indulge in <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-hulu-orignals-to-stream\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a binge-watching session</a> while relaxing on the couch.&#160;&#160;</p><p>If a runny nose and any congestion are keeping you from getting some proper rest, look for products that use a combination of a nasal decongestant like phenylephrine and an antihistamine like diphenhydramine or doxylamine. We recommend something like Nyquil's Severe Cold and Flu or Robitussin Severe Multi-Symptom Cough, Cold, and Flu Nighttime.</p><p>Dr.&#160; Desrosiers says to \"be sure to read the label carefully and make sure you aren't taking too much of the ingredients during the day.\" She also says to check with your doctor before taking powerful decongestants if you have high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, thyroid problems, prostate issues or take MAOI medications for psychiatric disease or Parkinson's.</p>\n\tDrink lots of fluids\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5d839ad62e22af040f5993c3?format=jpeg\" alt=\"cold drink fluids\" height=\"3840\" width=\"5120\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Shutterstock</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>Congestion, mild fever, and fatigue make it very easy to become dehydrated, which leads to feeling even worse. Downing plenty of fluids helps keep you comfortable and may help your immune system function better.</p><p>That doesn't mean you should pour yourself alcohol, coffee, or soda, however. It's best to stick with water, small cups of juice, iced or hot tea, or other beverages that are easy on your stomach.</p>\n\tRun a humidifier\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5d8393742e22af1eea434912?format=jpeg\" alt=\"pure enrichment mistaire humidifier\" height=\"1200\" width=\"1600\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Amazon</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>While you can catch a cold any time of year, they're more common during the winter, when the air tends to be dryer &#8212; and that makes your scratchy throat and congestion even worse.

You should also call a doctor if your cold isn't gone after two weeks, if it's so severe that you're bringing up colored phlegm, or if you're experiencing wheezing, shortness of breath, or your throat hurts so bad that you're unable to eat or drink.</li><li><strong>Yellow or green nasal discharge is normal:&#160;</strong>Though many clinicians may think yellow or green nasal discharge is cause for antibiotics, it's actually quite common to see this color of mucous with the common cold.

sinus or ear infection.</li><li><strong>Don't ask for antibiotics:&#160;</strong>Antibiotics don't treat viruses (only bacteria) and may cause greater harm in terms of the side effects and bacterial resistance against antibiotics.</li><li><strong>Wear a mask when going outside: </strong><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/face-masks-effective-in-protecting-against-coronavirus-2020-6\"

This service usually costs about $149 and the delivery team will unbox your mattress wherever you want, take the old packaging with them, and remove your old bed too. Unfortunately, this service has been suspended during the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>I unboxed all of the mattresses by myself, but I'm an old pro. I recommend having a partner or friend help you since there's heavy lifting involved. Each bed came with instructions and took about five minutes to completely unpackage and place on my test bed frame, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07D7HBR76/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=biipf_062520_casper-nova-hybrid-mattress-review-20&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;creativeASIN=B07D7HBR76&#38;linkId=e46da97859d9449f07d5168429bcd080\">Zinus Callie</a>, though you can use the Casper mattresses on any strong and level foundation.</p><p>The set up was simple. I emptied the mattress out of the box onto my bed frame, unwrapped the outer layer of plastic, unfolded the mattress so it was flat on the frame, and then removed the inner layer of plastic.</p><p>Each mattress gave off a \"new bed smell\" once released from the vacuum seal. This is why I always unbox mattresses in the morning &#8212; it gives them time to air out before I put sheets on them at bedtime. A full day of airing out is needed to be odor-free.</p><p>Though there weren't any major differences in the set-up processes, there were a few minor variations with each mattress. The weight of a mattress is a big determinant in how easy it is to set-up and how difficult it will be to move and rotate down the road.</p><p>The Element is the lightest at 68 pounds for a Queen, the Original is 79, the Original Hybrid is 91, the Nova Hybrid is 89, and the Wave Hybrid is a back-breaking 111 pounds.</p><p>However, weight isn't the only factor in the set-up process. The Nova Hybrid and Wave Hybrid have two handles sewn onto the left and right sides of the bed, which made them easier to move and position. But the handles weren't enough to make up for the heft and floppiness of the Wave Hybrid.</p><p>The Nova Hybrid unfolded upside down after you remove the outer layer of plastic so you have to flip it. This was not an issue with the other mattresses, so hopefully it was a fluke, but something to note in case you experience a similar issue.</p>\n\tFirmness level\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f36e885e89ebf001f044d39?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Casper Nova\" height=\"680\" width=\"907\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Casper</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3><strong>Though I personally prefer the plush </strong><a href=\"https://casper.5ad6.net/c/196318/396851/7235?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcasper.com%2Fmattresses%2Fcasper-nova%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\"><strong>Nova Hybrid</strong></a><strong>, the </strong><a href=\"https://casper.5ad6.net/c/196318/396851/7235?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcasper.com%2Fmattresses%2Fcasper-original%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\"><strong>Original</strong></a><strong> would appeal to a broader range of sleepers with its slightly firmer than average feel.</strong></h3><p>Firmness is the most important factor when comparing mattresses because it often translates to comfort.</p><p>From softest to firmest, the mattresses rank Nova Hybrid, <a href=\"https://casper.5ad6.net/c/196318/396851/7235?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcasper.com%2Fmattresses%2Fcasper-original%2F%3Fmaterial%3Dhybrid\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Original Hybrid</a>, <a href=\"https://casper.5ad6.net/c/196318/396851/7235?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcasper.com%2Fmattresses%2Fcasper-wave%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Wave Hybrid</a>, Original, and <a href=\"https://casper.5ad6.net/c/196318/396851/7235?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcasper.com%2Fmattresses%2Fcasper-element%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Element</a>.

The Original Hybrid and Wave Hybrid are average, while the Original and Element are slightly firmer than average. According to Casper, the Element is a medium firmness but in my experience, I thought it was the firmest of the bunch.</p><p>Comfort is an incredibly subjective characteristic of mattresses since it depends on several factors that vary by person. Softer mattresses are usually ideal for side sleepers and lighter individuals because it's better at contouring around your body, while&#160;firmer beds most often benefit stomach and back sleepers, and heavier people.</p><p>When I first started testing mattresses, I preferred slightly firmer than average mattresses, especially since I suffer from chronic back pain. But I recently lost a lot of weight and softer mattresses are preferable to me now. For reference, I'm 6-feet tall, weigh 195 pounds, and prefer to sleep on my side, though you'll occasionally catch me on my stomach.</p><p>I'm giving you my life story to illustrate that you should take my comfort assessments with a grain of salt.</p>\n\tHeat dissipation\n\t\n\t<h3>During our testing, the <a href=\"https://casper.5ad6.net/c/196318/396851/7235?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcasper.com%2Fmattresses%2Fcasper-nova%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Nova Hybrid</a> and <a href=\"https://casper.5ad6.net/c/196318/396851/7235?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcasper.com%2Fmattresses%2Fcasper-original%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Original</a> were the most breathable and the <a href=\"https://casper.5ad6.net/c/196318/396851/7235?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcasper.com%2Fmattresses%2Fcasper-wave%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Wave Hybrid</a> was the least.</h3><p>In addition to firmness, heat dissipation is important.

If your partner is tossing and turning in the night, you don't want their movements to disturb your sleep.&#160;&#160;</p><p>I've created a motion transfer test based on research and the materials I have available. I start by placing a 12-ounce can of soda upright in the middle of the bed. Then I drop a 15-pound bowling ball from 4 feet above the bed so that its impact point is about 12 inches from the can. It's a good indication that the mattress has good motion isolation if the can stays upright after performing the test over and over. On the other hand, if the can consistently falls over, the motion dampening property isn't very good.</p><p>In my tests, only the <a href=\"https://casper.5ad6.net/c/196318/396851/7235?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcasper.com%2Fmattresses%2Fcasper-original%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Casper Original</a> and <a href=\"https://casper.5ad6.net/c/196318/396851/7235?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcasper.com%2Fmattresses%2Fcasper-element%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Element</a> had solid motion isolation. The can stayed upright after each initial drop. With the Casper Original, the can would shift to one side slightly after one drop, and when I dropped the bowling ball a second time without repositioning the can, it fell over. With the Element, I didn't need to readjust the can. I just dropped the bowling ball again and again, and the can stayed upright.</p><p>When I performed the test on the <a href=\"https://casper.5ad6.net/c/196318/396851/7235?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcasper.com%2Fmattresses%2Fcasper-wave%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Wave Hybrid</a>, the can fell over immediately in some areas but not others. This is likely due to the different support zones built into the mattress, so I'd say this is good but not great.</p><p>Both the <a href=\"https://casper.5ad6.net/c/196318/396851/7235?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcasper.com%2Fmattresses%2Fcasper-original%2F%3Fmaterial%3Dhybrid\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Original Hybrid</a> and <a href=\"https://casper.5ad6.net/c/196318/396851/7235?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcasper.com%2Fmattresses%2Fcasper-nova%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Nova Hybrid</a> failed the motion transfer tests even when I moved the impact point of the bowling ball to 18 inches from the can.&#160;&#160;</p><p>My motion transfer tests were backed up by my personal, subjective experience. I could clearly feel the movements of my wife and dog in the hybrid beds but their movements were less pronounced when we shared the all-foam Casper mattresses.</p><p>These results suggest that the all-foam beds might be better for couples sharing a bed, while the hybrid mattresses might be better suited for people who sleep alone, or heavy sleepers who wouldn't even feel any motion. If you get a larger hybrid mattress size, it might be fine for couples.</p>\n\tMattress sizes available\n\t\n\t<h3>All five mattresses are available in Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, and Cal King sizes.</h3><p>Those first three sizes are best for people who sleep alone with Twin XL being ideal for taller individuals and Full beds geared toward bigger folks. The other sizes will better suit couples who share a bed. Cal King is for taller partners, and King is for those who are larger.</p><p>To ensure a more objective review, I always test Queen-sized mattresses as it's the most popular size and fits a large group of sleepers. However, my wife and I are a little larger than your average humans and we share a bed with a terrier and a bulky full-body pillow. If I wasn't testing a mattress for work, we would need a King or Cal King instead.</p>\n\tReturn policy and warranty\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f36c67ae89ebf001f044b12?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Casper Warranty\" height=\"585\" width=\"780\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Casper</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<h3><strong>Casper has a 100-night risk-free trial and 10-year limited warranty.</strong></h3><p>A good return policy is a must when trying out a mattress since the only way you can know if a bed is right for you is to actually sleep on it.&#160;&#160;</p><p>You can try any of the mattresses with Casper's 100-night risk-free trial.

It performed almost as well as the Nova Hybrid in our tests but</strong><strong> the firmness accommodates more sleeping styles and it's about half the price.</strong></h3><p>While I was testing the new Casper mattresses, the one I most enjoyed sleeping on was the <a href=\"https://casper.5ad6.net/c/196318/396851/7235?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcasper.com%2Fmattresses%2Fcasper-nova%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Nova Hybrid</a>. It excelled in two important categories &#8212; edge support and comfort. But naturally, comfort is subjective. I'm a hot sleeper who prefers softer mattresses, and the Nova Hybrid slept the coolest and is the softest of the lot, which made it the most comfortable for me.</p><p>I think most sleepers will benefit from the <a href=\"https://casper.5ad6.net/c/196318/396851/7235?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcasper.com%2Fmattresses%2Fcasper-original%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Casper Original</a>, which, with its slightly firmer than average feel, was comfortable when I slept on my side and stomach, and my wife was comfortable on her back. This accommodated more sleeping styles. The bed stayed nice and cool through the night, had good motion isolation, and was easy to move. The edge support is subpar, but at almost half the price of the Nova Hybrid, it's overall a solid value.</p><p>For couples on a smaller budget, I recommend turning to the <a href=\"https://casper.5ad6.net/c/196318/396851/7235?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcasper.com%2Fmattresses%2Fcasper-element%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Element</a>. It's about $500 cheaper than the other beds, and the only mattress that has both excellent edge support and motion isolation. If you are picky about comfort, though, you may want to look elsewhere because the simple two-layer construction of the Element doesn't afford much pressure relief.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://casper.5ad6.net/c/196318/396851/7235?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcasper.com%2Fmattresses%2Fcasper-original%2F%3Fmaterial%3Dhybrid\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Original Hybrid</a> is a good solution for a broad array of sleepers with its medium firmness. I'm usually a side-sleeper, but I preferred to sleep on my stomach while testing it. It doesn't sleep too hot either.</p><p>The only mattress I'm hesitant to recommend is the pricy <a href=\"https://casper.5ad6.net/c/196318/396851/7235?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcasper.com%2Fmattresses%2Fcasper-wave%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Wave Hybrid</a>. Since the motion isolation, edge support, and heat dissipation are subpar, I could only see this as a possible adequate solution for stomach or back sleepers who sleep cold and alone and have the money to spend on a luxury mattress &#8212; but it's a stretch.&#160;</p>\n</div><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

its leisure route map</a> this winter with a focus on Latin America and the Caribbean as demand shifts south of the border to the few countries welcoming Americans. The new leisure-focused routes make sense as the company's CEO has said he doesn't expect business travel to recover until 2024.&#160;</p><p>The new routes boost United's presence in Mexico, Costa Rica, Belize, the Dominican Republic, and Honduras with expanded service from the airline's hubs across the US from coast to coast. Both regions have been taking the lead in accepting American tourists in recent months as more flyers take to the skies.</p><p>Costa Rica, for example, is opening its borders to all Americans starting November 1 – after previously restricting entry for residents of high-risk states – with proof of a negative COVID-19 PCR test, according to the <a href=\"https://cr.usembassy.gov/covid-19-information/\">US Embassy in San Jose</a>. Belize and Honduras have recently begun allowing all US citizens to enter but are similarly requiring negative tests to be presented for entry.&#160;</p><p>Mexico has remained open to Americans arriving via air throughout the summer and has not used negative tests as a requirement for entry. The Dominican Republic also does not require a negative test for entry.</p><p>The new routes allow for quicker journeys and allow for more non-stop itineraries for those seeking to head south for the winter. United is also increasing flights on existing routes to Latin America and the Caribbean.&#160;</p><p>Here's where United Airlines is flying this winter.</p><h2>Between Cleveland, Ohio, and Cancun, Mexico</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f5a3ab1e6ff30001d4e7ff8?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Cancun, Mexico\" height=\"1403\" width=\"1872\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Cancun, Mexico.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Shutterstock.com</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>United will begin flying between Cleveland, Ohio, and Cancun, Mexico on December 19 with year-round, Saturday-only service after having left the route in August 2019, according to Cirium route data.

here</a>.&#160;</li></ul><p>A new film adaptation of Roald Dahl's classic children's book \"The Witches\" will premiere on HBO Max on October 22, just in time for Halloween.&#160;</p><p>Academy Award winners Anne Hathaway and Octavia Spencer star in the film; Hathaway plays the Grand High Witch, leader of a wicked coven, while Spencer plays the high-energy grandmother of the film's protagonist. \"The Witches\" is directed by Robert Zemeckis of \"Forrest Gump\" and \"Back to the Future\" fame, with Chris Rock serving as narrator.</p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/clk2ClBOGTM\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>This reimagining of \"The Witches\" is set in the American south during 1967, while Dahl's novel was published in 1983 and set in England. Spencer's character and her grandson (played by Jahzir Bruno) come across a witch conference at an Alabama hotel and eventually discover the witches' plot to turn children into mice.</p><p>\"The Witches\" was originally planned for a theatrical release, but the coronavirus pandemic has led Warner Bros. to pursue streaming premieres for several of its films this year. Warner Bros. also released \"Scoob!\" to home audiences after cancelling a May theater release and made it available to HBO Max subscribers in June. \"The Witches\" will look to capitalize on Halloween excitement with the holiday just days away and much of the world still practicing social distancing.</p><h2>How to watch 'The Witches' on HBO Max</h2><p>To watch \"The Witches\" when it's released on October 22, you'll need an <a href=\"https://www.hbomax.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HBO Max subscription</a>. The service costs $14.99 a month, and new members can receive a free seven-day trial.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/hbo-max-streaming-service\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HBO Max</a> is an on-demand streaming service that combines HBO's original series and library of films with a huge catalog of additional movies and shows from sources like DC Comics, Turner Classic Movies, and Adult Swim.&#160;</p><p>HBO Max launched as a replacement for the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/hbo-go-vs-hbo-now-vs-hbo-max\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HBO Now and HBO Go streaming services.</a> If you already subscribe to HBO through your cable provider, there's a good chance you can get HBO Max for free. You can see if your <a href=\"https://www.hbomax.com/do-i-already-have-access\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">current subscription supports HBO Max here</a>.</p><p>The HBO Max app is available on Android, iPhone, PlayStation, Xbox, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/google-chromecast-with-google-tv-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Chromecast</a>, PC, Mac, Samsung TVs, and Apple TV. The app isn't available on Roku or Amazon Fire streaming devices yet.</p><p>Like all HBO Max content, \"The Witches\" will be limited to an HD resolution of 1080p; a spokesman for the service previously <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/why-cant-hbo-max-support-4k-hdr-dolby-vision-when-netflix-and-disney-plus-can/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said that 4K streaming and HDR support will come to the app at a later date.</a></p><p>\"The Witches\" is exclusive to HBO Max in the US but will be released to other on-demand video services in the UK and Ireland on October 26. Viewers in those countries will be able to purchase the movie or rent it for 48 hours.</p><h2><strong>Where to watch more films inspired by Roald Dahl</strong></h2><p>Dahl's books have impacted multiple generations and inspired a wide range of films and other media adaptations. <a href=\"https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/196318/564546/9358?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored\">Disney Plus</a> is home to several Dahl adaptations, including \"James and the Giant Peach,\" \"The BFG,\" and \"Fantastic Mr. Fox.\" The most popular Dahl-inspired film, \"Willy Wonka &#38; The Chocolate Factory, \" is available to stream through <a href=\"https://www.freeform.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Freeform</a>, along with \"Matilda.\"</p><p>Jim Henson helped produce a British adaptation of \"The Witches\" in 1990; the film was a critical success but a commercial failure. You can watch the 1990 version of <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/20282991\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\"The Witches\" on Netflix now</a>, but know that Dahl disagreed with the filmmakers' decision to change the original ending of his novel for the screen.&#160;</p><p>Sources told Variety that the 2020 version of \"The Witches\" will stay closer to the story of the book, even though it's set during the American civil rights movement with Black protagonists.&#160;</p><p>All of these films are also available to buy or rent through <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-rent-movies-online\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">digital streaming retailers</a>, like <a

Here to save you from the never-ending rotation of takeout, these meal kits are re-introducing you to your kitchen in all its wonder. As it turns out, your stove is just as important as your microwave.</p><p>But just as it can be a challenge to pick your favorite take-out restaurant, it can be difficult to pick your favorite meal kit delivery service. We've taste-tested plenty of brands to put together our comprehensive buying guide, which you can <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-meal-kit-delivery-service\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">check out here</a>, but we're also helping narrow down your decision-making process with comparison pieces like this.

They've been around for years, and have built up a loyal base of followers thanks to their tasty recipes, wide selections, and ability to cater to various dietary restrictions. Both feature solid produce and protein options and are fantastic for a date night activity.</p><p>But there are certainly some aspects in which Blue Apron and HelloFresh begin to differentiate themselves from one another, and that's really how you'll be making your decision. Here are our thoughts after testing both.</p><h2><strong>Ease of use&#160;&#160;</strong></h2><p><a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/https://www.blueapron.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\"><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5ce6afaf9252e330d174c1a7?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Blue Apron vs HelloFresh Graphic 2\" height=\"601\" width=\"1201\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Alyssa Powell/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></a></p><p>If we're thinking in terms of pure convenience, HelloFresh is a bit easier to use than Blue Apron. While both are extremely convenient, <a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/sid/biip_051719_blue-apron-vs-hellofresh/https://www.hellofresh.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">HelloFresh</a> is more focused on providing meals that are truly no fuss, and as a result, can be ready in just a matter of minutes.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/https://www.blueapron.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored\">Blue Apron</a>, on the other hand, sometimes requires just a bit more prep work or expertise — as a tradeoff, however, you may find Blue Apron's meals a bit more complex and interesting.</p><p>I've found many of HelloFresh's recipes to be a bit more straightforward and easy to follow, which is ideal for the beginner chef. If you're just looking to dip your toe into culinary waters and are beginning to make your way around four burners and an oven, then <a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/sid/biip_051719_blue-apron-vs-hellofresh/https://www.hellofresh.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">HelloFresh</a> certainly seems a bit less intimidating.</p><p>While both <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/https://www.blueapron.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored\">Blue Apron</a> and HelloFresh's directions are very clear, it often seems as though HelloFresh's recipes simply require fewer steps. Not only is that ideal for the beginner chef, but it's also well-suited for folks who perhaps are in a bit more of a rush. And if your main draw to a meal kit is convenience through and through, then HelloFresh is the way to go.</p><p><strong>Winner: <a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/sid/biip_051719_blue-apron-vs-hellofresh/https://www.hellofresh.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">HelloFresh</a></strong></p><hr><h2><strong>Recipe quality and creativity </strong></h2><p>What <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/https://www.blueapron.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Blue Apron</a> may lack in convenience, it makes up for in creativity. The meal kit service is looking to put a bit of a gourmet spin on home cooking, and consequently, if you're looking to expand your horizons a bit, you'll be able to do so with Blue Apron.</p><p>I appreciate the internationally-inspired meals like Mushroom Tempura Rice Bowl or Crispy za'atar Chicken Tenders, which have the capacity to introduce cooks not only to new flavors but perhaps new techniques as well. Indeed, it's not all that often that you'll find meal kits making use of ingredients like fregola sarda, but Blue Apron could make it a staple in your kitchen.</p><p>For slightly more experienced chefs, Blue Apron is an ideal way to begin to expand horizons and check out different flavor combinations in a relatively risk-free environment. I've also had a number of friends adapt Blue Apron recipes to their own needs, something that seems more unique to this particular meal kit service than any other that I've tried.</p><p><strong>Winner: <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/https://www.blueapron.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Blue Apron</a></strong></p><hr><h2><strong>Ability to cater to dietary preferences</strong></h2><p><a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/sid/biip_051719_blue-apron-vs-hellofresh/https://www.hellofresh.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5ce6aeeddf29c82dba7a5448?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Blue Apron vs HelloFresh Graphic 3\" height=\"601\" width=\"1201\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Alyssa Powell/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/sid/biip_051719_blue-apron-vs-hellofresh/https://www.hellofresh.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">HelloFresh</a> has recently become something of a meal kit behemoth, acquiring a number of smaller meal kit services including Green Chef.

Strap over 500,000 pounds to its back and it would be, well, nothing.</p><p>But airplane tires manage that impact every day, without incident. They're made to withstand hitting the pavement at extreme speeds, all while supporting an entire commercial jet. Don't think too hard about it next time you're in the air, but 45 inches of rubber is the only thing standing between you and the tarmac during landing.</p><p>So, what makes them tough enough for the job?</p><p>If you've ever driven down a US highway, you've probably seen shredded tires along the way. Semitruck tires aren't supposed to explode, but they do. Airplane tires? Not so much. There are a few differences between the two.</p><p>First of all, a semitruck isn't falling out of the sky as part of its route. Those tires don't need to be made to withstand the same high speeds and weights. Airplane tires, on the other hand, need to be reinforced.</p><p><strong>Brandy Moorhead</strong>: They're made with a combination of proprietary synthetic rubber compounds, which are paired with aluminum steel reinforcements and nylon and aramid fabrics.</p><p><strong>Narrator</strong>: That's Brandy. She's in charge of Goodyear's aircraft tires, and she told us that airplane tires are inflated twice as much as truck tires and six times as much as a car's. That's because the higher the pressure, the firmer the tire, and the more strength it has to support the plane. And when they're inflated, it's not with regular air. Airplane tires are filled with nitrogen.</p><p><strong>Brandy</strong>: Nitrogen is an inert gas, so high temperatures and pressure changes have less effect.</p><p><strong>Narrator</strong>: Plane tires are subjected to the most rigorous conditions of any vehicle tire. When Goodyear develops a new airplane tire, it starts with a prototype. Then the tires are tested beyond their breaking points. They're tested for speed, pressure, and the ability to handle a load up to 38 tons. So they have to be made very differently than other tires. Instead of the blocky design seen on a lot of car tires, plane tires get groovy.</p><p><strong>Brandy</strong>: That blocked pattern enables different maneuvering and different characteristics of ride and handling, which are required by an automobile, as opposed to just an aircraft that takes off and lands on a runway. The reason we have grooves in an aircraft tire at all is because we need to evacuate water if we were to land on a wet surface.</p><p><strong>Narrator</strong>: Commercial jets usually have around 20 tires and touch down about 500 times before they have to be retread, which can be done seven times before the tire's no better than scrap rubber. And tires at the nose of the plane tend to have shorter life spans than the rest.</p><p>It takes two mechanics up to an hour to change a single tire. They raise the tire only 5 centimeters off the ground, which doesn't feel like enough room to fit a thumb, let alone change a plane tire. The mechanics take off the hubcap and reduce the tire pressure from 200 to 30 psi, which reduces the risk of it exploding as the bolts and nuts holding it on the plane are removed. A sleeve protects the axle, and a lifting tool pulls the tire off. The axle sleeve is then greased, and the new tire is slid smoothly on. And then things move in reverse: nuts and bolts, tire reinflated to 200, hubcap back on, and the whole thing is gently lowered 5 centimeters back onto the ground.</p><p>So, what happens after 500 landings, seven retreadings, and uncountable \"This is your captain speaking\"s? A lot of the tires get recycled into playground mulch and even other tires for farming equipment. Those tires will be made from old plane tires, but not like them. There's no need. Because if a farmer is using their tractor the same way they'd use a plane, well, they're doing it wrong.</p><p><em>EDITOR'S NOTE: This video was originally published in October 2019.</em></p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/why-plane-tires-dont-explode-during-landing-2019-10'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=8yS8hetEK_0:bSuYfGGslE8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=8yS8hetEK_0:bSuYfGGslE8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=8yS8hetEK_0:bSuYfGGslE8:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=8yS8hetEK_0:bSuYfGGslE8:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=8yS8hetEK_0:bSuYfGGslE8:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=8yS8hetEK_0:bSuYfGGslE8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=8yS8hetEK_0:bSuYfGGslE8:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=8yS8hetEK_0:bSuYfGGslE8:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/8yS8hetEK_0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 18:00:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5daf70324af9090cad0b800e?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"eb9282cc43728c0f98ad8cdbb4389ef6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn69@2020_2/2020/10/20/02-05-12-898_422be39fd9a822c4.webp","destWidth":2576,"destHeight":1932,"sourceBytes":78704,"destBytes":78704,"author":"jtungul@businessinsider.com (Jade Tungul)","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn67@2020_3/2020/10/20/02-05-22-757_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=8yS8hetEK_0:bSuYfGGslE8:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn47@2020_6/2020/10/20/02-05-13-065_9c61f0b7f9b4d51f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=8yS8hetEK_0:bSuYfGGslE8:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn99@2020_2/2020/10/20/02-05-25-488_c7ca1cd7618e6636.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn79@2020_1/2020/10/20/02-05-18-571_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=8yS8hetEK_0:bSuYfGGslE8:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn31@2020_3/2020/10/20/02-05-12-914_a6afeccf796f7a75.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/8yS8hetEK_0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn52@2020_1/2020/10/20/02-05-17-656_679ab4ccacf5a130.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603159473340},{"createdTime":"2020-10-20 10:04:33","updatedTime":"2020-10-20 10:04:33","title":"The best headphone deals — save $70 on Bang & Olufsen's Beoplay E8 true wireless earbuds","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/headphone-deals","description":"<p class=\"financial-disclaimer\"><i>When you buy through our links, we may earn money from our affiliate partners. <a href=\"https://www.insider-inc.com/commerce-on-insider-inc/\">Learn more.</a></i></p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f8e09f49e9fe4001900a3c9?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Bang &#38; Olufsen Beoplay E8\" height=\"599\" width=\"799\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Amazon</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\"><li><strong>Good-quality headphones can be expensive, but they often go on sale.</strong></li><li><strong>We've rounded up the best headphone deals for October 2020.</strong></li><li><strong>We'll update this list regularly with the top deals.</strong></li><li><strong>Right now, the <a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/196318/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fbang-olufsen-beoplay-e8-3rd-gen-earphones-black%2F6405595.p%3FskuId%3D6405595\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"0\" data-amzn-asin=\"B083KVM9VW\" data-ml-dynamic=\"true\" data-ml-dynamic-type=\"sl\" data-uri=\"0e052449226e91e3a3602b2e19d17fbf\">Bang &#38; Olufsen Beoplay E8</a> are on sale for $280 — that's</strong><strong> $70 off their regular price.</strong></li></ul><p>A great pair of headphones can change the way you listen to music. Sure, the random earbuds that you have in your bottom drawer may do the job just fine for some, but if you want to hear nuanced details, well-rounded bass, or a sparkling high-end, you'll need something a little more versatile.</p><p>If you are in the market for a new pair of headphones, it's worth figuring out exactly what kind of headphones you want. The first step is to determine whether you want in-ear headphones, on-ear headphones, or over-ear headphones.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-earbuds\">In-ear headphones</a> are more portable than any other headphones, while <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-over-ear-headphones\">over-ear headphones</a> are the most comfortable and deep-sounding. <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-on-ear-headphones\">On-ear headphones</a> are often considered a good compromise between the two. If you hate wires, you could also get <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-wireless-earbuds\">true wireless in-ear headphones</a>, like AirPods, which cut the cables completely.&#160;</p><p>It's also worth looking into a few headphone brands. If you're an audiophile who wants the best-sounding headphones, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/sennheiser-hd1-wireless-headphones-deal-amazon-2019-9\">companies like Sennheiser</a>, Klipsch, and Shure are worth considering. If you want incredible noise-cancelling headphones or those that work great for day-to-day use, consider those from Sony or <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/bose-700-wireless-noise-cancelling-headphones-review-nearly-perfect-2019-7\">Bose</a>. And, if you want plenty of bass and tight integration with your Apple products, look into <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/beats-solo-pro-headphones-review-great-sound-not-comfortable-2019-10\">headphones from Beats</a> or Apple itself.</p><p>Once you've determined the type of headphones you want, you'll want to figure out what your budget is. These days, you can get solid headphones for under $100, but as with anything, you get what you pay for — and the more you're willing to spend, the better headphones you'll be able to get.&#160;</p><p>Of course, you don't necessarily have to spend as much as you normally would if you can find a great deal. And that's exactly why we put together this guide for the best headphone deals that you can take advantage of right now.</p><h2><strong>Here are the best headphone deals in October 2020:</strong></h2><ul class=\"summary-list\"><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=biipf_022620_headphone-deals-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07ZPC9QD4&linkId=290a4bbf0878ebeb8128f633bcfdb5130878ebeb8128f633bcfdb513\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Apple AirPods Pro, $219 (originally $249) at Amazon</a> [You save $30]</strong></li><li><a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/196318/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fbang-olufsen-beoplay-e8-3rd-gen-earphones-black%2F6405595.p%3FskuId%3D6405595\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"0\" data-amzn-asin=\"B083KVM9VW\" data-ml-dynamic=\"true\" data-ml-dynamic-type=\"sl\" data-uri=\"0e052449226e91e3a3602b2e19d17fbf\">Bang &#38; Olufsen Beoplay E8 (3rd Gen), $280 (originally $350) at Best Buy</a> [You save $70]&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/196318/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fhyperx-cloud-stinger-wired-stereo-gaming-headset-for-pc-ps4-xbox-one-nintendo-wii-u-mobile-devices-red-black%2F5590001.p%3FskuId%3D5590001\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\"><strong>HyperX Cloud Stinger Gaming Headset, $31 (originally $50) at Best Buy</strong></a><strong> [You save $19]</strong></li><li><a href=\"https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&u=1088116&m=62772&urllink=www.dailysteals.com%2Fproducts%2Fbeats-solo3-club-collection-wireless-on-ear-headphonesr-headphones\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener nofollow nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\"><strong>Beats Solo3 Club Collection Wireless Headphones, $103 (originally $200) at Daily Steals when you use code BISOLO </strong></a><strong> [You save $97]</strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/https://www.jabra.com/bluetooth-headsets/jabra-elite-45e##100-98900002-02\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored nofollow sponsored\">Jabra Elite 45e Headphones, $30 (originally $100) at Jabra</a>&#160;[You save $70]</strong></li></ul><p><em>Prices and links are current as of 10/19/2020.

Just leave us alone. They're tired of it. People are tired of hearing Fauci and all these idiots.\"</p><p>Trump revised the figure to 700,000 or 800,000 deaths before expressing indifference about whether his statements would reach reporters, CNN said.</p><p>\"If there's a reporter on, you can have it just the way I said it, I couldn't care less,\" he said, according to CNN.</p><p>Fauci has been the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984 and was recently part of the White House's coronavirus task force.</p><p>Trump's criticisms of Fauci had been relatively muted until recently. While <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-again-receives-poor-marks-on-response-to-coronavirus-2020-9\">Trump has struggled for months</a> with unfavorable opinions about his handling of the coronavirus outbreak, Fauci has remained one of the most trusted sources for health information.</p><p>In a September <a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/abc-too-slow-on-pandemic\">ABC News/Ipsos poll</a>, only 35% of Americans said they approved of how Trump had handled the coronavirus pandemic, with 67% of respondents saying he acted too slowly to combat the disease.</p><p>In an <a href=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6938425/200266-NBCWSJ-June-Poll.pdf\">NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll</a> in June, 50% of respondents said they viewed Fauci favorably, while only 11% said they had a negative view. And in a <a href=\"http://files.kff.org/attachment/Topline-KFF-Health-Tracking-Poll-September-2020.pdf\">Kaiser Family Foundation poll</a> released in September, 68% of respondents said they had a great deal or fair amount of trust in Fauci when it came to the updates about the coronavirus.</p><p>In an <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/video/fauci-covid-cases-increase-latest-60-minutes-2020-10-18/\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"40\" data-uri=\"28b3d7041a4075ec82bd9cf3362baa73\">interview with CBS's \"60 Minutes\"</a> that aired on Sunday, Fauci said he was \"absolutely not\" surprised that Trump caught the coronavirus.</p><p>\"I was worried that he was going to get sick when I saw him in a completely precarious situation of crowded, no separation between people, and almost nobody wearing a mask,\" he said, referring to the White House ceremony for Trump's Supreme Court nominee, Judge Amy Coney Barrett, on September 26.</p><p>\"When I saw that on TV, I said, 'Oh my goodness. Nothing good can come out of that. That's got to be a problem,'\" Fauci continued. \"And then sure enough, it turned out to be a superspreader event.\"</p><p>Trump announced on October 2 that he and first lady Melania Trump had contracted the coronavirus. He was transported later that day to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for treatment, and he was released on October 5.</p><p>The president has routinely dismissed the threat of COVID-19, urging state leaders to reopen businesses and claiming that <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/515223-trump-maintains-us-rounding-the-turn-on-coronavirus\">the US is \"rounding the turn\" on the pandemic</a> and that the virus will \"disappear.\"</p><p>But Fauci offered a different perspective, telling CBS: \"When you have a million deaths and over 30 million infections globally, you cannot say that we're on the road to essentially getting out of this. So quite frankly I don't know where we are. It's impossible to say.\"</p><p>In the interview, Fauci also said that his media appearances hadn't always been in his control.</p><p>\"During this pandemic, has the White House been controlling when you can speak with the media?\" Dr. Jon LaPook asked.</p><p>\"You know, I think you'd have to be honest and say yes,\" Fauci replied. \"I certainly have not been allowed to go on many, many, many shows that have asked for me.\"</p><p>Trump took another swing at Fauci on Monday afternoon, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1318252740431155200?s=21\">this time on Twitter</a>.</p><p>\"Dr. Tony Fauci says we don't allow him to do television, and yet I saw him last night on @60Minutes, and he seems to get more airtime than anybody since the late, great, Bob Hope,\" Trump said. \"All I ask of Tony is that he make better decisions.\" The president also accused Fauci of saying \"no masks &#38; let China in.\"</p><p>Trump went on to mock Fauci's ceremonial first pitch of the first 2020 MLB game between the Washington Nationals and the New York Yankees in July.</p><p>\"Also, Bad arm!\" Trump wrote, adding that Fauci \"threw out perhaps the worst first pitch in the history of Baseball!\"</p><p>Before a rally in Prescott, Arizona, on Monday afternoon, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1318260842471751683?s=20\">Trump pushed back on the notion</a> that he was criticizing Fauci because of Fauci's favorability among Americans.</p><p>\"We let him do what he wants to do.

Guests will have access to yoga and fitness classes, meditation services, a swimming pool, a running track, and more. There's also a 5,000-square-foot theatre for workshops, conventions, movies, and live performances.</p><p>\"Just like the man-made island of Venice Italy became an important center of commerce in the old world, we believe this could be the start of a modern floating Venice of the Americas and an important hub of innovation in the world,\" reads the <a href=\"https://ocean.builders/cruiseship/\">website.</a></p><p>Ocean Builders founder Chad Elwartowski told The Telegraph that he is in the final stages of obtaining a ship from Carnival Cruises for an undisclosed sum that will host over 2,000 people in its 777 cabins. If the acquisition goes through, the company will start auctioning the first batch of 100 rooms on November. 5, which will range in price from $25,000 and $50,000. It's unclear what those rates cover and how long guests would be renting the rooms.</p><p>Ocean Builders did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.</p><p>Bidding for the rooms will close on November 28, and guests will be able to move in starting in January when the ship, the MS Satoshi, will be anchored off the coast of Panama.</p><p>According to the website, all businesses onboard will accept payment in the form of bitcoin and USD, as well as other forms of payment.&#160;</p><p>Cruise ships have made headlines since the start of the pandemic as they were proven to be Petri dishes for the spread of the coronavirus disease, with <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-diamond-princess-cruise-ship-coronavirus-quarantine-went-wrong-2020-2\">vessels like the Diamond Princess ending up with hundreds of cases</a>. The pandemic has battered the cruise industry, prompting many lines — <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/carnival-coronavirus-covid-19-diamond-grand-princess-zaandam-2020-7\">including the biggest, Carnival Corp.</a> — to resort to layoffs and offloading their fleets of vessels.</p><p>Ocean Builders said on its website that it believes a \"properly run cruise ship can be the healthiest and safest place in the world to live\" and intends to use the \"newest cruise industry health and safety standards\" to create a safe environment onboard. That will include onboard health testings, medical facilities, a pharmacy, and doses of hydroxychloroquine, the anti-malaria drug that has been incorrectly touted by President Trump as a cure for the coronavirus disease. <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-hydroxychloroquine-side-effects-coronavirus-2020-6\">Medical experts have advised against its use,</a> and FDA studies have shown that it has no effect on improving symptoms or someone's chances of survival after being infected with the disease.</p><p>\"If you are concerned about catching the flu you have the option to wearing a mask, social distancing, or taking preventative doses of hydroxychloroquine,\" the cruise's website states, seemingly referring to the coronavirus disease as \"the flu.\"</p><p>The company's endeavor to create an unconventional work setup represents a growing industry that is catering to a mass shift to remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many have been freed from having to live near now-closed corporate offices and have subsequently been deprived of the usual perks that come with working in the region, such as free snacks and in-house massages.</p><p>Google has announced that employees will be working remotely through summer 2021, and some firms like Dropbox, Twitter, and Slack have told employees that they may work remotely permanently if they choose. Facebook has said that those who wish to leave the pricey San Francisco Bay Area for more affordable locales will <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/21/technology/facebook-remote-work-coronavirus.html\">likely have to take a pay cut.</a>&#160;</p><p>As for turning to floating accommodations for live-and-work purposes, this isn't Silicon Valley's first time to entertain such a notion. Ex-Googler Patri Friedman, founder of the nonprofit think tank Seasteading Institute, told The Telegraph in a June interview that <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/silicon-valley-elite-seasteads-floating-city-pandemic-2020-6\">he's seen an increase in interest in seasteads</a>, or floating cities that operate independently of existing governments.&#160;</p><p>Friedman also once drafted designs for a would-be floating settlement in the Bay Area that would be \"Burning Man meets Silicon Valley meets the water.\" The idea inspired BlueSeed, a startup that set out to launch a so-called \"Googleplex of the seas\" in 2013 as&#160;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/blueseed-entrepreneurs-concept-vessels-images-2011-12\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"60\" data-uri=\"7a966383e187d1c145c4b6747b11ecac\">Business Insider reported in 2011.</a></p><p>The company sought to skirt US regulations by building vessels on international waters near the Bay Area that would serve as incubators for tech workers who were unable to obtain US work visas. It was backed by billionaire investor Peter Thiel but never panned out.&#160;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a
