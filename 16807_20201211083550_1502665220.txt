Your day-to-day as a lawyer may include talking with clients, client intake, billing, collection, practice management tasks, and maybe, just maybe, finding time in your day to research and write that brief. Unfortunately, those non-billable administrative tasks are often those that take up most of your time. This is where workflow automation, and <a href=\"https://lawyerist.com/reviews/law-practice-management-software/actionstep/\">Actionstep</a>, can help.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-details\">Details</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>From client onboarding and scheduling to document generation and billing, there are many opportunities to keep your firm’s work flowing with automation, allowing you to service your client and attract new ones more efficiently. Workflow automation removes room for human error related to duplicate data entry, creates a better client experience, improves communication and transparency between you, your staff, and your clients, and helps you grow your business without breaking the bank.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Actionstep&#8217;s workflow automation runs through all its features including CRM, Matter Management, Document Assembly &#38; Management, Time &#38; Billing, Trust &#38; Office Accounting, Reporting and much more. You’ll be able to create tailored workflows to automate data collection and entry, assign tasks, and make sure everything is checked off before moving to the next step. This gives everyone in your firm a roadmap, ensuring everything goes according to plan.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/GBU9YhwGLMzhdpXx1OsTEytQjidBqkYUBsq4Rm99kaOBl_JxKVcbBdYqJ0RfkQTDEwhq8ajZGy2ptfRIuGawXLJyb31lnonKYDQzx4TH4BgOlsJv0GS9L13SUofXegdjcDEpvuXN\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Take client intake as an example. A typical workflow for this could include a prospective client contacting your law firm on your website, someone contacting the prospective client, scheduling an initial consultation, meeting with that client, then generating a fee agreement.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using Actionstep, you can automate your client intake process by using a webform that can automatically populate a database with client information, instantly create and send a personalized email to the prospective client once the form is completed, generate a task for someone to contact the potential client, and even generate a fee agreement after the consultation. All you need to do is meet with the client.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With workflow automation, you are in control of how things are done without having to control every little thing and are able to be more efficient without cutting corners. By defining your workflow, from client intake to closing the file, you’ll be able to transform much of that administrative work into an automated process, giving you space in your day to focus on higher value client and operational activities.&#160;&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-how-to-get-it\">How to Get it</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To learn more about Actionstep or to sign up for a free demo, visit <a href=\"https://hubs.ly/H0BccPW0\">Actionstep.com</a> today!</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://lawyerist.com/lawyerist/sponsored/automate-your-client-experience-and-workflow-with-actionstep/\">Automate Your Client Experience and Workflow with Actionstep</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://lawyerist.com/lawyerist\">Lawyerist</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/solosmalltech?a=Vm-5nuplw1o:ubE1EaUjxFE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/solosmalltech?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/solosmalltech?a=Vm-5nuplw1o:ubE1EaUjxFE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/solosmalltech?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/solosmalltech/~4/Vm-5nuplw1o\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 08 Dec 2020 16:33:23 +0000","feedId":16807,"bgimg":"https://lawyerist.com/lawyerist/lh4.googleusercontent.com/EJY4oSuB-ODumqjxUUZmfKGTcWYZzVAER5_yXOiVJ5_DMx-zfYbCPwnJunMBKtynA986CnaGvxTYTHOg4hX7SkXopLvt5E7DZ6aWhNAQQmsuEbH9BkYGO3t_icfQdI9u5VzQXlFQ","linkMd5":"39ab12319be47b5f22bbed7b9389b993","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn0@2020_1/404.jpg","sourceBytes":0,"destBytes":0,"author":"Lawyerist","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://lawyerist.com/lawyerist/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Lawyerist-Ad-Design-Client-Experience-09-1-694x444.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn59@2020_6/2020/12/11/08-33-48-189_b3a0354cd010d6d4.webp","https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/EJY4oSuB-ODumqjxUUZmfKGTcWYZzVAER5_yXOiVJ5_DMx-zfYbCPwnJunMBKtynA986CnaGvxTYTHOg4hX7SkXopLvt5E7DZ6aWhNAQQmsuEbH9BkYGO3t_icfQdI9u5VzQXlFQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn76@2020_5/2020/12/11/08-33-48-130_ab7ce064b942b60e.webp","https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/GBU9YhwGLMzhdpXx1OsTEytQjidBqkYUBsq4Rm99kaOBl_JxKVcbBdYqJ0RfkQTDEwhq8ajZGy2ptfRIuGawXLJyb31lnonKYDQzx4TH4BgOlsJv0GS9L13SUofXegdjcDEpvuXN":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/solosmalltech?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn64@2020_2/2020/12/11/08-33-47-830_ef6254f83cd2e87a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/solosmalltech?d=qj6IDK7rITs":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/solosmalltech/~4/Vm-5nuplw1o":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn72@2020_3/2020/12/11/08-33-47-797_17866840e61b2acd.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1607675627751}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-12-11 16:33:47","updatedTime":"2020-12-11 16:33:47","feedId":16807,"fetchDate":"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 08:33:47 +0000","fetchMs":22,"handleMs":19,"totalMs":123080,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":10,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"b7f013d573409428dc92482e3348ccd3","hostName":"us-029*","requestId":"fe3a0c44fb92416fb0d934d425fc9b7f_16807","contentType":"text/xml; charset=UTF-8","totalBytes":120730,"bgimgsTotal":1,"bgimgsGithubTotal":1,"articlesImgsTotal":6,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":4,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx8":1,"myreaderx22":1,"myreaderx2":1,"myreaderx12":1},"failGithubMap":{"myreaderx23":1}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-09-07 02:13:40","updatedTime":"2020-09-07 02:44:00","id":16807,"name":"Lawyerist","url":"http://feeds.feedburner.com/solosmalltech","subscriber":199,"website":null,"icon":"https://lawyerist.com/lawyerist/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/cropped-L-dot-transparent-65x65.png","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx63/cdn32@2020_6/2020/09/06/18-43-57-058_8e28c860a000cf6d.png","description":"Join your tribe.
