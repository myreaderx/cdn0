The list goes on …</strong></p> \n<p>But never fear! In this post I’d like to offer you a little guidance by outlining ten skills that will help you land your first dev job in 2020. For each skill, I’ll suggest a hands-on project to get you started and point you to appropriate resources on <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/library?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=articles\">SitePoint Premium</a> for further reading.</p> \n<p>Let’s dive in.</p> \n<h2 id=\"1gettoknowyourcodeeditor\">1. Get to Know Your Code Editor</h2> \n<p>As a coder, you’re going to be spending a lot of time in your editor of choice. That’s why you should make the effort to learn what it can do and how to configure it properly. The subject of which editor to use can quickly become controversial, but if you’re just starting out, I would encourage you to check out <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\">VS Code</a> (or <a href=\"https://vscodium.com/\">VSCodium</a> if you care about privacy).</p> \n<p>VS Code ships with a lot of cool features, such as <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/tips-and-tricks#_emmet-syntax\">Emmet abbreviations</a>, <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/tips-and-tricks#_intellisense\">intellisense</a>, <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/tips-and-tricks#_default-keyboard-shortcuts\">various keyboard shortcuts</a> and <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/tips-and-tricks#_git-integration\">Git integration</a>. There are also <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/tips-and-tricks#_extensions\">hundreds (if not thousands) of extensions</a> that you can install to customize your workflow.</p> \n<h3 id=\"projectidea\">Project Idea</h3> \n<p>Install VS Code on your machine and commit to using it. Spend some time researching popular extensions for your language of choice and install at least three of these. You should also install <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode\">Prettier</a> and configure it to format your code on save, as well as <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint\">ESLint</a>, which will display JavaScript linting errors in VS Code’s console. For bonus points, you can print out the <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/tips-and-tricks#_keyboard-reference-sheets\">keyboard shortcut reference sheet for your platform</a> and attempt to memorize two or three shortcuts per week.</p> \n<h3 id=\"furtherreading\">Further Reading</h3> \n<p>By way of a reference, I would recommend <em><a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/visual-studio-code-end-to-end-editing-and-debugging-tools-for-web-developers?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=articles\">Visual Studio Code: End-to-End Editing and Debugging Tools for Web Developers</a></em>. This up-to-date guide covers all of the essential VS Code components, including the editing features of the workspace, advanced functionality such as code refactoring and key binding, and integration with Grunt, Gulp, npm, and other external tools. <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/visual-studio-code-end-to-end-editing-and-debugging-tools-for-web-developers/read/2?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=articles\">Chapter Two</a>, which introduces you to the user interface, and <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/visual-studio-code-end-to-end-editing-and-debugging-tools-for-web-developers/read/9?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=articles\">Chapter Nine</a>, on working with extensions, should be of particular interest.</p> \n<h2 id=\"2buildacontactform\">2. Build a Contact Form</h2> \n<p>If you’re building a web application, it’s only a matter of time until you encounter HTML forms. They’re a big part of the web experience, and they can be complicated. For example, you need to make them accessible, and you need to make sure they render well on different browsers and on smaller screens. It can also be a challenge to style them consistently without breaking their usability.</p> \n<p>Forms are a critical part of a visitor’s journey on your site. Even if your visitor is sold on what you have to offer, a broken or even a badly laid out form could be enough for them to abandon ship. That means you lose the conversion.</p> \n<h3 id=\"projectidea-1\">Project Idea</h3> \n<p>Build and style a contact form. Concentrate on the alignment of the form fields, a prominent <a href=\"https://11web.com/what-is-call-to-action/\">CTA</a>, and make sure the form previews well across browsers and devices. Try to include various form controls, such as <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> elements and check boxes, while keeping the layout simple and elegant.</p> \n<p>You might also like to upload your finished form to <a href=\"https://codepen.io/\">CodePen</a>, an online community for testing and showcasing user-created HTML, CSS and JavaScript code snippets. When applying for a job, a well-curated CodePen account could potentially serve as a mini portfolio.</p> \n<h3 id=\"furtherreading-1\">Further Reading</h3> \n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/form-design-patterns?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=articles\">Form Design Patterns</a></em> offers ten recipes for different kinds of forms — registration forms, booking forms, login forms and more. Learn from the pros and find out how to make your forms both engaging and accessible to all. If you’re looking for a quick start with this project, I recommend reading the first part of the <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/form-design-patterns/read/1?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=articles\">first chapter</a>, which covers things such as labels, placeholders, styling and input types.</p> \n<h2 id=\"3becomeacquaintedwithclientsidevalidation\">3. Become Acquainted with Client-side Validation</h2> \n<p>You won’t get far as a web developer in 2020 without knowing JavaScript: it’s one of the most popular programming languages in the world and, frankly, a must-have skill.</p> \n<p>On the front end it’s used for a wide variety of tasks, such as making interactive elements for web pages (sliders, maps, charts, menus, chat widgets, etc.) and generally enhancing the user experience. One rather nice feature of the language is that it can manipulate the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model\">DOM</a>, so as to offer users instant feedback on an action without needing to reload the page. This makes web pages feel snappier and more responsive.</p> \n<h3 id=\"projectidea-2\">Project Idea</h3> \n<p>In this project, you should take the contact form you built in step two and augment it with client-side validation.</p> \n<p>Using the <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_form_input_types.asp\">correct input types</a> will get you a lot of the way there, but also try to add some custom validation. You should display error messages in an intuitive way and avoid using alert boxes. And if all that sounds a bit too easy, why not add a field which asks a question to ensure that the user isn’t a bot.</p> \n<h3 id=\"furtherreading-2\">Further Reading</h3> \n<p>If you’re new to the world of JavaScript programming, or would just like a quick and easy desk reference, then check out <em><a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/javascript-novice-to-ninja-2nd-edition?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=articles\">JavaScript: Novice to Ninja, 2nd Edition</a></em>. This step-by-step introduction to coding in JavaScript will show you how to to solve real-world problems and develop richer web applications. You’ll want to pay particular attention to <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/javascript-novice-to-ninja-2nd-edition/read/8?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=articles\">Chapter Eight</a>, which shows you how to use JavaScript to interact with an HTML form.</p> \n<h2 id=\"4makeacurrencyconverterusingthefixerapi\">4. Make a Currency Converter Using the Fixer API</h2> \n<p>In the past, JavaScript had a reputation as being a toy language — good for menus and animations, but not a lot else. And while that might have been the case in the early 2000s, in 2020 nothing could be further from the truth.</p> \n<p>Nowadays, entire apps are written in JavaScript. New tools and frameworks are introduced and developed at a rapid rate, and the language itself has undergone big changes since the arrival of ES2015 (aka ES6). It’s important you stay abreast of these changes, and have a good idea of what JavaScript is capable of and where it fits into the web development picture as a whole.</p> \n<h3 id=\"projectidea-3\">Project Idea</h3> \n<p>Make an app that allows users to convert one currency to another. Users should enter an amount, select the actual currency, select the desired currency and then the app should fetch the exchange rate from the <a href=\"https://fixer.io/\">Fixer API</a>. The user interface should be updated dynamically without any kind of page refresh.</p> \n<p>Use modern JavaScript features where you can. Complete the project using either vanilla JavaScript, or a library like <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/\">React</a> to handle the UI updates.</p> \n<h3 id=\"furtherreading-3\">Further Reading</h3> \n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/javascript-best-practice?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=articles\">JavaScript: Best Practice</a></em> is a collection of articles which take a look at modern JavaScript and how the language has evolved to allow you to write clean, maintainable, and reusable code. I would recommend reading the “<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/javascript-best-practice/read/1?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=articles\">Anatomy of a Modern JavaScript Application</a>”, “<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/javascript-best-practice/read/6?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=articles\">Using Modern JavaScript Syntax</a>” and “<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/javascript-best-practice/read/7?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=articles\">Flow Control in Modern JavaScript</a>”.</p> \n<h2 id=\"5designyourownportfoliowebsite\">5. Design Your Own Portfolio Website</h2> \n<p>In your career as a web developer, you’ll likely find yourself working alongside a designer on the same project. And while design and development can be considered separate disciplines, having a firm grasp of the design process will ease that relationship and stand you in good stead with your colleagues.</p> \n<p>Or perhaps you want to go it alone as a freelancer, taking projects from design to deployment. In this case, a generic-looking website won’t cut it. You’ll need to offer the client an eye-catching but also highly functional design that helps them achieve their business goals.</p> \n<h3 id=\"projectidea-4\">Project Idea</h3> \n<p>Design your own portfolio website — your place on the internet to present yourself and showcase your skills. Spend some time researching what makes a good portfolio design, then mock up a design of your own either with pencil and paper, or using a <a href=\"https://thedigitalprojectmanager.com/wireframe-tools/\">wireframing tool</a> of your choice.</p> \n<p>Design-wise, pay attention to the layout, the colors you’ll use, and the typography. Content-wise, consider which pages you’ll need (hint: you could include a contact form) and how to present both yourself and your work. There are <a href=\"https://undsgn.com/creating-a-portfolio-website-tips-on-how-to-do-it-right/\">lots of sites</a> around the Internet that will give you tips on what to include.</p> \n<h3 id=\"furtherreading-4\">Further Reading</h3> \n<p>Ok, I get it. Design is hard. But it doesn’t need to be …</p> \n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/the-principles-of-beautiful-web-design-3rd-edition/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=articles\">The Principles of Beautiful Web Design</a></em> is a fantastic book if you’re struggling with the design process. It will walk you through an example design, from concept to completion, teaching you a host of practical skills along the way.</p> \n<p>Start in Chapter One by reading about <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/the-principles-of-beautiful-web-design-3rd-edition/read/1/jz96kwyx?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=articles\">what makes good design</a> and take it from there.

I’ll also look at how to interact with a Mongo database from within a Node program, and also highlight some of the differences between Mongo and a traditional relational database (such as MySQL) along the way.</p> \n<h2 id=\"terminologyandbasicconcepts\">Terminology and Basic Concepts</h2> \n<p>MongoDB is a document-oriented database. This means that it doesn’t use tables and rows to store its data, but instead <em>collections</em> of JSON-like <em>documents</em>. These documents support embedded fields, so related data can be stored within them.</p> \n<p>MongoDB is also a schema-less database, so we don’t need to specify the number or type of columns before inserting our data.</p> \n<p>Here’s an example of what a MongoDB document might look like:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">{\n  _id: ObjectId(3da252d3902a),\n  type: \"Tutorial\",\n  title: \"An Introduction to MongoDB\",\n  author: \"Manjunath M\",\n  tags: [ \"mongodb\", \"compass\", \"crud\" ],\n  categories: [\n    {\n      name: \"javascript\",\n      description: \"Tutorialss on client-side and server-side JavaScript programming\"\n    },\n    {\n      name: \"databases\",\n      description: \"Tutorialss on different kinds of databases and their management\"\n    },\n  ],\n  content: \"MongoDB is a cross-platform, open-source, NoSQL database...\"\n}\n</code></pre> \n<p>As you can see, the document has a number of <em>fields</em> (<code>type</code>, <code>title</code> etc.), which store <em>values</em> (“Tutorial”, “An Introduction to MongoDB” etc.). These values can contain strings, numbers, arrays, arrays of sub-documents (for example, the <code>categories</code> field), geo-coordinates and more.</p> \n<p>The <code>_id</code> field name is reserved for use as a primary key. Its value must be unique in the collection, it’s immutable, and it may be of any type other than an array.</p> \n<p><em>Tip: for those wondering what “JSON-like” means, internally Mongo uses something called <a href=\"http://bsonspec.org/\">BSON</a> (short for Bin­ary JSON). In practice, you don’t really need to know much about BSON when working with MongoDB.</em></p> \n<p>As you might guess, a <strong>document</strong> in a NoSQL database corresponds to a <strong>row</strong> in an SQL database. A group of documents together is known as a <strong>collection</strong>, which is roughly synonymous with a <strong>table</strong> in a relational database.</p> \n<p>Here’s a table summarizing the different terms:</p> \n<table> \n <thead> \n  <tr> \n   <th>SQL Server</th> \n   <th>MongoDB</th> \n  </tr> \n </thead> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td>Database</td> \n   <td>Database</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td>Table</td> \n   <td>Collection</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td>Row</td> \n   <td>Document</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td>Column</td> \n   <td>Field</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td>Index</td> \n   <td>Index</td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p>If you’re starting a new project and are unsure whether to choose Mongo or a relational database such as MySQL, now might be a good time to read our tutorial <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/sql-vs-nosql-choose/\">SQL vs NoSQL: How to Choose</a>.</p> \n<p>With that said, let’s go ahead and install MongoDB.</p> \n<h2 id=\"installingmongodb\">Installing MongoDB</h2> \n<p><em>Note: if you’d just like to follow along with this tutorial without installing any software on your PC, there are a couple of online services you can use. <a href=\"https://mongoplayground.net/\">Mongo playground</a>, for example, is a simple sandbox to test and share MongoDB queries online.</em></p> \n<p>MongoDB comes in various editions. The one we’re interested in is the MongoDB Community Edition.</p> \n<p>The project’s home page has excellent documentation on installing Mongo, and I won’t try to replicate that here. Rather, I’ll offer you links to instructions for each of the main operating systems:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/\">Install MongoDB Community Edition on Windows</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/\">Install MongoDB Community Edition on macOS</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/\">Install MongoDB Community Edition on Ubuntu</a></li> \n</ul> \n<p>If you use a non-Ubuntu-based version of Linux, you can check out <a href=\"https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/#mongodb-community-edition-installation-tutorials\">this page</a> for installation instructions for other distros. MongoDB is also normally available through the official Linux software channels, but sometimes this will pull in an outdated version.</p> \n<h3 id=\"postinstallationconfiguration\">Post Installation Configuration</h3> \n<p>Once you have MongoDB installed for your system, you might encounter this error:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">dbpath (/data/db) does not exist.\n Create this directory or give existing directory in --dbpath.\n See http://dochub.mongodb.org/core/startingandstoppingmongo\n</code></pre> \n<p>This means that Mongo can’t find (or access) the directory it uses to store its databases. This is pretty easy to remedy:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">sudo mkdir -p /data/db\nsudo chown -R `id -un` /data/db\n</code></pre> \n<p>The first command creates the <code>data/db</code> directory. The second sets permissions so that Mongo can write to that directory.</p> \n<h3 id=\"installthecompassgui\">Install the Compass GUI</h3> \n<p>We’ll be using the command line in this tutorial, but MongoDB also offers a tool called Compass to connect to and manage your databases using a GUI.</p> \n<p>If you’re on Windows, Compass can be installed as part of the main Mongo installation (just select the appropriate option from the wizard). Otherwise, you can <a href=\"https://docs.mongodb.com/compass/master/install/\">download Compass for your respective OS here</a>.</p> \n<p>This is what it looks like:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/1579526415MongoDB-Compass.png\" alt=\"Mongo DB Compass GUI\" /></p> \n<h3 id=\"themongoshell\">The Mongo Shell</h3> \n<p>We can test our installation by opening the Mongo shell. You can do this by opening a terminal window and typing <code>mongo</code>.</p> \n<p><em>Note: this assumes that <code>&lt;mongodb installation dir&gt;/bin</code> is in your path. If for any reason this isn’t the case, change into the <code>&lt;mongodb installation dir&gt;/bin</code> directory and rerun the command.</em></p> \n<p>If you get an <code>Error: couldn't connect to server</code> error, you’ll need to start the Mongo server (in a second terminal window) with the command <code>mongod</code>.</p> \n<p>Once you’re in the Mongo shell, type in <code>db.version()</code> to see the version of MongoDB you’re running. At the time of writing, this should output <code>4.2.2</code>.</p> \n<p>Please note that you can exit the Mongo shell by running <code>quit()</code> and the Mongo daemon by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> at any time.</p> \n<p>Now let’s get acquainted with some MongoDB basics.</p> \n<h2 id=\"basicdatabaseoperations\">Basic Database Operations</h2> \n<p>Enter the Mongo shell if you haven’t already (by typing <code>mongo</code> into a terminal):</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">[mj@localhost ~]$ mongo\nMongoDB shell version v4.2.2\nconnecting to: mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/?compressors=disabled&amp;gssapiServiceName=mongodb\nImplicit session: session { \"id\" : UUID(\"08a624a0-b330-4233-b56b-1d5b15a48fea\") }\nMongoDB server version: 4.2.2\n</code></pre> \n<p>Let’s start off by creating a database to work with. To create a database, MongoDB has a <code>use DATABASE_NAME</code> command:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">&gt; use exampledb\nswitched to db exampledb\n</code></pre> \n<p>To display all the existing databases, try <code>show dbs</code>:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">&gt; show dbs\n\nadmin          0.000GB\nconfig         0.000GB\nlocal          0.000GB\n</code></pre> \n<p>The <code>exampledb</code> isn’t in the list because we need to insert at least one document into the database. To insert a document, you can use <code>db.COLLECTION_NAME.insertOne({\"key\":\"value\"})</code>. Here’s an example:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">&gt; db.users.insertOne({name: \"Bob\"})\n{\n   \"acknowledged\" : true,\n   \"insertedId\" : ObjectId(\"5a52c53b223039ee9c2daaec\")\n}\n</code></pre> \n<p>MongoDB automatically creates a new <code>users</code> collection and inserts a document with the key–value pair <code>'name':'Bob'</code>. The ObjectId returned is the ID of the document inserted. MongoDB creates a unique ObjectId for each document on creation, and it becomes the default value of the <code>_id</code> field.</p> \n<p>Now we should be able to see our database:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">&gt;show dbs\nadmin          0.000GB\nconfig         0.000GB\nexampledb      0.000GB\nlocal          0.000GB\n</code></pre> \n<p>Similarly, you can confirm that the collection was created using the <code>show collections</code> command:</p> \n<pre><code>&gt; show collections\nusers\n</code></pre> \n<p>We’ve created a database, added a collection named <code>users</code> and inserted a document into it. Now let’s try dropping it. To drop an existing database, use the <code>dropDatabase()</code> command, as exemplified below:</p> \n<pre><code>&gt;db.dropDatabase()\n{ \"dropped\" : \"exampledb\", \"ok\" : 1 }\n</code></pre> \n<p><code>show dbs</code> confirms that the database was indeed dropped:</p> \n<pre><code>&gt; show dbs\nadmin          0.000GB\nconfig         0.000GB\nlocal          0.000GB\n</code></pre> \n<p>For more database operations, please consult the MongoDB reference page on <a href=\"https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/\">database commands</a>.</p> \n<p> Continue reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-mongodb/?utm_source=rss\">An Introduction to MongoDB</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=_WbfHU3L3kk:Pb5QiEbuc_E:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=_WbfHU3L3kk:Pb5QiEbuc_E:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=_WbfHU3L3kk:Pb5QiEbuc_E:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=_WbfHU3L3kk:Pb5QiEbuc_E:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/_WbfHU3L3kk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Sun, 23 Feb 2020 07:00:30 +0000","feedId":6128,"bgimg":"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/1581897968mongodb.png","linkMd5":"f070e28f116e1ac183ddc7ff115ae69b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn21@2020_6/2020/08/24/22-51-25-093_dbbee966c0ebd4d9.webp","destWidth":600,"destHeight":339,"sourceBytes":7684,"destBytes":7684,"author":"Manjunath M","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/1581897968mongodb.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn21@2020_6/2020/08/24/22-51-25-093_dbbee966c0ebd4d9.webp","https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/1579526415MongoDB-Compass.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn83@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-51-41-671_2ea8740132f434a8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn15@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-39-311_6409ebad5acff93a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn3@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-47-113_bf83e999bebef320.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=_WbfHU3L3kk:Pb5QiEbuc_E:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn8@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-51-39-234_d45dc1030bcfe370.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/_WbfHU3L3kk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn67@2020_6/2020/08/24/22-51-42-896_74d33e9d62c05120.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598309483300},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","title":"30 Web Development Checklists Every Team Should Keep Handy","link":"https://www.sitepoint.com/?p=175724","description":"<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/web-development-checklists/?utm_source=rss\" title=\"30 Web Development Checklists Every Team Should Keep Handy\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1585614006web-dev-resources.png\" alt=\"30 Web Development Resources Every Team Should Keep Handy\" srcset=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1585614006web-dev-resources-300x170.png 300w, https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1585614006web-dev-resources.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /> </a> \n<p><strong>Building a website or app and making it available for the world is a complex business.

And while some power users might take advantage of the goodies, if you aren’t well acquainted with these platforms beforehand, you’ll find out that the learning curve to start using these services is very steep, and that for every cloud service you intend to use you’ll need to find out first in which way each provider reinvented the wheel before you can actually spin it into any free deployment.</p> \n<p>Let’s see now how a handful of smaller players rose to prominence with free hosting services that aren’t a hassle to implement and have fewer strings attached.</p> \n<p> Continue reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/how-to-host-static-sites-for-free-with-an-automated-pipeline/?utm_source=rss\">How to Host Static Sites for Free with an Automated Pipeline</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=7-Hx4dh2RiY:Ow0De2cxZw0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=7-Hx4dh2RiY:Ow0De2cxZw0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=7-Hx4dh2RiY:Ow0De2cxZw0:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=7-Hx4dh2RiY:Ow0De2cxZw0:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/7-Hx4dh2RiY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 27 Jul 2020 18:23:40 +0000","feedId":6128,"bgimg":"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1595820731free-static-web-hosting.png","linkMd5":"7b507d14614482649f98a2d100ba2b41","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn30@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-51-25-627_c4a14dc1cab2c93b.webp","destWidth":600,"destHeight":340,"sourceBytes":12416,"destBytes":12416,"author":"Lucero del Alba","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1595820731free-static-web-hosting.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn30@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-51-25-627_c4a14dc1cab2c93b.webp","https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1595294384Jamstack_Logo_Original.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn95@2020_6/2020/08/24/22-51-43-041_adbddd8db48491dd.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn15@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-39-311_6409ebad5acff93a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn3@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-47-113_bf83e999bebef320.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=7-Hx4dh2RiY:Ow0De2cxZw0:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn84@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-51-38-972_6a474c7823a79c19.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/7-Hx4dh2RiY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn83@2020_4/2020/08/24/22-51-44-579_028efb975457ec3a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598309483250},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","title":"How to Make a Career Transition Into Web Development","link":"https://editor.sitepoint.com/?p=176339","description":"<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/how-to-make-a-career-transition-into-web-development/?utm_source=rss\" title=\"How to Make a Career Transition Into Web Development\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1592379114web-dev-job.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1592379114web-dev-job-300x170.png 300w, https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1592379114web-dev-job.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /> </a> \n<p><strong>Over the past ten years, there has been an explosion of interest in web development.</strong></p> \n<p>The 2008–09 financial crisis caused millions of young adult workers to lose their jobs and rethink their entire careers from scratch. From the ashes of this crisis, web development has become the darling of the job market.</p> \n<p>An increased number of companies, small and large, have turned to the wonders of web development to disrupt or adapt to the new “web 2.0” environment. These companies know that without a web presence, their businesses are doomed to be ignored.</p> \n<p>The spike in interest in web development has led to millions of young adults thinking of it not just as a skill to learn, but as a career to adopt. But for those who have already gone through college and spent a life worth of savings to get their degree, switching their careers to web development seems like a tough proposition.</p> \n<p>If you’re in this position, the questions are hard. Do you have to start all over again, taking expensive and lengthy classes to learn the skills? Or can you jump ship from a traditional career to web development and still make it until you get a well-paying job?</p> \n<p>The answer is, no, you don’t have to go back to college to <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/21-steps-to-becoming-a-successful-web-developer/\">become a web developer</a>. And yes, you can transition to web development if you prepare yourself for it.</p> \n<p>People from all backgrounds have been able to switch to a career in web development. Their advice will shine a light for those who want to do the same without having to sacrifice everything in the way.</p> \n<h2 id=\"choosetherightselfeducationpath\">Choose the Right Self-education Path</h2> \n<p>To say that it is possible to become a web developer through self-education may have seemed like alchemy 20 years ago. In 2020, self-education appears to be the rule rather than the exception.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2016#work\">2016 StackOverflow annual survey</a> found that almost 70% of its respondents considered themselves as “self-taught.” Whether they learned to code entirely on their own or partially is something the survey left out. However, it still shows the relevance self-education has for professional web developers.</p> \n<p>For someone who wants to become a developer, learning on their own is more of a pragmatic obligation than a moral one. Without a formal degree, self-education is the only path to acquire the skills necessary to launch a web development career.</p> \n<p>The question, however, shouldn’t be focused on whether self-education is a good idea or not. What truly matters, according to several developers, is to pick the right language and put all energies available into mastering it before focusing on a specific framework. It seems, unlike what the business saying goes, that it’s better to put all the eggs in one basket than to spread them out.</p> \n<p>For Lexis Hanson, a former finance professional turned developer, mastering a programming language first — one based on her needs — and focusing on frameworks and libraries second <a href=\"https://code.likeagirl.io/thoughts-on-becoming-a-self-taught-software-engineer-c8d8e7bde704?gi=d29f1405520b\">was critical</a> to her self education.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>[Mastering a programming language first] forced me to stay focused on getting extremely comfortable with vanilla JavaScript before diving into frameworks, which made that next step significantly easier.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Putting language over frameworks may be the smart decision, but it still doesn’t help to pick the right one. One solution that can shine a light on the issue is to <em>pick a personal project</em>. The specific technical needs required to fulfill your project will guide your choices better.</p> \n<p>One self-taught developer who’s in favor of this approach is Avi Flombaum. Instead of picking the first language that pops into a Google search, he <a href=\"https://medium.com/learn-love-code/what-i-wish-i-knew-before-teaching-myself-how-to-code-402cc31d566a\">explains</a>:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>Beginners shouldn’t care about the languages they’re using. They should care that their chosen language matches their goals, if they’re getting expertise and depth and in it — and, of course, if they love using it.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>A personal project will foster your passion for programming, and it will help you decide on the language you should consider to build it. Some common ideas include:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>a static website</li> \n <li>a basic app, like a to-do list</li> \n <li>an automation script</li> \n</ul> \n<p>If you’re short of ideas, you can check the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/\">r/DailyProgrammer</a> subreddit, which posts daily projects with a detailed background, challenges, and inputs to use.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15923787101-reddit-1024x643.jpg\" alt=\"Reddit\" width=\"1024\" height=\"643\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-176344\" /></p> \n<p>Another vital aspect to consider before settling on a specific language is to think about your natural problem-solving methodologies. How do you break down problems? How do you think about their solutions?</p> \n<p>In the case of Hanson, she wasn’t sure whether to choose a language based on object-oriented programming or functional programming. But instead of going with the wisdom of the crowds and picking a popular language, she thought about the way she solved problems in general. Based on that introspection, she chose the programming paradigm that best suited her (which happened to be JavaScript).</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>Functional programming resonated with me (you might have other preferences), and I challenged myself to approach problems from a “functional-first” perspective. In my opinion, this forced me to think more flexibly about programming and how functions and components should “compose” with one another.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>As you learn the basics of a language, consider reading its documentation, especially if you’re already toying with a specific framework. At first, this may seem hard, but the more you practice your skills, and the more you read the documentation, the more sense it will all make.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15923787382-angular-1024x425.jpg\" alt=\"Angular\" width=\"1024\" height=\"425\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-176345\" /></p> \n<p>Vinicius Brasil <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-to-learn-a-new-programming-language-faster-dc31ec8367cb\">recommends</a> using GitHub to find and read production code in the language you’re learning. He adds, “If you are confident to contribute, that’s even better.”</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15923787693-angular-1024x773.jpg\" alt=\"Angular\" width=\"1024\" height=\"773\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-176346\" /></p> \n<p>Whenever you get stuck, don’t panic. Web development is a friendly skill whose practitioners share solutions to common problems. Stack Overflow is the most popular place developers go to ask questions and share advice. And when you can’t seem to find a solution, remember: “<a href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Google%20is%20your%20friend\">Google is your friend</a>.”</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15923788004-stack-overflow-1024x603.jpg\" alt=\"Stack Overflow\" width=\"1024\" height=\"603\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-176347\" /></p> \n<p>Among the many challenges self-educated developers often face is getting accustomed to the rather strange way of writing code. Many experienced developers will tell you that the way you write a string of code is as important as what that code is meant to do. The truthfulness of such a statement is a discussion of its own, and it has its merits, but for a beginner developer who’s learning on the side and with their own resources, writing perfect code is more of a luxury than a necessity, at least in the beginning.</p> \n<p>Such is the case of <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/google-not-learn-not-why-searching-can-be-better-than-knowing-79838f7a0f06/\">Jeremy Gunter</a>, whose “learn first, clean later” mentality became the greatest boon to his confidence during the early days of his self-education. His methodology consisted of using pseudo-code to make his code work and then Googling how they are supposed to be written.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>Instead of going mental trying to remember method names, I focused on what action I needed to perform. When I wanted to add an item to the beginning of an array, I found it easier to google the phrase “add item to beginning of array JavaScript” than to try and use my own memory to differentiate between shift(), unshift(), and pop().</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Any experienced developer will probably grind their teeth at the idea of using pseudo-code over syntax. Still, for the self-educated folk, Gunter’s approach resembles more to Mark Zuckerberg’s “learn fast and break things” mantra than to Tim Peters’ “beautiful is better than ugly.”</p> \n<p>All in its time, Mr. Peters, all in its time.</p> \n<h2 id=\"buildanetwork\">Build a Network</h2> \n<p>College education is often seen as a mechanical process where a student acquires all the required knowledge to become a professional in their chosen field. Under this mentality, anything that doesn’t imply studying and memorizing technical concepts is secondary.</p> \n<p>This simplistic idea leaves a significant advantage that college-educated developers have over self-taught ones, and on which the latter must work if they want to be in an equal position to the former. That is, the <em>professional network</em> college provides to its students.</p> \n<p>A professional network is built upon a web of mentors, professors, job seekers, and classmates. Some of these people will eventually become colleagues, and some will act as referrals and references for job prospects, both critical elements to succeed in any professional career.</p> \n<p>To dismiss the importance that a network like this has over web developers is to undervalue one of the most prominent advantages colleges bring to their students. Thus, anyone who is considering switching to a career in web development must prioritize building this network while they develop their skillset.</p> \n<p>As a self-educated developer, you may not have professors or job seekers around you. The work, then, should be focused on building strong relationships with those developers who may help you in your journey.</p> \n<p>To start, you need to consider participating in local development events and meetups. Whether these meetings are general or language-specific isn’t important. What matters is that you proactively meet other people and become a part of the community.</p> \n<p>Nnena Ndukwe, a college dropout and former tanning consultant, <a href=\"https://codeburst.io/how-i-went-from-mopping-floors-at-a-tanning-salon-to-becoming-a-software-developer-7dc4d2e8d21a\">explains</a> the usefulness of attending meetups throughout her self-education journey:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>Having these conversations about tech with people in the field helped me gain more knowledge about opportunities for work, organizations to volunteer for, and tech or social events to attend that would be fulfilling. One opportunity always leads to the next via networking.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>To prove her point, Nnenna says she got her first development job through a bootcamp she heard about in one of the meetups she participated in. Whether meetups generate jobs directly or indirectly isn’t relevant. The point is that they compound the opportunities available for switching to a web development career.</p> \n<p>The most popular site to find local meetups is Meetup.com, but you can also use Facebook events and Eventbrite. A quick search in any of these sites will bring you dozens of meetups in your area.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15923788295-meetup-1024x529.jpg\" alt=\"MeetUp\" width=\"1024\" height=\"529\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-176348\" /></p> \n<p>Just like Google is your friend when it comes to learning to code, you can also use it to find events in your area. You can use a general search query like “web development” plus your city, or a more specific one like “Python” (or any other language or framework you want) plus your city, and you’ll get many events close to you.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15923788546-google-1024x928.jpg\" alt=\"Google\" width=\"1024\" height=\"928\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-176349\" /></p> \n<p>You can both participate as an attendee and use the networking available to meet others who can help you, or you can give a talk on your self-taught process.</p> \n<p>Most attendees will be surprised and glad to meet someone who’s trying to make the switch without a degree. You may even meet others who happened to achieve your career switching goal and who can give you feedback and support on your journey.</p> \n<p>Another option to build a network is to participate in online communities. There are dozens of <a href=\"https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/46-slack-groups-developers\">Slack chats for developers</a>, and these will provide you with a great deal of information about the latest news, ideas, and people to connect with. You can even search for developers in your area you can meet for a coffee.</p> \n<p>These events and meetups aren’t just useful for meeting colleagues. As Nnenna Ndukwe attests, they are also effective for meeting potential clients or employers as well.</p> \n<p> Continue reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/how-to-make-a-career-transition-into-web-development/?utm_source=rss\">How to Make a Career Transition Into Web Development</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=Thh9E_7so9k:b-cDw2K8kd4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=Thh9E_7so9k:b-cDw2K8kd4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=Thh9E_7so9k:b-cDw2K8kd4:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=Thh9E_7so9k:b-cDw2K8kd4:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/Thh9E_7so9k\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 22:00:31 +0000","feedId":6128,"bgimg":"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1592379114web-dev-job.png","linkMd5":"ca98f621de472d2541b4bd02a6ec334d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn45@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-51-27-222_74dd0377fa707c6a.webp","destWidth":600,"destHeight":339,"sourceBytes":6174,"destBytes":6174,"author":"Ivan Kreimer","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1592379114web-dev-job.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn45@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-51-27-222_74dd0377fa707c6a.webp","https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15923787101-reddit-1024x643.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn0@2020_1/404.jpg","https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15923787382-angular-1024x425.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn0@2020_1/404.jpg","https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15923787693-angular-1024x773.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn0@2020_1/404.jpg","https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15923788004-stack-overflow-1024x603.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn0@2020_1/404.jpg","https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15923788295-meetup-1024x529.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn0@2020_1/404.jpg","https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15923788546-google-1024x928.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn0@2020_1/404.jpg","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn15@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-39-311_6409ebad5acff93a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn3@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-47-113_bf83e999bebef320.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=Thh9E_7so9k:b-cDw2K8kd4:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn76@2020_4/2020/08/24/22-51-44-554_de9b2a643806a7b3.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/Thh9E_7so9k":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn32@2020_6/2020/08/24/22-51-37-737_9efdb43460ef3dca.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598309483262},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","title":"The Complete Developer&#8217;s Guide to Windows Subsystem for Linux 2","link":"https://www.sitepoint.com/?p=173424","description":"<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/wsl2-windows-terminal/?utm_source=rss\" title=\"The Complete Developer’s Guide to Windows Subsystem for Linux 2\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/1596512234windows-subsystem-linux-2.png\" alt=\"The Complete Guide to the Windows Subsystem for Linux 2\" srcset=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/1596512234windows-subsystem-linux-2-300x170.png 300w, https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/1596512234windows-subsystem-linux-2.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /> </a> \n<p><strong>This tutorial demonstrates how to install, manage, and use a full Linux environment on your Windows 10 PC with WSL2. You’ll be running a Linux kernel and executing native applications while seamlessly sharing files and services with Windows code editors and browsers.</strong></p> \n<h2 id=\"whyuselinux\">Why Use Linux?</h2> \n<p>Your host almost certainly uses Linux. It’s fast, open source, and runs the majority of web software including:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>servers (Apache, NGINX, LiteSpeed, etc.)</li> \n <li>language runtimes (PHP, Python, Node.js, Ruby, etc.)</li> \n <li>utility libraries (image manipulation, ZIP creation, emailers, etc.)</li> \n <li>databases (MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, etc.)</li> \n <li>other dependencies (Elastic Search, RabbitMQ, proxies, etc.)</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Some of these dependencies may be available on Windows and macOS, but installing and maintaining identical versions is difficult. They’re often slower and you may encounter subtle differences which will not become apparent until you deploy.</p> \n<p>Some developers install Linux on their desktop, but that may not be viable if you regularly require non-Linux software such as Microsoft or Adobe products. Alternative options:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>Use two PCs or dual boot on a single device. Switching between systems can be cumbersome.</li> \n <li>Run a Linux virtual machine (VM) using Hyper-V, VirtualBox, Parallels, WMware, or Vagrant. This requires considerable OS resources and reasonable IT knowledge. Sharing files between systems can be awkward.</li> \n <li>Run web applications in Docker containers. It’s another topic to learn and Docker itself runs natively on Linux. Both the Windows and macOS editions use Linux below the surface.</li> \n</ol> \n<h2 id=\"whatisthewindowssubsystemforlinux\">What is the Windows Subsystem for Linux?</h2> \n<p>The Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) lets developers run a Linux environment directly on Windows 10. It’s an unmodified OS, but highly integrated into Windows and without the overhead of a virtual machine.</p> \n<p>WSL1 was groundbreaking and translated Linux system calls to Windows equivalents. This could be slow and several features weren’t available. WSL2 uses Hyper-V virtual machine technology so Linux compatibility is excellent and file access is up to 20x faster than before.</p> \n<h2 id=\"windows10requirements\">Windows 10 Requirements</h2> \n<p>WSL2 is compatible with the Home, Pro, or Server editions of Windows but <em>not</em> Windows 10 S (although you can often upgrade to the Home edition for free).</p> \n<p>The Windows May 2020 update is essential — that’s version 2004 or above. Choose the <strong>Settings</strong> cog from the Start menu, then select <strong>System</strong> followed by <strong>About</strong>. The <strong>Windows specifications</strong> are shown at the bottom of the panel:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/1596503684windows-requirements.png\" alt=\"Windows specifications\" width=\"249\" height=\"155\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-176895\" /></p> \n<p>The update has been slowly rolling out since the end of May 2020. If you have a version below 2004, you may be able to trigger the update by clicking the <strong>Check for updates</strong> button in <strong>Settings</strong>, then <strong>Update &amp; Security</strong>.</p> \n<p>If 2004 remains stubbornly unavailable, you may be able to download and install it manually from <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10\">microsoft.com/software-download/windows10</a></p> \n<p>However, be aware some PCs report that version 2004 is currently unavailable in the <strong>Windows Update</strong> panel. You won’t be able to upgrade until Microsoft has released a fix for your device.</p> \n<h2 id=\"pcrequirements\">PC Requirements</h2> \n<p>WSL2 (and Hyper-V) require hardware virtualization support to be enabled in your BIOS.</p> \n<p><em>WARNING: <strong>fiddling with your BIOS settings can trash your PC!</strong> Be careful when making changes. Consult your manufacturer’s help pages or search for online advice about your specific make and model.</em></p> \n<p>Hardware virtualization will be active on most devices, but you can check by rebooting, and opening the BIOS panels — typically by hitting the <kbd>DEL</kbd>, <kbd>F2</kbd>, or <kbd>F10</kbd> key as the system starts. Look for <strong>Virtualization Technology</strong>, <strong>VTx</strong> or similar options. Ensure they are enabled, save, and reboot the device.</p> \n<p>Finally, ensure your <code>C:</code> drive has at least 1GB of spare disk space — ideally more. You may be able to free up some space in <strong>Settings</strong>, <strong>System</strong>, <strong>Storage</strong> or using the <strong>Disk clean-up</strong> tool in <strong>Windows Administrative Tools</strong>.</p> \n<p>At the time of writing, WSL2 will install Linux to your <code>C:</code> drive, although it’s possible to <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/?p=173424#move-your-linux-disk-image\">move it elsewhere</a> after installation.</p> \n<h2 id=\"enablewsl2\">Enable WSL2</h2> \n<p>The <strong>Virtual Machine Platform</strong> and <strong>Windows Subsystem for Linux</strong> features must be enabled in <strong>Turn Windows features on or off</strong>. The panel can be accessed by hitting Start and typing <em>“features”</em> or from the <strong>Programs and Features</strong> icon in the classic Control Panel.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/1596503725windows-features.png\" alt=\"enable WSL2\" width=\"415\" height=\"368\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-176896\" /></p> \n<p>Alternatively, you can execute the following commands in a Windows Powershell terminal run as an Administrator:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart\ndism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart\n</code></pre> \n<p>Reboot Windows 10, then enable WSL2 as the default by entering the following command in a Windows Powershell or command prompt:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">wsl --set-default-version 2\n</code></pre> \n<h2 id=\"downloadlinux\">Download Linux</h2> \n<p>You can install any number of Linux distros from the <strong>Microsoft Store</strong> accessed in the Start menu. This includes Ubuntu, Debian, SUSE, Kali, and Alpine. Enter <em>“Linux”</em> in the search box:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/1596503767store.png\" alt=\"Microsoft Store\" width=\"1013\" height=\"611\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-176897\" /></p> \n<p><strong>Ubuntu</strong> is a good choice unless you have specific requirements. The latest edition will be installed if you click the <strong>Ubuntu</strong> icon followed the <strong>Get</strong> button.</p> \n<p>The download could take a while depending on your network speed.</p> \n<h2 id=\"launchlinux\">Launch Linux</h2> \n<p>Following download, click the <strong>Launch</strong> button on the <strong>Microsoft Store</strong> app, or the new <strong>Ubuntu</strong> icon in the Start menu. This will complete the installation process and can take several minutes.</p> \n<p><em>Note: the first time you launch a WSL2 distro, you <strong>may</strong> see a message in the terminal about a kernel update. Copy the link into your browser, then download and install the update. You will need to launch Ubuntu again to continue with the installation.</em></p> \n<p>You’ll be prompted to enter a username and password. These are the credentials for Linux administration: <em>they are completely separate from your Windows username and password</em> (although choosing the same ones may be practical).</p> \n<p>Linux will eventually be ready and your terminal will show content similar to this:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">Installing, this may take a few minutes...\nPlease create a default UNIX user account. The username does not need to match your Windows username.\nFor more information visit: https://aka.ms/wslusers\nEnter new UNIX username: ******\nNew password:\nRetype new password:\npasswd: password updated successfully\nInstallation successful!\nTo run a command as administrator (user \"root\"), use \"sudo &lt;command&gt;\".\nSee \"man sudo_root\" for details.\n\nWelcome to Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (GNU/Linux 4.19.104-microsoft-standard x86_64)\n\n * Documentation:  https://help.ubuntu.com\n * Management:     https://landscape.canonical.com\n * Support:        https://ubuntu.com/advantage\n\n  System information as of Mon Jul 6 12:07:38 BST 2020\n\n  System load:  0.27               Processes:             8\n  Usage of /:   0.4% of 250.98GB   Users logged in:       0\n  Memory usage: 0%                 IPv4 address for eth0: 172.21.232.173\n  Swap usage:   0%\n\n0 updates can be installed immediately.\n0 of these updates are security updates.\n\nThe list of available updates is more than a week old.\nTo check for new updates run: sudo apt update\n</code></pre> \n<h2 id=\"updatelinux\">Update Linux</h2> \n<p>There are likely to be several Linux updates. To update Ubuntu, enter the following commands in the Linux terminal:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">sudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n</code></pre> \n<p>Other Linux distros will have a similar process, but check the documentation for assistance.</p> \n<h2 id=\"switchbetweenwsl1andwsl2\">Switch Between WSL1 and WSL2</h2> \n<p>Existing WSL1 distros can be converted to WSL2. Entering the following command in a Windows Powershell terminal to display the installed Linux distros and their WSL version:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">PS C:\\&gt; wsl --list --verbose\n\n  NAME    STATE    VERSION\n* Ubuntu  Running  1\n</code></pre> \n<p>(The * asterisk highlights the default Linux installation.)</p> \n<p>To switch <code>Ubuntu</code> to WSL2, enter:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">wsl --set-version Ubuntu 2\n</code></pre> \n<p>Similarly, to switch back to WSL1, enter:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">wsl --set-version Ubuntu 1\n</code></pre> \n<h2 id=\"setadefaultlinuxdistribution\">Set a Default Linux Distribution</h2> \n<p>When you have multiple Linux distributions installed, one must be set as the default. It will be used when <code>wsl</code> is entered in a Windows Powershell terminal.</p> \n<p>To set the default distro, list your installations:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">wsl --list\n</code></pre> \n<p>and set a default with:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">wsl --setdefault &lt;DistributionName&gt;\n</code></pre> \n<p>Ubuntu example: <code>wsl --setdefault Ubuntu</code>.</p> \n<h2 id=\"runlinuxasaspecificuser\">Run Linux as a Specific User</h2> \n<p>To run your default distribution as a specific user, enter the following command in a Windows Powershell terminal:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">wsl --user &lt;username&gt;\n</code></pre> \n<p>A default user is defined <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/?p=173424#launch-linux\">during installation</a> and you can create others. A <code>root</code> user is also created, but you should avoid using it under normal circumstances. <em>It’s too easy to enter a dangerous command!</em></p> \n<h2 id=\"moveyourlinuxdiskimage\">Move Your Linux Disk Image</h2> \n<p>The Linux disk image is installed on your <code>C:</code> drive. Optionally, you can move it to another drive to free up space. The following instructions presume you’ll move it to <code>D:\\wsl</code>.</p> \n<p>In a Windows Powershell terminal (<strong>not</strong> the Ubuntu terminal), enter <code>wsl --list</code> to view your Linux distributions, then export one by name to a back-up <code>.tar</code> file, e.g. <code>D:\\backup\\ubuntu.tar</code>:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">mkdir D:\\backup\nwsl --export Ubuntu D:\\backup\\ubuntu.tar\n</code></pre> \n<p>Unregister the same distribution to remove it from the <code>C:</code> drive:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">wsl --unregister Ubuntu\n</code></pre> \n<p>Enter <code>wsl --list</code> to verify the distribution has been removed.</p> \n<p>Import the backup into a new WSL2 distribution at another location, such as <code>D:\\wsl</code>:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">mkdir D:\\wsl\nwsl --import Ubuntu D:\\wsl\\ D:\\backup\\ubuntu.tar\n</code></pre> \n<p>Verify it has been successfully created by entering <code>wsl --list</code> and launching the <strong>Ubuntu</strong> app from the Start menu.</p> \n<p>Unfortunately, Ubuntu will now use <code>root</code> as the default user.

You may have an event, a sale, a promotion, or a game. You can build a clock in raw JavaScript rather than reaching for the nearest plugin. While there are many great clock plugins, here are the benefits you’ll get from using raw JavaScript:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Your code will be lightweight because it will have zero dependencies.</li> \n <li>Your website will perform better. You won’t need to load external scripts and stylesheets.</li> \n <li>You’ll have more control. You will have built the clock to behave exactly the way you want it to (rather than trying to bend a plugin to your will).</li> \n</ul> \n<p>So, without further ado, here’s how to make your own countdown clock in a mere 18 lines of JavaScript.</p> \n<p><em>For in-depth JavaScript knowledge, read our book, <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/javascript-novice-to-ninja-2nd-edition?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=articles\">JavaScript: Novice to Ninja, 2nd Edition</a>.</em></p> \n<h2 id=\"basicclockcountdowntoaspecificdateortime\">Basic Clock: Count down to a Specific Date or Time</h2> \n<p>Here’s a quick outline of the steps involved in creating a basic clock:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Set a valid end date.</li> \n <li>Calculate the time remaining.</li> \n <li>Convert the time to a usable format.</li> \n <li>Output the clock data as a reusable object.</li> \n <li>Display the clock on the page, and stop the clock when it reaches zero.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3 id=\"setavalidenddate\">Set a Valid End Date</h3> \n<p>First, you’ll need to set a valid end date. This should be a string in any of the formats understood by JavaScript’s <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/parse\">Date.parse()</a> method. For example:</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601\">ISO 8601</a> format:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">const deadline = '2015-12-31';\n</code></pre> \n<p>The short format:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">const deadline = '31/12/2015';\n</code></pre> \n<p>Or, the long format:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">const deadline = 'December 31 2015';\n</code></pre> \n<p>Each of these formats allows you to specify an exact time and a time zone (or an offset from UTC in the case of ISO dates). For example:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">const deadline = 'December 31 2015 23:59:59 GMT+0200';\n</code></pre> \n<p>You can read more about date formatting in JavaScript in <a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff743760\">this article</a>.</p> \n<h3 id=\"calculatethetimeremaining\">Calculate the Time Remaining</h3> \n<p>The next step is to calculate the time remaining. We need to write a function that takes a string representing a given end time (as outlined above). We then calculate the difference between that time and the current time. Here’s what that looks like:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">function getTimeRemaining(endtime){\n  const total = Date.parse(endtime) - Date.parse(new Date());\n  const seconds = Math.floor( (total/1000) % 60 );\n  const minutes = Math.floor( (total/1000/60) % 60 );\n  const hours = Math.floor( (total/(1000*60*60)) % 24 );\n  const days = Math.floor( total/(1000*60*60*24) );\n\n  return {\n    total,\n    days,\n    hours,\n    minutes,\n    seconds\n  };\n}\n</code></pre> \n<p>First, we’re creating a variable <code>total</code>, to hold the remaining time until the deadline. The <code>Date.parse()</code> function converts a time string into a value in milliseconds. This allows us to subtract two times from each other and get the amount of time in between.</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">const total = Date.parse(endtime) - Date.parse(new Date());\n</code></pre> \n<h3 id=\"convertthetimetoausableformat\">Convert the Time to a Usable Format</h3> \n<p>Now we want to convert the milliseconds to days, hours, minutes, and seconds. Let’s use seconds as an example:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">const seconds = Math.floor( (t/1000) % 60 );\n</code></pre> \n<p>Let’s break down what’s going on here.</p> \n<ol> \n <li>Divide milliseconds by 1000 to convert to seconds: <code>(t/1000)</code></li> \n <li>Divide the total seconds by 60 and grab the remainder. You don’t want all of the seconds, just those remaining after the minutes have been counted: <code>(t/1000) % 60</code></li> \n <li>Round this down to the nearest whole number. This is because you want complete seconds, not fractions of seconds: <code>Math.floor( (t/1000) % 60 )</code></li> \n</ol> \n<p>Repeat this logic to convert the milliseconds to minutes, hours, and days.</p> \n<h3 id=\"outputtheclockdataasareusableobject\">Output the Clock Data as a Reusable Object</h3> \n<p>With the days, hours, minutes, and seconds prepared, we’re now ready to return the data as a reusable object:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">return {\n  total,\n  days,\n  hours,\n  minutes,\n  seconds\n};\n</code></pre> \n<p>This object allows you to call your function and get any of the calculated values. Here’s an example of how you’d get the remaining minutes:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">getTimeRemaining(deadline).minutes\n</code></pre> \n<p>Convenient, right?</p> \n<h3 id=\"displaytheclockandstopitwhenitreacheszero\">Display the Clock and Stop It When It Reaches Zero</h3> \n<p>Now that we have a function that spits out the days, hours, minutes, and seconds remaining, we can build our clock. First we’ll create the following HTML element to hold our clock:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"markup language-markup\">&lt;div id=\"clockdiv\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre> \n<p>Then we’ll write a function that outputs the clock data inside our new div:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">function initializeClock(id, endtime) {\n  const clock = document.getElementById(id);\n  const timeinterval = setInterval(() =&gt; {\n    const t = getTimeRemaining(endtime);\n    clock.innerHTML = 'days: ' + t.days + '&lt;br&gt;' +\n                      'hours: '+ t.hours + '&lt;br&gt;' +\n                      'minutes: ' + t.minutes + '&lt;br&gt;' +\n                      'seconds: ' + t.seconds;\n    if (t.total &lt;= 0) {\n      clearInterval(timeinterval);\n    }\n  },1000);\n}\n</code></pre> \n<p>This function takes two parameters. These are the id of the element that contains our clock, and the countdown’s end time. Inside the function, we’ll declare a <code>clock</code> variable and use it to store a reference to our clock container div. This means we don’t have to keep querying the DOM.</p> \n<p>Next, we’ll use <code>setInterval</code> to execute an anonymous function every second. This function will do the following:</p> \n<p> Continue reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/build-javascript-countdown-timer-no-dependencies/?utm_source=rss\">Build a Countdown Timer in Just 18 Lines of JavaScript</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=3cLR3rZXmIw:QCfcY_RDyIY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=3cLR3rZXmIw:QCfcY_RDyIY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=3cLR3rZXmIw:QCfcY_RDyIY:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=3cLR3rZXmIw:QCfcY_RDyIY:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/3cLR3rZXmIw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Sun, 31 May 2020 22:10:07 +0000","feedId":6128,"bgimg":"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/1591024583m0021-12.jpg","linkMd5":"00133b9c6b170f49190d459fee16da49","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn29@2020_3/2020/08/24/22-51-26-677_74558cef1d0b84fd.webp","destWidth":1800,"destHeight":1109,"sourceBytes":33406,"destBytes":33406,"author":"Yaphi Berhanu","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/1591024583m0021-12.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn29@2020_3/2020/08/24/22-51-26-677_74558cef1d0b84fd.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn15@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-39-311_6409ebad5acff93a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn3@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-47-113_bf83e999bebef320.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=3cLR3rZXmIw:QCfcY_RDyIY:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn30@2020_4/2020/08/24/22-51-43-719_02db2dcd44d3ba26.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/3cLR3rZXmIw":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn96@2020_3/2020/08/24/22-51-39-019_daa2e4279c49dd4f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598309483269},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","title":"How to Use Deno&#8217;s Built-in Tools","link":"https://editor.sitepoint.com/?p=177668","description":"<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/deno-built-in-tools/?utm_source=rss\" title=\"How to Use Deno’s Built-in Tools\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1598232667deno-dev-tools.png\" alt=\"How to Use Deno’s Built-in Tools\" srcset=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1598232667deno-dev-tools-300x170.png 300w, https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1598232667deno-dev-tools.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /> </a> \n<p><strong>One surprising difference between Deno and Node.js is the number of tools built into the runtime.

This is an unstable feature which requires the <code>--unstable</code> flag, but no files will be altered when it’s used.</p> \n<p>Linting is useful to spot less obvious syntax errors and ensure code adheres with your team’s standards. You may already be using a linter such as <a href=\"https://eslint.org/\">ESLint</a> in your editor or from the command line, but Deno provides another option in any environment where it’s installed.</p> \n<p>To recursively lint all <code>.js</code> and <code>.ts</code> files in the current and child directories, enter <code>deno lint --unstable</code>:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">$ deno lint --unstable\n\n(no-extra-semi) Unnecessary semicolon.\n};\n ^\n    at /home/deno/testing/lib.js:13:1\n\nFound 1 problem\n</code></pre> \n<p>Alternatively, you can specify one or more files to limit linting. For example:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">$ deno lint --unstable ./index.js\n$\n</code></pre> \n<p>For further information, see the <a href=\"https://deno.land/manual/tools/linter\">Deno Manual: Linter</a>. It includes a list of rules you can add to code comments to ignore or enforce specific syntaxes.</p> \n<h2 id=\"testrunner\">Test Runner</h2> \n<p>Deno has a built-in test runner for unit-testing JavaScript or TypeScript functions.</p> \n<p>Tests are defined in any file named <code>&lt;something&gt;test</code> with a <code>.js</code>, <code>.mjs</code>, <code>.ts</code>, <code>.jsx</code>, or <code>.tsx</code> extension. It must make one or more calls to <a href=\"https://doc.deno.land/builtin/stable#Deno.test\"><code>Deno.test</code></a> and pass a test name string and a testing function. The function can be synchronous or asynchronous and use a variety of <a href=\"https://deno.land/std/testing\">assertion utilities</a> to evaluate results.</p> \n<p>Create a new <code>test</code> subdirectory with a file named <code>lib.test.js</code>:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">// test lib.js library\n\n// assertions\nimport { assertEquals } from 'https://deno.land/std/testing/asserts.ts';\n\n// lib.js modules\nimport { hello, sum } from '../lib.js';\n\n// hello function\nDeno.test('lib/hello tests', () =&gt; {\n\n  assertEquals( hello('Someone'), 'Hello Someone!');\n  assertEquals( hello(), 'Hello Anonymous!' );\n\n});\n\n// sum integers\nDeno.test('lib/sum integer tests', () =&gt; {\n\n  assertEquals( sum(1, 2, 3), 6 );\n  assertEquals( sum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), 21 );\n\n});\n\n// sum strings\nDeno.test('lib/sum string tests', () =&gt; {\n\n  assertEquals( sum('a', 'b', 'c'), 'abc' );\n  assertEquals( sum('A', 'b', 'C'), 'AbC' );\n\n});\n\n// sum mixed values\nDeno.test('lib/sum mixed tests', () =&gt; {\n\n  assertEquals( sum('a', 1, 2), 'a12' );\n  assertEquals( sum(1, 2, 'a'), '3a' );\n  assertEquals( sum('an', null, [], 'ed'), 'annulled' );\n\n});\n</code></pre> \n<p>To run all tests from all directories, enter <code>deno test</code>. Or run tests stored in a specific directory with <code>deno test &lt;dir&gt;</code>. For example:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">$ deno test ./test\n\nrunning 4 tests\ntest lib/hello tests ... ok (4ms)\ntest lib/sum integer tests ... ok (2ms)\ntest lib/sum string tests ... ok (2ms)\ntest lib/sum mixed tests ... ok (2ms)\n\ntest result: ok. 4 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out (11ms)\n\n$\n</code></pre> \n<p>A <code>--filter</code> string or regular expression can also be specified to limit tests by name. For example:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">$ deno test --filter \"hello\" ./test\n\nrunning 1 tests\ntest lib/hello tests ... ok (4ms)\n\ntest result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 3 filtered out (5ms)\n</code></pre> \n<p>Longer-running tests can be stopped on the first failure by passing a <code>--failfast</code> option.</p> \n<p>For further information, see the <a href=\"https://deno.land/manual/testing\">Deno Manual: Testing</a>. A few third-party test modules are also available, including <a href=\"https://github.com/crewdevio/merlin\">Merlin</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/drashland/rhum\">Ruhm</a>, but these still use <code>Deno.test</code> beneath the surface.</p> \n<p> Continue reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/deno-built-in-tools/?utm_source=rss\">How to Use Deno’s Built-in Tools</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=UEB_pjHCMQE:SRnrKvjdjxs:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=UEB_pjHCMQE:SRnrKvjdjxs:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=UEB_pjHCMQE:SRnrKvjdjxs:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=UEB_pjHCMQE:SRnrKvjdjxs:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/UEB_pjHCMQE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Sun, 23 Aug 2020 21:25:00 +0000","feedId":6128,"bgimg":"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1598232667deno-dev-tools.png","linkMd5":"672c921374fe6651c4823f711e7c09b7","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn97@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-24-770_4de55998201b323a.webp","destWidth":600,"destHeight":340,"sourceBytes":60951,"destBytes":13034,"author":"Craig Buckler","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1598232667deno-dev-tools.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn97@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-24-770_4de55998201b323a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn15@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-39-311_6409ebad5acff93a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn3@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-47-113_bf83e999bebef320.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=UEB_pjHCMQE:SRnrKvjdjxs:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn34@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-51-45-928_e885ebb62dfe64a7.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/UEB_pjHCMQE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn49@2020_3/2020/08/24/22-51-44-348_b422db8207648329.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598309483243},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","title":"Local Authentication Using Passport in Node.js","link":"http://www.sitepoint.com/?p=78440","description":"<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/local-authentication-using-passport-node-js/?utm_source=rss\" title=\"Local Authentication Using Passport in Node.js\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/1585544614local-auth.png\" alt=\"Local Authentication Using Passport in Node.js\" srcset=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/1585544614local-auth-300x170.png 300w, https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/1585544614local-auth.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /> </a> \n<p><strong>A common requirement when building a web app is to implement a login system, so that users can authenticate themselves before gaining access to protected views or resources. Luckily for those building Node apps, there’s a middleware called <a href=\"http://www.passportjs.org/\">Passport</a> that can be dropped into any <a style=\"font-weight:bold\" href=\"https://expressjs.com/\">Express</a>-based web application to provide authentication mechanisms in only a few commands.</strong></p> \n<p>In this tutorial, I’ll demonstrate how to use Passport to implement local authentication (that is, logging in with a username and password) with a MongoDB back end. If you’re looking to implement authentication via the likes of Facebook or GitHub, please refer to <a style=\"font-weight:bold\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/passport-authentication-for-nodejs-applications/\">this tutorial</a>.</p> \n<p>As ever, all of the code for this article is available for download on <a href=\"https://github.com/sitepoint-editors/LocalPassportAuth\">GitHub</a>.</p> \n<h2 id=\"prerequisites\">Prerequisites</h2> \n<p>To follow along with this tutorial, you’ll need to have Node and MongoDB installed on your machine.</p> \n<p>You can install <strong>Node</strong> by heading to <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/download/\">the official Node download page</a> and grabbing the correct binaries for your system. Alternatively, you can use a version manager — a program that allows you to install multiple versions of Node and switch between them at will. If you fancy going this route, please consult our quick tip, “<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/quick-tip-multiple-versions-node-nvm/\">Install Multiple Versions of Node.js Using nvm</a>”.</p> \n<p><strong>MongoDB</strong> comes in various editions. The one we’re interested in is the MongoDB Community Edition.</p> \n<p>The project’s home page has excellent documentation and I won’t try to replicate that here. Rather, I’ll offer you links to instructions for each of the main operating systems:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/\">Install MongoDB Community Edition on Windows</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/\">Install MongoDB Community Edition on macOS</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/\">Install MongoDB Community Edition on Ubuntu</a></li> \n</ul> \n<p>If you use a non-Ubuntu–based version of Linux, you can check out <a href=\"https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/#mongodb-community-edition-installation-tutorials\">this page</a> for installation instructions for other distros. MongoDB is also normally available through the official Linux software channels, but sometimes this will pull in an outdated version.</p> \n<p><em>Note: You don’t need to enter your name and address to download MongoDB. If prompted, you can normally dismiss the dialog.</em></p> \n<p>If you’d like a quick refresher on using MongoDB, check out our beginner’s guide, “<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-mongodb/\">An Introduction to MongoDB</a>”.</p> \n<h2 id=\"authenticationstrategiessessionvsjwt\">Authentication Strategies: Session vs JWT</h2> \n<p>Before we begin, let’s talk briefly about authentication choices.</p> \n<p>Many of the tutorials online today will opt for token-based authentication using <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/using-json-web-tokens-node-js/\">JSON Web Tokens</a> (JWTs). This approach is probably the simplest and most popular one nowadays. It relegates part of the authentication responsibility to the client and makes them sign a token that’s sent with every request, to keep the user authenticated.</p> \n<p>Session-based authentication has been around longer. This method relegates the weight of the authentication to the server. It uses cookies and sees the Node application and database work together to keep track of a user’s authentication state.</p> \n<p>In this tutorial, we’ll be using session-based authentication, which is at the heart of the <a href=\"http://www.passportjs.org/packages/passport-local/\">passport-local strategy</a>.</p> \n<p>Both methods have their advantages and drawbacks. If you’d like to read more into the difference between the two, <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/q/43452896\">this Stack Overflow thread</a> might be a good place to start.</p> \n<h2 id=\"creatingtheproject\">Creating the Project</h2> \n<p>Once all of the prerequisite software is set up, we can get started.</p> \n<p>We’ll begin by creating the folder for our app and then accessing that folder on the terminal:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">mkdir AuthApp\ncd AuthApp\n</code></pre> \n<p>To create the node app, we’ll use the following command:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npm init\n</code></pre> \n<p>You’ll be prompted to provide some information for Node’s <code>package.json</code>. Just keep hitting <kbd>Return</kbd> to accept the default configuration (or use the <code>-y</code> flag).</p> \n<h2 id=\"settingupexpress\">Setting up Express</h2> \n<p>Now we need to install <a href=\"http://expressjs.com/\">Express</a>. Go to the terminal and enter this command:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npm install express\n</code></pre> \n<p>We’ll also need to install the <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser\">body-parser</a> middleware which is used to parse the request body that Passport uses to authenticate the user. And we’ll need to install the <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session\">express-session </a> middleware.</p> \n<p>Let’s do that. Run the following command:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npm install body-parser express-session\n</code></pre> \n<p>When that’s done, create an <code>index.js</code> file in the root folder of your app and add the following content to it:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">/*  EXPRESS SETUP  */\n\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\n\napp.use(express.static(__dirname));\n\nconst bodyParser = require('body-parser');\nconst expressSession = require('express-session')({\n  secret: 'secret',\n  resave: false,\n  saveUninitialized: false\n});\n\napp.use(bodyParser.json());\napp.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));\napp.use(expressSession);\n\nconst port = process.env.PORT || 3000;\napp.listen(port, () =&gt; console.log('App listening on port ' + port));\n</code></pre> \n<p>First, we <code>require</code> Express and create our Express app by calling <a href=\"http://expressjs.com/en/api.html#express\">express()</a>. Then we define the directory from which to serve our static files.</p> \n<p>The next line sees us <code>require</code> the body-parser middleware, which will help us parse the body of our requests. We’re also adding the express-session middleware to help us save the session cookie.</p> \n<p>As you can, see we’re configuring express-session with a <code>secret</code> to sign the session ID cookie (you should choose a unique value here), and two other fields, <a href=\"https://github.com/expressjs/session#resave\">resave</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/expressjs/session#saveuninitialized\">saveUninitialized</a>. The <code>resave</code> field forces the session to be saved back to the session store, and the <code>saveUninitialized</code> field forces a session that is “uninitialized” to be saved to the store. To learn more about them, check out their documentation, but for now it’s enough to know that for our case we want to keep them <code>false</code>.</p> \n<p>Then, we use <code>process.env.PORT</code> to set the port to the environment port variable if it exists. Otherwise, we’ll default to <code>3000</code>, which is the port we’ll be using locally. This gives you enough flexibility to switch from development, directly to a production environment where the port might be set by a service provider like, for instance, <a href=\"https://www.heroku.com/\">Heroku</a>. Right below that, we called <a href=\"http://expressjs.com/en/api.html#app.listen\">app.listen()</a> with the port variable we set up and a simple log to let us know that it’s all working fine and on which port is the app listening.</p> \n<p>That’s all for the Express setup. Now it’s on to setting up <code>Passport</code>.</p> \n<h2 id=\"settinguppassport\">Setting up Passport</h2> \n<p>First, we install Passport with the following command:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npm install passport\n</code></pre> \n<p>Then we need to add the following lines to the bottom of the <code>index.js</code> file:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">/*  PASSPORT SETUP  */\n\nconst passport = require('passport');\n\napp.use(passport.initialize());\napp.use(passport.session());\n</code></pre> \n<p>Here, we require <code>passport</code> and initialize it along with its session authentication middleware, directly inside our Express app.</p> \n<h2 id=\"creatingamongodbdatastore\">Creating a MongoDB Data Store</h2> \n<p>Since we’re assuming you’ve already installed Mongo, you should be able to start the Mongo shell using the following command:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">mongo\n</code></pre> \n<p>Within the shell, issue the following command:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">use MyDatabase;\n</code></pre> \n<p>This simply creates a datastore named <code>MyDatabase</code>.</p> \n<p>Leave the terminal there; we’ll come back to it later.</p> \n<h2 id=\"connectingmongotonodewithmongoose\">Connecting Mongo to Node with Mongoose</h2> \n<p>Now that we have a database with records in it, we need a way to communicate with it from our application. We’ll be using <a href=\"http://mongoosejs.com/\">Mongoose</a> to achieve this. Why don’t we just use plain Mongo? Well, as the Mongoose devs like to say on their website:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>writing MongoDB validation, casting and business logic boilerplate is a drag.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Mongoose will simply make our lives easier and our code more elegant.</p> \n<p>Let’s go ahead and install it with the following command:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npm install mongoose\n</code></pre> \n<p>We’ll also be using<a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/passport-local-mongoose\"> passport-local-mongoose</a>, which will simplify the integration between Mongoose and Passport for local authentication. It will add a <code>hash</code> and <code>salt</code> field to our Schema in order to store the hashed password and the salt value. This is great, as <a href=\"https://security.stackexchange.com/a/120541\">passwords should never be stored as plain text in a database</a>.</p> \n<p>Let’s install the package:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npm install passport-local-mongoose\n</code></pre> \n<p>Now we have to configure Mongoose. Hopefully you know the drill by now: add the following code to the bottom of your <code>index.js</code> file:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">/* MONGOOSE SETUP */\n\nconst mongoose = require('mongoose');\nconst passportLocalMongoose = require('passport-local-mongoose');\n\nmongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/MyDatabase',\n  { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true });\n\nconst Schema = mongoose.Schema;\nconst UserDetail = new Schema({\n  username: String,\n  password: String\n});\n\nUserDetail.plugin(passportLocalMongoose);\nconst UserDetails = mongoose.model('userInfo', UserDetail, 'userInfo');\n</code></pre> \n<p>Here we require the previously installed packages. Then we connect to our database using <code>mongoose.connect</code> and give it the path to our database. Next, we’re making use of a <a href=\"http://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html\">Schema</a> to define our data structure. In this case, we’re creating a <code>UserDetail</code> schema with <code>username</code> and <code>password</code> fields.</p> \n<p>Finally, we add <code>passportLocalMongoose</code> as a plugin to our Schema. This will work part of the magic we talked about earlier. Then, we create a <a href=\"http://mongoosejs.com/docs/models.html\">model</a> from that schema. The first parameter is the name of the collection in the database. The second one is the reference to our Schema, and the third one is the name we’re assigning to the collection inside Mongoose.</p> \n<p>That’s all for the Mongoose setup. We can now move on to implementing our Passport strategy.</p> \n<h2 id=\"implementinglocalauthentication\">Implementing Local Authentication</h2> \n<p>And finally, this is what we came here to do! Let’s set up the local authentication. As you’ll see below, we’ll just write the code that will set it up for us:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">/* PASSPORT LOCAL AUTHENTICATION */\n\npassport.use(UserDetails.createStrategy());\n\npassport.serializeUser(UserDetails.serializeUser());\npassport.deserializeUser(UserDetails.deserializeUser());\n</code></pre> \n<p>There’s quite some magic going on here. First, we make <code>passport</code> use the local strategy by calling <code>createStrategy()</code> on our <code>UserDetails</code> model — courtesy of <code>passport-local-mongoose</code> — which takes care of everything so that we don’t have to set up the strategy. Pretty handy.</p> \n<p>Then we’re using <code>serializeUser</code> and <code>deserializeUser</code> callbacks. The first one will be invoked on authentication, and its job is to serialize the user instance with the information we pass on to it and store it in the session via a cookie. The second one will be invoked every subsequent request to deserialize the instance, providing it the unique cookie identifier as a “credential”. You can read more about that in the <a href=\"http://www.passportjs.org/docs/configure/#sessions\">Passport documentation</a>.</p> \n<h2 id=\"routes\">Routes</h2> \n<p>Now let’s add some routes to tie everything together. First, we’ll add a final package. Go to the terminal and run the following command:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npm install connect-ensure-login\n</code></pre> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/connect-ensure-login\">connect-ensure-login</a> package is middleware that ensures a user is logged in. If a request is received that is unauthenticated, the request will be redirected to a login page. We’ll use this to guard our routes.</p> \n<p>Now, add the following to the bottom of <code>index.js</code>:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">/* ROUTES */\n\nconst connectEnsureLogin = require('connect-ensure-login');\n\napp.post('/login', (req, res, next) =&gt; {\n  passport.authenticate('local',\n  (err, user, info) =&gt; {\n    if (err) {\n      return next(err);\n    }\n\n    if (!user) {\n      return res.redirect('/login?info=' + info);\n    }\n\n    req.logIn(user, function(err) {\n      if (err) {\n        return next(err);\n      }\n\n      return res.redirect('/');\n    });\n\n  })(req, res, next);\n});\n\napp.get('/login',\n  (req, res) =&gt; res.sendFile('html/login.html',\n  { root: __dirname })\n);\n\napp.get('/',\n  connectEnsureLogin.ensureLoggedIn(),\n  (req, res) =&gt; res.sendFile('html/index.html', {root: __dirname})\n);\n\napp.get('/private',\n  connectEnsureLogin.ensureLoggedIn(),\n  (req, res) =&gt; res.sendFile('html/private.html', {root: __dirname})\n);\n\napp.get('/user',\n  connectEnsureLogin.ensureLoggedIn(),\n  (req, res) =&gt; res.send({user: req.user})\n);\n</code></pre> \n<p>At the top, we’re requiring <code>connect-ensure-login</code>. We’ll come back to this later.</p> \n<p>Next, we set up a route to handle a POST request to the <code>/login</code> path. Inside the handler, we use the <a href=\"http://www.passportjs.org/docs/authenticate/\">passport.authenticate</a> method, which attempts to authenticate with the strategy it receives as its first parameter — in this case <code>local</code>. If authentication fails, it will redirect us to <code>/login</code>, but it will add a query parameter — <code>info</code> — that will contain an error message. Otherwise, if authentication is successful, it will redirect us to the <code>'/'</code> route.</p> \n<p>Then we set up the <code>/login</code> route, which will send the login page. For this, we’re using <a href=\"http://expressjs.com/en/api.html#res.sendFile\">res.sendFile()</a> and passing in the file path and our root directory, which is the one we’re working on — hence the <code>__dirname</code>.</p> \n<p>The <code>/login</code> route will be accessible to anyone, but our next ones won’t. In the <code>/</code> and <code>/private</code> routes we’ll send their respective HTML pages, and you’ll notice something different here. Before the callback, we’re adding the <code>connectEnsureLogin.ensureLoggedIn()</code> call. This is our route guard. Its job is validating the session to make sure you’re allowed to look at that route. Do you see now what I meant earlier by “letting the server do the heavy lifting”? We’re authenticating the user every single time.</p> \n<p>Finally, we’ll need a <code>/user</code> route, which will return an object with our user information. This is just to show you how you can go about getting information from the server. We’ll request this route from the client and display the result.</p> \n<p>Talking about the client, let’s do that now.</p> \n<p> Continue reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/local-authentication-using-passport-node-js/?utm_source=rss\">Local Authentication Using Passport in Node.js</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=Z8-wbd_Js6k:yQv4e6Wzv38:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=Z8-wbd_Js6k:yQv4e6Wzv38:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=Z8-wbd_Js6k:yQv4e6Wzv38:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=Z8-wbd_Js6k:yQv4e6Wzv38:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/Z8-wbd_Js6k\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 07 Apr 2020 16:00:45 +0000","feedId":6128,"bgimg":"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/1585544614local-auth.png","linkMd5":"cf0130dd4d8157ce616d10816dbd05db","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn13@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-29-287_2eeb93fe376553c6.webp","destWidth":600,"destHeight":340,"sourceBytes":16012,"destBytes":16012,"author":"Paul Orac","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/1585544614local-auth.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn13@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-29-287_2eeb93fe376553c6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn15@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-39-311_6409ebad5acff93a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn3@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-47-113_bf83e999bebef320.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=Z8-wbd_Js6k:yQv4e6Wzv38:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn28@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-46-919_40621cf5ee8b3540.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/Z8-wbd_Js6k":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn60@2020_4/2020/08/24/22-51-38-070_6cb2955b3722010c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598309483279},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","title":"CSS Viewport Units: A Quick Start","link":"https://www.sitepoint.com/?p=151506","description":"<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/css-viewport-units-quick-start/?utm_source=rss\" title=\"CSS Viewport Units: A Quick Start\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/1490784120Viewport_Units.png\" alt=\"CSS Viewport Units\" srcset=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/1490784120Viewport_Units-300x167.png 300w, https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/1490784120Viewport_Units-768x427.png 768w, https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/1490784120Viewport_Units.png 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /> </a> \n<p><strong>It’s been a few years since viewport units were first introduced in CSS. They’re truly “responsive length units” in the sense that their value changes every time the browser resizes. If you’ve heard about these units before but never learned about them in detail, this article can help you out.</strong></p> \n<h2 id=\"theunitsandtheirmeaning\">The Units and Their Meaning</h2> \n<p>There are four viewport-based units in CSS. These are <code>vh</code>, <code>vw</code>, <code>vmin</code> and <code>vmax</code>.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Viewport Height</strong> (vh). This unit is based on the height of the viewport. A value of <code>1vh</code> is equal to 1% of the viewport height.</li> \n <li><strong>Viewport Width</strong> (vw). This unit is based on the width of the viewport. A value of <code>1vw</code> is equal to 1% of the viewport width.</li> \n <li><strong>Viewport Minimum</strong> (vmin). This unit is based on the <strong>smaller dimension of the viewport</strong>. If the <em>viewport height is smaller</em> than the width, the value of <code>1vmin</code> will be equal to 1% of the viewport height. Similarly, if the <em>viewport width is smaller</em> than the height, the value of <code>1vmin</code> will be equal to 1% of the viewport width.</li> \n <li><strong>Viewport Maximum</strong> (vmax). This unit is based on the <strong>larger dimension of the viewport</strong>. If the <em>viewport height is larger</em> than the width, the value of <code>1vmax</code> will be equal to 1% of viewport height. Similarly, if the <em>viewport width is larger</em> than the height, the value of <code>1vmax</code> will be equal to 1% of hte viewport width.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Let’s see what the value of these units will be in different situations:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>If the viewport is 1200px wide and 1000px high, the value of <code>10vw</code> will be 120px and the value of <code>10vh</code> will be 100px. Since the width of the viewport is greater than its height, the value of <code>10vmax</code> will be 120px and the value of <code>10vmin</code> will be 100px.</li> \n <li>If the device is now rotated so that the viewport becomes 1000px wide and 1200px high, the value of <code>10vh</code> will be 120px and the value of <code>10vw</code> will be 100px. Interestingly, the value of <code>10vmax</code> will still be 120px because it will now be determined based on the height of the viewport. Similarly, the value of <code>10vmin</code> will still be 100px.</li> \n <li>If you resize the browser window so that the viewport becomes 1000px wide and 800px high, the value of <code>10vh</code> will become 80px and the value of <code>10vw</code> will become 100px. Similarly, the value of <code>10vmax</code> will become 100px and the value of <code>10vmin</code> will become 80px.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>At this point, viewport units may sound similar to percentages. However, they’re very different. In the case of percentages, the width or height of the child element is determined with respect to its parent. Here’s an example:</p> \n<div style=\"margin-bottom:1em;\"> \n <p data-height=\"885\" data-theme-id=\"6441\" data-slug-hash=\"xqadex\" data-default-tab=\"result\" data-user=\"SitePoint\" data-embed-version=\"2\" data-pen-title=\"Viewport Units and Percentage\" class=\"codepen\">See the Pen <a href=\"http://codepen.io/SitePoint/pen/xqadex/\">Viewport Units and Percentage</a> by SitePoint (<a href=\"http://codepen.io/SitePoint\">@SitePoint</a>) on <a href=\"http://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</p> \n <p><script async=\"\" src=\"https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script></p> \n</div> \n<p>As you can see, the width of the first child element is set to be equal to 80% of its parent’s width. However, the second child element has a width of 80vw, which makes it wider than its parent.</p> \n<p> Continue reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/css-viewport-units-quick-start/?utm_source=rss\">CSS Viewport Units: A Quick Start</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=HDXuMOfIjjU:Kye8I2RwHrE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=HDXuMOfIjjU:Kye8I2RwHrE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=HDXuMOfIjjU:Kye8I2RwHrE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=HDXuMOfIjjU:Kye8I2RwHrE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/HDXuMOfIjjU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 08 Jun 2020 16:00:10 +0000","feedId":6128,"bgimg":"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/1490784120Viewport_Units.png","linkMd5":"3f7e502dd184ddb0c8b83a12c1a12208","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn49@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-51-24-661_50df401814882fa6.webp","destWidth":900,"destHeight":500,"sourceBytes":22186,"destBytes":22186,"author":"Asha Laxmi","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/1490784120Viewport_Units.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn49@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-51-24-661_50df401814882fa6.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn15@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-39-311_6409ebad5acff93a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn3@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-47-113_bf83e999bebef320.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=HDXuMOfIjjU:Kye8I2RwHrE:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn75@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-46-979_902502630d8404eb.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/HDXuMOfIjjU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn43@2020_6/2020/08/24/22-51-46-665_ccbb966366b730d1.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598309483268},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","title":"How to Create an Ecommerce Site with React","link":"https://editor.sitepoint.com/?p=176295","description":"<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/how-to-create-an-ecommerce-site-with-react/?utm_source=rss\" title=\"How to Create an Ecommerce Site with React\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1591621031ecommerce-app.png\" alt=\"How to Create an Ecommerce Site with React\" srcset=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1591621031ecommerce-app-300x169.png 300w, https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1591621031ecommerce-app.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /> </a> \n<p><strong>Since most of the performance optimizations for ecommerce web applications are front-end related, the prominent, front-end centric framework React — often preferred for its simplicity and elegance — will be used in this tutorial.</strong></p> \n<p>In creating a basic ecommerce site, we’ll also make use of React Context as an alternative to state management frameworks such as Redux and MobX.</p> \n<p>Also, a basic method for handling authentication and cart management will be shown in this application. Below is a screenshot of what we’ll be building:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15916199571-our-products-1024x503.gif\" alt=\"The finished app\" width=\"1024\" height=\"503\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-176297\" /></p> \n<p>This tutorial assumes you have a basic knowledge of JavaScript and JSX.</p> \n<h2 id=\"prerequisites\">Prerequisites</h2> \n<p>In the course of building this application, we’ll be using React Context to manage our application data, because it “provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level”, as outlines in <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html\">the docs</a>.</p> \n<p>To build the application, you’ll also need a computer with the required applications for starting and running a React application — <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/\">Node &gt;= 8.10 and npm &gt;= 5.6</a> on your machine.</p> \n<p>Create a React project like so:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npx create-react-app e-commerce\n</code></pre> \n<p>In this application, we also use React Router to handle the routing. To install this module, run this:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npm install react-router-dom\n</code></pre> \n<p>Finally, we’ll use the Bulma open-source CSS framework to style this application. To install this, run the following command:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npm install bulma\n</code></pre> \n<h2 id=\"gettingstarted\">Getting Started</h2> \n<p>First, we need to add the stylesheet to our application. To achieve that, we’ll add an import statement to include this file in the <code>index.js</code> file in the <code>src</code> folder of the application. This will apply the stylesheet across all the components in the application. Below is a snippet of the import statement:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">// ./index.js\n...\nimport \"bulma/css/bulma.css\";\n...\n</code></pre> \n<p>In this application, we define a dataset for the application, since we aren’t working with a back-end API. The dataset contains the application’s users and the initial products list:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">// ./Data.js\nexport default {\n  users: [\n    { username: \"regular\", accessLevel: 1, password: \"password\" },\n    { username: \"admin\", accessLevel: 0, password: \"password\" }\n  ],\n  initProducts: [\n    {\n      name: \"shoes\",\n      stock: 10,\n      price: 399.99,\n      shortDesc: \"Nulla facilisi. Curabitur at lacus ac velit ornare lobortis.\",\n      description:\n        \"Cras sagittis. Praesent nec nisl a purus blandit viverra. Ut leo. Donec quam          elis, ultricies nec, pellentesque eu, pretium quis, sem. Fusce a quam.\"\n    },\n    ...moreProducts\n  ]\n};\n</code></pre> \n<h2 id=\"contextsetup\">Context Setup</h2> \n<p>In complex applications where the need for Context is usually necessary, there can be multiple contexts, with each having its data and methods relating to the set of components that requires the data and methods. For example, there can be a <code>ProductContext</code> for handling the components which use products related data, and another <code>ProfileContext</code> for handling data relating to authentication and user data. However, for the sake of keeping things as simple as possible, we’ll use just one context instance.</p> \n<p>In order to create the context, we create a file <code>Context.js</code> in the root of our application:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">// ./Context.js\n\nimport React from \"react\";\nconst Context = React.createContext({});\nexport default Context;\n</code></pre> \n<p>This creates the Context and initializes the context data to an empty object. Next, we need to create a component wrapper, which we’ll use to wrap components that use the Context data and methods:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">    // ./withContext.js\n\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport Context from \"./Context\";\nconst withContext = WrappedComponent =&gt; {\n  const WithHOC = props =&gt; {\n    return (\n      &lt;Context.Consumer&gt;\n        {context =&gt; &lt;WrappedComponent {...props} context={context} /&gt;}\n      &lt;/Context.Consumer&gt;\n    );\n  };\n  WithHOC.WrappedComponent = WrappedComponent;\n  return WithHOC;\n};\nexport default withContext;\n</code></pre> \n<p>The code above exports a function <code>withContext</code>, which uses the Consumer Component property of the previously created Context. The Consumer component transmits data associated with the Context to its child component.</p> \n<h2 id=\"appdevelopment\">App Development</h2> \n<p>Next, we need to set up up the <code>App.js</code> file. Here, we’ll be handling the application’s navigation as well as defining its data and methods to manage them.</p> \n<p>First, let’s set up up the application navigation:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">//./src/App.js\n\nimport React, { Component } from \"react\";\nimport { Switch, Route, Link, BrowserRouter as Router } from \"react-router-dom\";\nimport data from \"./Data\";\nimport Context from \"./Context\";\nexport default class App extends Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {};\n    this.routerRef = React.createRef();\n  }\n  ...\n  ...\n  ...\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      &lt;Context.Provider\n        value={{\n          ...this.state,\n          removeFromCart: this.removeFromCart,\n          addToCart: this.addToCart,\n          login: this.login,\n          addProduct: this.addProduct,\n          clearCart: this.clearCart,\n          checkout: this.checkout\n        }}\n      &gt;\n        &lt;Router ref={this.routerRef}&gt;\n          &lt;div className=\"App\"&gt;\n            &lt;nav\n              className=\"navbar container\"\n              role=\"navigation\"\n              aria-label=\"main navigation\"\n            &gt;\n              &lt;div className=\"navbar-brand\"&gt;\n                &lt;b className=\"navbar-item is-size-4 \"&gt;ecommerce&lt;/b&gt;\n                &lt;a\n                  role=\"button\"\n                  class=\"navbar-burger burger\"\n                  aria-label=\"menu\"\n                  aria-expanded=\"false\"\n                  data-target=\"navbarBasicExample\"\n                  onClick={e =&gt; {\n                    e.preventDefault();\n                    this.setState({ showMenu: !this.state.showMenu });\n                  }}\n                &gt;\n                  &lt;span aria-hidden=\"true\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n                  &lt;span aria-hidden=\"true\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n                  &lt;span aria-hidden=\"true\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n                &lt;/a&gt;\n              &lt;/div&gt;\n              &lt;div className={`navbar-menu ${\n                  this.state.showMenu ? \"is-active\" : \"\"\n                }`}&gt;\n                &lt;Link to=\"/products\" className=\"navbar-item\"&gt;\n                  Products\n                &lt;/Link&gt;\n                {this.state.user &amp;&amp; this.state.user.accessLevel &lt; 1 &amp;&amp; (\n                  &lt;Link to=\"/add-product\" className=\"navbar-item\"&gt;\n                    Add Product\n                  &lt;/Link&gt;\n                )}\n                &lt;Link to=\"/cart\" className=\"navbar-item\"&gt;\n                  Cart\n                  &lt;span\n                    className=\"tag is-primary\"\n                    style={{ marginLeft: \"5px\" }}\n                  &gt;\n                    {Object.keys(this.state.cart).length}\n                  &lt;/span&gt;\n                &lt;/Link&gt;\n                {!this.state.user ? (\n                  &lt;Link to=\"/login\" className=\"navbar-item\"&gt;\n                    Login\n                  &lt;/Link&gt;\n                ) : (\n                  &lt;a className=\"navbar-item\" onClick={this.logout}&gt;\n                    Logout\n                  &lt;/a&gt;\n                )}\n              &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;/nav&gt;\n            &lt;Switch&gt;\n              &lt;Route exact path=\"/\" component={Component} /&gt;\n              &lt;Route exact path=\"/login\" component={Component} /&gt;\n              &lt;Route exact path=\"/cart\" component={Component} /&gt;\n              &lt;Route exact path=\"/add-product\" component={Component} /&gt;\n              &lt;Route exact path=\"/products\" component={Component} /&gt;\n            &lt;/Switch&gt;\n          &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/Router&gt;\n      &lt;/Context.Provider&gt;\n    );\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> \n<p>Our <code>App</code> component will be responsible for initializing the application data and will also define methods to manipulate these data. Here, we define the context data and methods using the context Provider component. The data and methods are passed as a property, <code>value</code>, on the Provider component to replace the object given on the context creation. (Note that the value can be of any data type.) We pass the state value and some methods, which we’ll define soon.</p> \n<p>Next, we build our application navigation. To achieve this, we need to wrap our app with a Router component, which can either be <code>BrowserRouter</code> (like in our case) or <code>HashRouter</code>. Next, we define our application’s routes using the Switch and Route component. We also create the app’s navigation menu, with each link using the Link component provided in the React Router module. We also add a reference, <code>routerRef</code>, to the Router component to enable us to access the router from the <code>App</code> component.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15916200132-app-component-1024x45.gif\" alt=\"App component\" width=\"1024\" height=\"45\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-176298\" /></p> \n<h2 id=\"userauthentication\">User Authentication</h2> \n<p>In the next step, we’ll handle the user authentication. First we need to initialize the user in the <code>App</code> component constructor. This is shown below:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">//./src/App.js\n...  \n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      user: null\n    };\n  }\n...\n</code></pre> \n<p>Next, we make sure the user is loaded when the application starts up by setting the user on component mount, as shown below:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">//.src/App/.js\n...\ncomponentDidMount() {\n    let user = localStorage.getItem(\"user\");\n    user = user ? JSON.parse(user) : null;\n    this.setState({ user });\n  }\n...\n</code></pre> \n<p>Here, we load the last user session from the local storage to the state if it exists. Next, we define the login and logout methods attached to the Context:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">//./src/App.js\n...\n  login = (usn, pwd) =&gt; {\n    let user = data.users.find(u =&gt; u.username === usn &amp;&amp; u.password === pwd);\n    if (user) {\n      this.setState({ user });\n      localStorage.setItem(\"user\", JSON.stringify(user));\n      return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n  };\n  logout = e =&gt; {\n    e.preventDefault();\n    this.setState({ user: null });\n    localStorage.removeItem(\"user\");\n  };\n...\n</code></pre> \n<p>The login method checks if the user and password combination match any user in the array and sets the state user if found. It also adds the user to local storage for persistency. The logout clears the user from both state and local storage. </p> \n<p>Next, we create the login component. First, we create a <code>components</code> folder where we’ll put all our components, then create a <code>Login.js</code> file. This component makes use of the context data. For it to have access to these data and methods, it has to be wrapped using the <code>withContext</code> method we created earlier.</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">// ./src/components/Login.js\n\nimport React, { Component, Fragment } from \"react\";\nimport withContext from \"../withContext\";\nimport { Redirect } from \"react-router-dom\";\nclass Login extends Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      username: \"\",\n      password: \"\"\n    };\n  }\n  handleChange = e =&gt;\n    this.setState({ [e.target.name]: e.target.value, error: \"\" });\n\n  login = () =&gt; {\n    const { username, password } = this.state;\n    if (!username || !password) {\n      return this.setState({ error: \"Fill all fields!\" });\n    }\n    let loggedIn = this.props.context.login(username, password);\n    if (!loggedIn) {\n      this.setState({ error: \"Invalid Credentails\" });\n    }\n  };\n  render() {\n    return !this.props.context.user ? (\n      &lt;Fragment&gt;\n        &lt;div className=\"hero is-primary \"&gt;\n          &lt;div className=\"hero-body container\"&gt;\n            &lt;h4 className=\"title\"&gt;Login&lt;/h4&gt;\n          &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;br /&gt;\n        &lt;br /&gt;\n        &lt;div className=\"columns is-mobile is-centered\"&gt;\n          &lt;div className=\"column is-one-third\"&gt;\n            &lt;div className=\"field\"&gt;\n              &lt;label className=\"label\"&gt;User Name: &lt;/label&gt;\n              &lt;input\n                className=\"input\"\n                type=\"text\"\n                name=\"username\"\n                onChange={this.handleChange}\n              /&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;div className=\"field\"&gt;\n              &lt;label className=\"label\"&gt;Password: &lt;/label&gt;\n              &lt;input\n                className=\"input\"\n                type=\"password\"\n                name=\"password\"\n                onChange={this.handleChange}\n              /&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            {this.state.error &amp;&amp; (\n              &lt;div className=\"has-text-danger\"&gt;{this.state.error}&lt;/div&gt;\n            )}\n            &lt;div className=\"field is-clearfix\"&gt;\n              &lt;button\n                className=\"button is-primary is-outlined is-pulled-right\"\n                onClick={this.login}\n              &gt;\n                Submit\n              &lt;/button&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n          &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n      &lt;/Fragment&gt;\n    ) : (\n      &lt;Redirect to=\"/products\" /&gt;\n    );\n  }\n}\nexport default withContext(Login);\n</code></pre> \n<p>This component renders a form with two inputs to collect the user login credentials. On submit of the input the component calls the login method, which is passed through the context. This Module also makes sure to redirect to the products page if the user is already logged in. We need to update the <code>App.js</code> component to use the Login component:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">// ./src/App.js\n...\nimport Login from \"./components/Login\";\n...\n...\n    &lt;Route exact path=\"/login\" component={Login} /&gt;\n...\n</code></pre> \n<p><img src=\"https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15916200543-login-1024x503.gif\" alt=\"Login\" width=\"1024\" height=\"503\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-176299\" /></p> \n<p> Continue reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/how-to-create-an-ecommerce-site-with-react/?utm_source=rss\">How to Create an Ecommerce Site with React</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=H3P9xWxgdeo:jWHNMTG1hhw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=H3P9xWxgdeo:jWHNMTG1hhw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=H3P9xWxgdeo:jWHNMTG1hhw:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=H3P9xWxgdeo:jWHNMTG1hhw:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/H3P9xWxgdeo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 10 Jun 2020 16:01:23 +0000","feedId":6128,"bgimg":"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1591621031ecommerce-app.png","linkMd5":"c683fc211657abe788e66a0a350ff5a7","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn82@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-51-26-260_c792a6b7a0b56552.webp","destWidth":600,"destHeight":337,"sourceBytes":10554,"destBytes":10554,"author":"Deven Rathore","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1591621031ecommerce-app.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn82@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-51-26-260_c792a6b7a0b56552.webp","https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15916199571-our-products-1024x503.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn0@2020_1/404.jpg","https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15916200132-app-component-1024x45.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn0@2020_1/404.jpg","https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15916200543-login-1024x503.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn0@2020_1/404.jpg","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn15@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-39-311_6409ebad5acff93a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn3@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-47-113_bf83e999bebef320.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=H3P9xWxgdeo:jWHNMTG1hhw:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn62@2020_4/2020/08/24/22-51-43-800_00697c373c1aaf8e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/H3P9xWxgdeo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn26@2020_4/2020/08/24/22-51-43-342_0e4757c32045fba9.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598309483268},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","title":"Why We Moved a 20-Year-Old Site to Gatsby","link":"https://editor.sitepoint.com/?p=176571","description":"<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/our-gatsby-redesign/?utm_source=rss\" title=\"Why We Moved a 20-Year-Old Site to Gatsby\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1594114523gatsby-redesign.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1594114523gatsby-redesign-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1594114523gatsby-redesign-768x576.jpg 768w, https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1594114523gatsby-redesign-1024x768.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /> </a> \n<p>We knew we had a problem.</p> \n<p>In 2019, SitePoint was getting Lighthouse Speed scores under 10 on mobile, and between 20 and 30 on desktop.</p> \n<p>Our efforts to control UX bloat were failing in the wake of a publishing business environment that sprang new leaks just as we’d finished temporarily plugging the last one. Our reliance on advertising, controlled by external parties, was a major obstacle to improved site performance. Our traffic growth had turned into decline.</p> \n<p>On a site that provided people with a place to come and learn to code with best practices, this was not a good look. And it wasn’t a site we could feel proud of, either.</p> \n<p>To make matters worse, operational bottlenecks had arisen that made adaptation a tricky logistical business. Our team was struggling to make changes to the site: having focused on our Premium experience for several years, we were down to one developer with WordPress and PHP experience. To test out code changes, the team would have to wait in a queue to access our staging server.</p> \n<p>It wasn’t energizing work for anyone, and it certainly wasn’t efficient.</p> \n<p>It was time to make some changes, and we set out to look for a solution. After a lot of research, we decided that <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/\">Gatsby</a> would be a great fit for our team. It would play to our talent strengths, help us solve all of the issues we had identified, and allow us to keep using WordPress for the backend so the editorial process wouldn’t need to change.</p> \n<h2 id=\"whywemovedtogatsby\">Why We Moved to Gatsby</h2> [caption id=\"attachment_176594\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1522\"]\n<img src=\"https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1594113779Visual_Studio_Code_A_Power_User_s_Guide_—_SitePoint.png\" alt=\"SitePoint 2020 Redesign\" width=\"1522\" height=\"914\" class=\"size-full wp-image-176594\" /> The end result.[/caption] \n<p>Early in the research process, Gatsby started to look like a serious frontrunner. SitePoint isn’t a small site, so we knew that the tech we chose had to be able to handle some pretty intense demands. Gatsby checked all of our boxes:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>We could code everything in <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/\">React</a>, a tech that every member of the front-end team knows and uses daily.</li> \n <li>Gatsby is super fast at its core — performance was at the heart of this project, and we could start from a good footing.</li> \n <li>The entire site is rendered as static, which would be great for SEO.</li> \n <li>We could build it as a new project, which meant no worrying about the existing codebase, which brought a huge amount of legacy code with it.</li> \n <li>We could use Gatsby Cloud, allowing the team to get feedback on the build at any time just by pushing the branch to GitHub.</li> \n <li>DDoS attacks on WordPress wouldn’t cause us issues, as the front-end is completely stand-alone.</li> \n</ul> \n<h2 id=\"moremaintainablecsswithstyledcomponents\">More Maintainable CSS with <code>styled-components</code></h2> \n<p>Since we were going to rebuild the site from scratch, we planned to make some design changes at the same time. To help with this work we decided to use <a href=\"https://styled-components.com/\">styled-components</a>.</p> \n<p>styled-components keeps the site’s styling easy to maintain, and we know where to look when we want to change the style of something — the style is always with the component.</p> \n<h2 id=\"howwemadethebuildhappen\">How We Made the Build Happen</h2> \n<p>We started by following Gatsby’s basic docs and pulling in our posts with the <code>gatsby-source-wordpress</code> plugin.</p> \n<p>This was a big initial test for us: we had to see if it was even <em>possible</em> to use Gatsby for our site.</p> \n<p>After 20 years of blogging, we have over 17,000 posts published. We knew the builds would take a long time, but we had to find out if Gatsby could deal with such a massive amount of content. As you’ve probably figured, the test delivered good news: Gatsby works.</p> \n<p>A quick tip for other teams working with large sites: to make development a better experience, we used environment vars to prevent Gatsby from fetching <em>all</em> of the site’s posts in development. There’s nothing quite like a 60 minute hot reload to slow progress.</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">if (hasNextPage &amp;&amp; process.env.NODE_ENV != \"development\") {\n  return fetchPosts({ first: 100, after: endCursor });\n}\n</code></pre> \n<p>From this point, we ran into some limitations with the WordPress source plugin. We couldn’t get all the data we needed, so we moved to the <a href=\"https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql\">WordPress GraphQL plugin</a>.</p> \n<p>We use Yoast to set our metadata for SEO, and had to ensure we were pulling in the correct information. We were able to do this with WordPress GraphQL. By doing it this way, the content team could still edit metadata the same way, and the data would still be dynamic and fetched on each build.</p> \n<p>During the build, we would have three or four people in the team working on parts of the new blog. In the past, if they wanted to get feedback they’d have to push to our staging server and make sure nobody was already using it.</p> \n<p>We found that Gatsby Cloud was a great solution to this issue. Now when someone pushes to a branch in GitHub, it creates a build in Gatsby Cloud along with a preview link. Our developers could share this link and get immediate testing and feedback much more effectively than before.</p> \n<p>This faster feedback cycle made it easy to have multiple people on the team working on the build and put an end to a major bottleneck.</p> \n<h2 id=\"launchdayfun\">Launch Day Fun</h2> \n<p>On the big day, we launched the new site and ran through our initial tests. The new blog was <em>flying</em> — every page load felt instant.</p> \n<p>We ran into some problems on SitePoint Premium, which started running into slows and even crashes. The culprit was a new element on blog pages that pulled in the popular books people were currently reading. It would do this via a client-side API call, and it was too much for Premium to handle due to the amount of traffic we get on the blog side.</p> \n<p>We quickly added some page caching to the API to temporarily solve the issues. We realized we were doing this wrong — we should have been sourcing this data at build time, so that the popular books are already loaded when we serve the page to the user.</p> \n<p>This is the main mindset shift you need to make when using Gatsby: any data that you can get at build time should be fetched at build time. You should only use client-side API calls when you need live data.</p> \n<p>Once we’d re-written the API call to happen during the build, the first load of a blog page was even quicker — and Premium stopped crashing.</p> \n<h2 id=\"whatwestillneedtosolve\">What We Still Need to Solve</h2> \n<p>While it’s hard to overstate how much better our on-site experience is today, there are still a few pain points we need to solve.</p> \n<p>If a new article is published, or if content is updated — as it is multiple times per day — we need to re-run the Gatsby build before these changes show up.</p> \n<p>Our solution for that right now is a simple cron job that runs at pre-scheduled times over the course of a day. The long-term solution to this is to add a webhook to the WordPress publish and update button, so that a new build is triggered once pressed.</p> \n<p>We also need to get incremental builds running. Right now, the entire site needs to be rebuilt each time, and given our content archive, this can take a while. Gatsby just introduced incremental builds as we went live, and we’re working on implementing this on our site. Once that’s set up our builds will be much faster if the only thing that has changed is content.</p> \n<p>Our speed score is still not where we want it to be. While the site feels subjectively very fast, we are still not getting consistent scores in Lighthouse. We want to get both mobile and desktop into the green zone (scores of 90+) for optimal user experience and SEO.</p> \n<h2 id=\"wouldwedoitagain\">Would We Do It Again?</h2> \n<p>A launch of this type would normally be a pretty nerve-wracking event, and take a lot of work from the team on launch day.</p> \n<p>With Gatsby, our launch was really easy. We just had to move WordPress onto a new domain, and point sitepoint.com at the Gatsby version of the site.</p> \n<p>Then we sat back and watched the numbers to see what happened to our traffic. Within a few days, the data was starting to come in and we were seeing a 15% increase in traffic. User engagement metrics were up across the board. And we hadn’t even removed our ads yet (which, you may have noticed, we’ve since done).</p> \n<p>It’s not hard to figure out why the effects were so immediate. We had better SEO running on static HTML and CSS pages, and massive speed improvements made possible by the move to Gatsby.</p> \n<p>Since we made the move, we’ve increased our Lighthouse speed scores from 6-15 on mobile to the 50-60 range, and from the 30s on desktop into the 70s. We wanted to ensure speed remained top of mind with this change, so we’re using a great tool called <a href=\"https://calibreapp.com/\">Calibre</a> that runs speed tests over a number of top pages each day and alerts us to the scores. We are using this tool to continue to improve our score, so I hope to have another article for you in three months when we get everything to stay in the 90+ range.</p> \n<p>The team loves working in Gatsby. The blog codebase was something that nobody wanted to work on. Now, everyone wants to take those cards thanks to the great developer experience.</p> \n<p>If you’ve been eyeing a move to Gatsby and wondering if it’s ready for prime time, take our advice — it’s worth the switch.</p> \n<p> Continue reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/our-gatsby-redesign/?utm_source=rss\">Why We Moved a 20-Year-Old Site to Gatsby</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=j_AQq753JIs:OJFqwyYrAr8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=j_AQq753JIs:OJFqwyYrAr8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=j_AQq753JIs:OJFqwyYrAr8:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=j_AQq753JIs:OJFqwyYrAr8:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/j_AQq753JIs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 06 Jul 2020 22:00:51 +0000","feedId":6128,"bgimg":"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1594114523gatsby-redesign.jpg","linkMd5":"1f73e2fd1d81e7687b67bfe98b22474a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn82@2020_6/2020/08/24/22-51-27-174_f575e47057458eb9.webp","destWidth":1880,"destHeight":1410,"sourceBytes":26590,"destBytes":26590,"author":"Stuart Mitchell","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1594114523gatsby-redesign.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn82@2020_6/2020/08/24/22-51-27-174_f575e47057458eb9.webp","https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1594113779Visual_Studio_Code_A_Power_User_s_Guide_—_SitePoint.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn64@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-51-42-860_9c5cbcbce096bfd2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn15@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-39-311_6409ebad5acff93a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn3@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-47-113_bf83e999bebef320.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=j_AQq753JIs:OJFqwyYrAr8:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn13@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-38-528_a13e340578a3f901.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/j_AQq753JIs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn6@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-35-191_64b512f995074034.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598309483258},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","title":"Simple Strategies for Winning the Positions Other Developers Want","link":"https://editor.sitepoint.com/?p=176175","description":"<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/getting-jobs-other-web-developers-want/?utm_source=rss\" title=\"Simple Strategies for Winning the Positions Other Developers Want\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1589506890developer-job.png\" alt=\"Simple strategies for getting positions other developers want\" srcset=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1589506890developer-job-300x170.png 300w, https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1589506890developer-job.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /> </a> \n<p><strong>How do they do it?</strong></p> \n<p><strong>“How is [insert developer name] able to attract the promotions and job offers they’re getting?

Seriously, what gives?</p> \n<h2 id=\"whymostdevelopersoptimizeforthewronggoal\">Why most developers optimize for the wrong goal</h2> \n<p>It’s a common mistake made by many employees in general. Here’s a quote from Reddit user <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Myidiotbox/\">Myidiotbox</a> that encapsulates both the attitude of many employees and the response they receive in return.</p> \n<p><a class=\"embedly-card\" href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/WalgreensStores/comments/dvbygj/an_interesting_title/f7brws0\">Card</a></p> \n<p><script async=\"\" src=\"//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js\" charset=\"UTF-8\"></script></p> \n<p>This is the unspoken attitude lurking beneath for many people.</p> \n<p>“I’m working really hard so I deserve X. I did my job well so I want Y.”</p> \n<p>Here’s the problem with this attitude.</p> \n<p>It takes you further away from the goals you want (such as being treated well, making more money, achieving significance, and so on). This perception is the primary reason so many developers fail to achieve the career goals they aspire to.</p> \n<p>Here are the goals (if you can call them that) a healthy employer looks for.</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Can I count on this developer to deliver amazing work consistently?</li> \n <li>Is this developer loyal or will he betray me and jump ship as soon as he gets the chance?</li> \n <li>How easy is it to replace these developers?</li> \n <li>Could I replace them if they left?</li> \n <li>How long would it take and how much would it cost me?</li> \n <li>This developer is killing it, how do I help them produce more amazing work?</li> \n</ul> \n<p>See the problem?</p> \n<p>There’s a mismatch here. The vast majority of people are struggling with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect\">Dunning-Kruger effect</a> and are prone to <a href=\"https://www.apa.org/monitor/feb03/overestimate\">overestimate their competence</a>. They believe they’re doing a better job relative to their peers.</p> \n<p>But they’re not.</p> \n<p>Here’s why this is an issue. This mismatched thinking puts you at odds with your employer. This creates significant problems down the line, too, because it turns employees (you) in to mercenaries over time.</p> \n<p>If this sounds harsh, it’s not intended to be.</p> \n<p>Here are some simple strategies web developers can use to attract the positions other developers want with minimal effort.</p> \n<h3 id=\"strategy1becomeapatriotstayapatriot\">Strategy #1: Become a patriot, stay a patriot</h3> \n<p>In 2013, Gallup worked with then Nationwide CEO Steve Rasmussen to improve employee engagement. In the course of their relationship, Rasmussen shared a surprising observation.</p> \n<p>Employees are either <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/157676/employees-either-patriots-mercenaries.aspx\"><strong>patriots</strong> or <em>mercenaries</em></a>.</p> \n<p>Not because they want to be but because they have to be.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>Patriots totally identify with their company, and mercenaries are more likely to focus on personal outcomes.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><strong>Patriot</strong> employees are engaged. They have ownership, they believe in their firm and their firm believes in them. Instead of looking out for themselves, they’re focused on looking out for their firm.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, <strong>mercenaries</strong> are focused on themselves. They tend to rely on serial job-hopping, power hoarding, and social climbing to get what they want. Mercenaries are focused on getting as much value as they can for themselves; they don’t care much about their company.</p> \n<p>It’s no surprise then that they’re <em>disengaged</em>.</p> \n<p>If the interests of the firm happen to align with their own interests, they’ll do what’s best for the firm. But they’re not really focused on putting their firm ahead of themselves.</p> \n<p>Most of the time they <em>can’t</em>.</p> \n<p>Why? Because their employer is a mercenary: these employers are focused on squeezing as much value as they can out of their employees. Then, they’re tossed aside once they’re burned out and used up.</p> \n<p>You’ll want to stay a patriot.</p> \n<p>This means you continue to buy in to your company’s vision. You continue to believe in your employer or co-workers and you look out for them. The instant you can’t do that, you start looking for another job. Here’s why it’s important to remain a patriot.</p> \n<p><em><a href=\"https://youtu.be/h1Yg8QSEvWw?t=4233\">Intention has a smell</a>.</em></p> \n<p>The exceptional opportunities, benefits, and rewards go overwhelmingly to people who like, trust, and believe in you.

None of the following are unique to Zsh, but they’re good to know nonetheless. I encourage you to start using the command line to perform operations such as those listed below. It might seem like more work than using a GUI at first, but once you get the hang of things, you’ll never look back.</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Entering <code>cd</code> from anywhere on the file system will bring you straight back to your home directory.</li> \n <li>Entering <code>!!</code> will bring up the last command. This is handy if a command fails because it needs admin rights. In this case you can type <code>sudo !!</code>.</li> \n <li>You can use <code>&amp;&amp;</code> to chain multiple commands. For example, <code>mkdir project &amp;&amp; cd project &amp;&amp; npm init -y</code>.</li> \n <li>Conditional execution is possible using <code>||</code>. For example, <code>git commit -m \"whatever...\" || echo \"Commit failed\"</code>.</li> \n <li>Using a <code>-p</code> switch with the <code>mkdir</code> command will allow you to create parent directories as needed. Using brace expansion reduces repetition. For example, <code>mkdir -p articles/jim/sitepoint/article{1,2,3}</code>.</li> \n <li>Set <a href=\"https://opensource.com/article/19/8/what-are-environment-variables\">environment variables</a> on a per-command basis like so: <code>NODE_DEBUG=myapp node index.js</code>. Or, on a per-session basis like so: <code>export NODE_DEBUG=myapp</code>. You can check it was set by typing <code>echo $&lt;variable-name&gt;</code>.</li> \n <li>Pipe the output of one command into a second command. For example, <code>cat /var/log/kern.log | less</code> to make a long log readable, or <code>history | grep ssh</code> to search for any history entries containing “ssh”.</li> \n <li>You can open files in your editor from the terminal. For example, <code>nano ~/.zshrc</code> (nano), <code>subl ~/.zshrc</code> (Sublime Text), <code>code ~/.zshrc</code> (VS Code). If the file doesn’t exist, it will be created when you press <em>Save</em> in the editor.</li> \n <li>Navigation is an important skill to master. Don’t just rely on your arrow keys. For example, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>a</kbd> will take you to the beginning of a line.</li> \n <li>Whereas <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>e</kbd> will take you to the end.</li> \n <li>You can use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>w</kbd> to delete one word (backw­ards).</li> \n <li><kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>u</kbd> will remove everything from the cursor to the beginning of the line.</li> \n <li><kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>k</kbd> will clear everything from the cursor to the end of the line. These last three can be undone with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>y</kbd>.</li> \n <li>You can copy text with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd>. This is much more elegant than right clicking and selecting <em>Copy</em>.</li> \n <li>Conversely, you can paste copied text with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>v</kbd>.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Try to commit those key combos to memory. You’ll be surprised at how often they come in handy.</p> \n<h2 id=\"15customaliasestoboostyourproductivity\">15 Custom Aliases to Boost Your Productivity</h2> \n<p>Aliases are terminal shortcuts for regular commands. You can add them to your <code>~/.zshrc</code> file, then reload your terminal (using <code>source ~/.zshrc</code>) for them to take effect.</p> \n<p>The syntax for declaring a (simple) alias is as follows:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">alias [alias-name]='[command]'\n</code></pre> \n<p>Aliases are great for often-used commands, long commands, or commands with a hard-to-remember syntax. Here are some of the ones I use on a regular basis:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>A <code>myip</code> alias, which prints your current public IP address to the terminal: <code>alias myip='curl http://ipecho.net/plain; echo'</code>.</li> \n <li>A <code>distro</code> alias to output information about your Linux distribution: <code>alias distro='cat /etc/*-release'</code>.</li> \n <li>A <code>reload</code> alias, as I can never seem to remember how to reload my terminal: <code>alias reload='source ~/.zshrc'</code>.</li> \n <li>An <code>undo-git-reset</code> alias: <code>alias undo-git-reset-head=\"git reset 'HEAD@{1}'\"</code>. This reverts the effects of running <code>git reset HEAD~</code>.</li> \n <li>An alias to update package lists: <code>alias sapu='sudo apt-get update'</code>.</li> \n <li>An alias to rerun the previous command with <code>sudo</code>: <code>alias ffs='sudo !!'</code>.</li> \n <li>Because I’m lazy, I have aliased <code>y</code> to the <code>yarn</code> command: <code>alias y='yarn'</code>. This means I can clone a repo, then just type <kbd>y</kbd> to pull in all the dependencies. I learned this one from Scott Tolinski on <a href=\"https://syntax.fm/\">Syntax</a>.</li> \n <li>Not one of the ones I use, but this alias blows away the <code>node_modules</code> folder and removes the <code>package-lock.json</code> file, before reinstalling a project’s dependencies: <code>alias yolo='rm -rf node_modules/ &amp;&amp; rm package-lock.json &amp;&amp; yarn install'</code>.

I agree — <em>it’s tougher</em>. A mastery of CSS requires skills in design, determination, inventiveness, experience, as well as coding (especially when using preprocessors such as <a href=\"https://sass-lang.com/\">Sass</a>).</strong></p> \n<p>CSS <em>suggests</em> layouts and styles to the browser. A browser can interpret those suggestions whichever way it chooses and, even then, the user or device can ignore or override any properties. Creating high-performance code which works well across all devices and screen resolutions is a challenge that few attempt or successfully complete. However, the rewards can be exhilarating.</p> \n<p>Starting with the easiest, the following project suggestions will help you on your journey to CSS mastery using books available at <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/\">SitePoint Premium</a>.</p> \n<h2 id=\"1makeasiteprinterfriendly\">1. Make a Site Printer-friendly</h2> \n<p>Visit a site you’re working on and attempt to print (or print preview) a page. Are you happy with the results?</p> \n<p>HTML pages are a continuous medium which do not necessarily work well on printed media. Inappropriate sections, scaling, text sizes, column dimensions, and missing or cropped content all lead to an inaccessible printing experience that few developers consider.</p> \n<p>Fortunately, print CSS can be developed within a few hours. It’s generally a matter of resetting styles (black on white), removing unnecessary sections (menus, hero images, forms, social media widgets, etc.), linearizing the layout, and reducing the paper and ink requirements.</p> \n<p>Delve into <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/css-master-2nd-edition/read/2/jyqxmd9k\">Browser-based Developer Tools</a> (from <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/css-master-2nd-edition/\">CSS Master</a>) and <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/browser-devtool-secrets/\">Browser DevTool Secrets</a> to discover how to examine and modify styles after switching to print rendering.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/css-master-2nd-edition/read/8/jyqxmeaa\">Applying CSS Conditionally</a> describes how to define <code>@media</code> query rules including <code>print</code> stylesheets.</p> \n<p>Consider your <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/smashing-book-6-new-frontiers-in-web-design/read/4/jynr4gos\">Strategy Guide to CSS Custom Properties</a> (from <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/smashing-book-6-new-frontiers-in-web-design/\">New Frontiers In Web Design</a>) to determine whether CSS variables could help with printing properties.

It’s quite simple to create your own QR code reader. Your website running on a smartphone equipped with a camera and running a little JavaScript can do the same trick.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://ilrm9.csb.app/\">Here’s a demo</a> of a QR code scanner that works not only on Mobile but also in most modern devices. All you need is a camera and a QR code to scan.</p> \n<p>If you don’t have a QR code handy, here’s one that shows the first eight digits of Pi.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/1499242522Pi-encoded-as-QR.gif\" alt=\"Test the QR Code Reader: QR code encoding the value of Pi\" title=\"The digits of Pi encoded in a QR\" /></p> \n<h2 id=\"creatingtheqrcodereader\">Creating the QR Code Reader</h2> \n<p>Our QR code reader will need some HTML and JavaScript but most importantly, a JavaScript library capable of interpreting the QR code.</p> \n<p>We’re not going to build that ourselves, because there are some great libraries out there doing this for us, so we don’t need to reinvent the wheel for our current purposes.</p> \n<p>Let’s begin by creating an <code>index.html</code> file.</p> \n<h3 id=\"addingthehtml\">Adding the HTML</h3> \n<p>We’ll need some very simple HTML for this project. Add the following to your body tag:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"markup language-markup\">&lt;div id=\"container\"&gt;\n    &lt;h1&gt;QR Code Scanner&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n    &lt;a id=\"btn-scan-qr\"&gt;\n        &lt;img src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/1499401426qr_icon.svg\"&gt;\n    &lt;a/&gt;\n\n    &lt;canvas hidden=\"\" id=\"qr-canvas\"&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;\n\n    &lt;div id=\"qr-result\" hidden=\"\"&gt;\n        &lt;b&gt;Data:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span id=\"outputData\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;script src=\"./src/qrCodeScanner.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre> \n<p>As you can see, we have a wrapper container with a title, the QR icon image wrapped in an <code>a</code> tag, a <code>canvas</code> and a <code>div</code> where we’ll show the result of the scan.</p> \n<p>Outside the container <code>div</code> we’re including the <code>qrCodeScanner.js</code> file. We’ll create it later, but first we’ll improve the look of our app.</p> \n<h3 id=\"addingstyles\">Adding Styles</h3> \n<p>Add the stylesheet to the head of our HTML:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"markup language-markup\">&lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"src/styles.css\" /&gt;\n</code></pre> \n<p>Now we want to create the <code>style.css</code> file within the <code>src</code> folder. We just want some basic styles for this sample app. Add the following to your css file:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"css language-css\">html {\n  height: 100%;\n}\n\nbody {\n  font-family: sans-serif;\n  padding: 0 10px;\n  height: 100%;\n  background: black;\n  margin: 0;\n}\n\nh1 {\n  color: white;\n  margin: 0;\n  padding: 15px;\n}\n\n#container {\n  text-align: center;\n  margin: 0;\n}\n\n#qr-canvas {\n  margin: auto;\n  width: calc(100% - 20px);\n  max-width: 400px;\n}\n\n#btn-scan-qr {\n  cursor: pointer;\n}\n\n#btn-scan-qr img {\n  height: 10em;\n  padding: 15px;\n  margin: 15px;\n  background: white;\n}\n\n#qr-result {\n  font-size: 1.2em;\n  margin: 20px auto;\n  padding: 20px;\n  max-width: 700px;\n  background-color: white;\n}\n</code></pre> \n<p>Nothing fancy at all. We’ll leave everything centered with a big QR button in the middle and the result underneath. We’re using black and white like the QR codes.</p> \n<h3 id=\"includingthedependentjavascriptlibraries\">Including the Dependent JavaScript Libraries</h3> \n<p>The secret to reading QR codes is math, and the substitute for math is open-source libraries. To read QR codes, we’ll be using the <a href=\"https://github.com/LazarSoft/jsqrcode\">JavaScript port</a> of the Java-based <a href=\"https://github.com/zxing/zxing\">image processing library</a> written by ZXing. The JavaScript version was ported by Lazar Laszlo.</p> \n<p>Because the JavaScript library consists of 17 files, we’ve taken the liberty of merging them into one file, wrapping the code in an anonymous function to prevent pollution of the global namespace and putting the file through Google Closure’s minifier to make the file size smaller.</p> \n<h3 id=\"someminortweakstothelibrary\">Some Minor Tweaks to the Library</h3> \n<p>In order to make the library more adaptable, we’ve added a few minor changes to the library’s output function to differentiate between a <em>success</em> response and an <em>error</em> response.</p> \n<p>Two important changes made were in <a href=\"https://github.com/sitepoint-editors/jsqrcode/blob/master/src/qrcode.js\">qrcode.js</a>, to these two lines:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">qrcode.result = \"error decoding QR Code\";\n//...\nqrcode.callback(\"Failed to load the image\");\n</code></pre> \n<p>These strings have been replaced by <code>Error</code> objects:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">qrcode.result = Error(\"error decoding QR Code\");\n//...\nqrcode.callback(Error(\"Failed to load the image\"));\n</code></pre> \n<p>Now I can detect in my callback function whether an error occurred, just by checking if the callback payload is an instance of <code>Error</code> or not.</p> \n<p>Those changes can be found in <a href=\"https://github.com/sitepoint-editors/jsqrcode/\">this fork</a> of the library.</p> \n<h3 id=\"addingthescripttag\">Adding the Script Tag</h3> \n<p>To use the library in our QR code reader, we first need to include it in our HTML using a regular script tag:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"markup language-markup\">&lt;script src=\"https://rawgit.com/sitepoint-editors/jsqrcode/master/src/qr_packed.js\"&gt;\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre> \n<h3 id=\"treatingitasanapp\">Treating It as an App</h3> \n<p>Something we’ll need to do is tell mobile browsers that we don’t want to scale this site in portrait mode. This can be achieved by adding the following meta tag within the <code>head</code> element:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"markup language-markup\">&lt;meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=0;\"/&gt;\n</code></pre> \n<p> Continue reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/create-qr-code-reader-mobile-website/?utm_source=rss\">How to Create a QR Code Reader for Your Mobile Website</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=5EHQxmPKy4U:aNk76Njbqgw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=5EHQxmPKy4U:aNk76Njbqgw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=5EHQxmPKy4U:aNk76Njbqgw:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=5EHQxmPKy4U:aNk76Njbqgw:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/5EHQxmPKy4U\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Sun, 14 Jun 2020 18:00:32 +0000","feedId":6128,"bgimg":"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/1591752091qr-code-reader.png","linkMd5":"8c916c29af8933686e8c47776d6b890b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn2@2020_4/2020/08/24/22-51-25-238_4c0983af10ff97fb.webp","destWidth":600,"destHeight":340,"sourceBytes":8280,"destBytes":8280,"author":"Dmitri Lau","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/1591752091qr-code-reader.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn2@2020_4/2020/08/24/22-51-25-238_4c0983af10ff97fb.webp","https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/1499229151barcode_apps.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn76@2020_3/2020/08/24/22-51-40-426_e9b8035570aaa763.webp","https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/1499242522Pi-encoded-as-QR.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn41@2020_6/2020/08/24/22-51-35-325_3b30ea2bd79ad942.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn15@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-39-311_6409ebad5acff93a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn3@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-47-113_bf83e999bebef320.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=5EHQxmPKy4U:aNk76Njbqgw:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn71@2020_6/2020/08/24/22-51-43-163_b2eba94ca40e668c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/5EHQxmPKy4U":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn76@2020_3/2020/08/24/22-51-36-023_bea398f745d7fd60.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598309483319},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","title":"Productive Remote Work (When Your Mental Health Says “No”)","link":"https://www.sitepoint.com/?p=175036","description":"<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/productive-remote-work-when-your-mental-health-says-no/?utm_source=rss\" title=\"Productive Remote Work (When Your Mental Health Says “No”)\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/1582026850remote-working.png\" alt=\"Productive Remote Working\" srcset=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/1582026850remote-working-300x170.png 300w, https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/1582026850remote-working.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /> </a> \n<p><strong>Remote work is <em>not</em> easy. It sounds like a dream (and it honestly is in a lot of ways), but there’s a darker side to remote work that one can’t understand until they’ve done it.</strong></p> \n<p>Here’s the deal. People that work remotely often suffer from suboptimal mental health, and so you’re probably wondering, why on earth do they do it? Well, the fact is, while remote working comes with some very unique challenges, so does <em>not</em> working remotely. The difference is that <em>remote</em> work can offer the flexibility you need to build a lifestyle that suits you.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/1582026150remote-work.jpg\" alt=\"people sitting at table with laptop\" /></p> \n<p>Indeed, remote work isn’t a silver bullet for burnout or wanderlust, but if you do happen to try it out and eventually wind up succumbing to loneliness, or a lack of motivation or productivity (as many remote workers do), at least you’ll have the opportunity to change things up and make things better.</p> \n<p>In the eyes of many, it’s the lesser of two evils.</p> \n<p>That being said, attempting to diagnose what your mind and body needs isn’t that easy. What might work one day might not work on another day, and what might work for one individual might not work for another individual. Humans are complex, and in the case of remote work, everyday productivity tricks often don’t cut it.</p> \n<p>Let’s take a look.</p> \n<h2 id=\"ifeellonely\">“I feel lonely”</h2> \n<p>Loneliness is a big issue (maybe the biggest?) for freelance remote workers and digital nomads in foreign countries, but it can also affect those that work in distributed teams (especially when some team members <em>aren’t</em> remote, as one can feel like an outsider at work using this setup). Let’s look at the solutions.</p> \n<h3 id=\"utilizecoworkingspaces\">Utilize co-working spaces</h3> \n<p>Co-working spaces aren’t for everyone. If you teach English, it’s obviously a no-no (not because of the noise, but because the noise would be distracting to <em>other</em> remote workers). If you’re only required to dive into the odd video call, though, many co-working spaces include a few hours of “booth time”.</p> \n<p>Throw in super-fast Wi-Fi, free coffee, daily events, and a likeminded crowd, joining a co-working space is like joining a community, and some co-working spaces (such as <a href=\"https://hubud.org/\">Hubud</a>) and <a href=\"https://www.dojobali.org/\">Dojo Bali</a>) are literally famous! <strong>Good vibes = a huge motivation boost</strong>.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/1582026194co-working.jpg\" alt=\"happy co-workers sitting with laptops on comfy chairs\" /></p> \n<h3 id=\"workfrombarsandcafs\">Work from bars and cafés</h3> \n<p>Cafés and bars work well too. The noise and seating options might be a tad unpredictable, and when going to a new place one has to find the Wi-Fi password, but all in all the experience is very much the same. It’s still fairly easy to meet other people, as it’s likely that you won’t be the only regular customer.</p> \n<p><em>Pro-tip: download <a href=\"https://www.wifimap.io/\">Wi-Fi Map app</a> to get the Wi-Fi passwords of networks near you!</em></p> \n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 1.5em;\"> \n <img style=\"margin-bottom: 0.5em;\" src=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/1582026235october-1024x768.jpg\" />\n <span style=\"display:block; font-size:0.8em; text-align:center; margin: 0;\">My favourite café — October Coffee Gaya, Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia)</span> \n</div> \n<p> Continue reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/productive-remote-work-when-your-mental-health-says-no/?utm_source=rss\">Productive Remote Work (When Your Mental Health Says “No”)</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=83vgrFijiDc:xq4fEhd9h4U:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=83vgrFijiDc:xq4fEhd9h4U:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=83vgrFijiDc:xq4fEhd9h4U:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=83vgrFijiDc:xq4fEhd9h4U:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/83vgrFijiDc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 18 Feb 2020 23:00:46 +0000","feedId":6128,"bgimg":"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/1582026850remote-working.png","linkMd5":"223ae88f145d5f7a41a7b4a48a7a3ad5","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn82@2020_6/2020/08/24/22-51-25-244_e9904f7733b1b7ca.webp","destWidth":600,"destHeight":340,"sourceBytes":4652,"destBytes":4652,"author":"Daniel Schwarz","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/1582026850remote-working.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn82@2020_6/2020/08/24/22-51-25-244_e9904f7733b1b7ca.webp","https://www.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/1582026150remote-work.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn89@2020_6/2020/08/24/22-51-36-089_8f349e5affea6432.webp","https://www.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/1582026194co-working.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn99@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-41-573_4e22821bd51a08d1.webp","https://www.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/1582026235october-1024x768.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn66@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-42-296_70615eaff4819a2e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn15@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-39-311_6409ebad5acff93a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn3@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-47-113_bf83e999bebef320.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=83vgrFijiDc:xq4fEhd9h4U:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn85@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-37-620_bf9c3cd1918a516b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/83vgrFijiDc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn68@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-46-147_0c3c8e0c069efaa6.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598309483301},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","title":"4 Most High-Demand Skillsets for Remote Jobs","link":"https://www.sitepoint.com/?p=175791","description":"<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/remote-jobs-high-demand-skillsets/?utm_source=rss\" title=\"4 Most High-Demand Skillsets for Remote Jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1586227008remote-job.png\" alt=\"4 Most In-demand Skill Sets for Remote Jobs\" srcset=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1586227008remote-job-300x170.png 300w, https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1586227008remote-job.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /> </a> \n<p>Working remotely is on the rise, and will continue to do so long after COVID-19 runs its course. If you’re thinking about ditching the office but aren’t sure how, learning one (or more!) of the following skillsets will increase your chances of landing a remote job.</p> \n<h2 id=\"softwaredevelopment\">Software Development</h2> \n<p>Software development is the most in-demand remote job in the world. And with a median salary of $66,000/year, you can probably afford a decent home office setup in which to operate.</p> \n<p>Software development might be the job for you if you like solving problems, building things, and continuous learning. Even the best developers have to jump on GitHub or Stack Overflow from time to time to crowdsource a solution. In fact, development practically necessitates collaboration, making the development community extremely tight and incredibly helpful.</p> \n<p>So what skills does a remote software developer need in 2020? Well, a lot of them. Google “software development skills” and you’ll find list upon list of subjects like programming languages, algorithms, databases, and encryption. But good news (and, as you’ll find, a running theme in this article): you don’t have to learn everything.</p> \n<p>Instead, choose a software development concentration. For example, going from software development to Java development immediately cuts your required skill set in half. And you don’t have to stop there. Refining your concentration to mobile Java development, or even mobile game Java development, turns a near Herculean task into something much more reasonable.</p> \n<h2 id=\"digitalmarketing\">Digital Marketing</h2> \n<p>Digital marketing is another wildly in-demand skill set. Digital marketers are responsible for services like social media campaign planning, content coordination, SEO, and PPC ads. Remote digital marketing jobs average a median salary of $50,500/year, and nearly every industry is hiring.</p> \n<p> Continue reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/remote-jobs-high-demand-skillsets/?utm_source=rss\">4 Most High-Demand Skillsets for Remote Jobs</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=FEEuK1Jz_8Q:ZNyZtC5WRoI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=FEEuK1Jz_8Q:ZNyZtC5WRoI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=FEEuK1Jz_8Q:ZNyZtC5WRoI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=FEEuK1Jz_8Q:ZNyZtC5WRoI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/FEEuK1Jz_8Q\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 26 May 2020 21:51:32 +0000","feedId":6128,"bgimg":"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1586227008remote-job.png","linkMd5":"74a2f9391da25b0722b238ba0fd80dbb","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn86@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-25-204_a6bb76a9b86c68e9.webp","destWidth":600,"destHeight":339,"sourceBytes":11678,"destBytes":11678,"author":"Joshua Kraus","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1586227008remote-job.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn86@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-25-204_a6bb76a9b86c68e9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn15@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-39-311_6409ebad5acff93a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn3@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-47-113_bf83e999bebef320.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=FEEuK1Jz_8Q:ZNyZtC5WRoI:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn77@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-35-340_fa4c6b964968f3ad.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/FEEuK1Jz_8Q":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn95@2020_4/2020/08/24/22-51-38-454_0f940512b0dd3a34.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598309483269},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","title":"10 Ways to Hide Elements in CSS","link":"https://www.sitepoint.com/?p=130922","description":"<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/hide-elements-in-css/?utm_source=rss\" title=\"10 Ways to Hide Elements in CSS\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/1582635109hide-with-css.jpg\" alt=\"Ten Ways to Hide Elements in CSS\" srcset=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/1582635109hide-with-css-300x170.jpg 300w, https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/1582635109hide-with-css.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /> </a> \n<p><strong>There are multiple ways to hide an element in CSS, but they differ in the way they affect accessibility, layout, animation, performance, and event handling.</strong></p> \n<h2 id=\"animation\">Animation</h2> \n<p>Some CSS hiding options are all or nothing. The element is either fully visible or fully invisible and there’s no in-between state. Others, such as transparency, can have a range of values, so interpolated CSS animations become possible.</p> \n<h2 id=\"accessibility\">Accessibility</h2> \n<p>Each method described below will visually hide an element, but it may or may not hide the content from assistive technologies. For example, a screen reader could still announce tiny transparent text.

As a JavaScript runtime designed by the creator of Node, you might expect there to be be a lot of similarities between the two projects, and there are. However, there are also important differences, meaning you can’t just substitute one for the other.</strong></p> \n<p>This article will take a look at Deno in relation to its “older cousin” to help understand what they have in common, and what sets them apart. (If you want to get the skinny on Deno first, check out <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/deno-introduction/\">our recent introduction</a>.)</p> \n<h2 id=\"languagesupport\">Language Support</h2> \n<p>Both projects are JavaScript runtimes, allowing JavaScript code to be executed on a computer outside of a web browser. Let’s look at how they stack up in terms of language support.</p> \n<h3 id=\"nodejs\">Node.js</h3> \n<p>The current LTS release of Node (v12.18.1 as of writing) supports modern JavaScript syntax and features. It also supports about 75% of the ES2020 spec. ECMAScript modules are also supported, but are currently only classed as experimental: you need to use the <code>.mjs</code> file extension, or add the property <code>\"type\": \"module\"</code> to your project’s <code>package.json</code> file.</p> \n<p>In order to run TypeScript (or any other language) on Node, the code needs to be compiled to JavaScript that the V8 engine can execute. There are several different ways to do this, with different pros and cons, so getting up and running means having to choose one of these and follow the necessary setup process.</p> \n<h3 id=\"deno\">Deno</h3> \n<p>I was unable to find any mention of the JavaScript spec supported by Deno, but as it also uses V8 under the hood I would assume a similar level of support as in Node. My own tests show that Deno supports ES2020 features like <code>Promise.allSettled()</code> and the <code>globalThis</code> keyword. ECMAScript modules are the default, with CommonJS modules not supported unless you use the Node compatibility library (more about this later).</p> \n<p>TypeScript is supported as a first-class language in Deno, meaning that it works out-of-the-box: no installing additional tools to transpile to JavaScript first. Of course, the V8 engine doesn’t support TypeScript natively, so Deno is still transpiling the code under the hood, but this is all seamless and transparent to you as a developer.</p> \n<p>I also couldn’t find mention of which version of TypeScript Deno v1.0.1 uses, but it supports optional chaining and nullish coalescing (but not private class fields) which would peg it as TS 3.7.</p> \n<h2 id=\"apis\">APIs</h2> \n<p>Deno and Node both expose their own APIs to developers, allowing us to write programs that can actually do useful things like read and write files, and send and receive network requests.</p> \n<h3 id=\"nodejs-1\">Node.js</h3> \n<p>When Node was first released, there was no built-in support for Promises. As a result of this, most of the APIs for asynchronous operations were written to take an error-first callback:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">const fs = require('fs');\nfs.readFile('readme.txt', (err, data) =&gt; {\n  if (err) {\n    // Handle the error\n  }\n  // Otherwise handle the data\n});\n</code></pre> \n<p>Even though Node developers now have access to Promises and the async/await syntax, the APIs still expect callbacks in order to maintain backwards compatibility.</p> \n<h3 id=\"deno-1\">Deno</h3> \n<p>Deno’s API has been designed to take advantage of modern JavaScript features. All the asynchronous methods return Promises. Deno also supports top level await, meaning you can use await in your main script without having to wrap it in an async function.</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">try {\n  const data = await Deno.readFile('readme.txt');\n  // Handle the data\n} catch (e) {\n  // Handle the error\n}\n</code></pre> \n<p>The development team also made the decision to use web standards where possible, which means they’ve implemented browser APIs where it’s practical to do so. Deno provides a global <code>window</code> object, and APIs such as <code>addEventListener</code> and <code>fetch</code>. Having access to <code>fetch</code> is particularly nice, as with Node you’d have to polyfill this or use a third-party library.</p> \n<h3 id=\"thecompatibilitymodule\">The compatibility module</h3> \n<p>Deno provides a <a href=\"https://deno.land/std/node/\">compatibility layer</a> with the aim of allowing you to reuse existing Node packages. It’s not yet complete, but it does currently support loading CommonJS modules via <code>require()</code>, among other things.</p> \n<h2 id=\"packagemanagement\">Package Management</h2> \n<p>Package management is one area where Deno represents a radical departure from Node’s way of doing things. As it’s still early days for Deno, it remains to be seen if its approach will prove to be advantageous.</p> \n<h3 id=\"nodejs-2\">Node.js</h3> \n<p>As you might be aware, Node comes with its own package manager called npm, which is used to install and manage third-party packages. npm is mainly used with the online <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/\">npm registry</a>, where most of the available third-party packages are listed.</p> \n<p>When you use npm to install a package into your project, a <code>package.json</code> file is used to specify the package name and acceptable version range. The package itself (plus any packages <em>it</em> depends on) are then downloaded into a <code>node_modules</code> folder inside your project.</p> \n<h3 id=\"deno-2\">Deno</h3> \n<p>Deno does away with the need for a package manager altogether. Instead, packages are linked to directly via a URL:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">import { Response } from \"https://deno.land/std@0.53.0/http/server.ts\";\n</code></pre> \n<p>On the first run of your code, Deno fetches and compiles all the dependencies. They are then cached on the file system, separately from your project, so subsequent runs are much faster.</p> \n<p>Similar to npm’s <code>package-lock.json</code> file, Deno allows you to specify a lock file that will be used to ensure that only dependencies that match the exact version you originally imported will be used</p> \n<p> Continue reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/node-vs-deno/?utm_source=rss\">Node.js vs Deno: What You Need to Know</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=QLbPXyg3tCk:cNrfEH5S1uc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=QLbPXyg3tCk:cNrfEH5S1uc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=QLbPXyg3tCk:cNrfEH5S1uc:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=QLbPXyg3tCk:cNrfEH5S1uc:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/QLbPXyg3tCk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Sun, 12 Jul 2020 18:15:34 +0000","feedId":6128,"bgimg":"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1594638764deno-vs-node.png","linkMd5":"3045a56b36052462cbc72689a5c5c6fe","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn97@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-51-26-868_ff93b8775ff6d50b.webp","destWidth":1900,"destHeight":1000,"sourceBytes":56292,"destBytes":56292,"author":"Nilson Jacques","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1594638764deno-vs-node.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn97@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-51-26-868_ff93b8775ff6d50b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn15@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-39-311_6409ebad5acff93a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn3@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-47-113_bf83e999bebef320.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=QLbPXyg3tCk:cNrfEH5S1uc:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn22@2020_6/2020/08/24/22-51-36-263_3f82878f5137b23e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/QLbPXyg3tCk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn94@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-37-515_f219d182aae9a954.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598309483258},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","title":"6+ Best Websites for Free Fonts in 2020","link":"https://editor.sitepoint.com/?p=176109","description":"<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/free-fonts/?utm_source=rss\" title=\"6+ Best Websites for Free Fonts in 2020\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1588729672free-web-fonts.png\" alt=\"6+ Best Websites for Free Fonts in 2020\" srcset=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1588729672free-web-fonts-300x170.png 300w, https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1588729672free-web-fonts.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /> </a> \n<p><strong>I firmly believe that, in order to strike the optimal balance between minimalism and visual appeal, a user interface should display no more than what’s absolutely necessary while making those necessary elements look visually appealing.</strong></p> \n<p><em>Keep it simple, but make the simple look amazing.</em></p> \n<p>But, what does simple look like exactly?</p> \n<p>Well, strip away all of the over-the-top marketing gimmicks, redundant features, and cluttering visuals, and most of what’s left is the UI copy and text content. As boring as this sounds, let’s be honest: this is the most important aspect of any app or website. Information and the ability to navigate it is the entire reason users are using our app or website.</p> \n<p>So with the right typeface coupled with the right font styles (see “<a href=\"https://creativebloq.com/features/font-vs-typeface/\">Font vs typeface: the ultimate guide</a>”), we can create designs that are quite simple and yet visually appealing at the same time.

That being said, make sure that you bookmark awesome resources if you do happen to come across any. Even Instagram might surprise you, and Twitter shouldn’t be overlooked either.</p> \n<p>That aside, let’s take a look as the best free font websites.</p> \n<h2 id=\"1googlefontshttpsfontsgooglecom\">1. <a href=\"https://fonts.google.com/\">Google Fonts</a></h2> \n<p>Number one on this “best free fonts” list is obviously Google Fonts, which goes above and beyond what most free font websites offer. First of all, Google Fonts offers a fast and convenient CDN (content delivery network), making it super easy to embed webfonts into websites without having to actually host them.</p> \n<p>Google fonts can be subsetted by script and weight, and we can also control how they’re loaded on the Web by setting the <code>font-display</code> CSS property from the embed code’s query string, which improves website loading times. (The CSS-Tricks article on “<a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/google-fonts-and-font-display/\">Google Fonts and font-display</a>” explains how.)</p> \n<p>Mind you, self-hosting fonts is better for <em>privacy</em> (because it’s cookieless) and <em>speed</em> (because it offers developers more control). Either way, Google Fonts has a humungous repertoire.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1588727787google-fonts-1024x640.png\" alt=\"A screenshot of some Google fonts\" width=\"1024\" height=\"640\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-176111\" /></p> \n<h2 id=\"2creativemarkethttpscreativemarketcomfreegoods\">2. <a href=\"https://creativemarket.com/free-goods/\">Creative Market</a></h2> \n<p>I know what you’re thinking: “Creative Market isn’t free, Daniel!”</p> \n<p>Ahhh, but what about the <a href=\"https://creativemarket.com/free-goods/\">Free Goods</a> section?

Select any two objects on the canvas and Arrow Auto will enable you to draw a connector between them. You can also hide and show the flows on demand.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://figma.com/community/plugin/733902567457592893/Autoflow/\">Autoflow</a> is a decent (and maybe nicer looking) alternative, but Arrow Auto has more features, including the ability to switch connector directions and also move connected objects around while keeping connectors intact.</p> \n<h2 id=\"2anglehttpsangleshutilizedevicemockups\">2. <a href=\"https://angle.sh/\">Angle</a> (utilize device mockups)</h2> \n<p><img src=\"https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/15876194922.jpg\" alt=\"Angle\" width=\"1500\" height=\"708\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-176050\" /></p> \n<p>Angle allows you to display your screens (i.e. artboards) from within a number of realistic or matte-effect device frames that each come with a variety of angle options <em>and</em> shadow styles.</p> \n<p>Impressively, they’re 100% vector as well.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://figma.com/community/plugin/750673765607708804/Artboard-Studio-Mockups/\">Artboard Studio</a> isn’t quite the same thing, as it allows for inserting a whole bunch of random 3D objects onto the canvas (like a kiwi, for example). If you only care about device mockups, I’d install Angle. <a href=\"https://figma.com/c/plugin/769588393361258724/Vectary-3D/\">Vectory 3D</a> is similar to Artboard Studio, but it outputs actual 3D assets.</p> \n<h2 id=\"3masterhttpsfigmacomcplugin767721682134156281mastermanagecomponentsmoreeasily\">3. <a href=\"https://figma.com/c/plugin/767721682134156281/Master/\">Master</a> (manage components more easily)</h2> \n<p><img src=\"https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/15876189373.jpg\" alt=\"Master\" width=\"1909\" height=\"958\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-176036\" /></p> \n<p>Master offers a better way to manage components, such as the ability to turn multiple identical objects into a component, duplicate components into other Figma files, and much more.</p> \n<h2 id=\"4cleandocumenthttpsfigmacomcplugin767379019764649932cleandocumentautocleandocuments\">4. <a href=\"https://figma.com/c/plugin/767379019764649932/Clean-Document/\">Clean Document</a> (auto-clean documents)</h2> \n<p><img src=\"https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/15876189474.png\" alt=\"Clean Document\" width=\"1920\" height=\"960\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-176037\" /></p> \n<p>Clean Document, well … cleans your document!

It scans code for object-oriented programming techniques that hinder code reusability and flexibility.</strong></p> \n<h2 id=\"why\">Why?</h2> \n<p>Let me begin with two mundane observations:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>Business requirements change over time.</li> \n <li>Programmers are not clairvoyant.</li> \n</ol> \n<p>New product launches, emergency lockdown regulations, expanding into new markets, economic factors, updated data protection laws: there are lots of potential causes for business software to need updating.</p> \n<p>From those two observations we can infer that programmers know that the code they write is going to change, but not what those changes will be or when they will happen.</p> \n<p>Writing code in such a way that it can be easily adapted is a skill that takes years to master.</p> \n<p>You’re probably already familiar with programming practices that come back and haunt you. Novice programmers quickly realize that global variables are more trouble than they’re worth, and the once incredibly popular Singleton Pattern has been <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/whats-so-bad-about-the-singleton/\">a dirty word for the last decade</a>.</p> \n<p>How you code your application has a big impact on how easy it is to adapt to meet new requirements. As you progress through your career, you learn techniques that make adapting code easier. Once you’ve grasped fundamentals of object-oriented programming you wonder how you ever did without it!</p> \n<p>If you ask ten developers to produce software, given the same requirements, you’ll get ten different solutions. Some of those solutions will inevitably be better than others.</p> \n<p>Consider a ship in a bottle and a model ship made of Lego. Both are model ships, but changing the sails on the ship in a bottle is very difficult, and reusing the parts is near impossible. However, with a Lego ship, you can easily swap out the sails or use the same components to build a model rocket, house or a car.</p> \n<p>Certain programming techniques lead to the <em>ship-in-a-bottle</em> approach and make your code difficult to change and adapt.</p> \n<h2 id=\"insphpect\">Insphpect</h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://insphpect.com\">Insphpect</a> is a tool which scans your code for programming practices that lead to this kind of a ship in a bottle design.</p> \n<p>It grades your code based on how flexible it is, and highlights areas where flexibility can be improved.</p> \n<h3 id=\"whatdoesinsphpectlookfor\">What does Insphpect look for?</h3> \n<p>Currently, Insphpect looks for the following:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://insphpect.com/traits/tight-coupling\">tight coupling</a></li> \n <li>hardcoded configuration</li> \n <li>singletons</li> \n <li>setter injection</li> \n <li>using the <code>new</code> keyword in a constructor</li> \n <li>service locators</li> \n <li>inheritance</li> \n <li>static methods</li> \n <li>global state</li> \n <li>files that have more than one role (e.g. defining a class and running some code)</li> \n</ul> \n<p>If it detects anything it identifies as inflexible, it highlights the code, explains why it highlighted the issue, then grades your whole project and individual classes on a score of 0-100 (with 100 being no issues detected). As a proof of concept, for some detections it’s able to automatically generate a patch file that re-writes the code to remove the inflexibility entirely.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://insphpect.com/report/5e63a943a8da7\">Take a look a sample report here</a>.</p> \n<p>Insphpect is currently in the testing phase, and it would really help my research progress if you can check it out and complete the survey in the “Give your feedback” section of the site.</p> \n<h3 id=\"background\">Background</h3> \n<p>Are those bad practices really bad, though?</p> \n<p>This was one of the more difficult parts of the background research, and you can read about how this was done in detail on the <a href=\"https://insphpect.com/background\">Insphpect website</a>.</p> \n<p>However, this can be summarized as:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>The opinions of each bad practice were collected from 100 authors per practice.</li> \n <li>The author’s opinion on the practice was graded on a scale of 1–5.</li> \n <li>The author’s methodological rigor was graded on a scale of 1–7 based on the Jadad score used for clinical trials.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>These were then plotted like the graph below:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1593053893singleton-1024x612.png\" alt=\"Singleton pattern results\" width=\"1024\" height=\"612\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-176470\" /></p> \n<p>Each horizontal line represents an article, and the left (orange) bar for each article is the recommendation going from 5 — Avoid this practice at all costs (Far left) — to 1 — Favor this practice over alternatives.</p> \n<p>The right (blue) bar for each article is the Jadad style score measuring analytic rigor. A score of seven means the article describes the practice, provides code examples, discusses alternative approaches, provides like-for-like code samples, discusses the pros/cons of each approach and makes a recommendation of which approach should be used.</p> \n<p>In the case of the singleton above, authors who compare the singleton to alternative approaches, discuss the pros/cons, etc., are significantly more likely to suggest using alternative approaches.</p> \n<h2 id=\"walkthrough\">Walkthrough</h2> \n<p>Currently, Insphpect allows uploading code via a Git repository URL or a ZIP file.</p> \n<p>So not to point out flaws in other people’s work, let’s take a look at one of my own projects to see what it identifies.</p> \n<p>We’ll use <a href=\"https://github.com/Level-2/Transphporm\">https://github.com/Level-2/Transphporm</a> as an example project.</p> \n<p>This is quite a good example, because it has a very high score on another code-quality tool <a href=\"https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/Level-2/Transphporm/\">Scrutinizer</a>.</p> \n<p>Firstly, enter the git URL <code>https://github.com/Level-2/Transphporm</code> into the text box at the top of the home page and press “Go”. It will take a few seconds to minutes, depending on the size of the project, and will generate a report that looks something like this:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1593053927report1.png\" alt=\"Transphporm Report\" width=\"600\" height=\"533\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-176472\" /></p> \n<p>Once you’re on the report page, you’ll see a summary at the top with an overall grade out of 100, with 100 being very good and 0 being very poor.</p> \n<p>Underneath the summary, you’ll see a list of all the classes in the project, each with its own grade.</p> \n<p>Don’t worry if your code doesn’t get a perfect score. It’s unlikely that it will. Remember, Insphpect is a tool that identifies flexibility in your code. There are parts of your code (like the entry point) where flexibility isn’t warranted.</p> \n<p>For Transphporm, it has highlighted issues in seven classes.</p> \n<p>Let’s take a look at some of those. Scroll down to <code>Transphporm\\Parser\\CssToXpath</code> and click the link. You’ll see a score for that particular class and a list of issues which have been identified.</p> \n<p>In this case, it has identified a static variable and a static method. Clicking on one of the red lines will reveal an explanation of why the line was flagged up.</p> \n<p>For example, clicking line 12 will give an explanation of why static variables are less flexible than instance variables.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1593053956report2.png\" alt=\"Single class report\" width=\"800\" height=\"684\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-176473\" /></p> \n<p>Although there’s a more in-depth explanation of the issues caused by static properties on the <a href=\"https://insphpect.com/report/class/5e63a8f479b6d/Transphporm%5CParser%5CCssToXpath\">report</a>, as a quick refresher, static variables have one value which is shared across all the instances of the class.</p> \n<p>This is inherently less flexible than an instance variable, because using an instance variable allows each instance to have a different value.</p> \n<p>For example, consider the following:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"php language-php\">class User {\n    public static $db;\n    public $id;\n    public $name;\n    public $email;\n\n    public function save() {\n        $stmt = self::$db-&gt;prepare('REPLACE INTO user (id, name, email) VALUES (:id, :name, :email)');\n\n        $stmt-&gt;execute([\n            'id' =&gt; $this-&gt;id,\n            'name' =&gt; $this-&gt;name.\n            'email' =&gt; $this-&gt;email\n        ]);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> \n<p>Because <code>$db</code> is static, every instance of this class shares the same <code>$db</code> instance and records will always be inserted into the same database.</p> \n<p>While this sounds reasonable, let me give you a real-world example.</p> \n<p> Continue reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/how-to-ensure-flexible-reusable-php-code-with-insphpect/?utm_source=rss\">How to Ensure Flexible, Reusable PHP Code with Insphpect</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=21YsXuwutH4:O13SFdpp0xY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=21YsXuwutH4:O13SFdpp0xY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=21YsXuwutH4:O13SFdpp0xY:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=21YsXuwutH4:O13SFdpp0xY:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/21YsXuwutH4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 29 Jun 2020 19:56:36 +0000","feedId":6128,"bgimg":"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1593522244code.png","linkMd5":"c4a9c66012adbc54e7d210ad77d88ab3","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn61@2020_6/2020/08/24/22-51-26-981_2e5433e41f94f41b.webp","destWidth":4167,"destHeight":2200,"sourceBytes":68948,"destBytes":68948,"author":"Tom Butler","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1593522244code.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn61@2020_6/2020/08/24/22-51-26-981_2e5433e41f94f41b.webp","https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1593053893singleton-1024x612.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn86@2020_4/2020/08/24/22-51-38-690_42ea3fe4cdd0d957.webp","https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1593053927report1.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn17@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-51-46-983_791b083817cdac0d.webp","https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1593053956report2.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn50@2020_3/2020/08/24/22-51-36-866_fb20b2890af7543f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn15@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-39-311_6409ebad5acff93a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn3@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-47-113_bf83e999bebef320.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=21YsXuwutH4:O13SFdpp0xY:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn14@2020_3/2020/08/24/22-51-35-263_ab3704682f596b9f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/21YsXuwutH4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn20@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-40-779_48da90385ac58c3e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598309483261},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","title":"How to Build a File Upload Form with Express and DropzoneJS","link":"http://www.sitepoint.com/?p=118985","description":"<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/file-upload-form-express-dropzone-js/?utm_source=rss\" title=\"How to Build a File Upload Form with Express and DropzoneJS\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual\" style=\"display: block;

Developers don’t like building them, designers don’t particularly enjoy styling them, and users certainly don’t like filling them in.</strong></p> \n<p>Of all the components that can make up a form, the file control could just be the most frustrating of the lot. It’s a real pain to style, it’s clunky and awkward to use, and uploading a file will slow down the submission process of any form.</p> \n<p>That’s why a plugin to enhance them is always worth a look, and <a href=\"http://www.dropzonejs.com\">DropzoneJS</a> is just one such option. It will make your file upload controls look better, make them more user-friendly, and by using AJAX to upload the file in the background, it will at the very least make the process <em>seem</em> quicker. It also makes it easier to validate files before they even reach your server, providing near-instantaneous feedback to the user.</p> \n<p>We’re going to take a look at DropzoneJS in some detail. We’ll show how to implement it. and look at some of the ways in which it can be tweaked and customized. We’ll also implement a simple server-side upload mechanism using Node.js.</p> \n<p>As ever, you can find the code for this tutorial on our <a href=\"https://github.com/sitepoint-editors/image-uploads-dropzonejs-node-express\">GitHub repository</a>.</p> \n<h2 id=\"introducingdropzonejs\">Introducing DropzoneJS</h2> \n<p>DropzoneJS allows users to upload files using drag and drop. Whilst the usability benefits <a href=\"http://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/56829/what-is-the-usability-benefit-of-drag-files-images-here\">could justifiably be debated</a>, it’s an increasingly common approach and one which is in tune with the way a lot of people work with files on their desktop. It’s also <a href=\"http://caniuse.com/#feat=dragndrop\">pretty well supported</a> across major browsers.</p> \n<p>DropzoneJS isn’t simply a drag and drop based widget, however. Clicking the widget launches the more conventional file chooser dialog approach.</p> \n<p>Here’s an animation of the widget in action:</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1447336497dropzone-1.gif\" alt=\"The DropzoneJS widget in action\" width=\"480\" height=\"339\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118991\" /></p> \n<p>Alternatively, take a look at <a href=\"http://www.dropzonejs.com/examples/simple.html\">this most minimal of examples</a>.</p> \n<p>You can use DropzoneJS for any type of file, though the nice little thumbnail effect makes it ideally suited to uploading images in particular.</p> \n<h3 id=\"features\">Features</h3> \n<p>To summarize some of the plugin’s features and characteristics, DropzoneJS:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>can be used <em>with or without jQuery</em></li> \n <li>has drag and drop support</li> \n <li>generates thumbnail images</li> \n <li>supports multiple uploads, optionally in parallel</li> \n <li>includes a progress bar</li> \n <li>is fully themeable</li> \n <li>includes extensible file validation support</li> \n <li>is available as an AMD module or RequireJS module</li> \n <li>comes in at around 43KB when minified and 13KB when gzipped</li> \n</ul> \n<h3 id=\"browsersupport\">Browser Support</h3> \n<p>Taken from the official documentation, browser support is as follows:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Chrome 7+</li> \n <li>Firefox 4+</li> \n <li>IE 10+</li> \n <li>Opera 12+ (Version 12 for macOS is disabled because their API is buggy)</li> \n <li>Safari 6+</li> \n</ul> \n<p>There are a couple of ways to handle fallbacks for when the plugin isn’t fully supported, which we’ll look at later.</p> \n<h2 id=\"gettingsetup\">Getting Set Up</h2> \n<p>The simplest way to get started with DropzoneJS is to <a href=\"https://cdnjs.com/libraries/dropzone\">include the latest version from a CDN</a>. At the time of writing, this is version <code>5.5.1</code>.</p> \n<p>Alternatively, you can <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/meno/dropzone/-/releases\">download the latest release from the project’s GitLab page</a>. There’s also a third-party package providing support for <a href=\"https://github.com/paramaggarwal/react-dropzone\">ReactJS</a>.</p> \n<p>Then, make sure you include both the main JavaScript file and the CSS styles in your page. For example:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"markup language-markup\">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n  &lt;meta charset=\"UTF-8\"&gt;\n  &lt;title&gt;File Upload Example&lt;/title&gt;\n  &lt;link\n    rel=\"stylesheet\"\n    href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/dropzone/5.5.1/min/dropzone.min.css\"&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n\n  &lt;script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/dropzone/5.5.1/min/dropzone.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre> \n<p>Note that the project supplies two CSS files — a <code>basic.css</code> file with some minimal styling, and a more extensive <code>dropzone.css</code> file. Minified versions of <code>dropzone.css</code> and <code>dropzone.js</code> are also available.</p> \n<h2 id=\"basicusage\">Basic Usage</h2> \n<p>The simplest way to implement the plugin is to attach it to a form, although you can use any HTML such as a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>. Using a form, however, means fewer options to set — most notably the URL, which is the most important configuration property.</p> \n<p>You can initialize it simply by adding the <code>dropzone</code> class. For example:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"markup language-markup\">&lt;form id=\"upload-widget\" method=\"post\" action=\"/upload\" class=\"dropzone\"&gt;&lt;/form&gt;\n</code></pre> \n<p>Technically, that’s all you need to do, though in most cases you’ll want to set some additional options. The format for that is as follows:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">Dropzone.options.WIDGET_ID = {\n  //\n};\n</code></pre> \n<p>To derive the widget ID for setting the options, take the ID you defined in your HTML and camel-case it. For example, <code>upload-widget</code> becomes <code>uploadWidget</code>:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">Dropzone.options.uploadWidget = {\n  //\n};\n</code></pre> \n<p>You can also create an instance programmatically:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">const uploader = new Dropzone('#upload-widget', options);\n</code></pre> \n<p>Next up, we’ll look at some of the available configuration options.</p> \n<h2 id=\"basicconfigurationoptions\">Basic Configuration Options</h2> \n<p>The <code>url</code> option defines the target for the upload form, and is the only required parameter. That said, if you’re attaching it to a form element then it’ll simply use the form’s <code>action</code> attribute, in which case you don’t even need to specify that.</p> \n<p>The <code>method</code> option sets the HTTP method and again, it will take this from the form element if you use that approach, or else it’ll simply default to <code>POST</code>, which should suit most scenarios.</p> \n<p>The <code>paramName</code> option is used to set the name of the parameter for the uploaded file. If you’re using a file upload form element, it will match the <code>name</code> attribute. If you don’t include it, it defaults to <code>file</code>.</p> \n<p><code>maxFiles</code> sets the maximum number of files a user can upload, if it’s not set to null.</p> \n<p>By default, the widget will show a file dialog when it’s clicked, though you can use the <code>clickable</code> parameter to disable this by setting it to <code>false</code>, or alternatively you can provide an HTML element or CSS selector to customize the clickable element.</p> \n<p>Those are the basic options, but let’s now look at some of the more advanced options.</p> \n<h3 id=\"enforcingmaximumfilesize\">Enforcing Maximum File Size</h3> \n<p>The <code>maxFilesize</code> property determines the maximum file size in megabytes. This defaults to a size of 1000 bytes, but using the <code>filesizeBase</code> property, you could set it to another value — for example, 1024 bytes. You may need to tweak this to ensure that your client and server code calculate any limits in precisely the same way.</p> \n<h3 id=\"restrictingtocertainfiletypes\">Restricting to Certain File Types</h3> \n<p>The <code>acceptedFiles</code> parameter can be used to restrict the type of file you want to accept. This should be in the form of a comma-separated list of MIME types, although you can also use wildcards.</p> \n<p>For example, to only accept images:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">acceptedFiles: 'image/*',\n</code></pre> \n<h3 id=\"modifyingthesizeofthethumbnail\">Modifying the Size of the Thumbnail</h3> \n<p>By default, the thumbnail is generated at 120x120px. That is, it’s square. There are a couple of ways you can modify this behavior.</p> \n<p>The first is to use the <code>thumbnailWidth</code> and/or the <code>thumbnailHeight</code> configuration options.</p> \n<p>If you set both <code>thumbnailWidth</code> and <code>thumbnailHeight</code> to <code>null</code>, the thumbnail won’t be resized at all.</p> \n<p>If you want to completely customize the thumbnail generation behavior, you can even override the <code>resize</code> function.</p> \n<p>One important point about modifying the size of the thumbnail is that the <code>dz-image</code> class provided by the package sets the thumbnail size in the CSS, so you’ll need to modify that accordingly as well.</p> \n<h3 id=\"additionalfilechecks\">Additional File Checks</h3> \n<p>The <code>accept</code> option allows you to provide additional checks to determine whether a file is valid before it gets uploaded. You shouldn’t use this to check the number of files (<code>maxFiles</code>), file type (<code>acceptedFiles</code>), or file size (<code>maxFilesize</code>), but you can write custom code to perform other sorts of validation.</p> \n<p>You’d use the <code>accept</code> option like this:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">accept: function(file, done) {\n  if (!someCheck()) {\n    return done('This is invalid!');\n  }\n  return done();\n}\n</code></pre> \n<p>As you can see, it’s asynchronous. You can call <code>done()</code> with no arguments and validation passes, or provide an error message and the file will be rejected, displaying the message alongside the file as a popover.</p> \n<p>We’ll look at a more complex, real-world example later, when we look at how to enforce minimum or maximum image sizes.</p> \n<h2 id=\"sendingadditionalheaders\">Sending Additional Headers</h2> \n<p>Often you’ll need to attach additional headers to the uploader’s HTTP request.</p> \n<p>As an example, one approach to CSRF (cross-site request forgery) protection is to output a token in the view, then have your <code>POST/PUT/DELETE</code> endpoints check the request headers for a valid token. Suppose you outputted your token like this:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"markup language-markup\">&lt;meta name=\"csrf-token\" content=\"CL2tR2J4UHZXcR9BjRtSYOKzSmL8U1zTc7T8d6Jz\"&gt;\n</code></pre> \n<p>Then, you could add this to the configuration:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">headers: {\n  'x-csrf-token': document.querySelector('meta[name=csrf-token]').getAttributeNode('content').value,\n},\n</code></pre> \n<p>Alternatively, here’s the same example but using jQuery:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">headers: {\n  'x-csrf-token': $('meta[name=\"csrf-token\"]').attr('content')\n},\n</code></pre> \n<p>Your server should then verify the <code>x-csrf-token</code> header, perhaps using some <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/csrf\">middleware</a>.</p> \n<h2 id=\"handlingfallbacks\">Handling Fallbacks</h2> \n<p>The simplest way to implement a fallback is to insert a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> into your form containing input controls, setting the class name on the element to <code>fallback</code>. For example:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"markup language-markup\">&lt;form id=\"upload-widget\" method=\"post\" action=\"/upload\" class=\"dropzone\"&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"fallback\"&gt;\n    &lt;input name=\"file\" type=\"file\" /&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;\n</code></pre> \n<p>Alternatively, you can provide a function to be executed when the browser doesn’t support the plugin using the <code>fallback</code> configuration parameter.</p> \n<p>You can force the widget to use the fallback behavior by setting <code>forceFallback</code> to <code>true</code>, which might help during development.</p> \n<h2 id=\"handlingerrors\">Handling Errors</h2> \n<p>You can customize the way the widget handles errors by providing a custom function using the <code>error</code> configuration parameter. The first argument is the file, the error message the second, and if the error occurred server-side, the third parameter will be an instance of <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>.</p> \n<p>As always, client-side validation is only half the battle. You must also perform validation on the server. When we implement a simple server-side component later, we’ll look at the expected format of the error response, which when properly configured will be displayed in the same way as client-side errors (illustrated below).</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1447336481dropzone-2.gif\" alt=\"Displaying errors with DropzoneJS\" width=\"480\" height=\"326\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-118990\" /></p> \n<h2 id=\"overridingmessagesandtranslation\">Overriding Messages and Translation</h2> \n<p>There are a number of additional configuration properties which set the various messages displayed by the widget. You can use these to customize the displayed text, or to translate them into another language.</p> \n<p>Most notably, <code>dictDefaultMessage</code> is used to set the text which appears in the middle of the dropzone, prior to someone selecting a file to upload.</p> \n<p>You’ll find a complete list of the configurable string values — all of which begin with <code>dict</code> — <a href=\"http://www.dropzonejs.com/#configuration-options\">in the documentation</a>.</p> \n<h2 id=\"events\">Events</h2> \n<p>There are a number of events you can listen to in order to customize or enhance the plugin.</p> \n<p>There are two ways to listen to an event. The first is to create a listener within an initialization function:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">Dropzone.options.uploadWidget = {\n  init: function() {\n    this.on('success', function(file, resp){\n      ...\n    });\n  },\n  ...\n};\n</code></pre> \n<p>This is the alternative approach, which is useful if you decide to create the Dropzone instance programatically:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">const uploader = new Dropzone('#upload-widget');\nuploader.on('success', function(file, resp){\n  ...\n});\n</code></pre> \n<p>Perhaps the most notable aspect is the <code>success</code> event, which is fired when a file has been successfully uploaded. The <code>success</code> callback takes two arguments: the first a file object, and the second an instance of <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>.</p> \n<p>Other useful events include <code>addedfile</code> and <code>removedfile</code>, for when a file has been added or removed from the upload list; <code>thumbnail</code>, which fires once the thumbnail has been generated; and <code>uploadprogress</code>, which you might use to implement your own progress meter.</p> \n<p>There are also a bunch of events which take an event object as a parameter and which you could use to customize the behavior of the widget itself — <code>drop</code>, <code>dragstart</code>, <code>dragend</code>, <code>dragenter</code>, <code>dragover</code> and <code>dragleave</code>.</p> \n<p>You’ll find a complete list of events in the relevant section <a href=\"http://www.dropzonejs.com/#event-list\">of the documentation</a>.</p> \n<p> Continue reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/file-upload-form-express-dropzone-js/?utm_source=rss\">How to Build a File Upload Form with Express and DropzoneJS</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=0e80W9LHE2E:kSNOsBeVCMo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=0e80W9LHE2E:kSNOsBeVCMo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=0e80W9LHE2E:kSNOsBeVCMo:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=0e80W9LHE2E:kSNOsBeVCMo:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/0e80W9LHE2E\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Sun, 01 Mar 2020 14:00:53 +0000","feedId":6128,"bgimg":"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1582725021file-upload.jpg","linkMd5":"43a50134081c8b598378a5bfa2ad471a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn49@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-28-958_5dbd8477f49e6038.webp","destWidth":600,"destHeight":339,"sourceBytes":1582,"destBytes":1582,"author":"Lukas White","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1582725021file-upload.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn49@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-28-958_5dbd8477f49e6038.webp","http://www.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1447336497dropzone-1.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn37@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-40-327_50e4ee3dcbaab828.webp","http://www.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1447336481dropzone-2.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn29@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-41-566_1fb35d2f0941a908.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn15@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-39-311_6409ebad5acff93a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn3@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-47-113_bf83e999bebef320.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=0e80W9LHE2E:kSNOsBeVCMo:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn1@2020_6/2020/08/24/22-51-46-667_53a7a82ef74bdbd5.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/0e80W9LHE2E":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn9@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-51-37-635_bee1369a0d422b09.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598309483298},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","title":"How to Migrate from WordPress to a Static Site Generator","link":"https://editor.sitepoint.com/?p=176744","description":"<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/migrate-wordpress-static-site-generator/?utm_source=rss\" title=\"How to Migrate from WordPress to a Static Site Generator\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1596713533wp-to-ssg.jpg\" alt=\"WordPress to Static Site Generator\" srcset=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1596713533wp-to-ssg-300x165.jpg 300w, https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1596713533wp-to-ssg-768x421.jpg 768w, https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1596713533wp-to-ssg-1024x561.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /> </a> \n<p><strong>In this article, you’ll learn how to turn your WordPress-driven site into a static site with just a handful of powerful tools.</strong></p> \n<p>Why would you do this? Because you can get insane speed gains and therefore boost your site’s performance in search engines, and also reduce (or eliminate) your hosting bill and dramatically improve your security.</p> \n<h2 id=\"thebenefitsofgoingstatic\">The Benefits of Going Static</h2> \n<p>Fantastic speedups are certainly no small feat, but that isn’t all you can get from turning your dynamic WordPress (WP) site install into a static one.</p> \n<p>Let’s summarize:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Reduced page load speed</strong>. Pages aren’t preprocessed at runtime (user’s request), and content isn’t pulled from the database. As a result, the web server will respond <em>a lot</em> faster (10x and even more).</li> \n <li><strong>Reduced latency through CDN’s</strong>. You can just drop these now-static pages on a distributed content delivery network (CDN), hugely improving response times all around the world.</li> \n <li><strong>Easier management</strong>. Once you’ve set your workflow — which is what we’ll do here — you’ll see that you actually won’t need to spend any additional effort in maintenance, WP upgrades or server updates.</li> \n <li><strong>Dramatically enhanced security</strong>. HTTPS out of the box with only static pages that aren’t being run by some bogus PHP version or an outdated WP, and most probably not even by Apache.</li> \n <li><strong>Improved SEO</strong>. Google values not only your content but how easy and secure the access to it is. This is, in fact, one of the few search engine optimizations still valid these days: a faster, more secure site will perform better on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_results_page\">search engine results page</a>.</li> \n <li><strong>Peace of mind</strong>. No need to upgrade PHP, no unpatched WP concerns, even no Linux servers being managed. Just relax and have your coffee/beer/tea/ginseng after your deployment.</li> \n</ul> \n<h2 id=\"iswordpresssecurewellitscomplicated\">“Is WordPress Secure?” Well, It’s Complicated …</h2> \n<p>WP developers follow <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/security\">good standards and security practices</a>, although a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_support\">long-term support</a> (LTS) is still very much missing. However, because of its very architecture, there are things that are out of the WP Security Team’s hands and transferred directly into yours:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>updating your server</li> \n <li>installing WP updates</li> \n <li>installing PHP updates</li> \n <li>installing updates for plugins and themes (if available, at all)</li> \n <li>managing WP and PHP (neither of which has LTS) mayor upgrades every once in a while</li> \n</ul> \n<p>All of this is a <em>constant</em> process, and plugins are not a minor threat, specially unmaintained ones, as these often have security holes by which attackers take control of WP installations. That is precisely why it took <a href=\"https://automattic.com/\">Automattic</a>, the company behind WP, years to accommodate WordPress.com (WP.com) — the commercial managed version of WordPress.org (WP.org) — to be able to offer <em>some</em> plugins.</p> \n<p>WP <em>could</em> be secure with a fair amount of conscious effort. And while you could argue that these are efforts any decent developer should put in, it’s also true that you can potentially lift this weight off your shoulders by turning your WP site into a static one, and while doing so redefining its architecture and removing <em>for good</em> nearly all of the available spots that could turn into a security threat. After all, there isn’t much an attacker can do with plain HTML, CSS files and flat images.</p> \n<p>However, you’ll still need to take care of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting\">cross-site scripting</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery\">cross-site request forgery</a>. 🤷‍♂️</p> \n<h2 id=\"preliminariesenterstaticsitegenerators\">Preliminaries: Enter Static Site Generators</h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://jamstack.org/\"><img src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1595294384Jamstack_Logo_Original.png\" /></a></p> \n<p><small><em>Provided: Netlify</em></small></p> \n<p>We briefly reviewed static site generators (SSGs) on our <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/jamstack-tools-services-apis/\">list of 100 Jamstack tools, APIs and services to power your sites</a> article, and there are <em>tons</em> more than we’ll cover here, so make sure to check <a href=\"https://www.staticgen.com/\">StaticGen</a> to learn more.</p> \n<p>Some SSGs are specifically targeted at WordPress, such as <a href=\"https://wp2static.com/\">WP2Static</a>, but we’ll focus on a more general-purpose one, <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/\">GatsbyJS</a> — the <em>“free and open source framework based on React that helps developers build blazing fast websites and apps”</em>.</p> \n<h2 id=\"migratingwordpress\">Migrating WordPress</h2> \n<p>I’ll have to admit that, as much as I wanted this process to be dead simple, there are a number of things that could make it a little more cumbersome and time consuming, such as the existing plugins you may have installed (the fewer the easier) and the way in which you’ve formatted your posts (the simpler the better). Think of this as a guideline that you might need to adjust to your specific case.</p> \n<p>Essentially, this is what we’ll do:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>set up GatsbyJS</li> \n <li>export WP posts/pages to Markdown</li> \n <li>generate the static assets</li> \n</ol> \n<h3 id=\"step1forkthegatsbystarters\">Step 1: Fork the Gatsby Starters</h3> \n<p>We’ll start by forking either the <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/vagr9k/gatsby-advanced-starter/\">Gatsby Advanced Starter</a></strong> or the <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/Vagr9K/gatsby-material-starter\">Gatsby Material Starter</a></strong>, both of which are tweaked general purpose primers for a GatsbyJS project, the second one with an “opinionated” <a href=\"https://material.io/\">Material Design</a> template (<a href=\"https://vagr9k.github.io/gatsby-material-starter/\">demo</a>).</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_application\"><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Progressive_Web_Apps_Logo.svg/200px-Progressive_Web_Apps_Logo.svg.png\" align=\"right\" /></a></p> \n<p>Right off the bat these starters will get you a fully featured React-powered <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/progressive-web-apps-a-crash-course/\">progressive web application</a> (PWA) with all batteries included:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>blazing fast loading times (pre-rendered HTML, JS auto chunk loading)</li> \n <li>Markdown posts (code syntax highlight, embed YouTube videos, embed Tweets)</li> \n <li>pagination, tags, categories</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://disqus.com/\">Disqus</a> support</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.netlifycms.org\">NetlifyCMS</a> support</li> \n <li>SEO goodies (<a href=\"https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/\">Google Analytics</a> support, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitemaps\">Sitemaps</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots_exclusion_standard\">robots.txt</a> generation, meta tags, <a href=\"https://schema.org/\">Schema.org JSON-LD</a> for Google Rich Snippets, <a href=\"https://ogp.me/\">OpenGraph Tags</a> for Facebook/Google+/Pinterest, <a href=\"https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/overview/markup\">Twitter Tags</a> for Twitter Cards)</li> \n <li>syndication feeds (RSS)</li> \n <li>social features (Twitter, LinkedIn and Telegram share button; Facebook and Reddit share/share count)</li> \n <li>development tools (<a href=\"https://eslint.org/\">ESLint</a>, <a href=\"https://prettier.io/\">Prettier</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint\">Remark-Lint</a>, deploying support for <a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\">GitHub pages</a> and <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/\">Netlify</a>, <a href=\"https://codeclimate.com/\">CodeClimate</a> config file and badge)</li> \n <li>and more!</li> \n</ul> \n<p>The claim is that after a successful migration and deployment to a CDN, your site should be so performant that an audit with <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/\">Google Lighthouse</a> should report the best results possible:</p> \n<p>\n <center></center></p> \n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vagr9K/gatsby-advanced-starter/master/docs/pwa-score.png\" alt=\"\" /></p> \n<h4 id=\"installationandconfiguration\">Installation and Configuration</h4> \n<p>You’ll first need to install GatsbyJS and <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/\">Node.js</a> so that you can use the <code>gatsby</code> CLI and the Node.js packet manager <code>npm</code>.

always a daunting task. Most likely you don’t know exactly what you’ll be asked and nerves can easily take over, making you forget even your own name. I’ve compiled 21 Node.js questions for job interviews that go from very simple stuff to some more technically advanced topics to help you in the process.</strong></p> \n<p>Node.js is not exclusively used in the back end. We also use it to create front-end applications, and this has become a very important part of the Web Development ecosystem. This means that it’s very useful for a Node.js developer to be familiar with the role this technology plays in different JavaScript environments. For this reason, I’ve included some questions and answers along those lines.</p> \n<h2 id=\"guidelines\">Guidelines</h2> \n<p>I would recommend trying to answer the questions yourself before reading the answers. If you didn’t get them all, try again tomorrow to see how much you’ve retained.</p> \n<p>There’s also the chance you’re here looking for interview question examples for your candidates. I believe these should be varied enough as a starting point to help you assess their level.</p> \n<p>More than just answering a question correctly, I think it’s the details that show how much someone knows. A good answer might ignite a conversation that could potentially render a stressful experience into a casual chat with a colleague. That’s an ideal result for both parties.</p> \n<h2 id=\"nodejsquestions\">Node.js Questions</h2> \n<h3 id=\"whatisnodejs\">What is Node.js?</h3> \n<p>Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment based on the V8 engine. It allows us to run JavaScript outside of the browser — typically, in a web server.</p> \n<h3 id=\"whatisnodejsgoodfor\">What is Node.js good for?</h3> \n<p>Node.js is great at handling multiple connections with low cyclomatic complexity, given that its single-threaded nature requires that we liberate the event loop as soon as possible. This makes Node.js an ideal choice for microservices and real-time applications.</p> \n<h3 id=\"whatisnpm\">What is npm?</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/\">npm</a> stands for Node.js Package Manager. It consists of a command-line interface that we can use to access an online registry of public and private packages.</p> \n<h3 id=\"howdoyoucreateanodejsappfromscratch\">How do you create a Node.js app from scratch?</h3> \n<p>We can start by creating a project folder.

It’s very common nowadays to use a Node.js environment for building front-end applications. A good example of Node.js in the front end is the <a href=\"https://www.electronjs.org/\">Electron</a> framework, which makes use of both Node.js and chromium to build “native” apps like, for instance, <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\">VS Code</a>.</p> \n<h3 id=\"canyoumentionthreepopularnodejsframeworks\">Can you mention three popular Node.js frameworks?</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://expressjs.com/\">Express.js</a> is probably the most popular framework to date. <a href=\"https://koajs.com/\">Koajs</a> is probably one of the fastest and <a href=\"https://sailsjs.com/\">Sails.js</a> works great for real-time bilateral communication apps given that use socket.io.</p> \n<h3 id=\"whatisexpressjsgoodfor\">What is Express.js good for?</h3> \n<p>Express.js makes it dead easy to set routes for our web app, which makes it an obvious choice to create <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/developers-rest-api/\">REST APIs</a>. It’s quite flexible and easy to use, and its middleware architecture helps to keep a simple and scalable system.</p> \n<h3 id=\"whatiscrypto\">What is Crypto?</h3> \n<p>Crypto is a Node.js internal library that provides cryptographic functionality to do things like, for example, encrypting and decrypting passwords.</p> \n<p> Continue reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/node-js-interview-questions/?utm_source=rss\">21 Node.js Interview Questions with Solutions</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=EUCGbVP1-hc:d3ieu6Rz7Jg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=EUCGbVP1-hc:d3ieu6Rz7Jg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=EUCGbVP1-hc:d3ieu6Rz7Jg:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=EUCGbVP1-hc:d3ieu6Rz7Jg:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/EUCGbVP1-hc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 12:52:32 +0000","feedId":6128,"bgimg":"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1597280671nodejs-questions.png","linkMd5":"e0295147b93f05ef5cd9ed31f683a20d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn57@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-27-030_1005dd71fcf2f6ef.webp","destWidth":600,"destHeight":340,"sourceBytes":10570,"destBytes":10570,"author":"Paul Orac","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1597280671nodejs-questions.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn57@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-27-030_1005dd71fcf2f6ef.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn15@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-39-311_6409ebad5acff93a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn3@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-47-113_bf83e999bebef320.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=EUCGbVP1-hc:d3ieu6Rz7Jg:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn8@2020_4/2020/08/24/22-51-39-925_bdb4507b9c5b1629.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/EUCGbVP1-hc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn56@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-39-438_d83a8b592a2b50f7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598309483245},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","title":"Get Cloud Certified with ExamPro&#8217;s Smart Learning Platform","link":"https://editor.sitepoint.com/?p=177312","description":"<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/how-exampro-helps-developers-get-cloud-certified/?utm_source=rss\" title=\"Get Cloud Certified with ExamPro’s Smart Learning Platform\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1597714771exampro.png\" alt=\"How ExamPro's Smart Learning Helps Developers Get Cloud Certified\" srcset=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1597714771exampro-300x170.png 300w, https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1597714771exampro.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /> </a> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.exampro.co/\">ExamPro</a> is a study platform to help people pass cloud certification exams.</strong></p> \n<p>Cloud certification exams are challenging, and involve retaining large quantities of technical information.

It will launch a server that scales and is secure by default, and is already configured to be highly optimized. AWS employs world-class engineers to maintain that service.</p> \n<p>Widespread cloud adoption has driven the cost down through cost-sharing of the underlying servers so far that it’s hard to justify paying for an in-house engineer when you can just pay to use the service for a fraction of a penny per hour.</p> \n<h2 id=\"usingthecloudhasintroducedanewdemandfromtechcompanies\">Using the Cloud Has Introduced a New Demand from Tech Companies</h2> \n<p>AWS is the most popular CSP among startups and technology companies. A CSP is a company with a collection of cloud services that you can use to build applications hosted on the cloud.</p> \n<p>AWS is a special kind of CSP because it has hundreds of cloud services for any conceivable use case, and they all seamlessly work together.</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Do you need to host a database? Then use AWS RDS.</li> \n <li>Do you need a server? Then use AWS EC2.</li> \n <li>Do you need a chatbot? Then use AWS Lex.</li> \n <li>Do need to generate reports for terabytes of data? Then use AWS Redshift.</li> \n <li>Do you need long-term storage for 7 years? Then use AWS Glacier.</li> \n <li>Do you need to rent a satellite? Then use AWS Ground Station.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>And then the list goes on and on.</p> \n<p>AWS allows companies to compete globally and have access to a wide range of cloud services to build complex applications. </p> \n<p>For a company to take advantage of the cloud, they need someone who knows how to use AWS. Since there are 200+ services, they will need knowledgeable people in different combinations of cloud services based on their use case and business goals.</p> \n<h2 id=\"whatareawscertifications\">What Are AWS Certifications?</h2> \n<p>AWS has officially created AWS Certifications to help companies identify qualified hiring candidates for cloud roles, and as of writing this article, they have 12 possible AWS certifications:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Certified Cloud Practitioner (CCP)</li> \n <li>Solutions Architect Associate (SAA)</li> \n <li>Developer Associate</li> \n <li>SysOps Administrator Associate</li> \n <li>DevOps Professional</li> \n <li>Solutions Architect Professional</li> \n <li>Machine Learning Specialty</li> \n <li>Data Analytics Specialty</li> \n <li>Databases Specialty</li> \n <li>Security Specialty</li> \n <li>Advanced Networking Specialty</li> \n <li>Alexa Skill Builder Specialty</li> \n</ul> \n<p>The two most popular AWS certifications are the CCP and the SAA, because they cover the broadest number of AWS services. </p> \n<p>The CCP is the introduction to AWS. The certification costs $100 USD to sit the exam at a test center or online, which can be passed with one to two weeks of study and is valid for three years.<br /> The SAA covers more in-depth services included in the CCP. The certification costs $150 USD to sit the exam at a test center or online, which can be passed with three to five weeks of study and is valid for three years.</p> \n<p>When you pass an AWS Certification, you get the next half off, so it’s common for people to take the CCP for $100 USD and then take the SAA at $75 USD.</p> \n<p> Continue reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/how-exampro-helps-developers-get-cloud-certified/?utm_source=rss\">Get Cloud Certified with ExamPro’s Smart Learning Platform</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=NSx66dwdRyg:1PwyDL6j94M:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=NSx66dwdRyg:1PwyDL6j94M:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=NSx66dwdRyg:1PwyDL6j94M:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=NSx66dwdRyg:1PwyDL6j94M:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/NSx66dwdRyg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 19 Aug 2020 19:30:12 +0000","feedId":6128,"bgimg":"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1597714771exampro.png","linkMd5":"ea8bb5a4c36805319d6d50e4d376abfb","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn21@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-26-143_6e008f9b6a91a956.webp","destWidth":600,"destHeight":340,"sourceBytes":17266,"destBytes":17266,"author":"Andrew Brown","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1597714771exampro.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn21@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-26-143_6e008f9b6a91a956.webp","https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1597713491road.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn85@2020_4/2020/08/24/22-51-44-072_6b2bde8f861a8604.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn15@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-39-311_6409ebad5acff93a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn3@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-47-113_bf83e999bebef320.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=NSx66dwdRyg:1PwyDL6j94M:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn80@2020_3/2020/08/24/22-51-44-469_6aa6fea8d3dbe430.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/NSx66dwdRyg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn48@2020_6/2020/08/24/22-51-46-776_7cdd46c957a63067.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598309483244},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","title":"How to Redesign the Django Admin with Bootstrap","link":"https://editor.sitepoint.com/?p=176063","description":"<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/how-to-hack-redesign-customize-the-django-admin-with-bootstrap/?utm_source=rss\" title=\"How to Redesign the Django Admin with Bootstrap\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1588125191django-admin.jpg\" alt=\"Hacking the Django Admin with Bootstrap\" srcset=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1588125191django-admin-300x170.jpg 300w, https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1588125191django-admin.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /> </a> \n<p><strong>The <a style=\"font-weight:bold\" href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/admin/\">Django administration site</a> is great — fully-featured, easy to use, secure by design, rock solid … and somewhat ugly, which can be something of a downside when you want to integrate it with the look and feel of the rest of your website.

So even if they will be <em>almost</em> identical, <em>we’ll need to maintain two different templates — one for the main UI, and one for the admin.</em></p> \n<h3 id=\"enablingadirectoryfortemplatesingeneral\">Enabling a Directory for Templates in General</h3> \n<p>First, we need to tell Django where we’ll store the hacked admin template in the base directory.</p> \n<p>Se we’ll need to edit <code>myproject/settings.py</code>. firstly, find the <code>TEMPLATES</code> constant and this <code>DIRS</code> key:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"python language-python\">'DIRS': [],\n</code></pre> \n<p>Change that code to this:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"python language-python\">'DIRS': [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')],\n</code></pre> \n<h3 id=\"wrappingtheadmintemplateadminbasehack\">Wrapping the Admin Template (<code>admin/base</code> Hack)</h3> \n<p>If we just wanted to do cosmetic changes, like passing a custom style sheet to the admin, or removing/replacing its header, we could get along with that by just editing the <code>admin/base_site</code> template and skipping this current step altogether. However, if we want to go all the way and “<a href=\"https://www.quora.com/In-programming-what-is-a-wrapper\">wrap</a>” the admin section as if it was contained within our main site, with the possibility to have a common header and footer, then keep reading.</p> \n<p>We’ll need to copy Django’s <a href=\"https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/contrib/admin/templates/admin/base.html\"><code>admin/base.html</code></a> to our templates directory in <code>templates/admin/base.html</code>, so that we can place our wrappers.</p> \n<p>We’ll edit the code around the <code>container</code> section, so that it goes from this:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"markup language-markup\">&lt;!-- Container --&gt;\n&lt;div id=\"container\"&gt;\n(...)\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;!-- END Container --&gt;\n</code></pre> \n<p>to this:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"markup language-markup\">{% block bodyheader %}{% endblock %}\n\n&lt;!-- Container --&gt;\n&lt;div id=\"container\"&gt;\n(...)\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;!-- END Container --&gt;\n\n{% block bodyfooter %}{% endblock %}\n</code></pre> \n<p>And that’s all!

Okay, <code>#header, .breadcrumbs { display: none; }</code> is something of a restatement of number 3; but it’s useful to know you can disable the branding and breadcrumbs sections both ways.<br /> b. There can be some issues when overlapping Bootstrap with Django’s CSS in the admin, so these are some fixes.</li> \n <li>Use the <code>bodyheader</code> and <code>bodyfooter</code> blocks to wrap the admin content.</li> \n</ol> \n<p>Now that we have access to the admin template, we could further its style sheet, or just leave it at that with a shared style with the main UI.</p> \n<h3 id=\"caveats\">Caveats</h3> \n<p>We’re maintaining two different templates (main UI and admin) to do essentially the same presentation. Admittedly, this isn’t ideal, as we’re explicitly breaking one of the maxims of software development: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself\">don’t repeat yourself</a> (DRY).</p> \n<p>As we commented, this is because the Django admin has been designed to be detached from the main UI. And there’s nothing wrong with that, just as there isn’t anything wrong with thinking out of the box. But yes, that forces us to use two templates with nearly the same content.</p> \n<p><em>Actually</em>, in principle we could design a template pattern that included that navbar and other common elements from the main UI and the admin, and reuse them from that single source; but at this point, and for the purpose of this article, that approach would be a little overkill. Anyway, I’ll leave the idea planted for you. 😉</p> \n<p> Continue reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/how-to-hack-redesign-customize-the-django-admin-with-bootstrap/?utm_source=rss\">How to Redesign the Django Admin with Bootstrap</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=EuknvqxyD8A:Q5hDN5PvF50:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=EuknvqxyD8A:Q5hDN5PvF50:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=EuknvqxyD8A:Q5hDN5PvF50:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=EuknvqxyD8A:Q5hDN5PvF50:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/EuknvqxyD8A\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 20 May 2020 22:00:39 +0000","feedId":6128,"bgimg":"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1588125191django-admin.jpg","linkMd5":"72a97eb756ff0aef4807612fac8fa673","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn1@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-25-680_2d11cf13d5de959a.webp","destWidth":600,"destHeight":339,"sourceBytes":6620,"destBytes":6620,"author":"Lucero del Alba","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1588125191django-admin.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn1@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-25-680_2d11cf13d5de959a.webp","https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1588121363admin.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn0@2020_1/404.jpg","https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1588121766Django_logo.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn0@2020_1/404.jpg","https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1588121945Bootstrap_logo.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn0@2020_1/404.jpg","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn15@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-39-311_6409ebad5acff93a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn3@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-47-113_bf83e999bebef320.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=EuknvqxyD8A:Q5hDN5PvF50:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn1@2020_3/2020/08/24/22-51-44-755_af3f85d4c270ab59.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/EuknvqxyD8A":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn64@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-45-245_d0326766a615177f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598309483270},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","title":"Managing Dates and Times Using Moment.js","link":"http://www.sitepoint.com/?p=80121","description":"<br />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Sun, 15 Mar 2020 11:00:22 +0000","feedId":6128,"bgimg":"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/1584337699m0021-12.jpg","linkMd5":"2b214caa766f988ff2d519437bfffa83","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn38@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-51-25-851_4e0bf1ca76468727.webp","destWidth":2000,"destHeight":1233,"sourceBytes":37506,"destBytes":37506,"author":"Jay Raj","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/1584337699m0021-12.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn38@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-51-25-851_4e0bf1ca76468727.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn15@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-39-311_6409ebad5acff93a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn3@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-47-113_bf83e999bebef320.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=PZIzt-pPIjE:ROZ-YPKMQWA:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn10@2020_4/2020/08/24/22-51-43-980_fe26cc5514d96a13.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/PZIzt-pPIjE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn24@2020_6/2020/08/24/22-51-46-598_c89b1da2c70653dd.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598309483291},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","title":"How to Design for Screen Readers with Adobe XD CC","link":"https://www.sitepoint.com/?p=175102","description":"<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/how-to-design-for-screen-readers-with-adobe-xd-cc/?utm_source=rss\" title=\"How to Design for Screen Readers with Adobe XD CC\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual\" style=\"display: block;

This is due to the fact that, often enough, thick lines are drawn between “who does what”.</strong></p> \n<p>Also, because creating accessible apps and websites isn’t considered to be exciting, this line is hardly ever questioned.</p> \n<p><strong>Accessibility is still a black sheep, even in 2020.</strong></p> \n<p><em>So</em>, since UX copy is the responsibility of the designer and ARIA attributes are the responsibility of the developer, exactly whose responsibility is it to cater for screen readers? Since:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>Screen reader UX copy is expressed as Braille or dictation (so how do we communicate this when our UI tools are visual?)</li> \n <li>Implementation is developer territory (so can we really shift the responsibility of writing UX copy to developers?)</li> \n</ol> \n<p>As you can see, it’s a <em>two-person job</em> — and yet, the tools simply don’t exist to facilitate this. I mean, make no mistake, some aspects of accessibility design are one-sided (for example, UI designers can very easily take care of color contrast by themselves). However, other aspects such as designing for screen readers requires collaboration between designers and developers.</p> \n<p>This is where Adobe XD CC’s <em>design handoff</em> and <em>voice prototyping</em> features come in handy. In this article, we’ll discuss what to consider when designing for screen readers, and we’ll also walk through how to use the features mentioned above.</p> \n<h2 id=\"whatarescreenreaders\">What Are Screen Readers?</h2> \n<p>A screen reader is a type of assistive technology that communicates what’s happening on the screen (for those with visual impairments). Screen reader software can be used in combination with the keyboard (for example, users will <kbd>tab</kbd> and <kbd>enter</kbd> as opposed to using the mouse), but it can also be used in combination with screen reader hardware, which allows for more efficient navigation and also caters for users that use Braille.</p> \n<p>If you’re an Apple user, for example, you’ll be somewhat aware of <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/my/accessibility/mac/vision/\">Apple VoiceOver</a>, which is the native Apple dictation software that acts as a screen reader. Windows users, however, commonly use either <a href=\"https://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/jaws/\">JAWS</a> or <a href=\"https://www.nvaccess.org/\">NVDA</a>, since there aren’t any native screen reader tools in the Windows operating system.</p> \n<p>Let’s dive in.</p> \n<h2 id=\"1useheadings\">1. Use Headings</h2> \n<p>Screen readers often use headings as a way of deciphering a website’s structure, and if we think too visually we run the risk of leaving out these headings. In the example below, the omission of the “Chapters” heading causes screen readers to assume that the list of chapters is a continuation of the content on the left-hand side, which it obviously isn’t.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/1582543608heading-1024x640.png\" alt=\"&quot;Chapters&quot; needs to be a heading\" width=\"1024\" height=\"640\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-175104\" /></p> \n<p>As a result, screen-reader users won’t be able to skip to “Chapters”, and they might not discover the information within.</p> \n<p>While there are code workarounds available (such as the <code>aria-label</code> attribute), having a <em>visible</em> heading inclusively offers a clearer experience for <em>everybody</em>, whether disabled or not.</p> \n<p>Of course, the section is very obviously a list of chapters, as we can infer from the context (i.e. the content). However, those using screen readers <em>very rarely</em> have the luxury of context. It’s like trying to find an object in storage where none of the boxes are labeled. Our designs need these labels and headings.</p> \n<p>On the technical side, the rule is that every section (as defined by a <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> tag) should have not only a heading, but an explicit heading that conflicts with no other heading. As an example, if the highest level heading within a section is an <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, then there should be no other <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> heading within that section. Otherwise, screen readers are clueless as to which heading is the label for the section.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/1582543648heading2-1024x640.png\" alt=\"The same heading for like sections\" width=\"1024\" height=\"640\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-175106\" /></p> \n<p> Continue reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/how-to-design-for-screen-readers-with-adobe-xd-cc/?utm_source=rss\">How to Design for Screen Readers with Adobe XD CC</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=QClTMds4s8o:lu4wDWOz06M:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=QClTMds4s8o:lu4wDWOz06M:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=QClTMds4s8o:lu4wDWOz06M:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=QClTMds4s8o:lu4wDWOz06M:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/QClTMds4s8o\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 26 Feb 2020 23:00:36 +0000","feedId":6128,"bgimg":"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/1582544632screen-readers.png","linkMd5":"1802bede153efd4d79266941be34d026","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn10@2020_4/2020/08/24/22-51-25-728_4d951bd672088038.webp","destWidth":600,"destHeight":339,"sourceBytes":5484,"destBytes":5484,"author":"Daniel Schwarz","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/1582544632screen-readers.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn10@2020_4/2020/08/24/22-51-25-728_4d951bd672088038.webp","https://www.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/1582543608heading-1024x640.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn34@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-39-018_69255e9cae2c6052.webp","https://www.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/1582543648heading2-1024x640.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn85@2020_6/2020/08/24/22-51-36-590_8100b12f6d23739a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn15@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-39-311_6409ebad5acff93a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn3@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-47-113_bf83e999bebef320.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=QClTMds4s8o:lu4wDWOz06M:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn73@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-36-700_0c5783ef11bea389.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/QClTMds4s8o":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn37@2020_4/2020/08/24/22-51-35-089_5fe697ca63faee3a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598309483297},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","title":"Build a Simple Beginner App with Node, Bootstrap and MongoDB","link":"https://www.sitepoint.com/?p=162947","description":"<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/build-simple-beginner-app-node-bootstrap-mongodb/?utm_source=rss\" title=\"Build a Simple Beginner App with Node, Bootstrap and MongoDB\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/1582112966app-development.png\" alt=\"Building a Simple Beginner App with Node, Bootstrap and MongoDB\" srcset=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/1582112966app-development-300x170.png 300w, https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/1582112966app-development.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /> </a> \n<p><strong>If you’re just getting started with Node.js and want to try your hand at building a web app, things can often get a little overwhelming. Once you get beyond the “Hello, World!” tutorials, much of the material out there has you copy-pasting code, with little or no explanation as to what you’re doing or why.</strong></p> \n<p>This means that, by the time you’ve finished, you’ve built something nice and shiny, but you also have relatively few takeaways that you can apply to your next project.</p> \n<p>In this tutorial, I’m going to take a slightly different approach. Starting from the ground up, I’ll demonstrate how to build a no-frills web app using Node.js, but instead of focusing on the end result, I’ll focus on a range of things you’re likely to encounter when building a real-world app. These include routing, templating, dealing with forms, interacting with a database and even basic authentication.</p> \n<p>This won’t be a JavaScript 101. If that’s the kind of thing you’re after, <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/beginners-guide-javascript-variables-and-datatypes/\">look here</a>. It will, however, be suitable for those people who feel reasonably confident with the JavaScript language, and who are looking to take their first steps in Node.js.</p> \n<h2 id=\"whatwellbebuilding\">What We’ll Be Building</h2> \n<p>We’ll be using <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/\">Node.js</a> and the <a href=\"http://expressjs.com/\">Express framework</a> to build a simple registration form with basic validation, which persists its data to a <a href=\"https://www.mongodb.com/\">MongoDB database</a>. We’ll add a view to list successful registration, which we’ll protect with basic HTTP authentication, and we’ll use <a href=\"https://getbootstrap.com/\">Bootstrap</a> to add some styling. The tutorial is structured so that you can follow along step by step. However, if you’d like to jump ahead and see the end result, <a href=\"https://github.com/jameshibbard/demo-node-app\">the code for this tutorial is also available on GitHub</a>.</p> \n<h2 id=\"basicsetup\">Basic Setup</h2> \n<p>Before we can start coding, we’ll need to get Node, npm and MongoDB installed on our machines. I won’t go into depth on the various installation instructions, but if you have any trouble getting set up, please <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/community/\">visit our forums</a> and ask for help there.</p> \n<h3 id=\"nodejs\">Node.js</h3> \n<p>Many websites will recommend that you head to <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/download/\">the official Node download page</a> and grab the Node binaries for your system. While that works, I would suggest that you use a version manager instead. This is a program which allows you to install multiple versions of Node and switch between them at will. There are various advantages to using a version manager. For example, it negates potential permission issues which would otherwise see you installing packages with admin rights.</p> \n<p>If you fancy going the version manager route, please consult our quick tip: <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/quick-tip-multiple-versions-node-nvm/\">Install Multiple Versions of Node.js Using nvm</a>. Otherwise, grab the correct binaries for your system from the link above and install those.</p> \n<h3 id=\"npm\">npm</h3> \n<p>npm is a JavaScript package manager which comes bundled with Node, so no extra installation is necessary here. We’ll be making quite extensive use of npm throughout this tutorial, so if you’re in need of a refresher, please consult <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/beginners-guide-node-package-manager/\">A Beginner’s Guide to npm — the Node Package Manager</a>.</p> \n<h3 id=\"mongodb\">MongoDB</h3> \n<p>MongoDB is a document database which stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. If you’ve never worked with Mongo before, you might like to check out our <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-mongodb/\">beginner-friendly introduction to MongoDB</a>.</p> \n<p>The quickest way to get up and running with Mongo is to use a service such as mLabs. They have a free sandbox plan which provides a single database with 0.5GB of storage running on a shared virtual machine. This is more than adequate for a simple app with a handful of users. If this sounds like the best option for you, please consult their <a href=\"http://docs.mlab.com/\">quick-start guide</a>.</p> \n<p>You can also install Mongo locally. To do this, please visit the <a href=\"https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community\">official download page</a> and download the correct version of the community server for your operating system. There’s a link to detailed, OS-specific installation instructions beneath every download link, which you can consult if you run into trouble.</p> \n<h3 id=\"amongodbgui\">A MongoDB GUI</h3> \n<p>Although not strictly necessary for following along with this tutorial, you might also like to install <a href=\"https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass\">Compass, the official GUI for MongoDB</a>. This tool helps you visualize and manipulate your data, allowing you to interact with documents with full CRUD functionality.</p> \n<h3 id=\"checkthateverythingisinstalledcorrectly\">Check that Everything is Installed Correctly</h3> \n<p>To check that Node and npm are installed correctly, open your terminal and type:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">node -v\n</code></pre> \n<p>followed by:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npm -v\n</code></pre> \n<p>This will output the version number of each program (<code>12.14.1</code> and <code>6.13.6</code> respectively at the time of writing).</p> \n<p>If you installed Mongo locally, you can check the version number using:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">mongo --version\n</code></pre> \n<p>This should output a bunch of information, including the version number (<code>4.2.2</code> at the time of writing).</p> \n<h3 id=\"checkthedatabaseconnectionusingcompass\">Check the Database Connection Using Compass</h3> \n<p>If you’ve installed Mongo locally, you start the server by typing the following command into a terminal:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">mongod\n</code></pre> \n<p>Next, open Compass. You should be able to accept the defaults (server: <code>localhost</code>, port: 27017), press the <em>CONNECT</em> button, and establish a connection to the database server.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/1579778337MongoDB-Compass-localhost27017_001.png\" alt=\"MongoDB Compass connected to localhost:27107\" /></p> \n<p><em><small>MongoDB Compass connected to localhost</small></em></p> \n<p>Note that the databases <code>admin</code>, <code>config</code> and <code>local</code> are created automatically.</p> \n<h4 id=\"usingacloudhostedsolution\">Using a Cloud-hosted Solution</h4> \n<p>If you’re using mLabs, create a database subscription (as described in their <a href=\"http://docs.mlab.com/\">quick-start guide</a>), then make a note of the connection details.</p> \n<p>Open Compass, click <em>New Connection</em>, then <em>Fill in connection fields individually</em>. Select <em>Username / Password</em> as the authentication method, then fill out the rest of the details. Finally, click <em>CONNECT</em> and you should be off to the races.</p> \n<p><em>Note: if you wish to use a connection string, it should look like this: <code>mongodb://&lt;dbuser&gt;:&lt;dbpassword&gt;@ds211709.mlab.com:11709/?authSource=&lt;dbname&gt;</code>.</em></p> \n<p><img src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/1579781817MongoDB-Compass-ds211709.mlab_.com11709_002.png\" alt=\"MongoDB Compass connected to mLabs\" /></p> \n<p><em><small>MongoDB Compass connected to mLabs</small></em></p> \n<p>Note that I called my database <code>sp-node-article</code>. You can call yours what you like.</p> \n<h2 id=\"initializetheapplication\">Initialize the Application</h2> \n<p>With everything set up correctly, the first thing we need to do is initialize our new project. To do this, create a folder named <code>demo-node-app</code>, enter that directory and type the following in a terminal:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npm init -y\n</code></pre> \n<p>This will create and auto-populate a <code>package.json</code> file in the project root. We can use this file to specify our dependencies and to create various <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/guide-to-npm-as-a-build-tool/\">npm scripts</a>, which will aid our development workflow.</p> \n<h3 id=\"installexpress\">Install Express</h3> \n<p>Express is a lightweight web application framework for Node.js, which provides us with a robust set of features for writing web apps. These features include such things as route handling, template engine integration and a middleware framework, which allows us to perform additional tasks on request and response objects. There’s nothing you can do in Express that you couldn’t do in plain Node.js, but using Express means we don’t have to re-invent the wheel and it reduces boilerplate.</p> \n<p>So let’s install <a href=\"http://expressjs.com/\">Express</a>. To do this, run the following in your terminal:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npm install express\n</code></pre> \n<p>This will see Express added to the <code>dependencies</code> section of the <code>package.json</code> file. This signals to anyone else running our code that Express is a package our app needs to function properly.</p> \n<h3 id=\"installnodemon\">Install nodemon</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/remy/nodemon\">nodemon</a> is a convenience tool. It will watch the files in the directory it was started in, and if it detects any changes, it will automatically restart your Node application (meaning you don’t have to). In contrast to Express, nodemon is not something the app requires to function properly (it just aids us with development), so install it using:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npm install --save-dev nodemon\n</code></pre> \n<p>This will add nodemon to the <code>dev-dependencies</code> section of the <code>package.json</code> file.</p> \n<h3 id=\"createsomeinitialfiles\">Create Some Initial Files</h3> \n<p>We’re almost through with the setup. All we need to do now is create a couple of initial files before kicking off the app.</p> \n<p>In the <code>demo-node-app</code> folder create an <code>app.js</code> file and a <code>start.js</code> file. Also create a <code>routes</code> folder, with an <code>index.js</code> file inside. After you’re done, things should look like this:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">.\n├── app.js\n├── node_modules\n│   └── ...\n├── package.json\n├── package-lock.json\n├── routes\n│   └── index.js\n└── start.js\n</code></pre> \n<p>Now, let’s add some code to those files.</p> \n<p>In <code>app.js</code>:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">const express = require('express');\nconst routes = require('./routes/index');\n\nconst app = express();\napp.use('/', routes);\n\nmodule.exports = app;\n</code></pre> \n<p>Here, we’re importing both the <code>express</code> module and (the export value of) our routes file into the application. The <code>require</code> function we’re using to do this is a built-in Node function which imports an object from another file or module. If you’d like a refresher on importing and exporting modules, read <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/understanding-module-exports-exports-node-js/\">Understanding module.exports and exports in Node.js</a>.</p> \n<p>After that, we’re creating a new Express app using the <a href=\"http://expressjs.com/en/api.html#express\">express</a> function and assigning it to an <code>app</code> variable. We then tell the app that, whenever it receives a request from forward slash anything, it should use the routes file.</p> \n<p>Finally, we export our app variable so that it can be imported and used in other files.</p> \n<p>In <code>start.js</code>:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">const app = require('./app');\n\nconst server = app.listen(3000, () =&gt; {\n  console.log(`Express is running on port ${server.address().port}`);\n});\n</code></pre> \n<p>Here we’re importing the Express app we created in <code>app.js</code>. (Note that we can leave the <code>.js</code> off the file name in the <code>require</code> statement.) We then tell our app to listen on port 3000 for incoming connections and output a message to the terminal to indicate that the server is running.</p> \n<p>And in <code>routes/index.js</code>:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">const express = require('express');\n\nconst router = express.Router();\n\nrouter.get('/', (req, res) =&gt; {\n  res.send('It works!');\n});\n\nmodule.exports = router;\n</code></pre> \n<p>Here, we’re importing Express into our routes file and then grabbing the router from it. We then use the router to respond to any requests to the root URL (in this case <code>http://localhost:3000</code>) with an “It works!” message.</p> \n<h3 id=\"kickofftheapp\">Kick off the App</h3> \n<p>Finally, let’s add an npm script to make nodemon start watching our app. Change the <code>scripts</code> section of the <code>package.json</code> file to look like this:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">\"scripts\": {\n  \"watch\": \"nodemon ./start.js\"\n},\n</code></pre> \n<p>The <code>scripts</code> property of the <code>package.json</code> file is extremely useful, as it lets you specify arbitrary scripts to run in different scenarios. This means that you don’t have to repeatedly type out long-winded commands with a difficult-to-remember syntax. If you’d like to find out more about what npm scripts can do, read <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/guide-to-npm-as-a-build-tool/\">Give Grunt the Boot! A Guide to Using npm as a Build Tool</a>.</p> \n<p>Now, type <code>npm run watch</code> from the terminal and visit <a href=\"http://localhost:3000\">http://localhost:3000</a>.</p> \n<p>You should see “It works!”</p> \n<p> Continue reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/build-simple-beginner-app-node-bootstrap-mongodb/?utm_source=rss\">Build a Simple Beginner App with Node, Bootstrap and MongoDB</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=UlJTL7bTeWM:DbWnhCOQoM0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=UlJTL7bTeWM:DbWnhCOQoM0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=UlJTL7bTeWM:DbWnhCOQoM0:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=UlJTL7bTeWM:DbWnhCOQoM0:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/UlJTL7bTeWM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Feb 2020 23:00:15 +0000","feedId":6128,"bgimg":"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/1582112966app-development.png","linkMd5":"14015955b8f2193a3f3f7e8d24180b7a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn94@2020_4/2020/08/24/22-51-27-276_f3c03953892c5cbc.webp","destWidth":600,"destHeight":339,"sourceBytes":7046,"destBytes":7046,"author":"James Hibbard","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/1582112966app-development.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn94@2020_4/2020/08/24/22-51-27-276_f3c03953892c5cbc.webp","https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/1579778337MongoDB-Compass-localhost27017_001.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn8@2020_6/2020/08/24/22-51-43-626_df0db69fd37a2270.webp","https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/1579781817MongoDB-Compass-ds211709.mlab_.com11709_002.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn68@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-46-948_e7ac30d546b846df.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn15@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-39-311_6409ebad5acff93a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn3@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-47-113_bf83e999bebef320.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=UlJTL7bTeWM:DbWnhCOQoM0:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn27@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-41-972_c140ab77d39d9d53.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/UlJTL7bTeWM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn66@2020_6/2020/08/24/22-51-36-412_cb7506d5255e495f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598309483307},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","title":"How to Properly Organize Files in Your Codebase &#038; Avoid Mayhem","link":"https://www.sitepoint.com/?p=175064","description":"<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/organize-project-files/?utm_source=rss\" title=\"How to Properly Organize Files in Your Codebase &amp; Avoid Mayhem\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/1582120005organize-files.png\" alt=\"How to Properly Organize Files on a Project and Avoid Mayhem\" srcset=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/1582120005organize-files-300x163.png 300w, https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/1582120005organize-files.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /> </a> \n<p><strong>The main library, data, UI, docs and wiki, tests, legacy and third-party components … How do we keep track and maintain order within all of this?</strong> Organizing the files in your codebase can become a daunting task.</p> \n<p>Relax — we’ve got this!

But let’s think about the other ways you could structure your project, and establish some basic rules to name files, address project documentation, and to some degree organize an effective workflow that would stand the test of time.</p> \n<h2 id=\"makingsenseofthings\">Making Sense of Things</h2> \n<p>We’ll establish a “baseline” for organizing files in a project — a logic that will serve us for a number of situations within the scope of software development.</p> \n<p>As with our rules for <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/committing-changes-right-way/\">committing changes to your codebase the right way</a>, none of this is carved in stone, and for what it’s worth, you and your team might come up with different guidelines. In any case, <em>consistency is the name of the game</em>. Be sure you understand (and discuss or dispute) what the rules are, and follow them once you’ve reached a consensus.</p> \n<h3 id=\"themandatoryset\">The Mandatory Set</h3> \n<p>This is a reference list of files that nearly every software project should have:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>README</strong>: this is what GitHub renders for you right under the sourcetree, and it can go <em>a long way</em> to explaining what the project is about, how files are organized, and where to find further information.</li> \n <li><strong>CHANGELOG</strong>: to list what’s new, modified or discontinued on every version or revision — normally in a reverse chronological order for convenience (last changes first).</li> \n <li><strong>COPYING LICENSE</strong>: a file containing the full text of the license covering the software, including some additional copyright information, if necessary (such as third-party licenses).</li> \n <li><strong>.gitignore</strong>: assuming you use <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/\">Git</a> (you most probably do), this will also be a must to tell what files not to sync with the repository. (See <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/jump-start-git/read/2/jyzj6fb9?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=articles\">Jump Start Git’s primer on .gitignore</a> and the <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore\">documentation</a> for more info, and have a look at <a href=\"https://github.com/github/gitignore\">a collection of useful .gitignore templates</a> for some ideas.)</li> \n</ul> \n<h4 id=\"supportingactors\">Supporting Actors</h4> \n<p> Continue reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/organize-project-files/?utm_source=rss\">How to Properly Organize Files in Your Codebase &amp; Avoid Mayhem</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=R3d0zmDsNJ8:vjxPqV8DgRg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=R3d0zmDsNJ8:vjxPqV8DgRg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=R3d0zmDsNJ8:vjxPqV8DgRg:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=R3d0zmDsNJ8:vjxPqV8DgRg:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/R3d0zmDsNJ8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 19 Feb 2020 23:00:25 +0000","feedId":6128,"bgimg":"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/1582120005organize-files.png","linkMd5":"b0867dbb1319be90d5f37b9051dcdfd6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn89@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-27-236_f512dafd05982c26.webp","destWidth":600,"destHeight":326,"sourceBytes":5564,"destBytes":5564,"author":"Lucero del Alba","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/1582120005organize-files.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn89@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-27-236_f512dafd05982c26.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn15@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-39-311_6409ebad5acff93a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn3@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-47-113_bf83e999bebef320.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=R3d0zmDsNJ8:vjxPqV8DgRg:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn44@2020_6/2020/08/24/22-51-38-942_1e325533774a419d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/R3d0zmDsNJ8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn81@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-37-434_ebd4f6b99597ec76.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598309483300},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","title":"Interested in Learning React?

This review couldn’t possibly encompass the whole spectrum of third-party APIs that you can integrate into your website, but hopefully you’ll still find the coverage enlightening enough.</p> \n<p><em>We’ll use the words “headless”, “detached”, and “serverless” a lot in this article. If you haven’t already, check out <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/learn-jamstack/\">our introduction to the Jamstack</a>, which covers all the basics.</em></p> \n<h2 id=\"hostingmostlyforfree\">Hosting (Mostly for Free)</h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://jamstack.org/\"><img src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1595294384Jamstack_Logo_Original.png\" /></a></p> \n<p><small><em>Provided: Netlify</em></small></p> \n<p>Hosting a Jamstack site usually involves automated deployment pipelines. For example, you might have a repository in GitHub which, on every push, automatically triggers an online deployment (via <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook\">webhooks</a>), running the necessary <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_build_automation_software\">build tools</a> (such as Jekyll) and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_testing\">regression tests</a> (via Travis CI).</p> \n<p>Sound difficult? It can be a surprisingly simple process!</p> \n<p>Most of the services here include these goodies out of the box:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>SSD drives</li> \n <li>CDN deployments</li> \n <li>free SSL (including for custom domains)</li> \n <li>command line deployments and rollbacks</li> \n</ul> \n<p><em>Note: look out for another article in this series, coming soon, covering how to use these services.</em></p> \n<h3 id=\"services\">Services</h3> \n<h4 id=\"googlefirebaseandawsamplify\">Google Firebase and AWS Amplify</h4> \n<p><a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/products/hosting\"><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Firebase_Logo.svg/200px-Firebase_Logo.svg.png\" align=\"right\" /></a></p> \n<p>\n <!-- ![The Firebase logo](firebase-logo.png)\n\n<small><a href=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Firebase_Logo.svg/200px-Firebase_Logo.svg.png\">Image source</a> --></p> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/products/hosting\">Firebase Hosting</a></strong> is Google’s take on a hosting service that’s easy to understand and implement, and it’s free to use (<a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/pricing\">limits apply</a>). Firebase’s backbone actually lies on top of the <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/\">Google Cloud Platform</a> (GCP), and you can in fact access and tweak some Firebase deployments through the GCP console. But by implementing something of an “gateway” (Firebase) that transparently handles GCP resources for us, Google gave developers a brand new and highly improved user experience (UX) … and the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/Firebase\">Firebase’s YouTube channel</a> is just brilliant! 👏</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/\"><img src=\"https://docs.amplify.aws/assets/logo-dark.svg\" align=\"right\" /></a></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/\">AWS Amplify</a> is also an effort to reduce the complexities of <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/\">Amazon Web Services</a> (AWS) for web and mobile deployment that doesn’t quite offer free hosting but 12 months of free use for new accounts for its <strong><a href=\"https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/storage/getting-started/q/platform/js\">Storage with Amplify</a></strong> as part of the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/free/\">AWS Free Tier</a>.</p> \n<p>Google really made a brilliant move with the Firebase family of products by “detaching” them from the GCP, but Amazon went half-way with AWS Amplify. It sure is a dramatic improvement from the regular AWS workflow, especially for novice users, and its <a href=\"https://docs.amplify.aws/\">documentation hub</a> is superb and way more down-to-earth than the way Amazon usually documents services. But Amplify is still accessed from the same old <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/console/\">(horrifically bloated) console</a>. You still need a credit card to just open an account, deployments are still region-specific (no built-in CDN, seriously?), and the workflow isn’t as straightforward when compared to that of Firebase or Netlify.</p> \n<h4 id=\"githubpagesandgitlabpages\">GitHub Pages and GitLab Pages</h4> \n<p><a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\"><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Octicons-logo-github.svg/200px-Octicons-logo-github.svg.png\" align=\"right\" /></a></p> \n<p>Both hosting services for Git repositories also have a built-in service to host static pages right out of your codebases, 100% free: <a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\">GitHub Pages</a> and <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/stages-devops-lifecycle/pages/\">GitLab Pages</a>.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/stages-devops-lifecycle/pages/\"><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/GitLab_logo.svg/200px-GitLab_logo.svg.png\" align=\"right\" /></a></p> \n<p>In a future article we’ll cover how to use these services, but in the meantime make sure to check out these easy-to-follow guides:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://guides.github.com/features/pages/\">Getting Started with GitHub Pages</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2016/04/07/gitlab-pages-setup/\">Hosting on GitLab.com with GitLab Pages</a></li> \n</ul> \n<h4 id=\"netlifyandheroku\">Netlify and Heroku</h4> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/\"><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Netlify_logo.svg/200px-Netlify_logo.svg.png\" align=\"right\" /></a></p> \n<p>In a very short period of time, <strong><a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/\">Netlify</a></strong> not only coined the <em>Jamstack</em> term but also positioned itself as the place to go for all things static. While you could certainly accomplish more with an elaborated AWS pipeline, the simplicity and unparalleled ease of use that Netlify offers is unbeatable. Want to host a static site? Just <a href=\"https://app.netlify.com/drop\">drop it here</a> and it’s online. Want automatic updates? <a href=\"https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/get-started/\">Link a repo</a> and just push a commit.

So if you aren’t yet quite ready to go static, this might be a good way to test your dynamic sites online for free.</p> \n<h4 id=\"othersservices\">Other Services</h4> \n<p><a href=\"https://workers.cloudflare.com/\"><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/37/Cloudflare-logo-vector.svg/200px-Cloudflare-logo-vector.svg.png\" align=\"right\" /></a></p> \n<p>With 194 data centers as of 2020, <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/\">Cloudflare</a> is — <a href=\"https://www.dnsperf.com/dns-providers-list/\">by many metrics</a> — the company that offers the lowest latency for their DNS and CDN services around the world.

But as with many things AWS, it’s difficult to implement and <em>very hard</em> to debug (see <a href=\"https://read.acloud.guru/why-amazon-dynamodb-isnt-for-everyone-and-how-to-decide-when-it-s-for-you-aefc52ea9476\">Why Amazon DynamoDB isn’t for everyone</a>, by Forrest Brazeal). In all fairness to Amazon, they also built <strong><a href=\"https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/datastore/getting-started/q/platform/js\">DataStore</a></strong> into AWS Amplify (with <a href=\"https://graphql.org/\">GraphQL</a> and REST API support) with a more straightforward approach, in line with the simplicity of the rest of Amplify’s products.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore\"><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/Cloud-Firestore-Logo.svg/200px-Cloud-Firestore-Logo.svg.png\" align=\"right\" /></a></p> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore\">Google Firestore</a></strong> made real-time NoSQL databases — a fairly complex topic in and of itself — as simple as they can be, with pretty much all the capabilities DynamoDB has. It’s <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore\">very well documented</a> (with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl-K7zZEsYLluG5MCVEzXAQ7ACZBCuZgZ\">introductory clips</a> that are fun to watch). And React and Vue.js have wrappers around Firestore with <a href=\"http://react-redux-firebase.com/\">react-redux-firebase</a> and <a href=\"https://vuefire.vuejs.org/vuexfire/\">Vuexfire</a>, respectively.</p> \n<p>Cloudflare sure knows how to take performance to the very extreme, and <strong><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/workers-kv/\">Workers KV</a></strong>, a serverless key-value storage for applications, is a fine example of what a well engineered product looks like. The premise of Workers KV is that you can access a <em>key</em> as if it were a local file within your app, and the content will be the <em>value</em> stored for that key. That’s it — no API to implement, no extra coding. And because of the unbeatable performance of the Cloudflare CDN, this approach can actually be <em>faster</em> than querying a NoSQL database. And as simple as it is, it scales seamlessly to millions of requests. 👏</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://fauna.com/\"><img src=\"https://fauna.com/assets/img/Fauna-logo-white.png\" align=\"right\" /></a></p> \n<p>And finally, there’s <strong><a href=\"https://fauna.com/\">FaunaDB</a></strong>, a startup that crafted a solution with native GraphQL and a <a href=\"https://fauna.com/pricing\">simple pricing</a> (including a free plan) that can be implemented in minutes.</p> \n<h2 id=\"managingcontentheadlesscms\">Managing Content: Headless CMS</h2> \n<p>In the “monolithic” way of doing things, whenever we used a given <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system\">content management system</a> — such as WordPress, Django, or Joomla! — it meant that we <em>also</em> needed to use the front-end engine that came attached to it, as back and front end were “coupled” components of a single piece of software (see <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/learn-jamstack/\">our introduction to the Jamstack</a> for more info about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_(computer_programming)\">tightly vs loosely coupled</a> sites).</p> \n<p>Enter the headless CMS — a back end only without a front end. Since a headless CMS would normally expose an API or generate static content in the way of Markdown or HTML files, the front end can be <em>anywhere</em> really. In fact, multiple and simultaneous interfaces can be created for web sites, mobile apps, and Internet of Things (IoT) apps.</p> \n<p>\n <center></center></p> \n<p><script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://ssl.gstatic.com/trends_nrtr/2213_RC01/embed_loader.js\"></script><br /> <script type=\"text/javascript\"> trends.embed.renderExploreWidget(\"TIMESERIES\", {\"comparisonItem\":[{\"keyword\":\"headless cms\",\"geo\":\"\",\"time\":\"today 5-y\"}],\"category\":0,\"property\":\"\"}, {\"exploreQuery\":\"date=today%205-y&amp;q=headless%20cms\",\"guestPath\":\"https://trends.google.com:443/trends/embed/\"}); </script></p> \n<h3 id=\"productsandservices\">Products and Services</h3> \n<p>There are a number of headless CMSs, both as software you can download and configure where you do the deployments yourself, or offered in the software-as-a-service (SaaS) model where everything is taken care of for you.</p> \n<p>Some features you can expect to find:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization\">localization (l10n) and internationalization (i18n)</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices\">microservices</a> architecture with a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer\">RESTful API</a></li> \n <li>editor interface</li> \n <li>customization</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Versioning_file_system\">versioning</a>*</li> \n</ul> \n<p>* <em>Since some headless CMS will integrate smoothly with your git repo, the versioning capability can actually be a remarkable improvement over a regular CMS.</em></p> \n<h4 id=\"selfhostedheadlesscms\">Self-hosted Headless CMS</h4> \n<p><a href=\"https://ghost.org/\"><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Ghost-Logo.svg/200px-Ghost-Logo.svg.png\" align=\"right\" /></a></p> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://ghost.org/\">Ghost</a></strong>, <em>“the #1 open source headless Node.js CMS”</em>, is certainly the one with <a href=\"https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost\">the most stars on GitHub</a>.

All of them offer free plans.</p> \n<h3 id=\"externalapiformprocessingasaservicefpaas\">External API: Form Processing as a Service (FPaaS)</h3> \n<p>Sometimes a builder won’t cut it, as you need more flexibility to present information and fields, or to fully integrate the look and feel of the form with the rest of your website. For this you will need to integrate an API.</p> \n<p>The way these services work is surprisingly easy: you specify a URL for submission that will do the processing for you. At most you’ll have to set a few things up but most probably won’t need to do any extra coding.</p> \n<p>There are a number of providers offering free plans, such as <strong><a href=\"https://www.form.io/\">Form.IO</a></strong>, <strong><a href=\"https://formcarry.com/\">Formcarry</a></strong>, <strong><a href=\"https://formspark.io/\">Formspark</a></strong>, and <strong><a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/products/forms/\">Netlify Forms</a></strong>.

Instead, you can implement a micro-service in your language of choice (oftentimes JavaScript, Python, or Go), encapsulate that logic into functions, and offer them through a RESTful API.</p> \n<p>As with pretty much everything else in this list, you won’t be paying anything for a function that’s not being actively used, so no worries for just leaving it sitting there (but beware that spikes in traffic might also trigger extra billing).</p> \n<h3 id=\"providers\">Providers</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/\"><img src=\"https://d1.awsstatic.com/Digital%20Marketing/House/PAC/2up/PAC-Q4_House-Ads_Lambda_2up.62dc7e19b7b2e0a2c06821594c31f1ce00a6bdda.png\" align=\"right\" /></a></p> \n<p>While the implementation details for <strong><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/\">AWS Lambda</a></strong>, <strong><a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/services/functions/\">Azure Functions</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/functions\">Google Cloud Functions</a></strong> may differ, they all work in pretty much the same fashion and you’ll need a degree of familiarity with AWS, Azure or GCP. AWS Lambda has the richest language support of them all (and also <strong><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/\">Amazon API Gateway</a></strong> to help you wrap your functions into a maintainable API with monitoring tools), while Azure — not surprisingly — has the best support for .NET Framework and .NET Core (with <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-versions\">different versions supporting different runtimes</a> and even <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-reference-node#typescript\">TypeScript transpiled to JavaScript</a>).

An SSR will bridge that gap by querying your database and generating static output out of it (for example, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown\">Markdown</a> pages), and with some settings to set your template, you’ll be all set.</p> \n<p>The listing here is <em>tiny</em> compared to the ever increasing list of SSRs. Have a look at <a href=\"https://www.staticgen.com/\">StaticGen</a> for more info.</p> \n<h3 id=\"mainproducts\">Main Products</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/\"><img src=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/Gatsby-Logo.svg\" width=\"200\" align=\"right\" /></a></p> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/\">GatsbyJS</a></strong> is powered by React.js and webpack, meaning that it can generate progressive web apps (aka PWAs, websites that look and feel like an apps). It also supports GraphQL (see <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/how-it-works/write-modern-apps/\">Write Apps with Better Building Blocks</a>) and it has <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/how-it-works/data-from-anywhere/\">+1,000 plugins to get data from anywhere</a> (WordPress, Drupal, Contentful, GraphCMS, DatoCMS, and many more). See <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/features/jamstack/gatsby-vs-jekyll-vs-hugo/\">how GatsbyJS says it compares to its main competitors, Hugo and Jekyll</a>.</p> \n<p>All of this flexibility comes at a cost, as setting and customizing GatsbyJS can be a time-consuming process, and if you don’t have a decent understanding of React — and therefore JavaScript — you won’t be able to make much of it. That’s where <strong><a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/\">Gatsby Cloud</a></strong> comes in, offering support to build and maintain Gatsby sites <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/pricing/\">for free or for a fee</a>, where you could automate your fast builds, access to previews, generate daily edits, and fire deployments with ease to Netlify, Cloudflare, AWS CloudFront or Akamai.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://gohugo.io/\"><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Logo_of_Hugo_the_static_website_generator.svg/200px-Logo_of_Hugo_the_static_website_generator.svg.png\" align=\"right\" /></a></p> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://gohugo.io/\">Hugo</a></strong> claims to be <em>“the world’s fastest framework for building websites”</em>, and it sure can generate massive sites in milliseconds. With built-in templates (literally <a href=\"https://themes.gohugo.io/\">hundreds of them available</a>) and native support for internationalization (i18n), it’s also one of the most popular SSGs. Hugo is a <a href=\"https://golang.org/\">Go app</a>, and while Go isn’t hard to set and learn, you’ll definitely need to be checking the documentation often if you aren’t familiar with it.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://jekyllrb.com/\"><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/Jekyll_%28software%29_Logo.png\" width=\"200\" align=\"right\" /></a></p> \n<p>Unlike GatsbyJS, configuring and deploying <strong><a href=\"https://jekyllrb.com/\">Jekyll</a></strong> is a rather straightforward process. Furthermore, Jekyll is the only SSR supported by <a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\">GitHub Pages</a> (Tom Preston-Werner, creator of Jekyll, is also a co-founder of GitHub), and can smoothly deploy static sites for free right out of your GitHub repos! Jekyll uses Shopify’s <a href=\"https://shopify.github.io/liquid/\">Liquid template language</a>, which is also easy to learn. The downsides? As a <a href=\"https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/\">Ruby app</a>, Jekyll can be hard to set on a Windows environment, and optimizations such as minimizing JavaScript code and image preloading aren’t included by default. In fact, Jekyll doesn’t even aim at generating a PWA but just purely static sites — which might still be fine depending on what you need.</p> \n<h4 id=\"comparison-2\">Comparison</h4> \n<table> \n <thead> \n  <tr> \n   <th>Product</th> \n   <th style=\"text-align:center;\">Language</th> \n   <th style=\"text-align:center;\">Templating</th> \n   <th style=\"text-align:center;\">Setting</th> \n   <th>GitHub stars</th> \n  </tr> \n </thead> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td><a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/\">GatsbyJS</a></td> \n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\">JavaScript</td> \n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\">React.js</td> \n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\">difficult</td> \n   <td><iframe src=\"https://ghbtns.com/github-btn.html?user=gatsbyjs&amp;repo=gatsby&amp;type=star&amp;count=true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"0\" width=\"150\" height=\"20\" title=\"GitHub\"></iframe></td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><a href=\"https://gohugo.io/\">Hugo</a></td> \n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\">Go</td> \n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\">Go (<a href=\"https://themes.gohugo.io/\">library</a>)</td> \n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\">intermediate</td> \n   <td><iframe src=\"https://ghbtns.com/github-btn.html?user=gohugoio&amp;repo=hugo&amp;type=star&amp;count=true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"0\" width=\"150\" height=\"20\" title=\"GitHub\"></iframe></td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><a href=\"https://jekyllrb.com/\">Jekyll</a></td> \n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\">Ruby</td> \n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"https://shopify.github.io/liquid/\">Liquid</a></td> \n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\">easy</td> \n   <td><iframe src=\"https://ghbtns.com/github-btn.html?user=jekyll&amp;repo=jekyll&amp;type=star&amp;count=true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"0\" width=\"150\" height=\"20\" title=\"GitHub\"></iframe></td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<h3 id=\"others\">Others</h3> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://wp2static.com/\">WP2Static</a></strong> is an SSR designed specifically for WordPress (WP).

internet age, technological innovation has largely been driven by a community of software engineers, web developers, and hardware hackers. Until recently, acclaimed startup accelerator Y Combinator only accepted founding teams with technical backgrounds. Furthermore, the most valuable companies of today are tech-enabled, so there’s been a focus on tech talent for future-proofing economies. Coding education provider Lambda School has raised close to $50M to close this skills gap and there are <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/library/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=articles\">many other courses</a> teaching the next generation to code. </p> \n<p>But what if coding was no longer vital to success in tech? Enter the world of no-code development platforms (NCDPs). </p> \n<p>Over the past couple of years, the rise of the no-code movement has started to change the landscape of tech. Ironically, Lamdba School itself is a product of the no-code movement, building its MVP (that has served 3,000 students) using a combination of tools such as Typeform, Airtable, and Retool. The no-code movement has also been called low code or visual development. The makers of no-code platforms are still discussing the best label for the movement but for now, I will stick with ‘no-code’. </p> \n<p>John Everhard summarizes no-code software <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/johneverhard/2019/01/15/what-really-is-low-codeno-code-development/#26adb5332a8e\">on Forbes</a> as a visual integrated development environment (IDE). “Within this environment, users (aka the citizen developer) drag-and-drop application components, connect them together and create a mobile or web app. Using this software, staff can design and build powerful applications that can scale for any organization—without writing any code.” All in all, users don’t need to understand code to be able to create an app and therein lies its power. </p> \n<h2 id=\"benefitsofnocode\">Benefits of No-Code</h2> \n<p>When we were in the thick of product development for <a href=\"https://www.cloudpeeps.com/\">CloudPeeps</a>, I remember how frustrating it was for our developers (and me!) when I needed to make any updates to our marketing pages or funnels. While I can happily edit HTML, having a custom-built platform meant deploying changes was limited to the devs. Prioritizing feature development alongside bug fixes and tweaks was a challenge. Progress was slow. We tried numerous A/B testing tools and moving some pages to popular CMSs, but the user experience started to suffer. While tools like Webflow existed then, they weren’t touted as mainstream solutions so we lacked the awareness to implement them. </p> \n<p>Since then, the rise of no-code tools has changed the game forever – not only for tasks like marketing pages but also for full-stack apps, which people can now build end-to-end. In 2014, if you wanted to build a marketplace, you had to develop it from scratch. After that, offerings like Sharetribe came along with standard marketplace software in a box with an ongoing price tag. Now, you can build whatever marketplace set-up you like using no-code tools. </p> \n<p>Evidently, saving time and money are two crucial benefits of no-code. Co-founder of Tiny product studio and indie investment fund Andrew Wilkinson recently <a href=\"https://twitter.com/awilkinson/status/1214285271090388994?s=11\">tweeted</a>: “I used to spend $25k-$100k building an app over 3-6 months. It was frustrating, expensive, and slow. Then I started using NoCode tools like Webflow, Bubble, Zapier, and Airtable. Suddenly I was able to build my app idea in days instead of months, at a fraction of the cost. Craziest of all, I could tweak and maintain it myself instead of hiring expensive devs.”. He likens ‘native-code’ to being a bulldozer: great to use when you need to build something sizeable and commercial grade. He compares ‘no-code’ to a pickup truck: powerful enough to help you get most simple and intermediate projects done. </p> \n<h2 id=\"whynow\">Why Now?</h2> \n<p>The tech industry has been increasingly criticized over the past decade for its lack of diversity and inclusion. Silicon Valley has bred a generation of founders who look like each other, talk like each other, and solve similar problems – and as these people gather further wealth through exits and investments, the cycle of sameness repeats. Teaching people to code and funding different founders is creating slow change, but the no-code movement has the potential to exponentially change the face of tech. If you no longer need access to engineers or capital to launch a product, anyone can have a crack at their idea. Perhaps it is the demand for the democratization of tech that has catapulted the no-code movement into the now. </p> \n<p> Continue reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/the-rise-of-the-no-code-movement/?utm_source=rss\">The Rise of the No-Code Movement</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=DXD7lVyKxHU:yOhbdE28NVY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=DXD7lVyKxHU:yOhbdE28NVY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=DXD7lVyKxHU:yOhbdE28NVY:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=DXD7lVyKxHU:yOhbdE28NVY:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/DXD7lVyKxHU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 16 Mar 2020 23:00:50 +0000","feedId":6128,"bgimg":"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584405762Isometric-City-Building-Vector-Illustration.jpg","linkMd5":"6373e8ca6c646cf42a69485f7ea2066c","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn18@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-24-738_e8c3fb0fd81a66cc.webp","destWidth":2000,"destHeight":1333,"sourceBytes":62842,"destBytes":62842,"author":"Kate Kendall","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584405762Isometric-City-Building-Vector-Illustration.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn18@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-24-738_e8c3fb0fd81a66cc.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn15@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-39-311_6409ebad5acff93a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn3@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-47-113_bf83e999bebef320.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=DXD7lVyKxHU:yOhbdE28NVY:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn31@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-46-730_9db146dc50decd6b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/DXD7lVyKxHU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn94@2020_4/2020/08/24/22-51-41-405_4a89e1ef5fa74e8c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598309483290},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","title":"Quick Tip: Configuring NGINX and SSL with Node.js","link":"http://www.sitepoint.com/?p=90221","description":"<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/configuring-nginx-ssl-node-js/?utm_source=rss\" title=\"Quick Tip: Configuring NGINX and SSL with Node.js\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/1583359805nginx-ssl.png\" alt=\"Quick Tip: Configuring NGINX and SSL with Node.js\" srcset=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/1583359805nginx-ssl-300x170.png 300w, https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/1583359805nginx-ssl.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /> </a> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.nginx.com/\">NGINX</a> is a high-performance HTTP server as well as a <a href=\"https://medium.com/intrinsic/why-should-i-use-a-reverse-proxy-if-node-js-is-production-ready-5a079408b2ca\">reverse proxy</a>. Unlike traditional servers, NGINX follows an event-driven, asynchronous architecture. As a result, the memory footprint is low and performance is high. If you’re running a Node.js-based web app, you should seriously consider using NGINX as a reverse proxy.</strong></p> \n<p>NGINX can be very efficient in serving static assets. For all other requests, it will talk to your Node.js back end and send the response to the client. In this tutorial, we’ll discuss how to configure NGINX to work with Node.js. We’ll also see how to setup SSL in the NGINX server.</p> \n<p><em>Note: Node also has a built-in HTTPS module and can be configured to read the necessary certificate files without the need for a reverse proxy. You can find out more about this in our article <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/how-to-use-ssltls-with-node-js/\">How to Use SSL/TLS with Node.js</a>.</em></p> \n<h2 id=\"installingnginx\">Installing NGINX</h2> \n<p>Assuming you already have Node.js installed on your machine (if not, check <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/quick-tip-multiple-versions-node-nvm/\">here</a>), let’s see how to install NGINX.</p> \n<h3 id=\"installationonlinux\">Installation on Linux</h3> \n<p>If you’re running Ubuntu, you can use the following command to install NGINX:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">sudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nginx\n</code></pre> \n<p>If you’re running a Linux distro other than Ubuntu, check out <a href=\"https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/installing-nginx/installing-nginx-open-source/#prebuilt\">the NGINX installation docs</a> for more information.</p> \n<p>NGINX will start automatically once it’s installed.</p> \n<h3 id=\"installationonmacos\">Installation on macOS</h3> \n<p>If you’re on macOS, you can use <a href=\"http://brew.sh/\">Homebrew</a> to install NGINX easily. The steps are as following:</p> \n<ul> \n <li> <p>Homebrew needs the directory <code>/usr/local</code> to be <code>chown</code>’d to your username.

If you’re wondering what the fuss is all about, you’ve come to the right place!</strong></p> \n<p>In this article, I hope to give you an overview of what Deno is. We’ll take a look at its key features, and ask why you might want to start learning this new tool.</p> \n<h2 id=\"whatisdeno\">What is Deno?</h2> \n<p>So what is it Deno, and why was it created? Deno is a JavaScript and TypeScript runtime, meaning you can write programs in either language and execute them from the command line. Unlike JavaScript run within a browser, Deno programs can access resources on the host computer, such as the filesystem and environment variables.</p> \n<p>If you’re aware of Node.js, and you’re thinking that Deno sounds pretty similar, you’d be right. Deno is the brainchild of Node’s creator, Ryan Dahl, who created Deno to address what he sees as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3BM9TB-8yA\">the design flaws in Node</a>. The aims of the project are to provide a scripting environment that is secure by default, that treats TypeScript as a first-class language, and that is as browser-compatible as possible (where practical).</p> \n<h2 id=\"securityfeatures\">Security Features</h2> \n<p>Deno is designed to be secure out of the box. All code is executed in a secure sandbox by default, which means you need to give explicit permission to allow a program to access the network or the filesystem.</p> \n<p>Programs can be granted permissions with the following command-line flags:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>-A, –allow-all</strong>: allow all permissions (disables all security).</li> \n <li><strong>–allow-env</strong>: allow getting and setting of environment variables.</li> \n <li><strong>–allow-hrtime</strong>: allow high resolution time measurement (can be used in timing attacks and fingerprinting).</li> \n <li><strong>–allow-net=\\\n   <allow -net=\"\"></allow></strong>: allow network access. Optionally takes a comma-separated whitelist of domains.</li> \n <li><strong>–allow-plugin</strong>: allow loading plugins (unstable feature).</li> \n <li><strong>–allow-read=\\\n   <allow -read=\"\"></allow></strong>: allow file system read access. Optionally takes a comma-separated whitelist of directories or files.</li> \n <li><strong>–allow-run</strong>: allow running subprocesses.</li> \n <li><strong>–allow-write=\\\n   <allow -write=\"\"></allow></strong>: allow file system write access. Optionally takes a comma-separated whitelist of directories or files.</li> \n</ul> \n<h2 id=\"firstclasstypescriptsupport\">First-class TypeScript Support</h2> \n<p>As I mentioned earlier, Deno can execute both JavaScript <em>and</em> TypeScript. What’s more, Deno supports TypeScript as a first-class language. This means it can load and run your TypeScript code without any additional build step. There’s no need to set up additional tooling to transpile your code into JavaScript first.</p> \n<p>Of course, since TypeScript is a superset of modern JavaScript, you can also write your code in good old JS if you want to! Deno supports some great, developer-friendly features such as ES Module imports</p> \n<h2 id=\"usingexternalcode\">Using External Code</h2> \n<p>As Ryan mentioned in his talk, one of his goals for Deno was to avoid the need for a package manager. Unlike with runtimes/languages such as Node.js and PHP (which use the npm and composer package managers respectively), there’s no package manager for Deno.</p> \n<p>Instead, external packages are imported directly via a URL:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">import { Client } from \"https://deno.land/x/mysql@2.2.0/mod.ts\";\n</code></pre> \n<p>The first time you run your script, Deno will fetch, compile, and cache all the imports so that subsequent starts are lightning fast. Obviously there are times when you may want to force Deno to re-fetch the imports, and you can do this with the <code>cache</code> subcommand:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">deno cache --reload my_module.ts\n</code></pre> \n<p> Continue reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/deno-introduction/?utm_source=rss\">Deno Guide: A Secure JavaScript &amp; TypeScript Runtime</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=kbeByFyya2g:x80Ei3mJkZ0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=kbeByFyya2g:x80Ei3mJkZ0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=kbeByFyya2g:x80Ei3mJkZ0:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=kbeByFyya2g:x80Ei3mJkZ0:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/kbeByFyya2g\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Sun, 05 Jul 2020 08:44:42 +0000","feedId":6128,"bgimg":"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1593954503deno-js-runtime.png","linkMd5":"bef69f4146418789a350a738954ac5ff","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn58@2020_4/2020/08/24/22-51-26-061_42634178d87bb92a.webp","destWidth":600,"destHeight":339,"sourceBytes":13082,"destBytes":13082,"author":"Nilson Jacques","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1593954503deno-js-runtime.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn58@2020_4/2020/08/24/22-51-26-061_42634178d87bb92a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn15@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-39-311_6409ebad5acff93a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn3@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-47-113_bf83e999bebef320.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=kbeByFyya2g:x80Ei3mJkZ0:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn21@2020_4/2020/08/24/22-51-35-205_d0f3407813e91d6f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/kbeByFyya2g":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn71@2020_6/2020/08/24/22-51-46-180_09a7a8b47d50d63d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598309483260},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","title":"13 Best Practices for Building RESTful APIs","link":"https://editor.sitepoint.com/?p=177401","description":"<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/build-restful-apis-best-practices/?utm_source=rss\" title=\"13 Best Practices for Building RESTful APIs\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1597808919build-restful-api.png\" alt=\"13 Best Practices for Building RESTful APIs\" srcset=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1597808919build-restful-api-300x170.png 300w, https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1597808919build-restful-api.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /> </a> \n<p><strong>Facebook, GitHub, Google, and many other giants need a way to serve and consume data. A RESTful API is still one of the best choices in today’s dev landscape to serve and consume data.</strong></p> \n<p>But have you ever considered learning about industry standards? What are the best practices for designing a RESTful API? In theory, anyone can quickly spin up a data API in less than five minutes — whether it be Node.js, Golang, or Python.</p> \n<p>We’ll explore 13 best practices you should consider when building a RESTful API. But first, let’s clarify a RESTful API quickly.</p> \n<h2 id=\"whatisarestfulapi\">What is a RESTful API?</h2> \n<p>A RESTful API needs to meet the following constraints for it to be called a RESTful API.</p> \n<ol> \n <li> <p><strong>Client-server</strong>: A RESTful API follows the client-server model where the server serves data and clients connect to the server to consume data. The interaction between client and server occurs through HTTP(S) requests that transfer the requested data.</p> </li> \n <li> <p><strong>Stateless</strong>: More importantly, a RESTful API should be stateless. Each request is treated as a standalone request. The server should not keep track of any internal state that might influence the result of future requests.</p> </li> \n <li> <p><strong>Uniform interface</strong>: Lastly, uniformity defines how the client and server interact. RESTful APIs define best practices for naming resources but define fixed HTTP operations that allow you to modify/interact with resources. The following HTTP operations can be accessed in RESTful APIs:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>GET request: retrieve a resource</li> \n   <li>POST request: create a resource or send information to the API</li> \n   <li>PUT request: create or replace a resource</li> \n   <li>PATCH request: update an existing resource</li> \n   <li>DELETE request: delete a resource</li> \n  </ul> </li> \n</ol> \n<p>With this deeper understanding of the characteristics of a RESTful API, it’s time to learn more about RESTful API best practices.</p> \n<h2 id=\"bestpracticesfordesigningyourfirstrestfulapi\">Best Practices For Designing Your First RESTful API</h2> \n<p>This article presents you with an actionable list of 13 best practices. Let’s explore!</p> \n<h3 id=\"1usehttpmethodscorrectly\">1. Use HTTP methods correctly</h3> \n<p>We’ve already discussed the possible HTTP methods you can use to modify resources: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.</p> \n<p>Still, many developers tend to abuse GET and POST, or PUT and PATCH. Often, we see developers use a POST request to retrieve data. Furthermore, we see developers use a PUT request which replaces the resource while they only wanted to update a single field for that resource.</p> \n<p>Make sure to use the correct HTTP method as this will add a lot of confusion for developers using your RESTful API. It’s better to stick to the intended guidelines.</p> \n<h3 id=\"2namingconventions\">2. Naming conventions</h3> \n<p>Understanding the RESTful API naming conventions will help you a lot with designing your API in an organized manner. Design a RESTful API according to the resources you serve.</p> \n<p>For example, your API manages authors and books (yes, a classic example). Now, we want to add a new author or access an author with ID <code>3</code>. You could design the following routes to serve this purpose:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>api.com/addNewAuthor</li> \n <li>api.com/getAuthorByID/3</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Imagine an API that hosts many resources that each have many properties. The list of possible endpoints will become endless and not very user-friendly. So we need a more organized and standardized way of designing API endpoints.</p> \n<p>RESTful API best practices describe that an endpoint should start with the resource name, while the HTTP operation describes the action. Now we get:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>POST api.com/authors</li> \n <li>GET api.com/authors/3</li> \n</ul> \n<p>What if we want to access all books author with ID <code>3</code> has ever written? Also for this case, RESTful APIs have a solution:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>GET api.com/authors/3/books</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Lastly, what if you want to delete a book with ID <code>5</code> for an author with ID <code>3</code>. Again, let’s follow the same structured approach to form the following endpoint:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>DELETE api.com/authors/3/books/5</li> \n</ul> \n<p>In short, make use of HTTP operations and the structured way of resource mapping to form a readable and understandable endpoint path. The big advantage of this approach is that every developer understands how RESTful APIs are designed and they can immediately use the API without having to read your documentation on each endpoint.</p> \n<h3 id=\"3usepluralresources\">3. Use plural resources</h3> \n<p>Resources should always use their plural form. Why? Imagine you want to retrieve all authors. Therefore, you would call the following endpoint: <code>GET api.com/authors</code>.</p> \n<p>When you read the request, you can’t tell if the API response will contain only one or all authors. For that reason, API endpoints should use plural resources.</p> \n<h3 id=\"4correctuseofstatuscodes\">4. Correct use of status codes</h3> \n<p>Status codes aren’t here just for fun. They have a clear purpose. A status code notifies the client about the success of its request.</p> \n<p>The most common status code categories include:</p> \n<p> Continue reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/build-restful-apis-best-practices/?utm_source=rss\">13 Best Practices for Building RESTful APIs</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=TUkeqKbp0W8:0BrO2IX59l8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=TUkeqKbp0W8:0BrO2IX59l8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=TUkeqKbp0W8:0BrO2IX59l8:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=TUkeqKbp0W8:0BrO2IX59l8:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/TUkeqKbp0W8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 18 Aug 2020 20:49:16 +0000","feedId":6128,"bgimg":"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1597808919build-restful-api.png","linkMd5":"280829cec3cdbe959522102093fcc96d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn89@2020_3/2020/08/24/22-51-24-701_2db2eca7032bec72.webp","destWidth":600,"destHeight":340,"sourceBytes":10008,"destBytes":10008,"author":"Michiel Mulders","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1597808919build-restful-api.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn89@2020_3/2020/08/24/22-51-24-701_2db2eca7032bec72.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn15@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-39-311_6409ebad5acff93a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn3@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-47-113_bf83e999bebef320.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=TUkeqKbp0W8:0BrO2IX59l8:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn52@2020_6/2020/08/24/22-51-46-269_263634eae7c1327e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/TUkeqKbp0W8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn66@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-37-315_82ed0bd662533647.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598309483245},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","title":"Meet Polypane, a Browser That Makes You Five Times Faster","link":"https://editor.sitepoint.com/?p=176796","description":"<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/polypane-developer-browser/?utm_source=rss\" title=\"Meet Polypane, a Browser That Makes You Five Times Faster\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1596070474polypane.png\" alt=\"How to Develop Websites 5x Faster with Polypane\" srcset=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1596070474polypane-300x170.png 300w, https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1596070474polypane.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /> </a> \n<p><strong>As developers, we like to use tools specifically made to make us as efficient as possible.

We pick our code editor specifically out of dozens available; our keyboard has the perfect clickiness for our fingers; yet we use the same browser as everyone else.

Then resize the browser again and build the design for that. Then … well, you get it. You’re doing it all one by one, repeating yourself over and over again. And if you’re unlucky, you get to do it all over a couple of times as you build, with new pages bringing new requirements that affect pages you’ve already finished.</p> \n<p>And you may want to do more than just build the visual side of your page. Do you want to check your pages for accessibility as you go? Add a browser extension. Do you want to create a full page screenshot to send to your boss or client? Add a browser extension. Do you want to check that your meta tags are correct? You guessed it, add a browser extension. With just a few basic things you already need half a dozen browser extensions. Have you used a browser with half a dozen extensions? It makes IE11 look fast in comparison.</p> \n<h2 id=\"polypaneworksdifferently\">Polypane Works Differently</h2> \n<p>When you open <a href=\"https://polypane.app\">Polypane</a>, you don’t see just a website. You see your website at multiple screen sizes at the same time, just as if you had a bunch of devices on your desk. What’s better, though, is that all these screen sizes are synced: if you interact with one you interact with all of them, whether you’re scrolling, clicking, hovering or typing. You’re interacting with a single website; you just happen to see it at multiple sizes at the same time.</p> \n<p>\n <video controls=\"\" width=\"100%\">\n  <source src=\"https://polypane.app/static/68568dbc740e534e7273939343f00331/intro.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" />\n </video><br /> \n <!-- [video]https://polypane.app/static/68568dbc740e534e7273939343f00331/intro.mp4 --></p> \n<p>Seeing all the screen sizes side by side means you no longer have to resize your browser and go through them one by one. And those screen sizes are yours to pick: you can pick from over 20 pre-configured devices, like phones, tablets and laptop sizes or you can resize them freeform however you like.</p> \n<p>Or you can ask Polypane to parse through the CSS of the page, find all the CSS media queries and create screen sizes from those, making sure you’re always testing the site on all the sizes you want to support.</p> \n<p>This alone makes Polypane a massive productivity boost. But if you eliminate resizing your browser all the time, what else can we do?</p> \n<p>Well, what about reloading?</p> \n<p>Polypane works with any hot reloading or live reloading system, just like any other modern browser out there. But Polypane also has a built-in live reloading server that requires zero configuration. Just tell it which folder to check and you’re done. It even works with plain HTML files! And best of all, if you update a CSS file or image, Polypane just refreshes that instead of reloading the full page.</p> \n<p> Continue reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/polypane-developer-browser/?utm_source=rss\">Meet Polypane, a Browser That Makes You Five Times Faster</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=ZdZ50rCWw08:SaKeEafODJE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=ZdZ50rCWw08:SaKeEafODJE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=ZdZ50rCWw08:SaKeEafODJE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=ZdZ50rCWw08:SaKeEafODJE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/ZdZ50rCWw08\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 10 Aug 2020 21:02:46 +0000","feedId":6128,"bgimg":"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1596070474polypane.png","linkMd5":"959888d267fa2e23892c33f6d7754d0b","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn17@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-25-719_986c65a7c4157b2d.webp","destWidth":600,"destHeight":340,"sourceBytes":10346,"destBytes":10346,"author":"Kilian Valkhof","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1596070474polypane.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn17@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-25-719_986c65a7c4157b2d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn15@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-39-311_6409ebad5acff93a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn3@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-47-113_bf83e999bebef320.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=ZdZ50rCWw08:SaKeEafODJE:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn14@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-35-374_8396fc27b6615f93.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/ZdZ50rCWw08":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn52@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-51-46-791_90604a95663fcafa.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598309483247},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","title":"GreenSock 3 Web Animation: Get to Know GSAP&#8217;s New Features","link":"https://editor.sitepoint.com/?p=177086","description":"<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/greensock-3-animation-features/?utm_source=rss\" title=\"GreenSock 3 Web Animation: Get to Know GSAP’s New Features\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1597120553gsap-3-web-animation.png\" alt=\"Animating the Web with the Latest Shiny GreenSock Animation Platform\" srcset=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1597120553gsap-3-web-animation-300x180.png 300w, https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1597120553gsap-3-web-animation.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /> </a> \n<p><strong>On November 1st 2019, the <a href=\"https://greensock.com/\">GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP)</a> released version 3, which is its major upgrade to date.</strong> </p> \n<p>GSAP is a powerful, backward-compatible, performant, and mature JavaScript animation library that allows you to animate pretty much anything on the web — such as DOM elements, JS objects, SVGs, CSS properties, etc.</p> \n<p>Its intuitive syntax empowers developers with the ability to create some mind blowing animation effects in a relatively short amount of time and with the minimum amount of code.</p> \n<p>In this article, I’m going to highlight some great new features of GSAP 3 and get you started on how to use them to get things moving on web in no time.</p> \n<h2 id=\"whatsnewingsap3\">What’s New in GSAP 3</h2> \n<h3 id=\"morefeaturesandsmallerfilesizes\">More Features and Smaller File Sizes</h3> \n<p>GreenSock has been rebuilt from the ground up using ES6 modules. It’s still feature-packed, with more than 50 new library features, but it’s only half the size! </p> \n<h3 id=\"condensedsyntaxforfastcoding\">Condensed Syntax for Fast Coding</h3> \n<p>If you’ve ever used GSAP before, you’re already familiar with its intuitive, beginner-friendly syntax. The new API is even more simplified and quick to learn and use.</p> \n<p>For example, now you don’t need to decide whether you want to use TweenLite or TweenMax, TimelineLite or TimelineMax. There’s just one object, the <code>gsap</code> object:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">// tween\ngsap.to(selector, {})\n\n// timeline\nconst tl = gsap.timeline()\n</code></pre> \n<p>Also, <code>duration</code> is no longer a parameter of the <code>to()</code>, <code>from()</code>, or <code>fromTo()</code> methods, but it’s set inside the <code>vars</code> object. In particular, the old</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">TweenMax.to(selector, 1, {})\n</code></pre> \n<p>becomes</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">gsap.to(selector, {\n  duration: 1\n})\n</code></pre> \n<p>Much more readable and also flexible. In fact, you can now set the <code>duration</code> using a function, for example.</p> \n<p>Another plus of this new, simplified API is that staggering animations are a breeze to code. No need to use the old <code>staggerTo()</code>, <code>staggerFrom()</code>, and <code>staggerFromTo()</code> methods because you can add staggers directly into the <code>vars</code> object of regular tweens:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">gsap.to(selector, {\n  x: 50,\n  duration: 1,\n  stagger: 0.5\n})\n</code></pre> \n<p>For more flexibility, you can use a stagger object like this:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">gsap.to(selector, {\n  x: 50,\n  duration: 1,\n  stagger: {\n    amount: 2,\n    from: 'center'\n  }\n})\n</code></pre> \n<p>Finally, GSAP’s eases have always been awesome, but a bit verbose. Not now. Version 3 comes with a more concise and readable syntax for setting eases. For example, instead of:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">Elastic.easeOut\nElastic.easeIn\nElastic.easeInOut\n</code></pre> \n<p>you simply write:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">'elastic'  // same as 'elastic.out'\n'elastic.in'  \n'elastic.inOut'\n</code></pre> \n<p>Another simplification consists in the possibility of replacing labels with the <code>&lt;</code> symbol to indicate the most recently added animation’s start time and the <code>&gt;</code> symbol to indicate the most recently added animation’s end time. Below is an example of how you could use labels in a timeline:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">gsap.timeline()\n  .add('start')\n  // this tween starts at the beginning of the\n  // entire animation\n  .to(selector, {}, 'start')\n  // this tween starts 0.5 seconds after\n  // the previous tween\n  .to(selector, {}, 'start+=0.5')\n</code></pre> \n<p>You can now rewrite the code above as follows:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">gsap.timeline()\n  .to(selector, {}, '&lt;')\n  .to(selector, {}, '&lt;0.5')\n</code></pre> \n<h3 id=\"inheritabledefaultvaluesforthetimeline\">Inheritable Default Values for the Timeline</h3> \n<p>If the values for some of the settings in your timeline remain the same throughout the child tweens, gone are the days of having to write those values over and over again. GSAP 3 lets you set those properties once in the parent timeline and they will be inherited by the child tweens.</p> \n<p>For example, instead of writing:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">const tl = new TimelineMax()\ntl.to(selector, 2, {\n  ease:  Power2.easeInOut,\n  rotation:  -180\n})\n  .to(selector, 2, {\n    ease:  Power2.easeInOut,\n    rotation:  -360\n})\n</code></pre> \n<p>Now, you can simply write:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">const tl = gsap.timeline({defaults: {\n  duration: 2,\n  ease:  'power2.inOut'\n}} )\n\ntl.to(selector, {\n  rotation:  -180  \n})\n.to(selector, {\n  rotation:  -360\n})\n</code></pre> \n<h3 id=\"keyframes\">Keyframes</h3> \n<p>Your GSAP 3 code gets even more concise and readable with keyframes. Keyframes, a concept that is quite familiar to CSS developers, are great in those cases when you want to animate the same element in different ways. Instead of creating a separate tween for each stage of the animation, you can now pass an array of keyframes to the <code>{} vars</code> object and all the steps of the animation will be perfectly sequenced inside the same tween. Here’s an example of how this works:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">gsap.to(selector, {keyframes: {\n  {x: 250, duration: 1},\n  {y: 100, duration: 1, delay: 0.5}\n}})\n</code></pre> \n<h3 id=\"moreutilityfunctions\">More Utility Functions</h3> \n<p>This latest release of the GreenSock library comes packed with a bunch of new <a href=\"https://greensock.com/docs/v3/GSAP/UtilityMethods\">utility methods</a> like <code>snap()</code>, which lets you snap a value to an increment or to the closest value in an array, and <code>random()</code>, which makes it a breeze to generate a random number based on parameters or randomly select an element in an array, and tons more.</p> \n<h2 id=\"simpleanimations\">Simple Animations</h2> \n<p>Here’s an example of using the three basic GSAP methods: <code>to()</code>, <code>from()</code>, and <code>fromTo()</code>:</p> \n<p>\n <!-- https://codepen.io/antonietta/pen/BajzPrd --></p> \n<p class=\"codepen\" data-height=\"300\" data-theme-id=\"6441\" data-default-tab=\"html,result\" data-user=\"SitePoint\" data-slug-hash=\"oNxjjyO\" style=\"height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;\" data-pen-title=\"GSAP3-to-from-fromTo-examples\"> <span>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/SitePoint/pen/oNxjjyO\"><br /> GSAP3-to-from-fromTo-examples</a> by SitePoint (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/SitePoint\">@SitePoint</a>)<br /> on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</span> </p> \n<p><script async=\"\" src=\"https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script></p> \n<h2 id=\"gsapeasesforlifelikeanimations\">GSAP Eases for Life-like Animations</h2> \n<p><strong>Eases</strong> are foundational components of animation. They embody the timing of tweens and thereby add interest and naturalness to the motion you create on screen.</p> \n<p>GSAP lets you add tons of eases by means of the <a href=\"https://greensock.com/docs/v3/Eases\">GreenSock Ease Equalizer</a>, a handy tool that offers a visual representation of GSAP easing options as you select and tweak the best fit for the particular effect you’re after.</p> \n<p>Let’s try some eases for our musical bird:</p> \n<p>\n <!-- https://codepen.io/antonietta/pen/bGEBaEY --></p> \n<p class=\"codepen\" data-height=\"300\" data-theme-id=\"6441\" data-default-tab=\"html,result\" data-user=\"SitePoint\" data-slug-hash=\"jOqbbpw\" style=\"height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;\" data-pen-title=\"GSAP3-eases-example\"> <span>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/SitePoint/pen/jOqbbpw\"><br /> GSAP3-eases-example</a> by SitePoint (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/SitePoint\">@SitePoint</a>)<br /> on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</span> </p> \n<p><script async=\"\" src=\"https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script></p> \n<h2 id=\"anexampleofkeyframeanimationwithgsap\">An Example of Keyframe Animation with GSAP</h2> \n<p>As I pointed out above, GSAP 3 gives you the option of implementing a number of tweens on the same element in a more efficient and readable way using keyframes.</p> \n<p>Here’s an example:</p> \n<p>\n <!-- https://codepen.io/antonietta/pen/ExPXeeR --></p> \n<p class=\"codepen\" data-height=\"300\" data-theme-id=\"6441\" data-default-tab=\"html,result\" data-user=\"SitePoint\" data-slug-hash=\"ExKVVpe\" style=\"height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;\" data-pen-title=\"GSAP3-keyframes-example\"> <span>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/SitePoint/pen/ExKVVpe\"><br /> GSAP3-keyframes-example</a> by SitePoint (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/SitePoint\">@SitePoint</a>)<br /> on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</span> </p> \n<p><script async=\"\" src=\"https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script></p> \n<p>Using GSAP keyframes on the SVG bird element lets me apply a number of tweens without having to write each tween separately. The advantage is that I don’t need to repeat some of the code — for example, the selector code (<code>'.bird'</code>) or any of the settings that remain the same throughout the animation.</p> \n<p> Continue reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/greensock-3-animation-features/?utm_source=rss\">GreenSock 3 Web Animation: Get to Know GSAP’s New Features</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=D3zR2hdOs58:876QNlxeL-A:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=D3zR2hdOs58:876QNlxeL-A:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=D3zR2hdOs58:876QNlxeL-A:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=D3zR2hdOs58:876QNlxeL-A:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/D3zR2hdOs58\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 12 Aug 2020 17:05:41 +0000","feedId":6128,"bgimg":"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1597120553gsap-3-web-animation.png","linkMd5":"50620dc4b76570edbe0d0073af4c6351","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn70@2020_3/2020/08/24/22-51-24-650_8508968cccac4bc4.webp","destWidth":600,"destHeight":360,"sourceBytes":5490,"destBytes":5490,"author":"Maria Antonietta Perna","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1597120553gsap-3-web-animation.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn70@2020_3/2020/08/24/22-51-24-650_8508968cccac4bc4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn15@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-39-311_6409ebad5acff93a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn3@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-47-113_bf83e999bebef320.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=D3zR2hdOs58:876QNlxeL-A:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn29@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-37-861_7d5deca7036fb0ff.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/D3zR2hdOs58":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn9@2020_6/2020/08/24/22-51-35-069_cdd2cfe6551b461d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598309483246},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","title":"Fonts and Colors Used by Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google and More","link":"http://www.sitepoint.com/?p=83483","description":"<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/fonts-colors-used-facebook-twitter-google/?utm_source=rss\" title=\"Fonts and Colors Used by Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google and More\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/1594257971fonts-colors.png\" alt=\"Fonts and Colors Used by Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and More\" srcset=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/1594257971fonts-colors-300x170.png 300w, https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/1594257971fonts-colors.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /> </a> \n<p><em>This article was updated in 2020 to show the newer fonts and colors used by social networks, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and various others.

I mean, what business isn’t on social media these days? <em>It’s a necessity!</em></strong></p> \n<p>Knowing what the different fonts and colors used by social networks are (so that we can use them in our designs) is quite handy. It’s something we “google” every time we design an app or website.

splitting the logic into front-end and back-end code. The reason behind this move is to promote code re-usability. For example, we may need to build a native mobile application that accesses the back-end API. Or we may be developing a module that will be part of a large modular platform.</strong></p> \n<p><img src=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/1493756964crudappB-01.png\" alt=\"An operator, sat at an old-fashioned telephone switchboard - Build a CRUD App Using React, Redux and FeathersJS\" /></p> \n<p>The popular way of building a server-side API is to use Node.js with a library like Express or Restify. These libraries make creating RESTful routes easy. The problem with these libraries is that we’ll find ourselves writing a <em>ton</em> of <strong>repetitive code</strong>. We’ll also need to write code for authorization and other middleware logic.</p> \n<p>To escape this dilemma, we can use a framework like <a href=\"http://feathersjs.com/\">Feathers</a> to help us generate an API in just a few commands.</p> \n<p>What makes Feathers amazing is its simplicity. The entire framework is modular and we only need to install the features we need. Feathers itself is a thin wrapper built on top of Express, where they’ve added new features — <a href=\"https://docs.feathersjs.com/api/services.html\">services</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.feathersjs.com/api/hooks.html\">hooks</a>. Feathers also allows us to effortlessly send and receive data over WebSockets.</p> \n<h2 id=\"prerequisites\">Prerequisites</h2> \n<p>To follow along with this tutorial, you’ll need the following things installed on your machine:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/\">Node.js</a> v12+ and an up-to-date version of npm. Check <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/quick-tip-multiple-versions-node-nvm/\">this tutorial</a> if you need help getting set up.</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.mongodb.com/\">MongoDB</a> v4.2+.

We’ll kick-start our project using the popular <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/create-react-app/\">create-react-app</a> tool.</p> \n<p>You can install it like so:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npm install -g create-react-app\n</code></pre> \n<p>Then create a new project:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\"># scaffold a new react project\ncreate-react-app react-contact-manager\ncd react-contact-manager\n\n# delete unnecessary files\nrm src/logo.svg src/App.css src/serviceWorker.js\n</code></pre> \n<p>Use your favorite code editor and remove all the content in <code>src/index.css</code>. Then open <code>src/App.js</code> and rewrite the code like this:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"jsx language-jsx\">import React from 'react';\n\nconst App = () =&gt; {\n  return (\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      &lt;h1&gt;Contact Manager&lt;/h1&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  );\n};\n\nexport default App;\n</code></pre> \n<p>Run <code>yarn start</code> from the <code>react-contact-manager</code> directory to start the project. Your browser should automatically open <code>http://localhost:3000</code> and you should see the heading “Contact Manager”. Quickly check the console tab to ensure that the project is running cleanly with no warnings or errors, and if everything is running smoothly, use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> to stop the server.</p> \n<h2 id=\"buildtheapiserverwithfeathers\">Build the API Server with Feathers</h2> \n<p>Let’s proceed with generating the back-end API for our CRUD project using the <code>feathers-cli</code> tool:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\"># Install Feathers command-line tool\nnpm install @feathersjs/cli -g\n\n# Create directory for the back-end code\n# Run this command in the `react-contact-manager` directory\nmkdir backend\ncd backend\n\n# Generate a feathers back-end API server\nfeathers generate app\n\n? Do you want to use JavaScript or TypeScript? JavaScript\n? Project name backend\n? Description contacts API server\n? What folder should the source files live in? src\n? Which package manager are you using (has to be installed globally)? Yarn\n? What type of API are you making? REST, Realtime via Socket.io\n? Which testing framework do you prefer? Mocha + assert\n? This app uses authentication No\n\n# Ensure Mongodb is running\nsudo service mongod start\nsudo service mongod status\n\n● mongod.service - MongoDB Database Server\n   Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/mongod.service; disabled; vendor preset: enabled)\n   Active: active (running) since Wed 2020-01-22 11:22:51 EAT; 6s ago\n     Docs: https://docs.mongodb.org/manual\n Main PID: 13571 (mongod)\n   CGroup: /system.slice/mongod.service\n           └─13571 /usr/bin/mongod --config /etc/mongod.conf\n\n# Generate RESTful routes for Contact Model\nfeathers generate service\n\n?

This is where we can configure our MongoDB connection parameters and other settings. Change the default paginate value to 50, since front-end pagination won’t be covered in this tutorial:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">{\n  \"host\": \"localhost\",\n  \"port\": 3030,\n  \"public\": \"../public/\",\n  \"paginate\": {\n    \"default\": 50,\n    \"max\": 50\n  },\n  \"mongodb\": \"mongodb://localhost:27017/contactsdb\"\n}\n</code></pre> \n<p>Open <code>backend/src/models/contact.model.js</code> and update the code as follows:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">require('mongoose-type-email');\n\nmodule.exports = function (app) {\n  const modelName = 'contacts';\n  const mongooseClient = app.get('mongooseClient');\n  const { Schema } = mongooseClient;\n  const schema = new Schema({\n    name : {\n      first: {\n        type: String,\n        required: [true, 'First Name is required']\n      },\n      last: {\n        type: String,\n        required: false\n      }\n    },\n    email : {\n      type: mongooseClient.SchemaTypes.Email,\n      required: [true, 'Email is required']\n    },\n    phone : {\n      type: String,\n      required: [true, 'Phone is required'],\n      validate: {\n        validator: function(v) {\n          return /^\\+(?:[0-9] ?){6,14}[0-9]$/.test(v);\n        },\n        message: '{VALUE} is not a valid international phone number!'\n      }\n    }\n  }, {\n    timestamps: true\n  });\n\n  ...\n\n  return  mongooseClient.model(modelName,  schema);\n};\n</code></pre> \n<p>Mongoose introduces a new feature called <a href=\"https://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html#timestamps\">timestamps</a>, which inserts two new fields for you — <code>createdAt</code> and <code>updatedAt</code>. These two fields will be populated automatically whenever we create or update a record. We’ve also installed the <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose-type-email\">mongoose-type-email</a> plugin to perform email validation on the server.</p> \n<p>Now, open <code>backend/src/mongoose.js</code> and change this line:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">{ useCreateIndex: true, useNewUrlParser: true }\n</code></pre> \n<p>to:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">{ useCreateIndex: true, useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true }\n</code></pre> \n<p>This will squash an annoying deprecation warning.</p> \n<p>Open a new terminal and execute <code>yarn test</code> inside the <code>backend</code> directory. You should have all the tests running successfully. Then, go ahead and execute <code>yarn start</code> to start the back-end server. Once the server has initialized, it should print <code>'Feathers application started on localhost:3030'</code> to the console.</p> \n<p>Launch your browser and access the URL <a href=\"http://localhost:3030/contacts\">http://localhost:3030/contacts</a>. You should expect to receive the following JSON response:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">{\"total\":0,\"limit\":50,\"skip\":0,\"data\":[]}\n</code></pre> \n<h2 id=\"testtheapiwithpostwoman\">Test the API with Postwoman</h2> \n<p>Now let’s use <a href=\"https://postwoman.io/\">Postwoman</a> to confirm all of our endpoints are working properly.</p> \n<p>First, let’s create a contact. This link will open Postwoman with everything set up to <a href=\"https://postwoman.io/?method=POST&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A3030&amp;path=%2Fcontacts&amp;contentType=application%2Fjson&amp;rawParams=%7B%0A%20%20%22name%22%3A%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%22first%22%3A%20%22Tony%22,%0A%20%20%20%20%22last%22%3A%20%22Stark%22%0A%20%20%7D,%0A%20%20%22phone%22%3A%20%22%2B18138683770%22,%0A%20%20%22email%22%3A%20%22tony%40starkenterprises.com%22%0A%7D\">send a POST request to the <code>/contacts</code> endpoint</a>. Make sure <em>Raw input enabled</em> is set to <em>on</em>, then press the green <em>Send</em> button to create a new contact. The response should be something like this:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">{\n  \"_id\": \"5e36f3eb8828f64ac1b2166c\",\n  \"name\": {\n    \"first\": \"Tony\",\n    \"last\": \"Stark\"\n  },\n  \"phone\": \"+18138683770\",\n  \"email\": \"tony@starkenterprises.com\",\n  \"createdAt\": \"2020-02-02T16:08:11.742Z\",\n  \"updatedAt\": \"2020-02-02T16:08:11.742Z\",\n  \"__v\": 0\n}\n</code></pre> \n<p>Now let’s retrieve our newly created contact. This link will open Postwoman ready to <a href=\"https://postwoman.io/?method=GET&amp;url=http://localhost:3030&amp;path=/contacts\">send a GET request to the <code>/contacts</code> endpoint</a>. When you press the <em>Send</em> button, you should get a response like this:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">{\n  \"total\": 1,\n  \"limit\": 50,\n  \"skip\": 0,\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"_id\": \"5e36f3eb8828f64ac1b2166c\",\n      \"name\": {\n        \"first\": \"Tony\",\n        \"last\": \"Stark\"\n      },\n      \"phone\": \"+18138683770\",\n      \"email\": \"tony@starkenterprises.com\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2020-02-02T16:08:11.742Z\",\n      \"updatedAt\": \"2020-02-02T16:08:11.742Z\",\n      \"__v\": 0\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</code></pre> \n<p>We can show an individual contact in Postwoman by sending a GET request to <code>http://localhost:3030/contacts/&lt;_id&gt;</code>. The <code>_id</code> field will always be unique, so you’ll need to copy it out of the response you received in the previous step. This is <a href=\"https://postwoman.io/?method=GET&amp;url=http://localhost:3030&amp;path=/contacts/5e36f3eb8828f64ac1b2166c\">the link for the above example</a>. Pressing <em>Send</em> will show the contact.</p> \n<p>We can update a contact by sending a PUT request to <code>http://localhost:3030/contacts/&lt;_id&gt;</code> and passing it the updated data as JSON. This is <a href=\"https://postwoman.io/?method=PUT&amp;url=http://localhost:3030&amp;path=/contacts/5e36f3eb8828f64ac1b2166c&amp;contentType=application/json&amp;rawParams=%7B%0A%20%20%22name%22:%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%22first%22:%20%22Tony%22,%0A%20%20%20%20%22last%22:%20%22Stark%22%0A%20%20%7D,%0A%20%20%22phone%22:%20%22%2B18138683770%22,%0A%20%20%22email%22:%20%22ts@starkenterprises.com%22%0A%7D\">the link for the above example</a>.

It was first released way back in 2001, and since then it has become a PHP developer’s favorite way of sending emails programmatically, aside from a few other fan favorites like <a href=\"http://www.sitepoint.com/sending-email-with-swift-mailer/\">Swiftmailer</a>.</strong></p> \n<p>In this article, we’ll talk about why you should use PHPMailer instead of PHP’s <code>mail()</code> function, and we’ll show some code samples on how to use this library.</p> \n<h2 id=\"isitanalternativetophpsmailfunction\">Is It an Alternative to PHP’s <code>mail()</code> Function?</h2> \n<p>In most cases, it’s an alternative to PHP’s <code>mail()</code> function, but there are many other cases where the <code>mail()</code> function is simply not flexible enough to achieve what you need.</p> \n<p>First of all, PHPMailer provides an object-oriented interface, whereas <code>mail()</code> is not object oriented. PHP developers generally hate to create <code>$headers</code> strings while sending emails using the <code>mail()</code> function because they require a lot of escaping. PHPMailer makes this a breeze. Developers also need to write dirty code (escaping characters, encoding and formatting) to send attachments and HTML based emails when using the <code>mail()</code> function, whereas PHPMailer makes this painless.</p> \n<p>Also, the <code>mail()</code> function requires a local mail server to send out emails, which is not always trivial to set up. PHPMailer can use a non-local mail server (SMTP) if you have authentication.</p> \n<p>Further advantages include:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>It can print various kinds of error messages in more than 40 languages when it fails to send an email.</li> \n <li>It has integrated SMTP protocol support and authentication over SSL and TLS.</li> \n <li>It can send an alternative plain-text version of email for non-HTML email clients.</li> \n <li>It has a very active developer community that keeps it secure and up to date.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>PHPMailer is also used by popular PHP content management systems like WordPress, Drupal, and Joomla.</p> \n<h2 id=\"installingphpmailer\">Installing PHPMailer</h2> \n<p>You can install <a href=\"https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer\">PHPMailer</a> using Composer:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">composer require phpmailer/phpmailer\n</code></pre> \n<h3 id=\"sendingemailfromalocalwebserverusingphpmailer\">Sending Email from a Local Web Server Using PHPMailer</h3> \n<p>Here’s the simplest example of sending an email from a local web server using PHPMailer:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"php language-php\">&lt;?php\nuse PHPMailer\\PHPMailer\\PHPMailer;\nuse PHPMailer\\PHPMailer\\Exception;\n\nrequire_once \"vendor/autoload.php\";\n\n//PHPMailer Object\n$mail = new PHPMailer(true); //Argument true in constructor enables exceptions\n\n//From email address and name\n$mail-&gt;From = \"from@yourdomain.com\";\n$mail-&gt;FromName = \"Full Name\";\n\n//To address and name\n$mail-&gt;addAddress(\"recepient1@example.com\", \"Recepient Name\");\n$mail-&gt;addAddress(\"recepient1@example.com\"); //Recipient name is optional\n\n//Address to which recipient will reply\n$mail-&gt;addReplyTo(\"reply@yourdomain.com\", \"Reply\");\n\n//CC and BCC\n$mail-&gt;addCC(\"cc@example.com\");\n$mail-&gt;addBCC(\"bcc@example.com\");\n\n//Send HTML or Plain Text email\n$mail-&gt;isHTML(true);\n\n$mail-&gt;Subject = \"Subject Text\";\n$mail-&gt;Body = \"&lt;i&gt;Mail body in HTML&lt;/i&gt;\";\n$mail-&gt;AltBody = \"This is the plain text version of the email content\";\n\ntry {\n    $mail-&gt;send();\n    echo \"Message has been sent successfully\";\n} catch (Exception $e) {\n    echo \"Mailer Error: \" . $mail-&gt;ErrorInfo;\n}\n</code></pre> \n<p>The code and comments should be sufficiently clear to explain everything that’s going on.</p> \n<h3 id=\"sendinganemailwithattachments\">Sending an Email with Attachments</h3> \n<p>Here’s an example of how to send an email with attachments using PHPMailer:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"php language-php\">&lt;?php\nuse PHPMailer\\PHPMailer\\PHPMailer;\nuse PHPMailer\\PHPMailer\\Exception;\n\nrequire_once \"vendor/autoload.php\";\n\n$mail = new PHPMailer;\n\n$mail-&gt;From = \"from@yourdomain.com\";\n$mail-&gt;FromName = \"Full Name\";\n\n$mail-&gt;addAddress(\"recipient1@example.com\", \"Recipient Name\");\n\n//Provide file path and name of the attachments\n$mail-&gt;addAttachment(\"file.txt\", \"File.txt\");        \n$mail-&gt;addAttachment(\"images/profile.png\"); //Filename is optional\n\n$mail-&gt;isHTML(true);\n\n$mail-&gt;Subject = \"Subject Text\";\n$mail-&gt;Body = \"&lt;i&gt;Mail body in HTML&lt;/i&gt;\";\n$mail-&gt;AltBody = \"This is the plain text version of the email content\";\n\ntry {\n    $mail-&gt;send();\n    echo \"Message has been sent successfully\";\n} catch (Exception $e) {\n    echo \"Mailer Error: \" . $mail-&gt;ErrorInfo;\n}\n</code></pre> \n<p>Here, we’re attaching two files — <code>file.txt</code>, which resides in the same directory as the script, and <code>images/profile.png</code>, which resides in <code>images</code> directory of the script directory.</p> \n<p>To add attachments to the email, we just need to call the function <code>addAttachment</code> of the PHPMailer object by passing the file path as argument. For attaching multiple files, we need to call it multiple times.</p> \n<h3 id=\"troubleshooting\">Troubleshooting</h3> \n<p>In our two examples, we used PHPMailer’s <a href=\"https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/blob/master/src/Exception.php\">Exception class</a> for debugging, so any errors thrown will help us debug any issues that may occur. We also added the argument <code>true</code> to <a href=\"https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/blob/master/src/PHPMailer.php#L819\">PHPMailer constructor</a>, to output higher-level, more descriptive exceptions.</p> \n<p>Depending on the system we use, probably the most frequent error we’ll see will be related to running the <code>mail()</code> function in the background:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>Mailer Error: Could not instantiate mail function.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>If we need more details on the error, we can also add something like this to the catch clause:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"php language-php\">print_r(error_get_last());\n</code></pre> \n<p>Usually, the problem with the mail function will be related to the missing mail server setup, in which case the <code>error_get_last</code> function will return something like this:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"php language-php\">Array (\n    [type] =&gt; 2\n    [message] =&gt; mail(): Failed to connect to mailserver at \"localhost\" port 25, verify your \"SMTP\" and \"smtp_port\" setting in php.ini or use ini_set()\n    [file] =&gt; OUR_PATH \\vendor\\phpmailer\\phpmailer\\src\\PHPMailer.php\n    [line] =&gt; 863\n)\n</code></pre> \n<p>This is the issue we’ll probably encounter most frequently, and we can solve it easily by using SMTP.</p> \n<p> Continue reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/sending-emails-php-phpmailer/?utm_source=rss\">Sending Emails in PHP with PHPMailer</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=AdFtZ6332zE:fIgRnc9a92c:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=AdFtZ6332zE:fIgRnc9a92c:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=AdFtZ6332zE:fIgRnc9a92c:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=AdFtZ6332zE:fIgRnc9a92c:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/AdFtZ6332zE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 15 Jun 2020 16:00:17 +0000","feedId":6128,"bgimg":"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/1592182649phpmailer.png","linkMd5":"72b3ad297af95193985e67e26cd087d6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn2@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-26-511_a81cc046c86d7050.webp","destWidth":600,"destHeight":339,"sourceBytes":10246,"destBytes":10246,"author":"Narayan Prusty","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/1592182649phpmailer.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn2@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-26-511_a81cc046c86d7050.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn15@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-39-311_6409ebad5acff93a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn3@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-47-113_bf83e999bebef320.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=AdFtZ6332zE:fIgRnc9a92c:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn90@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-51-40-041_6e9dcecfeead732d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/AdFtZ6332zE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn73@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-35-085_49c566f6dd910b4f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598309483263},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","title":"Need to Edutain Your Kids While Distancing?

These are generally needed either for promotion or for internal communication, and all companies need them at one point or another.</strong></p> \n<p>You might have all the content ready, or ideas for content, but then you’ll need to focus on the design, because it’s what brings it all together in harmony.</p> \n<p>There are professional tools which designers usually go for in this case. Most commonly used are InDesign, Affinity Publisher, QuarkXPress or others.</p> \n<p>These design tools have varying levels of complexity, require various levels of technical knowledge, and have different learning curves. For someone who’s never opened InDesign or worked with a similar professional design tool, the idea of designing a brochure or catalog can be a bit intimidating.</p> \n<p>If this sounds like you, then don’t panic. There is a tool out there that can help you create professional designs online easily, and it’s perfect for any type of design that has multiple pages (and it works for single page designs too). Its name is Flipsnack.</p> \n<p>Even if you don’t struggle with design, it’s still worth giving it a try.</p> \n<p>What makes <a href=\"https://www.flipsnack.com/?utm_source=sitepoint&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=DesignStudio\">Flipsnack</a> different from most professional design tools is that it’s really simple and straightforward. It’s so easy to use, in fact, that anyone from marketers, business owners to students can and have used it.</p> \n<h2 id=\"flipsnackdesignandpublishingtool\">Flipsnack: design and publishing tool</h2> \n<p>With over four million users now, Flipsnack is one of the world’s leading digital publishing platforms for online page-flip catalogs. People of all skill sets and from every corner of the globe have found Flipsnack the perfect place to create all sorts of publications. Some of them use Flipsnack to simply transform ready-made PDFs into interactive page flip catalogs, while others prefer to use its integrated design tool to build their catalog from scratch, page by page. The integrated design tool is called “Design Studio”.</p> \n<p>After you’re done creating and designing, Flipsnack offers multiple ways to share your creation if you want to. You can simply share a link via social media, send it via email, host it on your own website, and much more. But, if you want everything to remain private, you can do that, too. Flipsnack uses all the top tier security measures to ensure that your data stays locked away for safekeeping.</p> \n<h2 id=\"howdoesthedesignstudiowork\">How does the Design Studio work?</h2> \n<p>Flipsnack’s <a href=\"https://www.flipsnack.com/online-design-tool?utm_source=sitepoint&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=DesignStudio\">Design Studio</a> is a force to be reckoned with. It’s powerful, intuitive, easy to navigate, and easy to use. The goal for Flipsnack was to bring everything a person — designer or not — could possibly need to create a work of art within the Design Studio.</p> \n<p>The interface is drag-and-drop based, and even though easy to navigate, it’s packed with advanced functionalities which are critical when making a professional design: layers, smart guides, rulers, multiple select, group, lock and more.</p> [video width=\"1000\" height=\"427\" mp4=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1594085205flipsnack-multiple-align.mp4\"][/video] \n<p>As far as capabilities go, even professional designers would be satisfied. Pretty much every aspect you could think about editing or designing, can be. There’s a wide range of fonts available, but the system supports font imports as well. All the options that you’d expect for editing texts are there. Users can upload their own images, or they can use free stock photos from Unsplash, directly from Flipsnack. Replacing an image with a different one requires just a simple drag-and-drop action.</p> \n<p>You can do anything from building basic layouts with texts and images, to designing more complex layouts, with image masks, shapes and even interactive elements. By adding videos in the design, GIFs, forms, interactive tags or captions, a basic design can become a really fun and engaging experience for the reader. Add shopping buttons in catalogs, create captions and descriptions that become displayed when the reader hovers their mouse over certain areas, and add links.</p> \n<p> Continue reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/flipsnack-an-easy-design-tool-for-incredible-magazines/?utm_source=rss\">Meet Flipsnack, An Easy Design Tool for Incredible Magazines</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=gdpsvljswxk:jF2S5iM3Zts:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=gdpsvljswxk:jF2S5iM3Zts:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=gdpsvljswxk:jF2S5iM3Zts:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=gdpsvljswxk:jF2S5iM3Zts:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/gdpsvljswxk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 08 Jul 2020 21:00:36 +0000","feedId":6128,"bgimg":"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1594288951artisan.jpg","linkMd5":"dcc90a6392658c3134d102d724f95bd8","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn74@2020_6/2020/08/24/22-51-34-175_7ada0fe90afcfa07.webp","destWidth":2340,"destHeight":1179,"sourceBytes":40226,"destBytes":40226,"author":"SitePoint Sponsors","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1594288951artisan.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn74@2020_6/2020/08/24/22-51-34-175_7ada0fe90afcfa07.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn15@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-39-311_6409ebad5acff93a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn3@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-47-113_bf83e999bebef320.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=gdpsvljswxk:jF2S5iM3Zts:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn61@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-51-37-429_5b90ddcfb6af28eb.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/gdpsvljswxk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn98@2020_3/2020/08/24/22-51-36-101_8b69775732e613d7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598309483258},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","title":"15 React Interview Questions with Solutions","link":"https://editor.sitepoint.com/?p=176448","description":"<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/react-interview-questions-solutions/?utm_source=rss\" title=\"15 React Interview Questions with Solutions\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1592875266react-interview-questions.png\" alt=\"15 React Interview Questions with Solutions\" srcset=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1592875266react-interview-questions-300x170.png 300w, https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1592875266react-interview-questions.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /> </a> \n<p><strong>React’s popularity shows no sign of waning, with the demand for developers still outstripping the supply in many cities around the world. For less-experienced developers (or those who’ve been out of the job market for a while), demonstrating your knowledge at the interview stage can be daunting.</strong></p> \n<p>In this article, we’ll look at fifteen questions covering a range of knowledge that’s central to understanding and working effectively with React. For each question, I’ll summarize the answer and give links to additional resources where you can find out more.</p> \n<h2 id=\"1whatsthevirtualdom\">1. What’s the virtual DOM?</h2> \n<h3 id=\"answer\">Answer</h3> \n<p>The virtual DOM is an in-memory representation of the actual HTML elements that make up your application’s UI. When a component is re-rendered, the virtual DOM compares the changes to its model of the DOM in order to create a list of updates to be applied. The main advantage is that it’s highly efficient, only making the minimum necessary changes to the actual DOM, rather than having to re-render large chunks.</p> \n<h3 id=\"furtherreading\">Further reading</h3> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://bitsofco.de/understanding-the-virtual-dom/\">Understanding the Virtual DOM</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/virtual-dom-explained\">Virtual DOM Explained</a></li> \n</ul> \n<h2 id=\"2whatsjsx\">2. What’s JSX?</h2> \n<h3 id=\"answer-1\">Answer</h3> \n<p>JSX is an extension to JavaScript syntax that allows for writing code that looks like HTML. It compiles down to regular JavaScript function calls, providing a nicer way to create the markup for your components.</p> \n<p>Take this JSX:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"jsx language-jsx\">&lt;div className=\"sidebar\" /&gt;\n</code></pre> \n<p>It translates to the following JavaScript:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">React.createElement(\n  'div',\n  {className: 'sidebar'}\n)\n</code></pre> \n<h3 id=\"furtherreading-1\">Further reading</h3> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.newline.co/fullstack-react/30-days-of-react/day-2/\">What is JSX?</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html\">JSX in Depth</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/react-design-patterns-and-best-practices-second-edition/read/2/k71ebq0z?preview=true&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=articles\">JSX in React Design Patterns and Best Practices</a></li> \n</ul> \n<h2 id=\"3whatsthedifferencebetweenaclasscomponentandafunctionalone\">3. What’s the difference between a class component and a functional one?</h2> \n<h3 id=\"answer-2\">Answer</h3> \n<p>Prior to React 16.8 (the introduction of hooks), class-based components were used to create components that needed to maintain internal state, or utilize lifecycle methods (i.e. <code>componentDidMount</code> and <code>shouldComponentUpdate</code>). A class-based component is an ES6 class that extends React’s <code>Component</code> class and, at minimum, implements a <code>render()</code> method.</p> \n<p><strong>Class component</strong>:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">class Welcome extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return &lt;h1&gt;Hello, {this.props.name}&lt;/h1&gt;;\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> \n<p>Functional components are stateless (again, &lt; React 16.8) and return the output to be rendered. They are preferred for rendering UI that only depends on props, as they’re simpler and more performant than class-based components.</p> \n<p><strong>Functional component</strong>:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">function Welcome(props) {\n  return &lt;h1&gt;Hello, {props.name}&lt;/h1&gt;;\n}\n</code></pre> \n<p><em>Note: the introduction of hooks in React 16.8 means that these distinctions no longer apply (see questions 14 and 15).</em></p> \n<h3 id=\"furtherreading-2\">Further reading</h3> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/functional-components-vs-class-components-in-react/\">Functional Components vs Class Components in React</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://medium.com/@Zwenza/functional-vs-class-components-in-react-231e3fbd7108\">Functional vs Class-Components in React</a></li> \n</ul> \n<h2 id=\"4whatarekeysusedfor\">4. What are keys used for?</h2> \n<h3 id=\"answer-3\">Answer</h3> \n<p>When rendering out collections in React, adding a key to each repeated element is important to help React track the association between elements and data. The key should be a unique ID, ideally a UUID or other unique string from the collection item, but which can be an array index as a last resort:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"jsx language-jsx\">&lt;ul&gt;\n  {todos.map((todo) =&gt;\n    &lt;li key={todo.id}&gt;\n      {todo.text}\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n  )};\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n</code></pre> \n<p>Not using a key can result in strange behavior when adding and removing items from the collection.</p> \n<h3 id=\"furtherreading-3\">Further reading</h3> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html#keys\">Lists and Keys</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://kentcdodds.com/blog/understanding-reacts-key-prop\">Understanding React’s key prop</a></li> \n</ul> \n<h2 id=\"5whatsthedifferencebetweenstateandprops\">5. What’s the difference between state and props?</h2> \n<h3 id=\"answer-4\">Answer</h3> \n<p>props are data that are passed into a component from its parent. They should not be mutated, but rather only displayed or used to calculate other values. State is a component’s internal data that can be modified during the lifetime of the component, and is maintained between re-renders.</p> \n<h3 id=\"furtherreading-4\">Further reading</h3> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://github.com/uberVU/react-guide/blob/master/props-vs-state.md\">props vs state</a></li> \n</ul> \n<h2 id=\"6whycallsetstateinsteadofdirectlymutatingstate\">6. Why call setState instead of directly mutating state?</h2> \n<h3 id=\"answer-5\">Answer</h3> \n<p>If you try to mutate a component’s state directly, React has no way of knowing that it needs to re-render the component. By using the <code>setState()</code> method, React can update the component’s UI.</p> \n<h3 id=\"bonus\">Bonus</h3> \n<p>As a bonus, you can also talk about how state updates are not guaranteed to be synchronous. If you need to update a component’s state based on another piece of state (or props), pass a function to <code>setState()</code> that takes <code>state</code> and <code>props</code> as its two arguments:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">this.setState((state, props) =&gt; ({\n  counter: state.counter + props.increment\n}));\n</code></pre> \n<h3 id=\"furtherreading-5\">Further reading</h3> \n<p> Continue reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/react-interview-questions-solutions/?utm_source=rss\">15 React Interview Questions with Solutions</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=SC-S40MdoNw:Q_0HpXAQbd4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=SC-S40MdoNw:Q_0HpXAQbd4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=SC-S40MdoNw:Q_0HpXAQbd4:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=SC-S40MdoNw:Q_0HpXAQbd4:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/SC-S40MdoNw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 24 Jun 2020 12:15:35 +0000","feedId":6128,"bgimg":"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1592875266react-interview-questions.png","linkMd5":"e6d08ee3f526b07c8420f889dc6fe698","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn77@2020_4/2020/08/24/22-51-28-140_a5993f8019303de0.webp","destWidth":600,"destHeight":340,"sourceBytes":8626,"destBytes":8626,"author":"Nilson Jacques","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1592875266react-interview-questions.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn77@2020_4/2020/08/24/22-51-28-140_a5993f8019303de0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn15@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-39-311_6409ebad5acff93a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn3@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-47-113_bf83e999bebef320.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=SC-S40MdoNw:Q_0HpXAQbd4:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn60@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-51-39-005_7333ea433c1118e8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/SC-S40MdoNw":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn51@2020_4/2020/08/24/22-51-38-639_6830bdb1b483463d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598309483261},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","title":"Introduction to the Jamstack: Build Secure, High-Performance Sites","link":"https://editor.sitepoint.com/?p=176683","description":"<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/learn-jamstack/?utm_source=rss\" title=\"Introduction to the Jamstack: Build Secure, High-Performance Sites\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1595250945jamstack.png\" alt=\"Jamstack\" srcset=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1595250945jamstack-300x158.png 300w, https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1595250945jamstack-768x404.png 768w, https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1595250945jamstack-1024x539.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /> </a> \n<p><strong>Every so often, web development takes a dramatic turn for the better. In this article, we introduce the Jamstack, explaining what it is and why it’s great.</strong></p> \n<p>Back in the day, dynamic sites exploded with the LAMP stack. Then the MEAN stack provided a foundation for the next generation of web apps. Now that APIs and reusable components are on the rise, static sites are fashionable again. It’s a “back to basics” of sorts — but not quite.</p> \n<h2 id=\"whatisthejamstack\">What Is the Jamstack?</h2> \n<p><img src=\"https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1595294384Jamstack_Logo_Original.png\" alt=\"Jamstack logo\" width=\"1204\" height=\"346\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-176701\" /></p> \n<p><small>Provided: Netlify</small></p> \n<p>The <strong>Jamstack</strong> is a <em>redefinition of the modern web for faster and more secure websites</em>. These sites scale better and, with the proper toolset, are a lot easier (and more fun) to develop and maintain.</p> \n<p>Let’s break up the term:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>J stands for JavaScript</strong>. JS has come <em>a long way</em> since it was introduced by Netscape in 1995. With reactive and progressive libraries, you can design web apps that behave pretty much like mobile ones.</li> \n <li><strong>A stands for APIs</strong>. You don’t need to program every single functionality yourself, but can rely on third-party processing for a huge number of tasks.</li> \n <li><strong>M stands for Markup</strong>. You can reuse components that have already been developed, or create new ones that are a lot easier to maintain.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3 id=\"isntthatjustbuzz\">Isn’t that just buzz?</h3> \n<p>In a way, yes. The term <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/jamstack/\">Jamstack</a>, originally stylized as JAMstack, was coined by the company <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/\">Netlify</a> as a way of promoting their “all-in-one platform for automating modern web projects.” The principles behind the Jamstack aren’t really new, as web components and APIs have existed for quite some time.</p> \n<p>But in very much the same way the term <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)\">Ajax</a> (asynchronous JavaScript and XML) was coined by another company back in the day — <a href=\"https://adaptivepath.com/\">Adaptive Path</a> — and even though the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMLHttpRequest\">XMLHttpRequest</a> (XHR) API that made Ajax possible also existed for some time, <strong>both Ajax and JAMstack were a refreshing revamp of ideas with legitimate uses</strong> that were quickly adopted by the community. The hype is well-deserved: this way of working has been a revelation for many developers around the world.</p> \n<h3 id=\"staticsites\">Static sites?</h3> \n<p>“Static sites” are the antithesis of “dynamic websites”, right?

Simple sites can be built using this process, but to really explore the possibilities, you need a web server.</strong></p> \n<h2 id=\"whatisawebserver\">What is a Web Server?</h2> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/?p=7949#whyapache\"><em>(Skip to the next section if you prefer …)</em></a></p> \n<p>A web server is software that listens for requests and returns data (usually a file). When you type “www.mysite.com”, the request is forwarded to a machine running web server software which returns a file back to your browser — such as the contents of <code>index.html</code>. The browser might then make further requests based on the HTML content — like CSS, JavaScript, and graphic files.</p> \n<p>Since the web server sits between your browser and the requested file, it can perform processing that’s not possible by opening an HTML file directly. For example, it can parse PHP code which connects to a database and returns data.</p> \n<p>You can use your host’s web server for testing, but uploading will become tiresome and changes could go live before they’ve been fully tested. What you need is a local web server installation.</p> \n<h2 id=\"whyapache\">Why Apache?</h2> \n<p>In general, it’s good to use the web server software that your web host uses. Unless you’re creating ASP.NET applications on Microsoft IIS, your host is likely to use <a href=\"http://httpd.apache.org/\">Apache</a> — the most widespread and fully-featured web server available. It’s an open-source project, so it doesn’t cost anything to download or install.</p> \n<p>The following instructions describe how to install Apache on Windows. macOS comes with Apache and PHP. Most Linux users will have Apache pre-installed or available in the base repositories.</p> \n<h2 id=\"allinonepackages\">All-in-one Packages</h2> \n<p>There are some excellent all-in-one Windows distributions that contain Apache, PHP, MySQL and other applications in a single installation file — such as <a href=\"http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html\">XAMPP</a> (for Windows, Linux and macOS), <a href=\"http://www.wampserver.com/en/\">WampServer</a> and <a href=\"http://www.devside.net/server/webdeveloper\">WampDeveloper Pro</a>. There’s nothing wrong with using these packages, although manually installing Apache will help you learn more about the system and its configuration options.</p> \n<h2 id=\"theapacheinstallationwizard\">The Apache Installation Wizard</h2> \n<p>An excellent official <code>.msi</code> installation wizard is available from the <a href=\"http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi\">Apache download page</a>. This option is certainly recommended for novice users or perhaps those installing Apache for the first time.</p> \n<h2 id=\"manualinstallation\">Manual Installation</h2> \n<p>Manual installation offers several benefits:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Backing up, reinstalling, or moving the web server can be achieved in seconds.</li> \n <li>You have more control over how and when Apache starts.</li> \n <li>You can install Apache anywhere, such as a portable USB drive (useful for client demonstrations).</li> \n</ul> \n<h3 id=\"step1configureiis\">Step 1: Configure IIS</h3> \n<p>Apache listens for requests on TCP/IP port 80. You need to uninstall or disable any program that uses that port. If you have a Professional or Server version of Windows, you may already have IIS installed. If you would prefer Apache, either <a href=\"http://support.microsoft.com/kb/321141\">remove IIS as a Windows component or disable its services</a>.</p> \n<h3 id=\"step2downloadthefiles\">Step 2: Download the files</h3> \n<p>We’re going to use the unofficial Windows binary from <a href=\"http://www.apachelounge.com/\">Apache Lounge</a>. This version has performance and stability improvements over the official Apache distribution, although I’m yet to notice a significant difference. However, it’s provided as a manually installable ZIP file from <a href=\"http://www.apachelounge.com/download/\">www.apachelounge.com/download/</a>.</p> \n<p>You should also <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145\">download and install the Windows C++ runtime from Microsoft.com</a>. You may have this installed already, but there is no harm installing it again.</p> \n<p>As always, remember to virus scan all downloads.</p> \n<h3 id=\"step3extractthefiles\">Step 3: Extract the Files</h3> \n<p>We’ll install Apache in <code>C:/Apache24</code>, so extract the ZIP file to the root of the <code>C:/</code> drive. Apache can be installed anywhere on your system, but you’ll need to change <code>SVROOT</code> configuration to point to your unzipped location — suh as <code>E:/Apache24</code>.</p> \n<h3 id=\"step4configureapache\">Step 4: Configure Apache</h3> \n<p>Apache is configured with the text file <code>conf/httpd.conf</code> contained in the Apache folder. Open it with your favorite text editor.</p> \n<p>Note that all file path settings use a forward slash (<code>/</code>) rather than the Windows backslash. If you installed Apache anywhere other than <code>C:/Apache24</code>, now is a good time to search and replace all references to <code>C:/Apache24</code>.</p> \n<p>There are several lines you should change for your production environment:</p> \n<ul> \n <li> <p>Line 60, listen to all requests on port 80:</p> <pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">Listen *:80\n</code></pre> </li> \n <li> <p>Line 162, enable mod-rewrite by removing the # (optional, but useful):</p> <pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so\n</code></pre> </li> \n <li> <p>Line 227, specify the server domain name:</p> <pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">ServerName localhost:80\n</code></pre> </li> \n <li> <p>Line 224, allow <code>.htaccess</code> overrides:</p> <pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">AllowOverride All\n</code></pre> </li> \n</ul> \n<p> Continue reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/how-to-install-apache-on-windows/?utm_source=rss\">How to Install Apache Web Server on Windows</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>. </p> \n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=bMvXXM6WD0Y:gfocj87jjZk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=bMvXXM6WD0Y:gfocj87jjZk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=bMvXXM6WD0Y:gfocj87jjZk:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=bMvXXM6WD0Y:gfocj87jjZk:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div> \n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/bMvXXM6WD0Y\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 30 Jun 2020 16:00:25 +0000","feedId":6128,"bgimg":"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1593595022mar7-outline-02.jpg","linkMd5":"e881aca5e1aafd07dfbee3909e115ed2","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn41@2020_4/2020/08/24/22-51-24-751_ae801ad141f96661.webp","destWidth":1800,"destHeight":1200,"sourceBytes":61584,"destBytes":61584,"author":"Craig Buckler","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1593595022mar7-outline-02.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn41@2020_4/2020/08/24/22-51-24-751_ae801ad141f96661.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn15@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-39-311_6409ebad5acff93a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn3@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-47-113_bf83e999bebef320.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=bMvXXM6WD0Y:gfocj87jjZk:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn38@2020_3/2020/08/24/22-51-42-852_e62a329714c60576.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/bMvXXM6WD0Y":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn39@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-44-992_138ecbd0673d744b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598309483260},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","title":"How to Prepare for a Remote Job Search","link":"https://www.sitepoint.com/?p=175086","description":"<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/how-to-prepare-for-a-remote-job-search/?utm_source=rss\" title=\"How to Prepare for a Remote Job Search\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/1582616267womanworking.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/1582616267womanworking-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/1582616267womanworking-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/1582616267womanworking-1024x683.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /> </a> \n<p><strong>The number of people working remotely is at an all-time high, and that’s not just because telecommuting is pants-optional. By giving employees more control over their schedule and work environment, <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/jobs/\">remote jobs</a> can enhance the work-life balance that so many people struggle to maintain.</strong></p> \n<p>But if you’ve held in-house positions for most of your career, properly preparing for your remote job search can up your chances of impressing remote employers, nailing the interview, and landing a remote job that best fits your needs.</p> \n<h2 id=\"whatareremoteemployerslookingfor\">What Are Remote Employers Looking For?</h2> \n<p>Remote employers are looking for three things in particular.</p> \n<h3 id=\"independence\">Independence</h3> \n<p>The office may at times feel like a panopticonic prison, but there is something to be said for workplace accountability. Can you stay focused without a boss periodically checking in on you? Can you stay productive without the sight and sound of other co-workers clacking away on their computers? When you work from home, the Damocles of the deadline is blunted and the motivating effect of being in close proximity to your team members weakens.</p> \n<p>Remote employers understand these challenges, which is why they look for candidates who can motivate themselves without external prompting. As trite as buzzwords like <em>self-starter</em> and <em>proactive</em> can be, they carry a significant amount of weight in the remote job search. Not only do you need to possess these qualities, you’ll need to be able demonstrate them to potential employers.</p> \n<h3 id=\"communication\">Communication</h3> \n<p>Working in an office allows employees to be more passive. Don’t know what’s going on? A co-worker can fill you in via a few seconds of conversation. Your boss is only a few steps away. Maybe there’s a whiteboard in the break room with announcements. Sharing a space with people just makes it much easier to stay in the loop.</p> \n<p>But if you’re on your own, you need to take initiative. To compensate for the lack of face-to-face, a good remote worker will put effort into the virtual communication tools at their disposal. They’ll reach out to people through email or Slack. They’ll suggest video chats or calls to hash things out. Even swapping memes in a group chat can help you stay engaged. But if you give in to the temptation of solitude, communication could suffer, and so could your work.</p> \n<h3 id=\"rationalthinking\">Rational Thinking</h3> \n<p>When communicating primarily through text, it’s all too common for our imaginations to run wild with unfounded anxieties. Emailed your boss a question and they didn’t respond within whatever time frame you’ve arbitrarily decided was reasonable? They must think it’s a dumb question and you’re dumb for asking it. They must not deem you important enough to expediently respond to. They must be offended by something you wrote. Asked a co-worker to do something and they responded with “k”? They hate you. They’re telling everyone how much they hate you. Everyone hates you. You’re garbage!</p> \n<p>Or … absolutely none of that is true and the coldness of non-verbal communication is messing with your head. Like any good employer, remote employers don’t want drama. They want rational critical thinkers who can vault the pitfalls of remote communication and maintain healthy work relationships. K?</p> \n<h2 id=\"howdoyoudemonstratetheseskillsonyourresume\">How Do You Demonstrate These Skills On Your Resume?</h2> \n<p>Even if you have little to no remote work experience, there are ways to frame your in-house work experience so that it demonstrates remote work skills. What have you done that demonstrates independence? Communication? Rational thinking? Figure it out and integrate it into your resume.</p> \n<p>For example, if you took the initiative on anything in a previous position, emphasize it. Say you <em>independently devised and implemented project x or volunteered to plan, create, and maintain project y</em>. Explain that you <em>created and ran program z with little oversight</em>.</p> \n<p>Here are some other ideas to get you thinking:</p> \n<p> Continue reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/how-to-prepare-for-a-remote-job-search/?utm_source=rss\">How to Prepare for a Remote Job Search</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=H3nrdjjNICg:4UKsWPEk4Ys:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=H3nrdjjNICg:4UKsWPEk4Ys:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=H3nrdjjNICg:4UKsWPEk4Ys:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=H3nrdjjNICg:4UKsWPEk4Ys:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/H3nrdjjNICg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 24 Feb 2020 23:00:50 +0000","feedId":6128,"bgimg":"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/1582616267womanworking.jpg","linkMd5":"85d22393cd36a16ace1f4262b15f6f1e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn46@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-51-27-352_d2db2069dea2b9cb.webp","destWidth":2200,"destHeight":1468,"sourceBytes":36358,"destBytes":36358,"author":"Joshua Kraus","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/1582616267womanworking.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn46@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-51-27-352_d2db2069dea2b9cb.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn15@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-39-311_6409ebad5acff93a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn3@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-47-113_bf83e999bebef320.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=H3nrdjjNICg:4UKsWPEk4Ys:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn46@2020_3/2020/08/24/22-51-41-183_0b681bc5f7e94fe9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/H3nrdjjNICg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn66@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-37-937_a145008cca033c4f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598309483298},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","title":"How to Migrate a React App to TypeScript","link":"https://www.sitepoint.com/?p=175483","description":"<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/how-to-migrate-a-react-app-to-typescript/?utm_source=rss\" title=\"How to Migrate a React App to TypeScript\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584071411os0004_17.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584071411os0004_17-300x250.jpg 300w, https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584071411os0004_17-768x640.jpg 768w, https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584071411os0004_17-1024x853.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /> </a> \n<p>When I first started learning TypeScript, one of the suggestions I often heard was, “convert one of your existing projects! It’s the best way to learn!” Soon after, a friend from Twitter <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfFVygaWCuE\">offered to do</a> just that — show me how to migrate a React app to TypeScript. </p> \n<p>The purpose of this article is to be that friend for you and help you migrate your own project to TypeScript. For context, I will be using pieces from a personal project which I migrated while going through this process myself. </p> \n<h2 id=\"theplan\">The Plan</h2> \n<p>To make this process feel less daunting, we’ll break this down into steps so that you can execute the migration in individual chunks. I always find this helpful when taking on a large task. Here are all the steps we’ll take to migrate our project:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>Add TypeScript</li> \n <li>Add <code>tsconfig.json</code></li> \n <li>Start simple</li> \n <li>Convert all files</li> \n <li>Increase strictness </li> \n <li>Clean it up </li> \n <li>Celebrate</li> \n</ol> \n<p>NOTE: the most important step in this whole process is number 9. Although we can only get there by working through them in sequential order. </p> \n<h3 id=\"1addtypescripttotheproject\">1. Add TypeScript to the Project</h3> \n<p>First, we need to add TypeScript to our project. Assuming your React project was bootstrapped with <code>create-react-app</code>, we can <a href=\"https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/#installation\">follow the docs</a> and run:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npm install --save typescript @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom @types/jest\n</code></pre> \n<p>or if you’re using <code>yarn</code>:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">yarn add typescript @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom @types/jest\n</code></pre> \n<p>Notice we haven’t changed anything to TypeScript yet. If we run the command to start the project locally (<code>yarn start</code> in my case), nothing should be different. If that’s the case, then great! We’re ready for the next step. </p> \n<h3 id=\"2addthetsconfigjson\">2.

The simplest way for us to get started is to scaffold one using this command:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npx tsc --init\n</code></pre> \n<p>This gets us some basics. </p> \n<p>We have not yet interacted with TypeScript. We have only taken the necessary actions to get things ready. Our next step is to migrate a file to TypeScript. With this, we can complete this step and move onto the next.</p> \n<h3 id=\"3startwithasimplecomponent\">3. Start with a Simple Component</h3> \n<p>The beauty of TypeScript is that you can incrementally adopt it. We can start with a simple component for our first piece of this migration.

I’ll also introduce you to <a href=\"https://github.com/jameshibbard/SP-Tools\">SP-Tools</a>, the extension we use at SitePoint to make life as an editor that little bit easier.</p> \n<h2 id=\"theanatomyofachromeextension\">The Anatomy of a Chrome Extension</h2> \n<p>Despite what you might think, building a Chrome extensions isn’t difficult. Let’s start by looking at the various components.</p> \n<p><em>Parts of the following section are borrowed from another tutorial I wrote about <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/build-vue-chrome-extension/\">building a Chrome extension using Vue.js</a>.</em></p> \n<p>The core piece of any Chrome extension is a <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/manifest\">manifest file</a>. This is in a JSON format and provides important information about an extension, such as its version, resources, or the permissions it requires.</p> \n<p>A manifest file won’t do much on its own, so we can use a <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/content_scripts\">content script</a> to add some functionality. Content scripts are files that “run in the context of web pages”. That is to say, you specify the URL in your manifest file, then when your browser visits a page whose address matches the URL you specified, the content script is injected into the page and run.</p> \n<p>To demonstrate these concepts, let’s start by writing a Chrome extension to do something on the SitePoint main site.</p> \n<p>Make a new folder called <code>my-extension</code> and two files, <code>manifest.json</code> and <code>main.js</code>:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">mkdir my-extension\ncd my-extension\ntouch manifest.json main.js\n</code></pre> \n<p>Open up <code>manifest.json</code> and add the following code:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">{\n  \"name\": \"My Extension\",\n  \"version\": \"0.0.1\",\n  \"manifest_version\": 2,\n  \"content_scripts\": [\n    {\n      \"matches\": [ \"*://*.sitepoint.com/*\" ],\n      \"js\": [ \"main.js\" ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</code></pre> \n<p>The <code>name</code>, <code>version</code> and <code>manifest_version</code> are all required fields. The <code>name</code> and <code>version</code> fields can be whatever you want; the <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/manifestVersion\">manifest version</a> should be set to 2 (as of Chrome 18).</p> \n<p>The <code>content_scripts</code> key allows us to register a content script (<code>main.js</code>), which will be run whenever we visit SitePoint. Notice how we can use <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/match_patterns\">match patterns</a> to specify parts of the URL, such as the protocol.</p> \n<p>Now let’s add the following code to <code>main.js</code> to make the browser say hello whenever we visit SitePoint:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">alert('Hello there!');\n</code></pre> \n<p>Finally, let’s install the extension. Open Chrome and enter <code>chrome://extensions/</code> in the address bar. You should see a page displaying the extensions you’ve installed.</p> \n<p>As we want to install our extension from a file (and not the Chrome Web Store) we need to activate <em>Developer mode</em> using the toggle in the top right-hand corner of the page. This should add an extra menu bar with the option <em>Load unpacked</em>. Click this button and select the <code>my-extension</code> folder you created previously. Click <em>Open</em> and the extension will be installed.</p> \n<p>Now when you visit SitePoint, this will happen:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/158348751501-chrome-ext.png\" alt=\"Basic Extension\" /></p> \n<p>Congratulations! You just made a Chrome extension.</p> \n<h3 id=\"backgroundscriptsandmessagepassing\">Background Scripts and Message Passing</h3> \n<p>So, that popup is pretty annoying right? To finish off this section, let’s add a context menu entry to fire it off manually, instead of having it appear on every page load.</p> \n<p>This introduces us to another important component of Chrome extensions — <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/background_pages\">background scripts</a>. These scripts can react to browser events (such as a user clicking a context menu entry) and they have full access to Chrome’s APIs. However, they <em>don’t</em> have access to the current page, and rely on message passing to communicate with content scripts.</p> \n<p>Update the manifest like so:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">{\n  \"name\": \"My Extension\",\n  \"version\": \"0.0.1\",\n  \"manifest_version\": 2,\n  \"permissions\": [ \"contextMenus\" ],\n  \"content_scripts\": [\n    {\n      \"matches\": [ \"*://*.sitepoint.com/*\" ],\n      \"js\": [ \"main.js\" ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"background\": {\n    \"scripts\": [\"background.js\"],\n    \"persistent\": false\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> \n<p>Notice that we’re requesting the <code>contextMenus</code> permission, as we want to add something to the context menu, and that we’ve registered a non-persistent background script. Making the background script non persistent allows it to be unloaded when it’s not needed.</p> \n<p>Next, create a <code>background.js</code> file and add:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(() =&gt; {\n  chrome.contextMenus.create({\n    id: 'greet',\n    title: 'Say hi',\n    contexts: ['page'],\n    documentUrlPatterns: ['*://*.sitepoint.com/*'],\n  });\n});\n\nchrome.contextMenus.onClicked.addListener((info, tab) =&gt; {\n  if (info.menuItemId === 'greet') {\n    chrome.tabs.sendMessage(tab.id, { text: 'greet' }, (res) =&gt; {\n      console.log(res);\n    });\n  }\n});\n</code></pre> \n<p>We register the context menu entry when the extension is installed, then add an event listener to send a message to our content script whenever the entry is clicked.</p> \n<p>Change <code>main.js</code> like so:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener((msg, sender, sendResponse) =&gt; {\n  if (msg.text === 'greet') {\n    alert('hi');\n    sendResponse('I greeted the user');\n  }\n});\n</code></pre> \n<p>Here, we listen for a message from our background script. If it has a text of “greet”, we then fire off the alert and send back a message informing the background script that we did what was requested.</p> \n<p>To try this out, head back to the extensions page (at <code>chrome://extensions/</code>), then click the reload icon and reload any SitePoint page. When you right click, you should now see a context menu entry.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/158349074502-chrome-ext.png\" alt=\"Context menu entry for our extension\" /></p> \n<h2 id=\"enhancingwordpressfunctionalitywithachromeextension\">Enhancing WordPress’ Functionality with a Chrome Extension</h2> \n<p>Now that we’ve familiarized ourselves with the basic components of a Chrome extension, let’s look at how we can make some additions to WordPress’ functionality.</p> \n<p>To follow along with this section, you’ll need a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/article/how-to-install-wordpress/\">working installation of WordPress</a>.

Plenty of existing ticketing and task management systems help teams and individuals track pending work really thoroughly. Sometimes, though, using TODO comments and other markers <em>within</em> a codebase ends up being a more efficient way of keeping tabs on what needs to get done.</p> \n<h2 id=\"whytodocomments\">Why // TODO Comments?</h2> \n<p>TODO comments (or FIXME, HACK, OPTIMIZE, XXX, etc.) are a common way developers indicate that an area of code is worth addressing and returning to. The <a href=\"https://www.tickgit.com/browse?repo=github.com/torvalds/linux\">Linux codebase</a> has 4k+ of these types of comments, <a href=\"https://www.tickgit.com/browse?repo=github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes\">Kubernetes</a> has 2k+.</p> \n<p>If <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/65c137768abf696ee1c79a026d6df3a166dd8553/packages/react-interactions/events/src/dom/__tests__/Tap-test.internal.js#L331\">this</a> sort of thing is a familiar sight, you’ve no doubt seen or used them before:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"text language-text\">    // TODO: Get rid of this condition somehow. Perhaps with a dynamic version\n    // of the @gate pragma.\n</code></pre> \n<h3 id=\"todosareeasy\">TODOs Are Easy</h3> \n<p>To-dos are easy to add and remove. You don’t need to leave your editor. They’re plaintext. You can include links to additional information. They’re flexible. You can even use emojis 😀✏️. You’re not constrained by the field requirements of an external ticketing system. You can be as thorough or succinct as you’d like in describing why you’re annotating an area of code.</p> \n<h3 id=\"nocontextswitching\">No Context Switching</h3> \n<p>To-dos are right next to the code they’re describing, which means you don’t lose the context of the codebase: the surrounding classes, functions, variables, etc. Using an external ticketing system requires you to either switch focus when trying to understand a ticket and the relevant pieces of code, or do a great deal of context-copying to help clarify your task.</p> \n<p>To-dos allow you to maintain your flow when writing code, and are often a lower mental burden than switching to and from tickets in an external system. To-dos, of course, can link back to an existing ticket for additional information if necessary.</p> \n<h3 id=\"trackablewithyourcode\">Trackable with Your Code</h3> \n<p>Since TODO comments are part of your code, they’re stored in version control. They can undergo code-review in your PRs. They have a history and can be attributed to authors, versions, and commits. This can enable project management aware reports about burndown, team responsibilities, tech debt, development efficiency, etc.</p> \n<h2 id=\"thecommandlinetool\">The Command-line Tool</h2> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/augmentable-dev/tickgit\">tickgit</a> command-line tool is an open-source project that scans a Git codebase for TODO comments. It runs a Git blame and outputs results with references to file paths and line numbers.</p> \n<p>It can be used to query ad-hoc for open TODO comments, and supports CSV output for consumption by other tools (spreadsheets, text processors, etc.).</p> \n<p>Here’s an example output:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1594774842output-1024x420.png\" alt=\"example output\" width=\"1024\" height=\"420\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-176664\" /></p> \n<p>The CLI is currently pretty simple, but with plans to improve to enable more use cases, including:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Customization of phrases to match (don’t match XXX but match <code>@TODO</code> in comments)</li> \n <li>Querying and filtering (show me all to-dos added this week, show me only mine, etc.)</li> \n <li>Aggregation queries count by author, average age by author, etc.</li> \n <li>A CI mode to fail with an error if certain criteria are met (no to-dos in certain branches, max 5 to-dos per author, etc.)</li> \n <li>Extract links and customized parsing of comments (extract an assignee, a due date, etc.)</li> \n</ul> \n<p> Continue reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/never-forget-a-todo-comment-with-tickgit-your-repos-project-manager/?utm_source=rss\">Never Forget a TODO Comment with tickgit, Your Repo’s Project Manager</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=bapDbpDeEHc:Pt8N0doXifw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=bapDbpDeEHc:Pt8N0doXifw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=bapDbpDeEHc:Pt8N0doXifw:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=bapDbpDeEHc:Pt8N0doXifw:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/bapDbpDeEHc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 14 Jul 2020 23:00:54 +0000","feedId":6128,"bgimg":"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1594776548tickgit.png","linkMd5":"8a616ebe896cbecdf29a2957dd23d028","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn14@2020_6/2020/08/24/22-51-25-729_71f21ae5ebb035e4.webp","destWidth":600,"destHeight":339,"sourceBytes":8326,"destBytes":8326,"author":"Patrick DeVivo","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1594776548tickgit.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn14@2020_6/2020/08/24/22-51-25-729_71f21ae5ebb035e4.webp","https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1594774808interface-1024x648.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn75@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-47-246_512b1c83904a444b.webp","https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1594774842output-1024x420.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn25@2020_4/2020/08/24/22-51-38-415_a5dca6b983c7d2a2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn15@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-39-311_6409ebad5acff93a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn3@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-47-113_bf83e999bebef320.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=bapDbpDeEHc:Pt8N0doXifw:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn46@2020_3/2020/08/24/22-51-35-409_615c172ccc8183f9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/bapDbpDeEHc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn40@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-51-39-450_d5cfe952fd33f801.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598309483257},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","title":"6 Top JavaScript UI Frameworks &#038;

There are countless UI frameworks and libraries for building complex, reactive apps that scale well.</p> \n<p>Some will help you write more efficient, maintainable code. Or you need help designing a set of consistent, interoperable, and fast UI components. In almost any situation, you can find an option that does much of the heavy lifting for you. There’s no need to start from scratch and reinvent the wheel.</p> \n<p>The most popular JavaScript frameworks available present some common capabilities. In particular, they:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>can keep state and view synchronized</li> \n <li>offer routing functionality</li> \n <li>let developers build, reuse, and maintain user interface components…</li> \n <li>… that are efficient and fast to respond to user interaction.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>The number of JS frameworks available is high and that number continues to grow. Take a look at these options. I’ve listed both stable, popular libraries and newer options for the curious.</p> \n<p>Let’s jump in with a sleek, enterprise-level JavaScript framework — Ext JS by Sencha.</p> \n<h2>1.

React</h2> \n<p><img src=\"https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1593782999fb.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook\" width=\"1527\" height=\"755\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-176544\" /></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://reactjs.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">React</a> is enormously popular among front-end developers. It’s an open-source JavaScript library for building blazingly fast, interactive UIs. React was first created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer working for Facebook. It was first deployed on Facebook’s newsfeed in 2011, and on Instagram in 2012. It’s used by the likes of Netflix, Airbnb, Instagram, and the New York Times, to name a few.</p> \n<p>Reasons for choosing React to power your next project include:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>React is quick to learn and use. It’s JavaScript with a small API.</li> \n <li>code components are stable and reusable. They’re a breeze to create and maintain using the API’s declarative syntax.</li> \n <li>A big company and a strong community support React.</li> \n <li>The library is stack agnostic, can also render on the server using Node.js, and on mobile apps with React Native.</li> \n</ul> \n<h2>3. Angular</h2> \n<p><img src=\"https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1593783142Angular.png\" alt=\"Angular\" width=\"1503\" height=\"813\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-176545\" /><br /> <a href=\"https://angular.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Angular</a> is a free, open-source framework by Google that works for both desktop and mobile.</p> \n<p>There’s a learning curve, including getting familiar with TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript. Despite that, Angular remains a great framework to work with. Here are some of the reasons for using it:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>cross-platform – progressive web apps, native mobile apps, and desktop</li> \n <li>offers speed and performance</li> \n <li>has great features like filters, two-way data binding, directives, and more</li> \n <li>makes available awesome tooling for faster development</li> \n <li>has full support from Google and a strong community of developers behind it.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>For more details, don’t miss <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/angular-introduction/\"><em>Angular Introduction: What It Is, and Why You Should Use It</em></a> by <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/author/ibodrov\">Ilya Bodrov-Krukowski</a>.</p> \n<h2>4. Vue</h2> \n<p><img src=\"https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1593783301Vue_js.png\" alt=\"Vue\" width=\"1503\" height=\"1015\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-176546\" /><br /> <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vue JS</a> is a free and open-source progressive JavaScript framework created by <a href=\"https://github.com/yyx990803/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Evan You</a>. It uses a template syntax (like Angular) and relies on a component-based architecture (like React).</p> \n<p>Here’s how Vue describes itself in its own <a href=\"https://github.com/vuejs/vue\" rel=\"nofollow\">GitHub repository page</a>:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>Vue (pronounced <code>/vjuː/</code>, like view) is a <strong>progressive framework</strong> for building user interfaces. It is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable, and can easily scale between a library and a framework depending on different use cases. It consists of an approachable core library that focuses on the view layer only, and an ecosystem of supporting libraries that helps you tackle complexity in large Single-Page Applications.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>Here are some of Vue’s strongest points:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>developer-friendly. If you know the languages of the web (HTML, CSS and JavaScript), the Vue docs are all you need to start building right away.</li> \n <li>you can integrate it within a project progressively. It easily scales from a library to a full-fledged framework.</li> \n <li>small and comes with a super-fast virtual DOM.</li> \n <li>has an amazing community behind it, which makes it a stable framework to adopt.</li> \n <li>offers great documentation.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>If you’d like to delve deeper, read <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/vue-right-framework/\"><em>How to Tell If Vue.js Is the Right Framework for Your Next Project</em></a> by <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/author/kgawron\">Karolina Gawron</a>.</p> \n<h2>5. Ember</h2> \n<p><img src=\"https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1593783359Ember_js_A_framework_for_ambitious_web_developers.png\" alt=\"Ember\" width=\"1483\" height=\"538\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-176547\" /><br /> Released in December 2011 by <a href=\"https://yehudakatz.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yehuda Katz</a> and <a href=\"https://tomdale.net/about-me/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tom Dale</a>, <a href=\"https://emberjs.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ember</a> is:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>A framework for ambitious web developers.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>Ember.js is a productive, battle-tested JavaScript framework for building modern web applications. It includes everything you need to build rich UIs that work on any device.</p> \n<p>This JavaScript framework is free, open-source, and has a strong community behind it. Here are some of the reasons why Ember is successful among developers:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>leverages the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration\" rel=\"nofollow\">convention over configuration</a> approach championed by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Heinemeier_Hansson\" rel=\"nofollow\">David Heinemeier Hansson.</a> It aims to lower the number of decisions that a developer has to make (without sacrificing flexibility).</li> \n <li>almost all you need to set up your app comes with Ember out of the box.</li> \n <li>backwards-compatible.</li> \n <li>quick to adopt the latest web standards and JavaScript features.</li> \n <li>offers great docs and resources.</li> \n</ul> \n<h2>6. Svelte 3</h2> \n<p><img src=\"https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1593783451svelte.png\" alt=\"Svelte\" width=\"1503\" height=\"1015\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-176548\" /><br /> Though it’s growing up quickly, <a href=\"https://svelte.dev/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Svelte 3</a> is the new kid on the frameworks block. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Rich_Harris\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rich Harris</a> released Svelte in November 2016 as an open-source project. <a href=\"https://svelte.dev/blog/svelte-3-rethinking-reactivity\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Version 3</strong></a> came out in April 2019 and was a complete overhaul.</p> \n<p>Svelte works differently from most frameworks listed so far. In particular:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>Whereas traditional frameworks like React and Vue do the bulk of their work in the <em>browser</em>, Svelte shifts that work into a <em>compile step</em> that happens when you build your app.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>Many frameworks use using techniques like virtual DOM diffing. Instead, Svelte surgically updates the DOM when the state of your app changes. Compiling code creates noticeable performance benefits.</p> \n<p>Svelte is quick for beginners to get started with. You can build components without lots of boilerplate code. Just use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The Svelte site features beginner-friendly resources. These include a tutorial, examples, and a detailed API for more seasoned Svelte devs. For help and support, you’re invited to join the dedicated <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/yy75DKs\" rel=\"nofollow\">Discord server</a>.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion</h2> \n<p>Choosing a framework is always a circumstancial decision. It involves paying attention to what your specific project’s challenges are. It also means considering your team’s experience and preferences.</p> \n<p>For example, if your team needs to build data-intensive, enterprise-level projects that need a secure, reliable, and comprehensive framework with a large set of components that work well with each other, <a href=\"https://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/\" rel=\"sponsored\">Ext JS by Sencha</a> is a great option. You’ll never have to go out of the framework to search for components. For projects that start small but need flexibility and scaling capabilities, Vue could work well. And if your front-end team has extensive React expertise, going with React could be your best bet.</p> \n<p>Do you have any other JS UI frameworks or library you’d like to suggest?

For many organizations, the enforced move to remote working over the past few months has presented significant challenges.</strong></p> \n<p>On the other hand, there are many employees who, despite being reticent to move to remote working at the beginning of the pandemic, are now finding that remote work actually suits them rather well.</p> \n<p>If you fall into this category, you might be wondering how you can continue to work from home after the current crisis ends. Many of the strategies you can deploy to achieve this are, in fact, similar to those that make for effective remote working in the first place: ensuring <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/10-tips-for-effective-collaboration-in-remote-teams/\">effective collaboration in remote teams</a>, and making sure that you set yourself up <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/remote-work-tips-tricks-and-best-practices-for-success/\">for success with remote work</a>, to name a couple things.</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, your employer might be hesitant to let you continue to work remotely after the pandemic is over. If you don’t want to move back to the office, you’ll find some tips in this article on how to convince your boss to let you continue working from home.</p> \n<h2 id=\"thebenefitsofremoteworking\">The Benefits of Remote Working</h2> \n<p>If you don’t want to move back to your office in the next few months, you’re not alone. In fact, <a href=\"https://journal.getabstract.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ga_remote_survey_2020_compressed.pdf\">nearly 43% of full-time American employees</a> say they want to work remotely more often even after the economy has reopened. One of the biggest reasons for this is the time that the average tech worker saves in commuting. The average American <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/10/07/nine-days-road-average-commute-time-reached-new-record-last-year/\">spent roughly 27 minutes</a> on their one-way commute to the office in 2018, which equates to more than 200 hours spent commuting per year.</p> \n<p>For tech companies, there are other benefits of remote working. Many software development firms are inherently multi-national, and co-ordinating employees across the globe can actually be easier if they’re working from home. As we’ve previously pointed out, <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/the-real-future-of-remote-work-is-asynchronous/\">the future of remote work is asynchronous</a>. Research has also found that the kind of creativity and flexibility that tech firms value is actually <a href=\"https://www.outsite.co/blog/how-remote-work-enhances-creativity-productivity\">increased by remote working</a> rather than decreased.</p> \n<p>Despite these findings, many organizations are still hesitant to let their employees work from home — at least once the global health crisis is over.

In this article, we’re going to walk through installing the Deno runtime, and creating a command-line weather program that will take a city name as an argument and return the weather forecast for the next 24 hours.</strong></p> \n<p>To write code for Deno, I’d highly recommend <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\">Visual Studio Code</a> with the official <a href=\"https://github.com/denoland/vscode_deno\">Deno plugin</a>. To make things a little more interesting, we’re going to be writing the app in TypeScript.</p> \n<h2 id=\"installingdeno\">Installing Deno</h2> \n<p>Firstly, let’s get Deno installed locally so we can begin writing our script. The process is straightforward, as there are installer scripts for all three major operating systems.</p> \n<h3 id=\"windows\">Windows</h3> \n<p>On windows, you can install Deno from PowerShell:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">iwr https://deno.land/x/install/install.ps1 -useb | iex\n</code></pre> \n<h3 id=\"linux\">Linux</h3> \n<p>From the Linux terminal, you can use the following command:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">curl -fsSL https://deno.land/x/install/install.sh |  sh\n</code></pre> \n<h3 id=\"macos\">macOS</h3> \n<p>On a Mac, Deno can be installed with Brew:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">brew install deno\n</code></pre> \n<h3 id=\"afterinstalling\">After installing</h3> \n<p>Once the install process is finished, you can check that Deno has been correctly installed by running the following command:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">deno --version\n</code></pre> \n<p>You should now see something similar to this:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">deno 1.2.0\nv8 8.5.216\ntypescript 3.9.2\n</code></pre> \n<p>Let’s create a folder for our new project (inside your home folder, or wherever you like to keep your coding projects) and add an <code>index.ts</code> file:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">mkdir weather-app\ncd weather-app\ncode index.ts\n</code></pre> \n<p><em>Note: as I mentioned above, I’m using VS Code for this tutorial. If you’re using a different editor, replace the last line above.</em></p> \n<h2 id=\"gettinguserinput\">Getting User Input</h2> \n<p>Our program is going to retrieve the weather forecast for a given city, so we’ll need to accept the city name as an argument when the program is run. Arguments supplied to a Deno script are available as <code>Deno.args</code>. Let’s log this variable out to the console to see how it works:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"ts language-ts\">console.log(Deno.args);\n</code></pre> \n<p>Now run the script, with the following command:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">deno run index.ts --city London\n</code></pre> \n<p>You should see the following output:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">[ \"--city\", \"London\" ]\n</code></pre> \n<p>Although we could parse this argument array ourselves, <a href=\"https://deno.land/std\">Deno’s standard library</a> includes a module called <a href=\"https://deno.land/std/flags\">flags</a> that will take care of this for us. To use it, all we have to do is add an import statement to the top of our file:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"ts language-ts\">import { parse } from  \"https://deno.land/std@0.61.0/flags/mod.ts\";\n</code></pre> \n<p><em>Note: the examples in the docs for standard library modules will give you an unversioned URL (such as <code>https://deno.land/std/flags/mod.ts</code>), which will always point to the latest version of the code. It’s good practice to specify a version in your imports, to ensure your program isn’t broken by future updates.</em>*</p> \n<p>Let’s use the imported function to parse the arguments array into something more useful:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"ts language-ts\">const args = parse(Deno.args);\n</code></pre> \n<p>We’ll also change the script to log out our new <code>args</code> variable, to see what that looks like. So now your code should look like this:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"ts language-ts\">import { parse } from  \"https://deno.land/std@0.61.0/flags/mod.ts\";\n\nconst args = parse(Deno.args);\n\nconsole.log(args);\n</code></pre> \n<p>Now, if you run the script with the same argument as before, you should see the following output:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">Download https://deno.land/std@0.61.0/flags/mod.ts\nDownload https://deno.land/std@0.61.0/_util/assert.ts\nCheck file:///home/njacques/code/weather-app/index.ts\n{ _: [], city: \"London\" }\n</code></pre> \n<p>Whenever Deno runs a script, it checks for new import statements. Any remotely hosted imports are downloaded, compiled, and cached for future use. The <code>parse</code> function has provided us with an object, which has a <code>city</code> property containing our input.</p> \n<p><em>Note: if you need to re-download the imports for a script for any reason, you can run <code>deno cache --reload index.ts</code>.</em></p> \n<p>We should also add a check for the <code>city</code> argument, and quit the program with an error message if it’s not supplied:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"ts language-ts\">if (args.city === undefined) {\n    console.error(\"No city supplied\");\n    Deno.exit();\n}\n</code></pre> \n<p> Continue reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/deno-build-command-line-weather-app/?utm_source=rss\">Build a Command Line Weather App in Deno</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=klaI9EOzrnU:G0TeSY_ZqsY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=klaI9EOzrnU:G0TeSY_ZqsY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=klaI9EOzrnU:G0TeSY_ZqsY:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=klaI9EOzrnU:G0TeSY_ZqsY:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/klaI9EOzrnU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Sun, 09 Aug 2020 21:54:16 +0000","feedId":6128,"bgimg":"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1597028804deno-runtime.png","linkMd5":"731bb5ef4f7a9811f29bb451f9511360","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn65@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-51-26-997_c9be10a526f5dc36.webp","destWidth":600,"destHeight":340,"sourceBytes":6618,"destBytes":6618,"author":"Nilson Jacques","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1597028804deno-runtime.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn65@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-51-26-997_c9be10a526f5dc36.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn15@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-39-311_6409ebad5acff93a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn3@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-47-113_bf83e999bebef320.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=klaI9EOzrnU:G0TeSY_ZqsY:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn80@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-40-704_eb14a5f70a4731ce.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/klaI9EOzrnU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn4@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-51-40-673_b0ef7706a9ea2703.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598309483247},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","title":"How to Use jQuery&#8217;s ajax() Function for Asynchronous HTTP Requests","link":"http://www.sitepoint.com/?p=88556","description":"<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/use-jquerys-ajax-function/?utm_source=rss\" title=\"How to Use jQuery’s ajax() Function for Asynchronous HTTP Requests\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/1588210620jquery-ajax.png\" alt=\"How to Use jQuery's $.ajax() for Asynchronous HTTP Requests\" srcset=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/1588210620jquery-ajax-300x170.png 300w, https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/1588210620jquery-ajax.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /> </a> \n<p><strong>Nowadays, developers tend to move away from <a style=\"font-weight:bold\" href=\"https://jquery.com/\">jQuery</a> and its handy methods for DOM manipulation and Ajax requests that made it hugely popular. Regarding the Ajax requests, the <a style=\"font-weight:bold\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API\">Fetch API</a>, or alternatively, the <a style=\"font-weight:bold\" href=\"https://github.com/axios/axios\">Axios library</a>, are now more popular tools for performing asynchronous operations. That said, jQuery is still very much alive and <a style=\"font-weight:bold\" href=\"https://trends.builtwith.com/javascript/jQuery\">powers almost 70,000 websites</a> worldwide. This means that knowing how to use jQuery is still valuable in the day-to-day work of developers, like supporting legacy codebases or maintaining projects that use jQuery as an important dependency.</strong></p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.sitepoint.com/javascript/ajax-javascript/\">Ajax</a> is a technology that allows developers to make asynchronous HTTP requests without the need for a full page refresh. To make the process less cumbersome than it would be in pure JavaScript, devs have been using the jQuery library for years. In my article <a href=\"http://www.sitepoint.com/introduction-jquery-shorthand-ajax-methods\">An Introduction to jQuery’s Shorthand Ajax Methods</a>, I discussed some of jQuery’s most-used Ajax shorthand methods: <code>$.get()</code>, <code>$.post()</code>, and <code>$.load()</code>. They are convenient methods for making Ajax requests in a few lines of code.</p> \n<p>Sometimes, we need more control over the Ajax calls we want to make. For example, we want to specify what should happen in case an Ajax call fails or we need to perform an Ajax request but its result is only needed if retrieved within a certain amount of time. In such situations, we can rely on another function provided by jQuery, called <code>$.ajax()</code>, that is the topic of this tutorial.</p> \n<h2 id=\"thedajaxfunction\">The <code>$.ajax()</code> Function</h2> \n<p>The jQuery <a href=\"https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/\"><code>$.ajax()</code></a> function is used to perform an asynchronous HTTP request. It was added to the library a long time ago, existing since version 1.0. The <code>$.ajax()</code> function is what every function discussed in the previously mentioned article calls behind the scene using a preset configuration. The signatures of this function are shown below:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">$.ajax(url[, settings])\n$.ajax([settings])\n</code></pre> \n<p>The <code>url</code> parameter is a string containing the URL you want to reach with the Ajax call, while <code>settings</code> is an object literal containing the configuration for the Ajax request.</p> \n<p>In its first form, this function performs an Ajax request using the <code>url</code> parameter and the options specified in <code>settings</code>. In the second form, the URL is specified in the <code>settings</code> parameter, or can be omitted, in which case the request is made to the current page.</p> \n<p>The list of the options accepted by this function, described in the next section, is very long, so I’ll keep their description short. In case you want to study their meaning in depth, you can refer to the official documentation of <code>$.ajax()</code>.</p> \n<h3 id=\"thesettingsparameter\">The <code>settings</code> Parameter</h3> \n<p>There are a lot of different options you can specify to bend <code>$.ajax()</code> to your needs.

We can have well-written pieces of code, but if we don’t have good organization, we’ll have a hard time as the complexity increases. There’s no need to wait until the project is half-way done to start thinking about the architecture; the best time is before starting, using our goals as beacons for our choices.</strong></p> \n<p>Node.js doesn’t have a de facto framework with strong opinions on architecture and code organization in the same way that Ruby has the Rails framework, for example. As such, it can be difficult to get started with building full web applications with Node.</p> \n<p>In this tutorial, we’re going to build the basic functionality of a note-taking app using the MVC architecture. To accomplish this, we’re going to employ the <a href=\"https://hapi.dev/\">Hapi.js</a> framework for <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/\">Node.js</a> and <a href=\"http://www.sqlite.org/\">SQLite</a> as a database, using <a href=\"https://sequelize.org/v3/\">Sequelize.js</a>, plus other small utilities, to speed up our development. We’re going to build the views using <a href=\"https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html\">Pug</a>, the templating language.</p> \n<h2 id=\"whatismvc\">What is MVC?</h2> \n<p>Model-View-Controller (or MVC) is probably one of the most popular architectures for applications. As with a lot of other <a href=\"https://youtu.be/NdSD07U5uBs?t=29m2s\">cool things in computer history</a>, the MVC model was conceived at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARC_(company)\">PARC</a> for the Smalltalk language as a solution to the problem of organizing applications with graphical user interfaces. It was created for desktop applications, but since then, the idea has been adapted to other mediums including the Web.</p> \n<p>We can describe the MVC architecture in simple terms:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Model</strong>: the part of our application that will deal with the database or any data-related functionality.</li> \n <li><strong>View</strong>: everything the user will see — basically, the pages that we’re going to send to the client.</li> \n <li><strong>Controller</strong>: the logic of our site, and the glue between models and views. Here we call our models to get the data, then we put that data on our views to be sent to the users.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Our application will allow us to create, view, edit and delete plain-text notes. It won’t have other functionality, but because we’ll have a solid architecture already defined we won’t have a lot of trouble adding things later.</p> \n<p>This tutorial assumes you have a recent version of Node installed on your machine. If this isn’t the case, please consult our <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/quick-tip-multiple-versions-node-nvm/\">tutorial on getting up and running with Node</a>.</p> \n<p>You can check out the final application in the <a href=\"https://github.com/sitepoint-editors/notes-board\">accompanying GitHub repository</a>, so you get a general overview of the application structure.</p> \n<h2 id=\"layingoutthefoundation\">Laying out the Foundation</h2> \n<p>The first step when building any Node.js application is to create a <code>package.json</code> file, which is going to contain all of our dependencies and scripts. Instead of creating this file manually, npm can do the job for us using the <code>init</code> command:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">mkdir notes-board\ncd notes-board\nnpm init -y\n</code></pre> \n<p>After the process is complete, we’ll have a <code>package.json</code> file ready to use.</p> \n<p><em>Note: if you’re not familiar with these commands, checkout our <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/beginners-guide-node-package-manager/\">Beginner’s Guide to npm</a>.</em></p> \n<p>We’re going to proceed to install Hapi.js — the framework of choice for this tutorial. It provides a good balance between simplicity, stability and features that will work well for our use case (although there are other options that would also work just fine).</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npm install @hapi/hapi@18.4.0\n</code></pre> \n<p>This command will download Hapi.js and add it to our <code>package.json</code> file as a dependency.</p> \n<p><em>Note: We’ve specified v18.4.0 of Hapi.js, as it’s compatible with Node versions 8, 10, and 12. If you’re using Node 12, you can opt to install the latest version (Hapi v19.1.0).</em></p> \n<p>Now we can create our entry file — the web server that will start everything. Go ahead and create a <code>server.js</code> file in your application directory and add the following code to it:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">\"use strict\";\n\nconst Hapi = require(\"@hapi/hapi\");\nconst Settings = require(\"./settings\");\n\nconst init = async () =&gt; {\n  const server = new Hapi.Server({ port: Settings.port });\n\n  server.route({\n    method: \"GET\",\n    path: \"/\",\n    handler: (request, h) =&gt; {\n      return \"Hello, world!\";\n    }\n  });\n\n  await server.start();\n  console.log(`Server running at: ${server.info.uri}`);\n};\n\nprocess.on(\"unhandledRejection\", err =&gt; {\n  console.log(err);\n  process.exit(1);\n});\n\ninit();\n</code></pre> \n<p>This is going to be the foundation of our application.</p> \n<p>First, we indicate that we’re going to use <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode\">strict mode</a>, which is a <a href=\"https://hapi.dev/policies/styleguide/#strict-mode\">common practice</a> when using the Hapi.js framework.</p> \n<p>Next, we include our dependencies and instantiate a new server object where we set the connection port to <code>3000</code> (the port can be any number <a href=\"http://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xml\">above 1023 and below 65535</a>).</p> \n<p>Our first route for our server will work as a test to see if everything is working, so a “Hello, world!” message is enough for us. In each route, we have to define the HTTP method and path (URL) that it will respond to, and a handler, which is a function that will process the HTTP request. The handler function can take two arguments: <code>request</code> and <code>h</code>. The first one contains information about the HTTP call, and the second will provide us with methods to handle our response to that call.</p> \n<p>Finally, we start our server with the <code>server.start()</code> method.</p> \n<h2 id=\"storingoursettings\">Storing Our Settings</h2> \n<p>It’s good practice to store our configuration variables in a dedicated file. This file exports a JSON object containing our data, where each key is assigned from an environment variable — but without forgetting a fallback value.</p> \n<p>In this file, we can also have different settings depending on our environment (such as development or production). For example, we can have an in-memory instance of SQLite for development purposes, but a real SQLite database file on production.</p> \n<p>Selecting the settings depending on the current environment is quite simple. Since we also have an <code>env</code> variable in our file which will contain either <code>development</code> or <code>production</code>, we can do something like the following to get the database settings:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">const dbSettings = Settings[Settings.env].db;\n</code></pre> \n<p>So <code>dbSettings</code> will contain the setting of an in-memory database when the <code>env</code> variable is <code>development</code>, or will contain the path of a database file when the <code>env</code> variable is <code>production</code>.</p> \n<p>Also, we can add support for a <code>.env</code> file, where we can store our environment variables locally for development purposes. This is accomplished using a package like <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv\">dotenv</a> for Node.js, which will read a <code>.env</code> file from the root of our project and automatically add the found values to the environment.</p> \n<p><em>Note: if you decide to also use a <code>.env</code> file, make sure you install the package with <code>npm install dotenv</code> and add it to <code>.gitignore</code> so you don’t publish any sensitive information.</em></p> \n<p>Our <code>settings.js</code> file will look like this:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">// This will load our .env file and add the values to process.env,\n// IMPORTANT: Omit this line if you don't want to use this functionality\nrequire(\"dotenv\").config({ silent: true });\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  port: process.env.PORT || 3000,\n  env: process.env.NODE_ENV || \"development\",\n\n  // Environment-dependent settings\n  development: {\n    db: {\n      dialect: \"sqlite\",\n      storage: \":memory:\"\n    }\n  },\n  production: {\n    db: {\n      dialect: \"sqlite\",\n      storage: \"db/database.sqlite\"\n    }\n  }\n};\n</code></pre> \n<p>Now we can start our application by executing the following command and navigating to <a href=\"http://localhost:3000\">http://localhost:3000</a> in our web browser:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">node server.js\n</code></pre> \n<p><em>Note: this project was tested on Node v12.15.0. If you get any errors, ensure you have an updated installation.</em></p> \n<h2 id=\"definingtheroutes\">Defining the Routes</h2> \n<p>The definition of routes gives us an overview of the functionality supported by our application. To create our additional routes, we just have to replicate the structure of the route that we already have in our <code>server.js</code> file, changing the content of each one.</p> \n<p>Let’s start by creating a new directory called <code>lib</code> in our project. Here we’re going to include all the JS components.</p> \n<p>Inside <code>lib</code>, let’s create a <code>routes.js</code> file and add the following content:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">\"use strict\";\nconst Path = require(\"path\");\n\nmodule.exports = [\n  // we’re going to define our routes here\n];\n</code></pre> \n<p>In this file, we’ll export an array of objects that contain each route of our application. To define the first route, add the following object to the array:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">{\n  method: \"GET\",\n  path: \"/\",\n  handler: (request, h) =&gt; {\n    return \"All the notes will appear here\";\n  },\n  config: {\n    description: \"Gets all the notes available\"\n  }\n},\n</code></pre> \n<p>Our first route is for the home page (<code>/</code>), and since it will only return information, we assign it a <code>GET</code> method. For now, it will only give us the message “All the notes will appear here”, which we’re going to change later for a controller function. The <code>description</code> field in the <code>config</code> section is only for documentation purposes.</p> \n<p>Then, we create the four routes for our notes under the <code>/note/</code> path. Since we’re building a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete\">CRUD</a> application, we’ll need one route for each action with the corresponding <a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_httpmethods.asp\">HTTP methods</a>.</p> \n<p>Add the following definitions next to the previous route:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">{\n  method: \"POST\",\n  path: \"/note\",\n  handler: (request, h) =&gt; {\n    return \"New note\";\n  },\n  config: {\n    description: \"Adds a new note\"\n  }\n},\n{\n  method: \"GET\",\n  path: \"/note/{slug}\",\n  handler: (request, h) =&gt; {\n    return \"This is a note\";\n  },\n  config: {\n    description: \"Gets the content of a note\"\n  }\n},\n{\n  method: \"PUT\",\n  path: \"/note/{slug}\",\n  handler: (request, h) =&gt; {\n    return \"Edit a note\";\n  },\n  config: {\n    description: \"Updates the selected note\"\n  }\n},\n{\n  method: \"GET\",\n  path: \"/note/{slug}/delete\",\n  handler: (request, h) =&gt; {\n    return \"This note no longer exists\";\n  },\n  config: {\n    description: \"Deletes the selected note\"\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> \n<p>We’ve done the same as in the previous route definition, but this time we’ve changed the method to match the action we want to execute.</p> \n<p>The only exception is the delete route. In this case, we’re going to define it with the <code>GET</code> method rather than <code>DELETE</code> and add an extra <code>/delete</code> in the path. This way, we can call the delete action just by visiting the corresponding URL.</p> \n<p><em>Note: if you plan to implement a strict REST interface, then you would have to use the <code>DELETE</code> method and remove the <code>/delete</code> part of the path.</em></p> \n<p>We can name parameters in the path by surrounding the word in curly braces. Since we’re going to identify notes by a slug, we add <code>{slug}</code> to each path, with the exception of the <code>POST</code> route; we don’t need it there because we’re not going to interact with a specific note, but to create one.</p> \n<p>You can read more about Hapi.js routes on the <a href=\"https://hapi.dev/tutorials/routing/?lang=en_US\">official documentation</a>.</p> \n<p>Now, we have to add our new routes to the <code>server.js</code> file.

To help navigate your course, below is a list of essential React tools for 2020.</strong></p> \n<h2 id=\"hooks\">Hooks</h2> \n<ul> \n <li>website: <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html\">reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html</a></li> \n <li>repository: <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/v16.8.0\">github.com/facebook/react</a></li> \n <li>GitHub stars: 140,000+</li> \n <li>developer: Facebook</li> \n <li>version: 16.8</li> \n <li>contributors: 1,300+</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Hooks are a new addition to React as of version 16.8. They unlock useful features in classless components. With Hooks, React no longer needs lifecycle methods such as <code>componentDidMount</code> to manage state. This encourages separation of concerns because components are not managing their own state. Putting a lot of state management inside class components blows up complexity. This makes stateful components harder to maintain. Hooks attempt to alleviate this problem by providing key features.</p> \n<p>The following basic Hooks are available:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>useState: for mutating state in a classless component without lifecycle methods</li> \n <li>useEffect: for executing functions post-render, useful for firing Ajax requests</li> \n <li>useContext: for switching component context data, even outside component props</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Pros:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>mitigates state management complexity</li> \n <li>supports functional components</li> \n <li>encourages separation of concerns</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Cons:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>context data switching can exponentiate cognitive load</li> \n</ul> \n<h2 id=\"functionalcomponents\">Functional Components</h2> \n<ul> \n <li>website: <a href=\"https://reactjs.org\">reactjs.org</a></li> \n <li>repository: <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/v16.12.0\">github.com/facebook/react</a></li> \n <li>GitHub stars: 140,000+</li> \n <li>developer: Facebook</li> \n <li>current version: 16.12</li> \n <li>contributors: 1,300+</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Functional components are a declarative way to create JSX markup without class components. They embrace the functional paradigm because they don’t manage state in lifecycle methods. This emphasizes focus on the UI markup without much logic. Because the component relies on props it becomes easier to test. Props have a <em>one-to-one</em> relationship with the rendered output.</p> \n<p>This is what a functional component looks like in React:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">const SimpleComponent = ({isInit, data}) =&gt;\n&lt;&gt;\n  {useEffect(() =&gt; {!isInt &amp;&amp; loadAjaxData()})}\n  {data}\n&lt;/&gt;\n</code></pre> \n<p>Pros:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>focuses on the UI only</li> \n <li>testable component</li> \n <li>less cognitive load when thinking about the component</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Cons:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>no lifecycle methods</li> \n</ul> \n<h2 id=\"createreactapp\">Create React App</h2> \n<ul> \n <li>website: <a href=\"https://create-react-app.dev/\">create-react-app.dev</a></li> \n <li>repository: <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app\">github.com/facebook/create-react-app</a></li> \n <li>GitHub stars: 76,000+</li> \n <li>developer: Facebook</li> \n <li>current version: 3.4</li> \n <li>contributors: 700+</li> \n</ul> \n<p>The quintessential tool to fire up a new React project. This manages all React dependencies via a single npm package. No more dealing with Babel, webpack, and whatnot. The entire dependency tool chain gets upgraded with <code>react-scripts</code> in <code>package.json</code>. There’s a way to integrate Create React App with any server-side rendering tool out there. The tool outputs <code>index.html</code> and static assets in the <code>public</code> folder. This public folder is the touch point where static assets are ready for integration.</p> \n<p>It’s easy to get started:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"shell language-shell\">npx create-react-app my-killer-app\n</code></pre> \n<p>And it’s even easier to upgrade later:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"shell language-shell\">npm i react-scripts@latest\n</code></pre> \n<p>Pros:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>easy to get started</li> \n <li>easy to upgrade</li> \n <li>single meta-dependency</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Cons:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>no server-side rendering, but allows for integration</li> \n</ul> \n<h2 id=\"proxyserver\">Proxy Server</h2> \n<ul> \n <li>website: <a href=\"https://create-react-app.dev/docs/proxying-api-requests-in-development\">create-react-app.dev/docs/proxying-api-requests-in-development</a></li> \n <li>repository: <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/tree/v0.2.3\">github.com/facebook/create-react-app</a></li> \n <li>GitHub stars: 76,000+</li> \n <li>developer: Facebook</li> \n <li>version: 0.2.3</li> \n <li>contributors: 700+</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Starting from version <code>react-scripts@0.2.3</code> or higher, it’s possible to proxy API requests. This allows the back-end API and local Create React App project to co-exist. From the client side, making a request to <code>/my-killer-api/get-data</code> routes the request through the proxy server. This seamless integration works both in local dev and post-build. If local dev runs on port <code>localhost:3000</code>, then API requests go through the proxy server. Once you deploy static assets, then it goes through whatever back end hosts these assets.</p> \n<p>To set a proxy server in <code>package.json</code>:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">\"proxy\": \"http://localhost/my-killer-api-base-url\"\n</code></pre> \n<p>If the back-end API is hosted with a relative path, set the home page:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">\"homepage\": \"/relative-path\"\n</code></pre> \n<p>Pros:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>seamless integration with back-end API</li> \n <li>eliminates CORS issues</li> \n <li>easy set up</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Con</p> \n<ul> \n <li>might need a server-side proxy layer with multiple APIs</li> \n</ul> \n<h2 id=\"proptypes\">PropTypes</h2> \n<ul> \n <li>website: <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/prop-types\">npmjs.com/package/prop-types</a></li> \n <li>repository: <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/prop-types\">github.com/facebook/prop-types</a></li> \n <li>GitHub stars: 3,000+</li> \n <li>developer: Facebook</li> \n <li>current version: 15.7.2</li> \n <li>contributors: 35+</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Declares the type intended for the React component and documents its intent.

This tool comes with a store that manages state data. State mutation is only possible via a dispatch message. The message object contains a type that signals to the reducer which mutation to fire. The recommendation is to keep everything in the app in a single store. Redux supports multiple reducers in a single store. Reducers have a one-to-one relationship between input parameters and output state. This makes reducers pure functions.</p> \n<p>A typical reducer that mutates state might look like this:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">const simpleReducer = (state = {}, action) =&gt; {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'SIMPLE_UPDATE_DATA':\n      return {...state, data: action.payload};\n\n    default:\n      return state;\n  }\n};\n</code></pre> \n<p>Pros:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>predictable state management</li> \n <li>multiple reducers in a single store</li> \n <li>reducers are pure functions</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Cons:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>set up from scratch can be a bit painful</li> \n</ul> \n<h2 id=\"reactredux\">React-Redux</h2> \n<ul> \n <li>website: <a href=\"https://www.react-redux.js.org\">react-redux.js.org</a></li> \n <li>repository: <a href=\"https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux\">github.com/reduxjs/redux</a></li> \n <li>GitHub stars: 18,500+</li> \n <li>developer: The Moon</li> \n <li>current version: 7.1.3</li> \n <li>contributors: 190+</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Official React bindings for Redux, it comes in two main modules: <code>Provider</code> and <code>connect</code>. The Provider is a React component with a <code>store</code> prop. This prop is how a single store hooks up to the JSX markup. The connect function takes in two parameters: <code>mapStateToProps</code>, and <code>mapDispatchToProps</code>. This is where state management from Redux ties into component props. As state mutates, or dispatches fire, bindings take care of setting state in React.</p> \n<p>This is how a connect might look:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">import { bindActionCreators } from 'redux';\nimport { connect } from 'react-redux';\n\nconst mapStateToProps = (state) =&gt; state.simple;\nconst mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) =&gt;\n  bindActionCreators({() =&gt; ({type: 'SIMPLE_UPDATE_DATA'})}, dispatch);\n\nconnect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(SimpleComponent);\n</code></pre> \n<p>Pros:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>official React bindings for Redux</li> \n <li>binds with JSX markup</li> \n <li>connects components to a single store</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Cons:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>learning curve is somewhat steep</li> \n</ul> \n<h2 id=\"reduxthunk\">Redux-Thunk</h2> \n<ul> \n <li>website: <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-thunk\">npmjs.com/package/redux-thunk</a></li> \n <li>repository: <a href=\"https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk\">github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk</a></li> \n <li>GitHub stars: 14,000+</li> \n <li>developer: The Moon</li> \n <li>current version: 2.3.0</li> \n <li>contributors: 40+</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Thunk middleware for Redux to make asynchronous API calls. It defers execution behind a thunk to unlock asynchrony. A thunk is a function that defers evaluation. For example, <code>() =&gt; 1 + 1</code>, because it doesn’t have immediate execution. This comes with niceties, like access to store state, and dispatch. Optional parameters are also supported in the thunk.</p> \n<p>For example:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">const loadData = () =&gt; async (dispatch, getState, optionalAsyncTool) =&gt; {\n  const state = getState();\n\n  const response = await optionalAsyncTool.get('/url/' + state.data);\n  dispatch({type: 'SIMPLE_LOAD_DATA', payload: response.data});\n};\n</code></pre> \n<p>Pros:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>quintessential tool for asynchrony</li> \n <li>access to state, and dispatch</li> \n <li>configurable with optional parameter</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Cons:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>at first, usefulness is not super clear</li> \n</ul> \n<h2 id=\"reduxlogger\">Redux-Logger</h2> \n<ul> \n <li>website: <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-logger\">npmjs.com/package/redux-logger</a></li> \n <li>repository: <a href=\"https://github.com/LogRocket/redux-logger\">github.com/LogRocket/redux-logger</a></li> \n <li>GitHub stars: 5,000+</li> \n <li>developer: Log Rocket</li> \n <li>current version: 2.0.4</li> \n <li>contributors: 40+</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Logger for Redux that captures any dispatches going through the store. Each dispatch shows in the dev console in a log message. It allows drilling into prev, and next state. The action in the dispatch is also available for payload inspection. This logger is useful in local dev and can be ripped out post-build.</p> \n<p>The following is a potential setup in Redux middleware:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">import { createStore } from 'redux';\n\nlet middleware = [];\n\nif (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') { // rip out post-build\n  const {logger} = require('redux-logger');\n  middleware.push(logger);\n}\n\nexport default () =&gt; createStore({}, applyMiddleware(...middleware));\n</code></pre> \n<p>Pros:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>good Redux insight</li> \n <li>captures all dispatches in the store</li> \n <li>can run in local dev only</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Cons:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>tricky to filter out unwanted messages</li> \n</ul> \n<p> Continue reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/essential-react-tools/?utm_source=rss\">20 Essential React Tools for 2020</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=Dg8AQkJ_8f0:6_fzWx2TemY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=Dg8AQkJ_8f0:6_fzWx2TemY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=Dg8AQkJ_8f0:6_fzWx2TemY:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=Dg8AQkJ_8f0:6_fzWx2TemY:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/Dg8AQkJ_8f0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 17 Mar 2020 23:00:44 +0000","feedId":6128,"bgimg":"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584060844react-tools.png","linkMd5":"f388bc640e0de788d90499390c37c8f8","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn50@2020_4/2020/08/24/22-51-25-236_af5bf1b47fc36952.webp","destWidth":600,"destHeight":340,"sourceBytes":15862,"destBytes":15862,"author":"Camilo Reyes","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584060844react-tools.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn50@2020_4/2020/08/24/22-51-25-236_af5bf1b47fc36952.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn15@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-39-311_6409ebad5acff93a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn3@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-47-113_bf83e999bebef320.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=Dg8AQkJ_8f0:6_fzWx2TemY:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn19@2020_6/2020/08/24/22-51-37-163_bcdbce677fd32039.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/Dg8AQkJ_8f0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn66@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-35-117_251cb9dc730c07ea.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598309483307},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","title":"15 Easy-to-Use Tools &#038; Services to Improve Your Workflow","link":"https://www.sitepoint.com/?p=175517","description":"<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/15-easy-to-use-tools-services-to-improve-your-workflow/?utm_source=rss\" title=\"15 Easy-to-Use Tools &amp; Services to Improve Your Workflow\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584427369Graphic-Designer.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584427369Graphic-Designer-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584427369Graphic-Designer-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584427369Graphic-Designer-1024x682.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /> </a> \n<p class=\"wp-special\"><em>This sponsored article was created by our content partner, <a href=\"https://bawmedia.com\" rel=\"sponsored\">BAW Media</a>.

Thank you for supporting the partners who make SitePoint possible.</em></p> \n<p><strong>Based on web accessibility data, the ADA compliance-related lawsuits reached over 2,000 cases in 2019. ADA Compliance is Mandatory for Digital Agencies. The challenge, however, is knowing <em>how</em> to build and design ADA-compliant websites. That’s the problem we’ll help you address in this post.</strong></p> \n<p>In this ultimate ADA compliance guide, we’ve laid out the things your web design agency needs to know to make accessible websites.</p> \n<p>The number of lawsuits will only keep growing if website owners, developers, and agencies continue to be non-compliant with the ADA.</p> \n<p>If you don’t want to be a part of that statistic, you’ll need to ensure that your agency and client websites offer accessibility to persons with disabilities and adhere to ADA standards.</p> \n<h2 id=\"whatistheadaanyway\">What is the ADA, anyway?</h2> \n<p>The <em><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://adata.org/learn-about-ada\">Americans with Disabilities Act</a></em> is a civil rights law that was enacted in 1990 to prohibit discrimination against persons with disabilities in every area of public life.</p> \n<p>This includes non-discrimination in schools, jobs, transportation, and all private and public places for general access — and those considered as “public accommodation.” </p> \n<p>For businesses, the required accommodations under the ADA include interface devices for the visually impaired, qualified interpreters or interpretive tools for the hearing impaired, ramp access for mobility devices like wheelchairs, and more.</p> \n<p>In the digital space, specifically websites, ADA compliance means providing web accessibility features and functionalities that allow persons with disabilities to use sites effectively.</p> \n<p>Originally, the ADA defined persons with disabilities as those with conditions that substantially limit major life activities — which somehow constricted what was considered as a disability.</p> \n<p>In the 2018 amendment, however, the ADA’s scope became broader, changing the meaning of “major life activity” to include daily life functions like performing manual operations.</p> \n<p>With this new definition, businesses will need to provide accessibility to a wide range of disabilities to adhere to ADA standards.</p> \n<h2 id=\"whyshouldwebdesignagenciesknowaboutit\">Why should web design agencies know about it?</h2> \n<p>If your web design agency creates websites that aren’t compliant with the ADA standards, you put your clients at risk of getting slapped with ADA-related lawsuits — and that’s not where you want to be.</p> \n<p>By providing non-compliant sites to your clients, not only will you get some flak from them due to the legal problems they’re bound to get in, but you’ll also wreck your agency’s credibility.</p> \n<p>It’s also worth pointing out that the ADA doesn’t specify the technical requirements for achieving compliance. Instead, it gives you the flexibility on how you can make your websites accessible.</p> \n<p>Unfortunately, this doesn’t give you a lot to work with to comply with legislation fully.</p> \n<p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) and the US courts previously used the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/\">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1</a> Level AA success criteria as a standard for assessing the accessibility of websites.</p> \n<p>The WCAG 2.1 provides layers of standards to help you achieve web accessibility, including principles, basic guidelines, success criteria, and sufficient and advisory techniques.</p> \n<p>Although the WCAG 2.1 isn’t formally codified into US law, it’s currently the best and safest standard you can follow to comply with web accessibility requirements and the ADA.</p> \n<p> Continue reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/the-ultimate-ada-compliance-guide/?utm_source=rss\">ADA Compliance Is Mandatory for Digital Agencies.

The jQuery validation plugin has been tested up to jQuery version 3.1.1, but the demo in this article works perfectly with version 3.4.1, which is the latest one.</p> \n<p>You can use any of the following <a href=\"https://jquery.com/download/\">download options</a>:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Download it from <a href=\"https://code.jquery.com/\">jquery.com</a></li> \n <li>Download it using Bower: <code>$ bower install jquery</code></li> \n <li>Download it using npm or Yarn: <code>$ npm install jquery</code> or <code>yarn add jquery</code></li> \n <li>Use a CDN: <code>https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.4.1/jquery.min.js</code></li> \n</ul> \n<p>Create a new HTML file named <code>index.html</code> and include jQuery before the closing <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code> tag:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"markup language-markup\">&lt;!-- Change the \"src\" attribute according to your installation path --&gt;\n&lt;script src=\"vendor/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre> \n<p>If you’d like to use Bower or npm but aren’t familiar with them, you might be interested in these two articles:</p>

2: Include the jQuery Validation Plugin</h2> \n<p>Choose between:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Download it from <a href=\"https://github.com/jquery-validation/jquery-validation/releases/tag/1.19.1\">the plugin’s github repo</a></li> \n <li>Download it using Bower: <code>$ bower install jquery-validation</code></li> \n <li>Download it using npm: <code>npm i jquery-validation</code></li> \n <li><a

<code>https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery-validate/1.19.1/jquery.validate.min.js</code></li> \n</ul> \n<p>Include the plugin after jQuery:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"markup

sum of its parts. Great Wi-Fi isn’t going to offset the mounting frustration of a wobbly chair. Calming natural lighting won’t be able to shut those kids up from across the street. To create a space that cultivates productivity, everything has to work in harmony.</strong></p> \n<p>Although some specifics will likely differ depending on your job (software engineers are probably going to want a more powerful computer than copywriters), here are six essentials for building the ultimate home office setup imaginable.</p> \n<h2 id=\"1createadistinctspacetoworkin\">1. Create a Distinct Space to Work In</h2> \n<p>No matter how badly many of us loathe the morning commute, going from one’s home to a distinct secondary location helps create that thing we love to call a work/life balance. On one side of the scale is the office — aka work — and on the other side of the scale is your home — aka life. But if you work from home, work and life gets all crammed together on one side of the scale.</p> \n<p>To regain that balance, you have to create a distinct work space that’s either physically or psychologically separate from the space in which you relax and sleep. In other words, the place where you work can’t also be the place you don’t do work.</p> \n<p>If you have a home with extra rooms, this should be relatively easy. Designate one of those rooms as your office. Boom. We’re done.</p> \n<p>However, if you live in a home or apartment with no extra rooms, you’ll have to get a little creative. If you can’t put a door between your home and your work, put up a room divider or a curtain. Heck, make your own divider with <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/search/pins/?rs=ac&amp;len=2&amp;q=plants%20as%20room%20dividers&amp;eq=plants%20as%20room&amp;etslf=4827\">plants</a>. These separators help tell your brain that it’s work time, not play time.</p> \n<p>Another way to trick your brain into separating your home office from your home is to leave the house before you start work. Get up and go for a walk, do a quick errand, or take out the garbage. Do something to tell your brain that you’re transitioning from one part of the day to another.</p> \n<h2 id=\"2preventdistractions\">2. Prevent Distractions</h2> \n<p>Unless you’re lucky enough to have a Faraday cage in your home, you’re bound to be met with some sort of distraction throughout your day. Some of these distractions may be auditory in nature. Perhaps the person living above you is an all-day stomper; maybe the park across your street attracts a lot of terrible street musicians. Here, sound is the enemy, and the solution is a white noise machine, sound canceling headphones, or even a loud fan.</p> \n<p>Other distractions may be digital. With no one looking over your shoulder, it’s tempting to futz around on the Internet instead of doing your work. This is where anti-procrastination apps come in handy.

But you’re wondering: “What should I be looking for in a remote job?” Or, if you’re “remote” already: “Is remote work overhyped, or do I just have a bad employer?”</strong></p> \n<p>If this sounds like you, keep reading as we take a deep dive into what remote workers should look for in a remote employer.</p> \n<h2 id=\"waitwhatsadigitalnomad\">Wait, what’s a digital nomad?</h2> \n<p>A <strong>digital nomad</strong> is anybody who’s referred to as “location-independent” as a result of them being able to work remotely, and leverages this unique opportunity to travel continuously.</p> \n<p>Considering the current of things (hello, COVID-19 👋), it’s worth noting that being a digital nomad doesn’t mean you need to travel between countries. Many digital nomads travel within their own countries, sometimes even via their own camper vans.</p> \n<p>It’s a thing; look it up. It’s really interesting!</p> \n<h2 id=\"whyareyouorwhydoyouwanttoberemote\">Why are you (or why do you want to be) remote?</h2> \n<p>First of all, there’s nothing wrong with wanting to work remotely (nomad or otherwise) simply because it’s the hot new thing and it sounds exciting. We only live once, so why not?</p> \n<p>This is especially true if you learn best by <em>doing</em>. If it turns out that it’s not for you, there’s no harm done really.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>Who says you can’t go home? — Bon Jovi</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>However, the most likely scenario is that you’ve considered working remotely because your current lifestyle isn’t allowing you to be your best self. Perhaps you’d like to learn more about other cultures (or even yourself — that is, soul-searching), or maybe you’re looking to reinvent your lifestyle by embracing flexible hours or switching up your routine in the hope that it might improve your mental health or boost your level of work output.</p> \n<p>Also, there’s nothing wrong with craving a little wanderlust if international digital nomadism is what you’re thinking about.</p> \n<p>Some digital nomads simply enjoy the cheaper cost of living (which benefits <em>them</em>) while boosting the GDP (gross domestic product) of their host city/country (which benefits the <em>city/country</em>, assuming of course they’re contributing responsibly).</p> \n<p>However, with that being said, employers don’t always enable remote work as well as they could (even when they’re <em>supposed</em> to be a fully-remote company), so what exactly should one look for when searching for a digital nomad–friendly remote job?</p> \n<p>Let’s take a look.</p> \n<h2 id=\"1flexiblehours\">1. Flexible Hours</h2> \n<p>One thing that’s very synonymous with remote work is flexible hours, especially when team members are distributed (because of the multiple timezones). This appeals to digital nomads a lot because they typically would like to explore the city/country that they’re visiting.</p> \n<p>But “flexible hours” can be misleading. Sometimes, it means “as long as the work is completed” — which, in translation, actually means “we’ll keep sending you more work while trying to convince you that you’re mismanaging your time”.</p> \n<p>Many remote workers say that, although they <em>technically</em> have the freedom to work whenever they want, there’s so much work to do that they have literally no life in their work-life balance.</p> \n<p>A remote work contract <em>must</em> include the following:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>the amount of forced vacation</li> \n <li>the number of hours you must work</li> \n <li>a crystal-clear overtime agreement</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Hopefully, all of this should be evident from the job description, but if it isn’t, then enter the remote job interview with a bucket of questions. Trust your instincts.</p> \n<p>Speak to other remote employees if you can.</p> \n<h2 id=\"2productivitymentalhealth\">2. Productivity/Mental Health</h2> \n<p>As much as your remote employer should care about your work life, they should also care about your <em>life</em> life. Besides, how you feel outside of work deeply impacts the way you work anyway.</p> \n<p> Continue reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/finding-perfect-remote-job-opportunity/?utm_source=rss\">Finding the Perfect Remote Job Opportunity</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=Da-FtOfNpm4:3JGPes_7H-s:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=Da-FtOfNpm4:3JGPes_7H-s:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=Da-FtOfNpm4:3JGPes_7H-s:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=Da-FtOfNpm4:3JGPes_7H-s:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/Da-FtOfNpm4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Sun, 26 Apr 2020 22:30:48 +0000","feedId":6128,"bgimg":"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1587612049remote-work.png","linkMd5":"379cbda1e05af5d2cd331431ec296474","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn38@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-26-732_02fbd427a4a5fbc4.webp","destWidth":600,"destHeight":339,"sourceBytes":4736,"destBytes":4736,"author":"Daniel Schwarz","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1587612049remote-work.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn38@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-26-732_02fbd427a4a5fbc4.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn15@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-39-311_6409ebad5acff93a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn3@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-47-113_bf83e999bebef320.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=Da-FtOfNpm4:3JGPes_7H-s:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn83@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-42-971_bec9014ff9ba7df1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/Da-FtOfNpm4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn53@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-41-268_77f1474f7d9bb133.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598309483273},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","title":"30 Life-saving Tools for Front-end Developers","link":"https://editor.sitepoint.com/?p=176261","description":"<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/life-saving-tools-for-front-end-developers/?utm_source=rss\" title=\"30 Life-saving Tools for Front-end Developers\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1591148465front-end-tools.png\" alt=\"30 Life-saving Tools for Front-end Developers\" srcset=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1591148465front-end-tools-300x170.png 300w, https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1591148465front-end-tools.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /> </a> \n<p><strong>As the functionalities of web apps keep getting ever more sophisticated and complex, web developers need flexible tools to keep up with rising user expectations. The good news is, the web development ecosystem gives us plenty of choice, with both well-established companies and the open-source community racing to build more powerful libraries, frameworks and apps to help developers do their job and increase productivity and efficiency.</strong></p> \n<p>In this post, I’ve rounded up 30 top tools for front-end web developers ranging from code editors and code playgrounds to CSS generators, JS libraries, and more.</p> \n<p>Let’s dive right in!</p> \n<h2 id=\"codeeditors\">Code Editors</h2> \n<p>Front-end developers spend hours writing or editing code. Therefore, it’s only natural that their closest friend on the job is the code editor. In fact, getting to know their code editor of choice and all its capabilities and shortcuts gives any dev a great advantage in terms of productivity.</p> \n<h3 id=\"1visualstudiocodehttpscodevisualstudiocom\"><a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\">1. Visual Studio Code</a></h3> \n<p>Visual Studio Code (VS Code) by Microsoft is a full-blown, free and open-source cross-platform integrated development environment (IDE) — that is, a complex piece of software that allows developers to create, test and deploy an entire project.</p> \n<p>Here are some of VS Code’s most popular features:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>IntelliSense, offering syntax highlighting and smart completions based on variable types, function definitions and imported modules</li> \n <li>debugging capabilities</li> \n <li>built-in Git commands</li> \n <li>flexibility and extensibility: you can easily add extensions relative to new languages, themes, etc.</li> \n <li>easy deployment capabilities</li> \n</ul> \n<p>You can download VS Code for Windows, MacOS, and Linux.</p> \n<h3 id=\"2atomhttpsatomio\"><a href=\"https://atom.io/\">2.

Typing <code>npm install</code> or yarn install in a command-line interface has become one of the most ordinary parts of a developer’s day-to-day job.</p> \n<h3 id=\"4npmhttpswwwnpmjscom\"><a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/\">4. NPM</a></h3> \n<p>What is npm? Well, as it says on the company’s website, it’s many things. In particular:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>it’s the package manager for Node.js that helps JS devs to share packaged modules of code</li> \n <li>the npm registry is a public collection of packages of open-source code for Node.js, front-end web apps, and more</li> \n <li>npm is also the command-line client developers use to install and publish those packages</li> \n <li>npm, Inc. is the company responsible for hosting and maintaining all of the above</li> \n</ul> \n<h3 id=\"5yarnhttpsyarnpkgcom\"><a href=\"https://yarnpkg.com/\">5. Yarn</a></h3> \n<p>Yarn is a package manager for installing and sharing code and also a project manager. It’s extensible via plugins, stable, very well documented, free and open source.</p> \n<h2 id=\"bundlers\">Bundlers</h2> \n<p>Module bundlers are used to bundle several modules into one or more optimized bundles for the browser.</p> \n<h3 id=\"6webpackhttpswebpackjsorg\"><a href=\"https://webpack.js.org/\">6. Webpack</a></h3> \n<p>Here’s all the goodness you’ll find in webpack, as it’s detailed in the software’s website:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>At its core, <strong>webpack</strong> is a <em>static module bundler</em> for modern JavaScript applications. When webpack processes your application, it internally builds a <a href=\"https://webpack.js.org/concepts/dependency-graph/\">dependency graph</a> which maps every module your project needs and generates one or more <em>bundles</em>. … Since version 4.0.0, <strong>webpack does not require a configuration file</strong> to bundle your project. Nevertheless, it is <a href=\"https://webpack.js.org/configuration\">incredibly configurable</a> to better fit your needs.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<h3 id=\"7parcelhttpsparceljsorg\"><a href=\"https://parceljs.org/\">7. Parcel</a></h3> \n<p>Parcel is a “blazing fast, zero configuration web application bundler”.</p> \n<p>Parcel</p> \n<ul> \n <li>is fast</li> \n <li>bundles all the project’s assets</li> \n <li>has zero-config code splitting</li> \n <li>and more.</li> \n</ul> \n<h2 id=\"cssgenerators\">CSS Generators</h2> \n<p>Have you ever tried to memorize how to declare CSS properties for gradients, text shadows, Flexbox or Grid, to mention just a few? Not easy. Unless you use some CSS features and their properties over and over again, it’s hard to remember them all. But even those who master CSS sometimes need a refresher on some properties, especially if they haven’t used them in a while. </p> \n<p>If you need some quick help with the latest and greatest CSS, here are CSS generators to the rescue. Enter the values, preview the result, grab the generated code and run.</p> \n<h3 id=\"8css3generatorhttpscss3generatorcom\"><a href=\"https://css3generator.com/\">8. CSS3 Generator</a></h3> \n<p>The CSS3 Generator is a free online app that lets you quickly write code for a number of modern CSS features like Flexbox, gradients, transitions and transforms, and many more.</p> \n<p>Enter the required CSS values, preview the result in real time, copy and paste the generated code.

The Ultimate CSS Generator</a></h3> \n<p>The Ultimate CSS Generator is a free online app that lets you generate code for CSS animation, backgrounds, gradients, borders, filters, and more.</p> \n<p>The interface is user-friendly, the information about browser support for the CSS feature you’re interested in is clear and easy to spot, and the generated code is clean and accurate. </p> \n<h3 id=\"10thecssgridlayoutgeneratorbydmitriibykovhttpscssgridlayoutgeneratorpw\"><a href=\"https://css-grid-layout-generator.pw/\">10. The CSS Grid Layout Generator by Dmitrii Bykov</a></h3> \n<p>CSS Grid is awesome, and creating your grid in code gives you full control over the final result. However, it’s helpful to have a visual representation of the grid while you’re coding. Although some major browsers have implemented great tools to let you visualize your grid, some devs could do with some additional help. Here’s where a CSS Grid generator might come in handy.</p> \n<p>The CSS Grid Layout Generator by Dmitrii Bykov is free, accessible online, and extremely flexible. I took it for a spin and found that it gives me a lot of control both at the level of the grid container and that of the grid item while providing me with nice preview capabilities and clean code.</p> \n<p>If you need help, click on the <em>How to Use</em> button and watch the presentation video offered by the app’s author.</p> \n<p>To know more about which CSS Grid generators are available, I put some of the best ones through their paces on SitePoint in my article “<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/css-grid-generators/\">5 Super CSS Grid Generators for Your Layouts</a>”.</p> \n<h2 id=\"librariesandframeworks\">Libraries and Frameworks</h2> \n<p>The demands on today’s web apps place great importance on speed in loading and updating page content.

The years in between were filled with starts and stops, challenges and successes, and a whole lot of tinkering.</p> \n<p>“I was always tinkering with the family computer, which was mostly, ‘oh god I’ve broken it how do I fix it before I get in trouble,’” Aaron said of his technical beginnings. He had an appetite for building and modifying hardware, which he attributes to the joy that comes from doing something with your hands. He’d collect spare hardware, buy and sell parts, and at times resort to scrounging and trading. “There were computer parts strewn everywhere,” he said.</p> \n<p>But by the time he graduated high school, Aaron had checked out academically. He wasn’t confident his grades were good enough for university, so he enrolled in TAFE, Australia’s largest vocational training provider, and spent six months learning XML before realizing that “making mobile websites for 2004’s best mobile phones in XML was pretty damn far from my idea of a good time.”</p> \n<p>So he dropped out of TAFE and eventually found himself working in the world of content, where he stayed for seven years. Though he worked his way up to a managerial and editorial role for a handful of companies within the technical realm, Aaron found himself consistently unsatisfied.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>I had this itch to solve technical problems, and working in content, I wasn’t able to scratch it. That’s what a lot of programming is, problem-solving. And it’s not that this is unique to programming, it’s just the type of problems – and solutions to them – are more enjoyable to me.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<h2>Back to School</h2> \n<p>During his long stretch in content, Aaron maintained enough of an interest in tinkering and programming to eventually enroll in a Software Engineering degree program.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>I took one subject to start off, as I felt I needed to validate two things: one, that I could learn to study again, and two, that I would enjoy it.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Aaron found the validation he was after, but it wasn’t until a few years later, when he learned his company had been acquired and his job was on the line, that he decided to leave content behind and commit fully to becoming a developer. Knowing he could be let go in as little as a week, Aaron enrolled at RMIT University full-time to pursue a degree in Software Engineering.</p> \n<p>Aaron was finally where he belonged, but it wasn’t easy.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>There was a lot of frustration. I found certain languages, concepts, and themes difficult to grasp, and others came with remarkable ease. So when you’re going from, ‘How easy and fun is this!’ to swearing at the computer asking why something isn’t working, it can be emotionally turbulent.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>In conjunction with the difficult subject matter was the overwhelming amount of career paths to choose from.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>The world of programming is outrageously broad, there are innumerable paths you can take, and there’s temptation to try and take them all because everyone loves the new shiny thing.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>The more career paths he discovered, the less sure of himself he grew.</p> \n<p> Continue reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/content-code-career-transition/?utm_source=rss\">How Aaron Osteraas Made the Content to Code Career Transition</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=jPn9TyDeBtQ:vMLaRyWHkTs:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=jPn9TyDeBtQ:vMLaRyWHkTs:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=jPn9TyDeBtQ:vMLaRyWHkTs:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=jPn9TyDeBtQ:vMLaRyWHkTs:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/jPn9TyDeBtQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 26 Mar 2020 09:40:24 +0000","feedId":6128,"bgimg":"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584488319developer-job.png","linkMd5":"7d8aa899128fe5a4cd09990e7e0e672f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn17@2020_3/2020/08/24/22-51-25-888_36eb321b13590b6f.webp","destWidth":600,"destHeight":340,"sourceBytes":7846,"destBytes":7846,"author":"Joshua Kraus","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584488319developer-job.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn17@2020_3/2020/08/24/22-51-25-888_36eb321b13590b6f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn15@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-39-311_6409ebad5acff93a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn3@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-47-113_bf83e999bebef320.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=jPn9TyDeBtQ:vMLaRyWHkTs:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn17@2020_4/2020/08/24/22-51-42-715_de40123d2d031db2.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/jPn9TyDeBtQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn39@2020_3/2020/08/24/22-51-41-879_7e03424d969533e9.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598309483282},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","title":"SVG 101: What Is SVG?","link":"https://www.sitepoint.com/?p=156582","description":"<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/svg-101-what-is-svg/?utm_source=rss\" title=\"SVG 101: What Is SVG?\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1597254478svg-squashed.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1597254478svg-squashed-300x158.jpg 300w, https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1597254478svg-squashed-768x404.jpg 768w, https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1597254478svg-squashed-1024x539.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /> </a> \n<p><strong>Though it was conceived back in the late 1990s, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics\">SVG</a> is in many ways the “ugly duckling” file format that grew up to become a swan. Poorly supported and largely ignored for most of the 2000s, since around 2017 all modern web browsers have been rendering SVG without serious issues, and most vector drawing programs have been offering the option to export SVG, which has unquestionably become a widely used graphic format on the Web.</strong></p> \n<p>This hasn’t happened by chance. Although traditional raster graphic file formats like JPGs and PNGs are perfect for photographs or very complex images, it turns out that SVG is the one graphic format that most closely meets current web development demands of scalability, responsiveness, interactivity, programmability, performance, and accessibility.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/1498798784svg101.svg\" alt=\"SVG 101 Header\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-156634\" /></p> \n<h2 id=\"sowhatissvgandwhyshouldyouuseit\">So, What Is SVG and Why Should You Use It?</h2> \n<p>SVG is an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML\">eXtensible Markup Language (XML)</a>-based vector graphic format for the Web and other environments. XML uses tags like HTML, although it’s stricter. You cannot, for example, omit a closing tag since this will make the file invalid and the SVG will not be rendered.</p> \n<p>To give you a taste of what SVG code looks like, here’s how you would draw a white circle with a black border:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"markup language-markup\">&lt;circle cx=\"100\" cy=\"100\" r=\"50\" stroke-width=\"4\" stroke=\"#000\" fill=\"#fff\" /&gt;\n</code></pre> \n<p>As you can see, under the hood, SVG documents are nothing more than simple plain text files that describe lines, curves, shapes, colors, and text. As it’s human-readable, easily understandable and modifiable, when embedded in an HTML document as an <strong>inline SVG</strong>, SVG code can be manipulated via CSS or JavaScript. This gives SVG a flexibility and versatility that can’t ever be matched by traditional PNG, GIF or JPG graphic formats.</p> \n<p>SVG is a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium\">W3C standard</a>, which means that it can inter-operate easily with other open standard languages and technologies including JavaScript, DOM, CSS, and HTML. As long as the W3C sets the global industry standards, it’s likely that SVG will continue to be the de facto standard for vector graphics in the browser.</p> \n<p>The awesomeness of SVG is that it can solve many of the most vexing problems in modern web development. Let’s breeze through some of them.</p> \n<ul> \n <li> <p><strong>Scalability and responsiveness</strong></p> <p>Under the hood, SVG uses shapes, numbers and coordinates rather than a pixel grid to render graphics in the browser, which makes it resolution-independent and infinitely scalable. If you think about it, the instructions for creating a circle are the same whether you’re using a pen or a skywriting plane. Only the scale changes.</p> <p>With SVG, you can combine different shapes, paths and text elements to create all kinds of visuals, and you’ll be sure they’ll look clear and crisp at any size.</p> <p>In contrast, raster-based formats like GIF, JPG, and PNG have fixed dimensions, which cause them to pixelate when they’re scaled. Although various responsive image techniques have proved valuable for pixel graphics, they’ll never be able to truly compete with SVG’s ability to scale indefinitely.</p> </li> \n <li> <p><strong>Programmability and interactivity</strong></p> <p>SVG is fully editable and scriptable. All kinds of animations and interactions can be added to an inline SVG graphic via CSS and/or JavaScript.</p> </li> \n <li> <p><strong>Accessibility</strong></p> <p>SVG files are text-based, so when embedded in a web page, they can be searched and indexed. This makes them accessible to screen readers, search engines and other devices.</p> </li> \n <li> <p><strong>Performance</strong></p> <p>One of the most important aspects impacting web performance is the size of the files used on a web page. SVG graphics are usually smaller in size compared to bitmap file formats.</p> </li> \n</ul> \n<p> Continue reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/svg-101-what-is-svg/?utm_source=rss\">SVG 101: What Is SVG?</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=gVMAbWSfvEg:OKm27NddORk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=gVMAbWSfvEg:OKm27NddORk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=gVMAbWSfvEg:OKm27NddORk:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=gVMAbWSfvEg:OKm27NddORk:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/gVMAbWSfvEg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 21:00:57 +0000","feedId":6128,"bgimg":"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1597254478svg-squashed.jpg","linkMd5":"d48d4391d1ec1fa618f31e980a9db43a","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn58@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-24-658_83f23f9c63a1429d.webp","destWidth":1900,"destHeight":1000,"sourceBytes":34436,"destBytes":34436,"author":"Ivaylo Gerchev","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1597254478svg-squashed.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn58@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-24-658_83f23f9c63a1429d.webp","https://www.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/1498798784svg101.svg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn67@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-40-116_85c0c4f6d7dd51ae.svg","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn15@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-39-311_6409ebad5acff93a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn3@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-47-113_bf83e999bebef320.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=gVMAbWSfvEg:OKm27NddORk:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn65@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-43-949_9de377ff3c644350.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/gVMAbWSfvEg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn13@2020_3/2020/08/24/22-51-45-626_193afbdffe2f92a5.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598309483246},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","title":"How to Replace Redux with React Hooks and the Context API","link":"https://www.sitepoint.com/?p=172278","description":"<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/replace-redux-react-hooks-context-api/?utm_source=rss\" title=\"How to Replace Redux with React Hooks and the Context API\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/1584425271fishing.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/1584425271fishing-300x288.jpg 300w, https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/1584425271fishing-768x738.jpg 768w, https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/1584425271fishing-1024x985.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /> </a> \n<p>The most popular way to handle shared application state in React is using a framework such as Redux. Quite recently, the React team introduced several new features which include React Hooks and the Context API. These two features effectively eliminated a lot of challenges that developers of large React projects have been facing. One of the biggest problems was ‘prop drilling’ which was common with nested components. The solution was to use a state management library like Redux. This, unfortunately, came with the expense of writing boilerplate code — but now, it’s possible to replace Redux with React Hooks and the Context API.</p> \n<p>In this article, you are going to learn a new way of handling state in your React projects, without writing excessive code or installing a bunch of libraries — as is the case with Redux. React hooks allow you to use local state inside of function components, while the Context API allows you to share state with other components.</p> \n<h2 id=\"prerequisites\">Prerequisites</h2> \n<p>In order to follow along with this tutorial, you will need to have a good foundation in the following topics:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/getting-started-react-beginners-guide/\">Getting Started with React</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/your-first-week-with-react?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=articles\">Your First Week with React</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/react-hooks/\">React Hooks</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/getting-started-redux/\">Foundation in Redux</a></li> \n</ul> \n<p>The technique you will learn here is based on patterns that were introduced in Redux.

VS Code, as it’s commonly known, is considered a “lightweight” code editor. In comparison with full integrated development environment (IDE) editors which occupy gigabytes of disk space, VS Code only uses less than 200MB when installed.</p> \n<p>Despite the “lightweight” term, VS Code offers a massive number of features which keep increasing and improving with every new update. For this guide, we’ll cover the most popularly used features. Every programmer has their own tool set which they keep updating whenever new workflows are discovered. If you want to learn every tool and feature VS Code has to offer, check out their <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/docs\">official documentation</a>. In addition, you may want to keep track of <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/updates\">updates</a> for new and improved features.</p> \n<h2 id=\"prerequisites\">Prerequisites</h2> \n<p>In order to follow along this guide, you need to be proficient in at least one programming language and framework. You also need to be conversant with versioning your project code with <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/git-for-beginners/\">git</a>. You’ll also need to have an account with a remote repository platform such as GitHub. I recommend you setup <a href=\"https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh\">SSH Keys</a> to connect with your remote repo.</p> \n<p>We’ll use a minimal <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/\">Next.js</a> project to demonstrate VS Code features. If you’re new to this, don’t worry, as the framework and the language used are not the focus for this guide. The skills taught here can be transferred to any language and framework that you’re working with.</p> \n<h2 id=\"abitofhistory\">A Bit of History</h2> \n<p>If you’re new to programming, I recommend you start with a simple text editor such as Windows NotePad. It’s the most basic text editor and doesn’t offer any kind of help whatsoever. The main advantage of using it is that it forces you to memorize language syntax and do your own indentation. Once you get comfortable writing code, upgrading to a better text editor such as <a href=\"https://notepad-plus-plus.org/\">NotePad++</a> is the next logical step. It offers a bit of essential coding help with features like syntax colorization, auto indentation and basic autocomplete. It’s important when learning programming not to be overwhelmed with too much information and assistance.</p> \n<p>Once you’ve gotten used to having a better coding experience, it’s time to upgrade. Not so long ago, these were the fully integrated development environments on offer:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/\">Visual Studio IDE</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://netbeans.org/\">NetBeans</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.eclipse.org/\">Eclipse</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/\">IntelliJ IDEA</a></li> \n</ul> \n<p>These platforms provide the complete development workflow, from coding to testing and deployment. They contain tons of useful features such as analyzing code and highlighting errors. They also contain a ton more features that many developers weren’t using, though they were essential for some teams. As a result, these platforms took a lot of disk space and were slow to start up. Many developers preferred using advance text editors such as <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/\">emacs</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vim.org/\">vim</a> to write their code in.</p> \n<p>Soon, a new crop of platform independent code editors started appearing. They were lightweight and provided many features that were mostly exclusive to IDEs. I’ve listed them below in the order they were released:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.sublimetext.com/\">Sublime Text</a>: July 2013</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://atom.io/\">Atom.io</a>: June 2015</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\">Visual Studio Code</a>: April 2016</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Mac developers had access to <a href=\"https://macromates.com/\">TextMate</a> which was released in October 2004. The snippets system used by all the above editors originated from TextMate. Having used all of them, I felt that the editor that came after was a significant improvement over the current one. According to a developer survey done by <a href=\"https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#development-environments-and-tools\">Stack OverFlow</a> in 2019, Visual Studio Code is the most popular code development environment with 50.7% usage. Visual Studio IDE comes second and NotePad++ comes third.</p> \n<p>That’s enough history and stats for now. Let’s delve into how to use Visual Studio Code features.</p> \n<h2 id=\"setupandupdates\">Setup and Updates</h2> \n<p>Visual Studio Code package installer is less than 100MB and consumes less than 200MB when fully installed. When you visit the <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\">download</a> page, your OS will automatically be detected and the correct download link will be highlighted.</p> \n<p>Updating VS Code is very easy. It displays a notification prompt whenever an update has been released. For Windows users, you’ll have to click on the notification to download and install the latest version. The download process occurs in the background while you’re working. When it’s ready to install, a restart prompt will appear. Clicking this will install the update for you and restart VS Code.</p> \n<p>For Ubuntu-based distributions, clicking on the <strong>update notification</strong> will simply open the website for you to download the latest installer. A much easier way is simply running <code>sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt upgrade -y</code>. This will update all installed Linux packages including VS Code. The reason this works is because VS Code added its repo to your package repo registry during the initial installation. You can find the repo information on this path: <code>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/vscode.list</code>.</p> \n<h2 id=\"userinterface\">User Interface</h2> \n<p>Let’s first get acquainted with the user interface:</p> \n<figure> \n <img src=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1586831185hero.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"940\" height=\"645\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-175827\" />\n <figcaption style=\"text-align:center; font-size:0.8em; margin: 12px 0 20px\">\n  <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/getstarted/userinterface/hero.png\">Image source</a> \n </figcaption>\n</figure> \n<p>VS Code’s user interface is divided into five main areas which you can easily adjust.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Activity Bar</strong>: allows you to switch between views: explorer, search, version control, debug and extensions.</li> \n <li><strong>Side Bar</strong>: contains the active view.</li> \n <li><strong>Editor</strong>: this is where you edit files and preview markdown files. You can arrange multiple open files side-by-side.</li> \n <li><strong>Panel</strong>: displays different panels: integrated terminal, output panels for debug information, errors and warnings.</li> \n <li><strong>Status</strong>: displays information about the currently opened project and file. Also contains buttons for executing version control actions, and enabling/disabling extension features.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>There’s also the top <strong>Menu Bar</strong> where you can access the editor’s menu system. For Linux users, the default integrated terminal will probably be the <strong>Bash</strong> shell. For Windows users, it’s <strong>PowerShell</strong>. Fortunately, there’s a shell selector located inside the terminal dropdown that will allow you to choose a different shell. If installed, you can choose any of the following:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Command Prompt</li> \n <li>PowerShell</li> \n <li>PowerShell Core</li> \n <li>Git Bash</li> \n <li>WSL Bash</li> \n</ul> \n<h2 id=\"workingwithprojects\">Working with Projects</h2> \n<p>Unlike full IDEs, VS Code doesn’t provide <strong>project creation</strong> or offer <strong>project templates</strong> in the traditional way. It simply works with folders. On my Linux development machine, I’m using the following folder pattern to store and manage my projects:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">/home/{username}/Projects/{company-name}/{repo-provider}/{project-name}\n</code></pre> \n<p>The <code>Projects</code> folder is what I refer to as to the <strong>workspace</strong>. As a freelance writer and developer, I separate projects based on which company I’m working for, and which repo I’m using. For personal projects, I store them under my own fictitious “company name”. For projects that I experiment with for learning purposes, and which I don’t intend to keep for long, I’ll just use a name such as <code>play</code> or <code>tuts</code> as a substitute for <code>{repo-provider}</code>.</p> \n<p>If you’d like to create a new project and open it in VS Code, you can use the following steps. Open a terminal and execute the following commands:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">$ mkdir vscode-demo\n$ cd vscode-demo\n# Launch Visual Studio Code\n$ code .\n</code></pre> \n<p>You can also do this in File Explorer. When you access the mouse context menu, you should be able to open any folder in VS Code.</p> \n<p>If you want to create a new project linked to a remote repo, it’s easier creating one on the repo site — for example, <a href=\"https://github.com/\">GitHub</a> or <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/\">BitBucket</a>.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/158610666602-github-create-project.png\" alt=\"GitHub create project\" /></p> \n<p>Take note of all the fields that have been filled in and selected. Next, go to the terminal and execute the following:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\"># Navigate to workspace/company/repo folder\n$ cd Projects/sitepoint/github/\n\n# Clone the project to your machine\n$ git clone git@github.com:{insert-username-here}/vscode-nextjs-demo.git\n\n# Open project in VS Code\n$ cd vscode-nextjs-demo\n$ code .\n</code></pre> \n<p>Once the editor is up and running, you can launch the integrated terminal using the keyboard shortcut <code>Ctrl+~</code> (tilde key). Use the following commands to generate <code>package.json</code> and install packages:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\"># Generate `package.json` file with default settings\n$ npm init -y\n\n# Install package dependencies\n$ npm install next react react-dom\n</code></pre> \n<p>Next, open <code>package.json</code> and replace the <code>scripts</code> section with this:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">\"scripts\": {\n  \"dev\": \"next\",\n  \"build\": \"next build\",\n  \"start\": \"next start\"\n}\n</code></pre> \n<p>The entire VS Code window should look like this:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/158610667503-vscode-project-setup.png\" alt=\"VS Code run script\" /></p> \n<p>Before we look at the next section, I’d like to mention that VS Code also supports the concept of <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces\">multi-root workspaces</a>. If you’re working with related projects — front-end, back-end, docs etc. — you can manage them all in a single workspace inside one editor. This will make it easier to keep your source code and documentation in sync.</p> \n<h2 id=\"versioncontrolwithgit\">Version Control with Git</h2> \n<p>VS Code comes built-in with Git source control manager. It provides a UI interface where you can stage, commit, create new branches and switch to existing ones. Let’s commit the changes we just did in our project. On the <strong>Activity bar</strong>, open the <strong>Source Control Panel</strong> and locate the <strong>Stage All Changes</strong> plus button as shown below.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/158610668504-vscode-source-control.png\" alt=\"VS Code source control\" /></p> \n<p>Click on it. Next, enter the commit message “Installed next.js dependencies”, then click the <strong>Commit</strong> button at the top. It has the checkmark icon. This will commit the new changes. If you look at the status located at the bottom, you’ll see various status icons at the left-hand corner. The <code>0 ↓</code> means there’s nothing to pull from the remote repo. The <code>1 ↑</code> means you’ve got one commit you need to push to your remote repo. Clicking on it will display a prompt on the action that will take place. Click <strong>OK</strong> to <code>pull</code> and <code>push</code> your code. This should sync up your local repo with the remote repo.</p> \n<p>To create a new branch or switch to an existing branch, just click the <strong>branch name</strong> <code>master</code> on the status bar, left bottom corner. This will pop up a <strong>branch panel</strong> for you to take an action.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/158610669105-vscode-branch-actions.png\" alt=\"VS Code branch actions\" /></p> \n<p>Do check out the following extensions for an even better experience with Git:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens\">Git Lens</a></li> \n <li><a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.githistory\">Git History</a></li> \n</ul> \n<p>Support for a different type of SCM, such as SVN, can be added via installing the relevant SCM extension from the marketplace.</p> \n<h2 id=\"creatingandrunningcode\">Creating and Running Code</h2> \n<p>On the <strong>Activity Bar</strong>, head back to the <strong>Explorer Panel</strong> and use the <strong>New Folder</strong> button to create the folder <code>pages</code> at the root of the project. Select this folder and use the <strong>New File</strong> button to create the file <strong>pages/index.js</strong>. Copy the following code:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">function HomePage() {\n  return &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Welcome to Next.js!&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;;\n}\n\nexport default HomePage;\n</code></pre> \n<p>With the <strong>Explorer Panel</strong>, you should see a section called <strong>NPM Scripts</strong>. Expand on this and hover over <code>dev</code>. A <code>run</code> button (play icon) will appear next to it. Click on it and this will launch a Next.js dev server inside the <strong>Integrated Terminal</strong>.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/158610669506-vscode-run-script.png\" alt=\"VS Code run script\" /></p> \n<p>It should take a few seconds to spin up.

Your code is clear and well documented; you’re eager to help others, and you’re able to handle 3x the work your co-workers can handle.</p> \n<p><em>You’re an amazing developer, and that’s your problem.</em></p> \n<p>Your Boss and your co-workers all want your best work. It’s an unspoken expectation in the workplace. No one prepares you for the horrible consequences that come with doing your job well.</p> \n<h2 id=\"thedevastatingpriceyoupayforworkinghard\">The devastating price you pay for working hard</h2> \n<p>There are several unpleasant downsides that come with exceptional performance and hard work. There’s one reward in particular that acts as a demotivator that destroys job satisfaction.</p> \n<p>You’re probably already familiar with it.</p> \n<p>The reward for working hard and performing above expectations at your job is <em>more work</em>.</p> \n<p>This is devastating to developers in the long term, and here are a few reasons why …</p> \n<p><strong>1. Price’s Law becomes a dysfunctional cycle</strong> <br /> Information scientist and physicist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_J._de_Solla_Price\">Derek de Solla Price</a> discovered that the square root of the number of people in any domain does 50 percent of the work. If there are ten developers on your team, 3 of them do half the work. Who are these employees? If you’re an A-player, you’re already doing far more than your co-workers.</p> \n<p>This is devastating because it creates a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtuous_circle_and_vicious_circle\">vicious cycle</a>. In many organizations, you’re rewarded with more and more work, but <em>your salary, titles or earning power remains unchanged</em>. When this happens, your employer steals from your future, minimizing your earning power and your ability to get a new job at an appropriate salary level with an appropriate title.</p> \n<p><strong>2. Mercenaries corrupt patriots</strong><br /> According to Gallup and Steve Rasmussen, former CEO of Nationwide, your co-workers are either <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/157676/employees-either-patriots-mercenaries.aspx\"><em>Patriots or Mercenaries</em></a>.</p> \n<p>If you’re a <strong>Patriot</strong>, you’re engaged. You believe in your managers and co-workers, and they believe in you. You’re focused on taking care of your organization because you trust your co-workers to look out for you. If you’re a <strong>Mercenary</strong>, you’re focused primarily on yourself. You’re a job hopper or social climber. You’re focused on getting as much value as you can for yourself; forget the company!</p> \n<p>The employees who are willing to let others work for them? They’re usually mercenaries, people who are willing to do the bare minimum to collect a paycheck. Left unchecked, these mercenaries kill morale in the company, causing A-players to leave or become B- and C-players.</p> \n<p><strong>3. Crab mentality sends A-players to the bottom of the social hierarchy</strong><br /> Mediocre employees don’t like high achievers, and high achievers don’t like mediocre employees. If you’re an A-player who’s surrounded by mediocre B- and C-player employees, you’ll be punished for excellence.</p> \n<p>What does this mean specifically?</p> \n<p>Your co-workers will attempt to destroy the self-confidence of any employee (you) who achieves success or outperforms the rest of the group due to envy, spite, resentment, conspiracy or competitiveness. This isn’t mere speculation: the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tall_poppy_syndrome\">tall poppy syndrome</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab_mentality\">crab bucket mentality</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons\">tragedy of the commons</a> are all examples of this kind of behavior in action. If you’re a great developer and you’re surrounded by mediocrity, you’ll be punished for it.</p> \n<p>“Yeah, well, I don’t care what anyone thinks anyway!”</p> \n<p>Here’s why you should care. No man is an island. At some point, you’re going to need help from others to do your job or complete a task. Want to find another job? You’ll need references from your manager and co-workers.</p> \n<p><strong>4. Mercenaries sabotage patriots</strong><br /> Their methods are simple. They get A-player patriots to do the work for them. Then they immediately take the credit for the A-player’s hard work. Mercenaries use a variety of strategies to accomplish this.</p> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machiavellianism_(psychology)\">Machiavellianism</a></strong>, or interpersonal manipulation to shape alliances, is used to gain and maintain social status, regardless of their actual performance, to gain leverage against opponents or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisoning_the_well\">poison the well</a>, turning managers against A-players they perceive as a threat.</p> \n<p><strong>Indirect aggression</strong> is characterized by bullying, slander, gossip, shaming or ostracizing others. It’s common in office settings and typically involves some reputation destruction. The thing with indirect aggression is that it’s incredibly difficult to prove and harder still to counteract unless you have a clear understanding of what it is and how it works.</p> \n<p><strong>Leverage.</strong> Malicious mercenaries will use anything as leverage: past mistakes, secrets shared in confidence, insecurities — anything that will get others (you) to do what they want when they want. For whatever reason, it’s important that they win and you lose.</p> \n<p>Successful patriots use their abilities and accomplishments as leverage to counter mercenary bad behavior. But they’ll also rely on strong relationships with others as a balm for scheming behavior. Unfortunately this is the exception, not the rule.</p> \n<p>See what I mean?</p> \n<p>Working hard comes with a devastating price. So what’s the alternative then? Doing the bare minimum? Working to keep my head down and collect a steady paycheck?</p> \n<p><em>Many employees do that already.</em></p> \n<p>Doing that is worse, because it comes with its own set of miserable problems. It’s difficult to find and keep a job. The mediocre aren’t paid all that well, and they’re the first to go if your company initiates layoffs or mass firings.</p> \n<p> Continue reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/the-devastating-price-developers-pay-for-working-hard/?utm_source=rss\">The Devastating Price Developers Pay for Working Hard</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=91D313f5p-E:kdO4Q9TPzEo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=91D313f5p-E:kdO4Q9TPzEo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=91D313f5p-E:kdO4Q9TPzEo:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=91D313f5p-E:kdO4Q9TPzEo:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/91D313f5p-E\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 31 Mar 2020 23:00:52 +0000","feedId":6128,"bgimg":"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584577966working-hard.png","linkMd5":"34d31f55c94b03682c404018d87762ce","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn17@2020_6/2020/08/24/22-51-26-601_b4d9a64e22f09468.webp","destWidth":600,"destHeight":340,"sourceBytes":8442,"destBytes":8442,"author":"Andrew McDermott","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1584577966working-hard.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn17@2020_6/2020/08/24/22-51-26-601_b4d9a64e22f09468.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn15@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-39-311_6409ebad5acff93a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn3@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-47-113_bf83e999bebef320.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=91D313f5p-E:kdO4Q9TPzEo:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn62@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-35-435_f942f40beac0fc99.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/91D313f5p-E":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn74@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-41-338_08123ecaad75f5b7.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598309483280},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","title":"Five Ways to Lazy Load Images for Better Website Performance","link":"https://www.sitepoint.com/?p=152544","description":"<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/five-techniques-lazy-load-images-website-performance/?utm_source=rss\" title=\"Five Ways to Lazy Load Images for Better Website Performance\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/1585618767lazy-load-images.png\" alt=\"Five Ways to Lazy Load Images for Better Website Performance\" srcset=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/1585618767lazy-load-images-300x170.png 300w, https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/1585618767lazy-load-images.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /> </a> \n<p><strong>With images being among the most popular type of content on the web, page load time on websites can easily become an issue.</strong></p> \n<p>Even when <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/saving-bandwidth-by-using-images-the-smart-way/\">properly optimized</a>, images can weigh quite a bit. This can have a negative impact on the time visitors have to wait before they can access content on your website. Chances are, they get impatient and navigate somewhere else, unless you come up with a solution to image loading that doesn’t interfere with the perception of speed.</p> \n<p>In this article, you’ll learn about five approaches to lazy loading images that you can add to your web optimization toolkit to improve the user experience on your website.</p> \n<h2 id=\"whatislazyloading\">What Is Lazy Loading?</h2> \n<p>Lazy loading images means loading images on websites asynchronously — that is, after the above-the-fold content is fully loaded, or even conditionally, only when they appear in the browser’s viewport. This means that if users don’t scroll all the way down, images placed at the bottom of the page won’t even be loaded.</p> \n<p>A number of websites use this approach, but it’s especially noticeable on image-heavy sites. Try browsing your favorite online hunting ground for high-res photos, and you’ll soon realize how the website loads just a limited number of images. As you scroll down the page, you’ll see placeholder images quickly filling up with real images for preview. For instance, notice the loader on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/\">Unsplash.com</a>: scrolling that portion of the page into view triggers the replacement of a placeholder with a full-res photo:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/1492178800lazy-loading-unsplash.png\" alt=\"Lazy loading in action on Unsplash.com\" /></p> \n<h2 id=\"whyshouldyoucareaboutlazyloadingimages\">Why Should You Care About Lazy Loading Images?</h2> \n<p>There are at least a couple of excellent reasons why you should consider lazy loading images for your website:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>If your website uses JavaScript to display content or provide some kind of functionality to users, loading the DOM quickly becomes critical. It’s common for scripts to wait until the DOM has completely loaded before they start running. On a site with a significant number of images, lazy loading — or loading images asynchronously — could make the difference between users staying or leaving your website.</li> \n <li>Since most lazy loading solutions work by loading images only if the user has scrolled to the location where images would be visible inside the viewport, those images will never be loaded if users never get to that point. This means considerable savings in bandwidth, for which most users, especially those accessing the Web on mobile devices and slow-connections, will be thanking you.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Well, lazy loading images helps with website performance, but what’s the best way to go about it?</p> \n<p>There’s no perfect way.</p> \n<p>If you live and breathe JavaScript, implementing your own lazy loading solution shouldn’t be an issue. Nothing gives you more control than coding something yourself.</p> \n<p>Alternatively, you can browse the Web for viable approaches and start experimenting with them. I did just that and came across these five interesting techniques.</p> \n<h2 id=\"1nativelazyloading\">#1 Native Lazy Loading</h2> \n<p>Native lazy loading of images and iframes is super cool. Nothing could be more straightforward than the markup below:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"markup language-markup\">&lt;img src=\"myimage.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"...\" /&gt;\n&lt;iframe src=\"content.html\" loading=\"lazy\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n</code></pre> \n<p>As you can see, no JavaScript, no dynamic swapping of the <code>src</code> attribute’s value, just plain old HTML.</p> \n<p>The <code>loading</code> attribute gives us the option to delay off-screen images and iframes until users scroll to their location on the page. <code>loading</code> can take any of these three values:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><code>lazy</code>: works great for lazy loading</li> \n <li><code>eager</code>: instructs the browser to load the specified content right away</li> \n <li><code>auto</code>: leaves the option to lazy load or not to lazy load up to the browser.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>This method has no rivals: it has zero overhead, it’s clean and simple. However, although at the time of writing most major browsers have <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/#feat=loading-lazy-attr\">good support for the <code>loading</code> attribute</a>, not all browsers are on board yet.</p> \n<p>For an in-depth article on this awesome feature for lazy-loading images, including browser support workarounds, don’t miss Addy Osmani’s “<a href=\"https://addyosmani.com/blog/lazy-loading/\">Native image lazy-loading for the web!</a>”.</p> \n<h2 id=\"2lazyloadingusingtheintersectionobserverapi\">#2 Lazy Loading Using the Intersection Observer API</h2> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API\">Intersection Observer API</a> is a modern interface that you can leverage for lazy loading images and other content.</p> \n<p>Here’s how MDN introduces this API:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>The Intersection Observer API provides a way to asynchronously observe changes in the intersection of a target element with an ancestor element or with a top-level document’s viewport.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>In other words, what’s being asynchronously watched is the intersection of one element with another.</p> \n<p>Denys Mishunov has a great tutorial both on the Intersection Observer and on lazy loading images using it. Here’s what his solution looks like.</p> \n<p>Let’s say you’d like to lazy load an image gallery. The markup for each image would look like this:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"markup language-markup\">&lt;img data-src=\"image.jpg\" alt=\"test image\"&gt;\n</code></pre> \n<p>Notice how the path to the image is contained inside a <code>data-src</code> attribute, not a <code>src</code> attribute. The reason is that using <code>src</code> means the image would load right away, which is not what you want.</p> \n<p>In the CSS, you give each image a <code>min-height</code> value, let’s say <code>100px</code>. This gives each image placeholder (the img element without the src attribute) a vertical dimension:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"css language-css\">img {\n  min-height: 100px;\n  /* more styles here */\n}\n</code></pre> \n<p>In the JavaScript document, you then create a <code>config</code> object and register it with an <code>intersectionObserver</code> instance:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">// create config object: rootMargin and threshold\n// are two properties exposed by the interface\nconst config = {\n  rootMargin: '0px 0px 50px 0px',\n  threshold: 0\n};\n\n// register the config object with an instance\n// of intersectionObserver\nlet observer = new intersectionObserver(function(entries, self) {\n  // iterate over each entry\n  entries.forEach(entry =&gt; {\n    // process just the images that are intersecting.\n    // isIntersecting is a property exposed by the interface\n    if(entry.isIntersecting) {\n      // custom function that copies the path to the img\n      // from data-src to src\n      preloadImage(entry.target);\n      // the image is now in place, stop watching\n      self.unobserve(entry.target);\n    }\n  });\n}, config);\n</code></pre> \n<p>Finally, you iterate over all of your images and add them to this <code>iterationObserver</code> instance:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">const imgs = document.querySelectorAll('[data-src]');\nimgs.forEach(img =&gt; {\n  observer.observe(img);\n});\n</code></pre> \n<p>The merits of this solution: it’s a breeze to implement, it’s effective, and has the <code>intersectionObserver</code> do the heavy-lifting in terms of calculations.</p> \n<p>On the flip side, although the Intersection Observer API is supported by most browsers in their latest versions, it’s not <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/#feat=intersectionobserver\">consistently supported by all of them</a>. Fortunately, a <a href=\"https://github.com/w3c/IntersectionObserver/tree/master/polyfill\">polyfill is available</a>.</p> \n<p>You can learn more on the Intersection Observer API and the details of this implementation in <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/01/deferring-lazy-loading-intersection-observer-api/\">Denys’s article</a>.</p> \n<h2 id=\"3lozadjs\">#3 Lozad.js</h2> \n<p>A quick and easy alternative for implementing lazy loading of images is to let a JS library do most of the job for you.</p> \n<p>Lozad is a highly performant, light and configurable lazy loader in pure JavaScript with no dependencies. You can use it to lazy load images, videos, iframes and more, and it uses the Intersection Observer API.</p> \n<p>You can include Lozad with npm/Yarn and import it using your module bundler of choice:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npm install --save lozad\n\nyarn add lozad\n</code></pre> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">import lozad from 'lozad';\n</code></pre> \n<p>Alternatively, you can simply download the library using a CDN and add it to the bottom of the HTML page in a <code>&lt; script&gt;</code> tag:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"markup language-markup\">&lt;script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/lozad/dist/lozad.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre> \n<p>Next, for a basic implementation, add the class <em>lozad</em> to the asset in your markup:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"markup language-markup\">&lt;img class=\"lozad\" data-src=\"img.jpg\"&gt;\n</code></pre> \n<p>Finally, instantiate Lozad in your JS document:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">const observer = lozad();\nobserver.observe();\n</code></pre> \n<p>You’ll find all the details of how you can use the library on the <a href=\"https://github.com/ApoorvSaxena/lozad.js\">Lozad GitHub repository</a>.</p> \n<p>If you don’t want to dive into the workings of the Intersection Observer API or you’re simply looking for a fast implementation that applies to a variety of content types, Lozad is a great choice.</p> \n<p>Only, be mindful of browser support and eventually integrate this library with a polyfill for the Intersection Observer API.</p> \n<p> Continue reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/five-techniques-lazy-load-images-website-performance/?utm_source=rss\">Five Ways to Lazy Load Images for Better Website Performance</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=7GHJTfs8iVY:D3fQHaQBI98:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=7GHJTfs8iVY:D3fQHaQBI98:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=7GHJTfs8iVY:D3fQHaQBI98:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=7GHJTfs8iVY:D3fQHaQBI98:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/7GHJTfs8iVY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 01 Apr 2020 13:00:29 +0000","feedId":6128,"bgimg":"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/1585618767lazy-load-images.png","linkMd5":"348aae744f92b9d1c48ff3a07a411cb9","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn74@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-26-162_43bf1f20344c0ee9.webp","destWidth":600,"destHeight":339,"sourceBytes":6930,"destBytes":6930,"author":"Maria Antonietta Perna","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/1585618767lazy-load-images.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn74@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-26-162_43bf1f20344c0ee9.webp","https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/1492178800lazy-loading-unsplash.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn20@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-51-41-634_da178a82a0a5c9d9.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn15@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-39-311_6409ebad5acff93a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn3@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-47-113_bf83e999bebef320.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=7GHJTfs8iVY:D3fQHaQBI98:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn91@2020_6/2020/08/24/22-51-47-368_25296ac9b0b56ddc.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/7GHJTfs8iVY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn57@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-51-35-106_591f7b67101678a4.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598309483280},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","title":"Why Flippa Is the Best Place to Sell Your Website","link":"https://editor.sitepoint.com/?p=176633","description":"<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/why-flippa-is-the-best-place-to-sell-your-website/?utm_source=rss\" title=\"Why Flippa Is the Best Place to Sell Your Website\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual\" style=\"display: block;

In this article, we’ll look at how buying an online business through Flippa compares with buying one through a broker.</strong></p> \n<p>Digital real estate will become the next great commodity. Individuals and companies alike will buy and sell their assets as a means of investment, trading to scale up and continuing to invest for growth. The ability to buy and sell these commodities with ease has already become a battleground where a multitude of businesses are vying to win. Just as with real estate, cryptocurrency, stocks and bonds, or even precious metals, there is a need to trade these digital assets on the free market.</p> \n<p>Deciding between a peer-to-peer marketplace like Flippa.com versus a <a href=\"https://www.flippa.com/businesses/business-brokers\">website broker</a> is critical when looking for the right opportunity, accessing the largest base of buyers, speed of sale and price optimization. </p> \n<p>Now, <a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/growth-quarters/2020/01/30/digital-trends-2020-every-single-stat-you-need-to-know-about-the-internet/\">more than ever before</a>, there’s a new group entering the digital economy. Traditional industries have been upended and jobs that existed only months ago are no longer viable. Thanks to these fast-moving changes, a whole new group of people will find themselves in ownership positions, running digital real estate and extrapolating value out of a predominantly online world. Every generation is now aware of the opportunity: you can supplement your income, or completely replace your traditional income stream, from the comfort of your home.</p> \n<p>So what happens when there’s literally hundreds of millions of digital real estate assets in operation? They become tradable. As with traditional real estate, there’s a ready market of buyers clamoring over the best and a steady influx of owners looking to offload their assets as they move to grow their investments.</p> \n<h2 id=\"whataretheplatformspoweringthisneweconomy\">What are the platforms powering this new economy?</h2> \n<p>Before we jump into the platforms available to trade digital assets, we should consider the platforms that have led the way in creating this new economy. The number of tradable sites and other digital assets that are powering this growing economy is staggering, and the data behind the platforms that are powering this new asset class are equally enthralling. Whether we’re talking about “traditional” ecommerce sites focussed on selling branded product held in local warehouses, modern drop-shipping storefronts that essentially operate as middlemen between manufacturers and customers, or websites based on entertainment and information, driving revenue through advertising or affiliate marketing programs, there are a few platforms that are absolutely dominating this space and they are doing so in historical fashion.</p> \n<p>Let’s take a look at the four largest platforms that are leading the way for the traders of digital assets within the Flippa marketplace and through digital brokerage firms.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1594698547amazon.jpg\" alt=\"stacked ecommerce icons\" width=\"1000\" height=\"507\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-176644\" /></p> \n<h3 id=\"amazon\">Amazon</h3> \n<p>All hail the king. The once-upon-a-time electronic book seller is not just the largest online retailer on the planet at this point, but dominates the booming digital asset economy as well.</p> \n<p>Did you know that half of all sales on Amazon come from third-party sellers? <a href=\"https://qz.com/1256651/amazon-marketplace-sold-more-stuff-than-amazon-itself-in-2017/\">It’s true</a>. There are actually more goods being sold through Amazon’s retail site by third-party vendors than Amazon is selling itself. If you take a look the next time you’re purchasing something through this behemoth, notice if it says the item is sold and/or shipped by Amazon or another party. It’s nearly impossible to survive as a consumer packaged goods brand these days without a presence on Amazon. And, once there, it’s all about competing through optimized listings and carefully positioned advertising to reach the number one space within your given niche.</p> \n<p>What many forward thinking entrepreneurs discovered through the Amazon platform was their Fulfilled by Amazon (FBA) system that essentially runs as a hands-off logistics integration. Today, there are over two million FBA sites live online, with 3,500 sellers joining that ecosystem daily. These businesses have found a way to move their product through Amazon’s system by providing the goods and marketing, but allowing Amazon to handle all of the fulfillment and customer service. In fact, these businesses have found so much success that it’s suggested the average turnover per FBA store is $115,000 annually.</p> \n<h3 id=\"shopify\">Shopify</h3> \n<p>Shopify has made a very strong name for itself over the past decade and is now the go-to answer for any business or individual looking to set up an independent ecommerce business with ease. It currently <a href=\"https://ecommerce-platforms.com/articles/best-shopify-stores\">boasts over 500,000 active sites</a> and the average revenue per business is noted at $50,000 per year. The added benefit that many users find when working with Shopify to build a successful digital business is the ability to readily integrate with several drop shipping service providers such as <a href=\"https://www.oberlo.com/\">Oberlo</a>. These plugins allow users to select items from overseas manufacturers and warehousers which they can sell on their site without the hassle, or upfront expenses, associated with purchasing, storing, and shipping inventory from their own location.</p> \n<h3 id=\"googleadsense\">Google AdSense</h3> \n<p>Not all digital businesses are selling products. Many, perhaps even most, are creating content, be it information or entertainment, and supplementing that content with advertisements in order to generate revenue. Google’s AdSense platform has made it incredibly easy for even the most amateur digital asset holders to monetize their websites. Opposed to a traditional newspaper or television stations that might be seeking out individual companies to sponsor their programming, AdSense simply plugs into your site using smart API integration and places appropriate ads on your website without any negotiation. At this point, over <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_AdSense#:~:text=Over%2011.1%20million%20websites%20use%20AdSense.\">11.1 million websites have integrated the AdSense platform</a>, each generating average revenue of $3,500 per year. Combined, AdSense has a value of $7billion in annual revenue. No wonder so many eager entrepreneurs are looking to trade these commodities.</p> \n<h3 id=\"wordpress\">WordPress</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://hostingtribunal.com/blog/wordpress-statistics/#gref\">Powering 35% of the Internet in 2020</a>, WordPress is one of (if not the) largest host of monetized, tradable digital assets in the world. Used for a variety of businesses from ecommerce companies to brick and mortar stores in need of a digital presence, WordPress truly serves the entire community. Bloggers certainly have a strong affinity with WordPress due to the ease of use, SEO practicalities, and thousands of helpful plugins. Of those bloggers, 65% have either a product or a service for sale, and 66% of them make money with their content. Professional bloggers have been reported to make an average of $185,000 per blog per year, while hobbyists are reporting an average of $16,000 per year.</p> \n<p>Many digital entrepreneurs use WordPress as a host for their ecommerce businesses, 28% of which are using the WordPress owned WooCommerce platform, which has similar integrations to Shopify as far as building a drop shipping business or managing warehoused inventory for online sale.</p> \n<p>All said and done, this was a lot of information just to let you know that digital entrepreneurship is big business and sees no signs of slowing down!</p> \n<p>If you already own and manage a content site or ecommerce business, or if you’re looking to enter the industry by acquiring an already successful online business, the question remains: what is the best way to go about it?</p> \n<p>Categorically, the best option for nearly all online businesses, websites, and investors is <a href=\"https://www.flippa.com/\">Flippa.com</a>.</p> \n<h2 id=\"whatarethedifferencesbetweenflippaandabroker\">What are the differences between Flippa and a broker?</h2> \n<p>The easiest way to understand the difference between Flippa and a broker is to draw an analogy. Let’s pretend that, rather than a digital asset, you’re in the market to either buy or sell a piece of art.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1594698574art.jpg\" alt=\"man viewing a wall of artworks\" width=\"1000\" height=\"568\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-176645\" /></p> \n<p>As an art buyer, you want to see the widest selection of art available. You want to see paintings, drawings, sculptures, and maybe some modern art concepts that haven’t even crossed your mind. And beyond that, you want to be able to speak to the artists themselves. You want the opportunity to ask them about their work, what it means, why and how they created it. Then, you want the opportunity to negotiate with the artist for a price that works for your budget. Essentially, as a buyer, you want the largest selection, you want a great experience, and you want a fair price.</p> \n<p>As a seller, you want to showcase your artwork on a stage that gets the most attention. You know that you’ll likely only sell a few pieces of art each year, or maybe just one piece every couple of years, so you want the best chance of finding a buyer who’s excited about what you’ve created. More so, you realize that your art is unique, so you want the chance to explain to potential buyers why yours is worth the money. And, of course, you want to make as much as possible through the sale.</p> \n<p>Essentially, as a seller, you want the largest available field of buyers, a simple communication process, and you want to be able to make the most money possible.</p> \n<p>If these are your requirements as a buyer or a seller of digital assets, Flippa wins, hands down, when compared to a broker. As a peer to peer marketplace, Flippa provides the largest selection of assets, the most people searching to buy an asset, the most fluid communication experience, and the ability to negotiate for the best price possible on both sides of the deal.</p> \n<p>Don’t get us wrong. Brokers can also be great.</p> \n<p>Let’s look again at art as a parallel to digital assets. In this scenario, a broker will often have a very nice, yet much smaller selection of works. Many of their pieces are incredibly high in value, but their process for selling those pieces is much more closed. They work with a narrow range of creators and a small group of potential buyers who are all looking for something highly specific. In addition, the broker will take over the sales process, performing the burden of communications and negotiations as a middleman, which can certainly be a benefit to some, but this separates the seller from the buyer, removing the excitement from the potential sale.</p> \n<p>Selling with Flippa would be like selling at a popular gallery in the middle of a major city. People flow in and out, looking for all sorts of deals, from affordable to expensive, from paintings to sculptures, often looking to move quickly once they find what they like.</p> \n<p>Replace the paintings, sculptures, and drawings that an artist might sell with the ecommerce businesses, content sites, and SaaS products that a digital entrepreneur might sell, and you have the difference between Flippa and a digital assets broker. While brokers often have fantastic assets, it’s a relatively small collection, their pool of potential buyers is rather small, and there are hurdles within the acquisition process that must be conquered. A company like Flippa, on the other hand, has an extensive portfolio, an massive user base, and a platform that’s quite easy to join and navigate without any help.</p> \n<p>What’s more in our reasoning to choose Flippa in this equation is that <a href=\"https://www.flippa.com/businesses/business-brokers\">Flippa actually works in partnership with brokers</a> as well, should that be your preferred method of going about the process. Flippa’s network of brokers combines the best of both worlds. If you’re new to trading digital assets or you just don’t have the time or energy to work the sale yourself, choosing to work with one of the brokers recognized by Flippa will give you that hands-on treatment, but also gives you the advantage of the size of the Flippa community.</p> \n<p> Continue reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/why-flippa-is-the-best-place-to-sell-your-website/?utm_source=rss\">Why Flippa Is the Best Place to Sell Your Website</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=3IamY2L3UTw:WUo8Q8HckmU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=3IamY2L3UTw:WUo8Q8HckmU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=3IamY2L3UTw:WUo8Q8HckmU:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=3IamY2L3UTw:WUo8Q8HckmU:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/3IamY2L3UTw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 13 Jul 2020 19:48:13 +0000","feedId":6128,"bgimg":"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1594699498flippa.png","linkMd5":"5835b846052a5537b75e2150ccb45819","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn37@2020_3/2020/08/24/22-51-24-742_f66e707679e788c4.webp","destWidth":600,"destHeight":339,"sourceBytes":9060,"destBytes":9060,"author":"SitePoint Team","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1594699498flippa.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn37@2020_3/2020/08/24/22-51-24-742_f66e707679e788c4.webp","https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1594698547amazon.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn35@2020_3/2020/08/24/22-51-40-591_95639c1bbd821d54.webp","https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1594698574art.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn77@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-40-275_c17cf663d2f5b155.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn15@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-39-311_6409ebad5acff93a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn3@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-47-113_bf83e999bebef320.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=3IamY2L3UTw:WUo8Q8HckmU:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn41@2020_6/2020/08/24/22-51-36-475_f16b1c08edad3449.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/3IamY2L3UTw":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn42@2020_3/2020/08/24/22-51-37-056_ffb6cd7dd44752f1.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598309483257},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","title":"8 Pre-built BeTheme Sites You Can Edit with Elementor","link":"https://editor.sitepoint.com/?p=176358","description":"<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/8-pre-built-betheme-sites-you-can-edit-with-elementor/?utm_source=rss\" title=\"8 Pre-built BeTheme Sites You Can Edit with Elementor\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1588813942multipurpose-themes.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1588813942multipurpose-themes-300x170.png 300w, https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1588813942multipurpose-themes.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /> </a> \n<p>The truth is that the WordPress classic editor had its shortcomings as far as providing solutions to building attractive, high-quality websites.

This year, I’ve endeavored to settle on my selections, commit, and get the workflows sorted out. I’ve been doing this with other mainstays in my system like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://textexpander.com/\">TextExpander</a>&nbsp;(a snippet manager) and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.alfredapp.com/\">Alfred</a>&nbsp;(a powerful launcher) as well. Seven months into the year, I’m confident that this effort has been fruitful.</p> \n<p>Managing complexity without compromising it has always been interesting to me. My first gig with meaningful traffic was as a Lifehack writer in the mid-2000s. I’ve gorged myself on and become disillusioned by my quest for software holy grails more times than I can count. This quest is even a hereditary calling of sorts. As a kid, car conversations with my father compared the merits of Grandview and Lotus Agenda, or how much you could get done with an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_Portfolio\">Atari Portfolio</a>&nbsp;on the train (an incredible amount, said with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/stories/working-on-the-ipad-one-year-later-still-my-favorite-computer/\">Viticci</a>-esque passion). He taught me spreadsheets by having us log our jogging metrics on a Macintosh Portable. This is not a very portable device, for the record:</p> \n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-177043\" src=\"https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1596788866Macintosh_Portable-IMG_7541-9900000000079e3c.jpg\" alt=\"Macintosh Portable\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" /></p> \n<p>I’m sure his heart still lies with an obscure 90s app called DayInfo — along with his data from that era, no doubt.</p> \n<p>This impossible but driving need to Reach Clarity has, for better or worse, entrenched itself within my own brain.</p> \n<p>Between then and now, information management and productivity software wandered in the wilderness. As a species, we have mastered the art of the list app. We have put more effort into this endeavour than the moon landing and the Large Hadron Collider combined. Nothing has impeded our ability to imagine new ways of being reminded about the things on the list.</p> \n<p>And yet the list has remained an unsatisfying — although not impotent — tool on its own. Lists are bad at context, yet we know that actions are meaningless without strategy. So, we’ve tried to brute force systems that provide context through lists. Folders of lists.&nbsp;<em>Areas of responsibilities</em>&nbsp;full of lists. The Today list, tomorrow’s list, Someday/Maybe,&nbsp;lists in kanban&nbsp;boards and listicles of list tips, tricks, and apps. Brain-dump into your big list and schedule a weekly review&nbsp;to sort that into your little lists. In this wilderness, lists have been our manna.</p> \n<p>For much of the last five years, I used a Bullet Journal-esque Markdown file to manage my tasks. It felt like a private stance of rejection against the pandering, posing performance art of productivity pornography.</p> \n<p>It felt good. It was a productive time.</p> \n<p>This isn’t an uncommon progression for the knowledge worker, whether you’re a developer, writer, or you sell a Memberful subscription to your clarinet lessons. Well ahead of the curve, Gina Trapani, founding editor of Lifehacker, became a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://todotxt.org/\">todo.txt</a>&nbsp;proponent. We’d all been let down by the failure of software to do what we had hoped it would do. We wanted it to connect the strategic and execution contexts for our lives, bridging the divide between the two so we could move forward with purpose. Instead, we had lists.</p> \n<p>Until the last few years, that is, when something broke loose and the fundamentalist rigidity around structure began to fall away. Notion created the momentum here. It cracked the tough UI problems of mixing free-form content tools with the power of the database.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://airtable.com/\">Airtable</a>&nbsp;pushed the spreadsheet into new territory. Its API is in the wild, giving us a glimpse at how much you can achieve when you can connect these engines to your data. A veritable horde stampedes over Notion’s social media manager every day, begging for an API timeline.</p> \n<p>I love the tools in this new wave of productivity software. I’ve used Notion personally for a few years and have been rebuilding SitePoint’s editorial workflow on it over the past month or two. For me, Notion&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;a holy grail.</p> [caption id=\"attachment_177044\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"273\"]\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-177044\" src=\"https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1596788927notion-views-9903cf06db028a3c.png\" alt=\"Notion\" width=\"273\" height=\"488\" />Freedom from lists: a mirage, 2020[/caption] \n<p>Sure, there are frequent moments of frustration. It’s so close to being unstoppably powerful – if only we had the API, or more powerful formulas and relational interactions. But these frustrations are borne of seeing the unfulfilled potential, rather than feeling stifled by inherent limitations. That’s an exciting shift.</p> \n<p>For all its anti-structure, Notion is best when you know how you want to structure your life, team, project, or data. It gives you all the tools you need to design workflows and dashboards that will be most useful for your use case. It is flexible to the extreme, but not the ideal free-wheeler.</p> \n<p>There’s another important side of information management. The ideal tool looks different when you want to build an organic body of knowledge. These tools should help you create context between discrete units of knowledge. They should help you do so rapidly without excessive structural overhead. The most valuable features are seamless interlinking, fast search, universal capture, and simplicity.</p> \n<p>In recent years, people like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ctietze\">Christian Tietze</a>&nbsp;have shared how they build digital&nbsp;<a href=\"https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/\"><em>zettelkastens</em></a>&nbsp;with apps like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/\">nvALT</a>. This concept has driven the wave of new apps built around these needs. In broad strokes, it’s an atomic database of all the information you acquire and deem worthy of saving. It grows and – this is the key – forms connections with the rest of your atomic notes over time. Similar thinking is at the root of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fortelabs.co/blog/basboverview/\">Second Brain</a>&nbsp;concept.</p> \n<p>There are a few apps bringing this style of information management into the future. The most famous is Roam Research, which I have not tried myself.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://obsidian.md/\">Obsidian</a>&nbsp;is another option that works well for developers. It’s also great for people who otherwise deal with a lot of code (like me – as an occasional developer, but primarily as an editor of content about code). Obsidian stores notes in local, plaintext Markdown, and you can use your preferred sync method.</p> [caption id=\"attachment_177045\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"800\"]\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-177045\" src=\"https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1596788985formatting-990000079e04513c.jpg\" alt=\"Obsidian's formatting options\" width=\"800\" height=\"919\" /> Obsidian’s formatting options[/caption] \n<p>It handles code blocks well, and offers features like Vim mode and a graph view of your note connections. For developers, the ideal tool should also be able to serve as a code snippet manager. Obsidian has what it takes, and you can extend it with plugins to make up for functionality you miss.</p> \n<p>My friend&nbsp;<a href=\"https://joeprevite.com/\">Joe Previte</a>&nbsp;recently posted a Twitter thread about these tools which introduced me to a new option,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://foambubble.github.io/foam/\">Foam</a>.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> \n <p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">I decided to experiment with Foam by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jevakallio?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@jevakallio</a> today.</p> \n <p>Here is a thread with my notes 👇🏼</p> \n <p>— Joe Previte (@jsjoeio) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jsjoeio/status/1278458385676021760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 1, 2020</a></p>\n</blockquote> \n<p><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p> \n<p>If the ideal knowledge manager should be able to replace your snippet manager, wouldn’t it be ideal if you could drive it from the app you write code in?</p> \n<p>Foam takes its cues from Roam Research — no surprise — but it’s built on Visual Studio Code and GitHub. Like Obsidian, it isn’t bound to the cloud, but unlike Obsidian it’s truly free and open source.</p> \n<p>The way in which it is extensible differs, too. As Joe notes, the ability to work with Code’s multitude of extensions gives Foam a powerful leg up. This is truer the more the use case applies to developers. Compare the options available in Code versus Obsidian’s built-in search, Vim mode, or GitHub integration. As with Obsidian, you can write your own extensions (if you’re a Premium member, you can access&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/visual-studio-code-end-to-end-editing-and-debugging-tools-for-web-developers/?utm_source=SitePoint&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Versioning\">this VS Code&nbsp;book from Wiley</a>&nbsp;to learn how).</p> \n<p>Obsidian is the batteries-included option and it’s a good one. If you want absolute control at the expense of time, Foam offers it. Conversely, VS Code’s popularity means there are more off-the-shelf workflows to use with your other tools.</p> \n<p>While I manage my life in Notion, I manage my writing with Git. That happens beneath a layer of proprietary apps like Ulysses, and I’m uninterested in moving the writing process itself to Code. But it does make this approach appealing for my notes.</p> \n<p>We’ve gained so much power in our tools that you can almost replace a raft of apps with two. Are we far from seeing structured and unstructured information management apps collide? I don’t know, but for clarity’s sake it may be best that they don’t. Perhaps that’s how my brain works, and the app that does it all for you is taking shape in a repo somewhere.</p> \n<p>But for the first time in a long time, I’m enjoying the quest for the holy grail again.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1596790200robot.jpg\" alt=\"AI under construction\" width=\"840\" height=\"250\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-177051\" /></p> \n<p><strong>This editorial was originally published in the <a href=\"http://go.sitepoint.com/t/y-A4F56872960D5149\">23 July 2020 issue of SitePoint Weekly</a>.</strong> To get the freshest resources, stories, and exclusive content for web developers, designers, and digital creators in your inbox each week, <a href=\"https://go.sitepoint.com/h/y/FF8A1E8197B86A00\">sign up here</a>.</p> \n<p> Continue reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/the-second-coming-of-the-productivity-tool/?utm_source=rss\">The Second Coming of the Productivity Tool</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=zXID788nNN8:MNswIKy1AJA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=zXID788nNN8:MNswIKy1AJA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=zXID788nNN8:MNswIKy1AJA:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=zXID788nNN8:MNswIKy1AJA:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/zXID788nNN8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 06 Aug 2020 15:55:21 +0000","feedId":6128,"bgimg":"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1596790397robot.png","linkMd5":"6ee11d3d1b95fe8961b1634fe3d6cda8","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn50@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-51-26-873_732e5f9b44333073.webp","destWidth":876,"destHeight":461,"sourceBytes":12590,"destBytes":12590,"author":"Joel Falconer","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1596790397robot.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn50@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-51-26-873_732e5f9b44333073.webp","https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1596788866Macintosh_Portable-IMG_7541-9900000000079e3c.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn62@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-51-41-619_ca42b5d594441c43.webp","https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1596788927notion-views-9903cf06db028a3c.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn65@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-41-145_2ed6c5a3d6745b3e.webp","https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1596788985formatting-990000079e04513c.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn62@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-44-958_b0af6db2117f290b.webp","https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1596790200robot.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn46@2020_3/2020/08/24/22-51-45-914_4381601be8a47162.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn15@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-39-311_6409ebad5acff93a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn3@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-47-113_bf83e999bebef320.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=zXID788nNN8:MNswIKy1AJA:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn71@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-36-081_8bb2e97f8baaf695.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/zXID788nNN8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn21@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-45-655_609c40d3866a7d7f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598309483248},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","title":"MEAN Stack: Build an App with Angular and the Angular CLI","link":"https://www.sitepoint.com/?p=158416","description":"<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/mean-stack-angular-angular-cli/?utm_source=rss\" title=\"MEAN Stack: Build an App with Angular and the Angular CLI\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual\" style=\"display: block;

We’ll use the most common MEAN architecture of having an Angular single-page app using a REST API built with Node, Express and MongoDB.</strong></p> \n<p>When thinking about user authentication, we need to tackle the following things:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>let a user register</li> \n <li>save user data, but never directly store passwords</li> \n <li>let a returning user log in</li> \n <li>keep a logged in user’s session alive between page visits</li> \n <li>have some pages that can only been seen by logged in users</li> \n <li>change output to the screen depending on logged in status (for example, a “login” button or a “my profile” button).</li> \n</ol> \n<p>Before we dive into the code, let’s take a few minutes for a high-level look at how authentication is going to work in the MEAN stack.</p> \n<h2 id=\"themeanstackauthenticationflow\">The MEAN Stack Authentication Flow</h2> \n<p>So what does authentication look like in the MEAN stack?</p> \n<p>Still keeping this at a high level, these are the components of the flow:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>user data is stored in MongoDB, with the passwords hashed</li> \n <li>CRUD functions are built in an Express API — Create (register), Read (login, get profile), Update, Delete</li> \n <li>an Angular application calls the API and deals with the responses</li> \n <li>the Express API generates a <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/using-json-web-tokens-node-js/\">JSON Web Token</a> (JWT, pronounced “Jot”) upon registration or login, and passes this to the Angular application</li> \n <li>the Angular application stores the JWT in order to maintain the user’s session</li> \n <li>the Angular application checks the validity of the JWT when displaying protected views</li> \n <li>the Angular application passes the JWT back to Express when calling protected API routes.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>JWTs are preferred over cookies for maintaining the session state in the browser. Cookies are better for maintaining state when using a server-side application.</p> \n<h2 id=\"theexampleapplication\">The Example Application</h2> \n<p>The code for this tutorial is available on <a href=\"https://github.com/sitepoint-editors/mean-authentication\">GitHub</a>. To run the application, you’ll need to have <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/quick-tip-multiple-versions-node-nvm/\">Node.js installed</a>, along with <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-mongodb/\">MongoDB</a>. (For instructions on how to install, please refer to <a href=\"https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/administration/install-community/\">Mongo’s official documentation — Windows, Linux, macOS</a>).</p> \n<h3 id=\"theangularapp\">The Angular App</h3> \n<p>To keep the example in this tutorial simple, we’ll start with an Angular app with four pages:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>home page</li> \n <li>register page</li> \n <li>login page</li> \n <li>profile page</li> \n</ol> \n<p>The pages are pretty basic and look like this to start with:</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/1453465473CombinedScreenshots-1024x620.png\" alt=\"Screenshots of the app\" /></p> \n<p>The profile page will only be accessible to authenticated users. All the files for the Angular app are in a folder inside the Angular CLI app called <code>/client</code>.</p> \n<p>We’ll use the Angular CLI for building and running the local server. If you’re unfamiliar with the Angular CLI, refer to the <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/angular-2-tutorial/\">Building a Todo App with Angular CLI</a> tutorial to get started.</p> \n<h3 id=\"therestapi\">The REST API</h3> \n<p>We’ll also start off with the skeleton of a REST API built with Node, Express and MongoDB, using <a href=\"http://mongoosejs.com/\">Mongoose</a> to manage the schemas. This API should initially have three routes:</p> \n<ol> \n <li><code>/api/register</code> (POST), to handle new users registering</li> \n <li><code>/api/login</code> (POST), to handle returning users logging in</li> \n <li><code>/api/profile/USERID</code> (GET), to return profile details when given a <code>USERID</code></li> \n</ol> \n<p>Let’s set that up now. We can use the <a href=\"https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html\">express-generator</a> tool to create a lot of the boiler plate for us. If this is new for you, we have a <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/create-new-express-js-apps-with-express-generator/\">tutorial on using it here</a>.</p> \n<p>Install it with <code>npm i -g express-generator</code>. Then, create a new Express app, choosing <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/a-beginners-guide-to-pug/\">Pug</a> as the view engine:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">express -v pug mean-authentication\n</code></pre> \n<p>When the generator has run, change into the project directory and install the dependencies:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">cd mean-authentication\nnpm i\n</code></pre> \n<p>At the time of writing, this pulls in an outdated version of Pug. Let’s fix that:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npm i pug@latest\n</code></pre> \n<p>We can also install Mongoose while we’re at it:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npm i mongoose\n</code></pre> \n<p>Next, we need to create our folder structure.</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Remove the <code>public</code> folder: <code>rm -rf public</code>.</li> \n <li>Create an <code>api</code> directory: <code>mkdir api</code>.</li> \n <li>Create a <code>controllers</code>, a <code>models</code>, and a <code>routes</code> directory in the <code>api</code> directory: <code>mkdir -p api/{controllers,models,routes}</code>.</li> \n <li>Create a <code>authenication.js</code> file and a <code>profile.js</code> file in the <code>controllers</code> directory: <code>touch api/controllers/{authentication.js,profile.js}</code>.</li> \n <li>Create a <code>db.js</code> file and a <code>users.js</code> file in the <code>models</code> directory: <code>touch api/models/{db.js,users.js}</code>.</li> \n <li>Create an <code>index.js</code> file in the <code>routes</code> directory: <code>touch api/routes/index.js</code>.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>When you’re done, things should look like this:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">.\n└── api\n    ├── controllers\n    │   ├── authentication.js\n    │   └── profile.js\n    ├── models\n    │   ├── db.js\n    │   └── users.js\n    └── routes\n        └── index.js\n</code></pre> \n<p>Now let’s add the API functionality. Replace the code in <code>app.js</code> with the following:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">require('./api/models/db');\n\nconst cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');\nconst createError = require('http-errors');\nconst express = require('express');\nconst logger = require('morgan');\nconst path = require('path');\n\nconst routesApi = require('./api/routes/index');\n\nconst app = express();\n\n// view engine setup\napp.set('views', path.join(__dirname, 'views'));\napp.set('view engine', 'pug');\n\napp.use(logger('dev'));\napp.use(express.json());\napp.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }));\napp.use(cookieParser());\napp.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));\n\napp.use('/api', routesApi);\n\n// catch 404 and forward to error handler\napp.use((req, res, next) =&gt; {\n  next(createError(404));\n});\n\n// error handler\napp.use((err, req, res, next) =&gt; {\n  // set locals, only providing error in development\n  res.locals.message = err.message;\n  res.locals.error = req.app.get('env') === 'development' ? err : {};\n\n  // render the error page\n  res.status(err.status || 500);\n  res.render('error');\n});\n\nmodule.exports = app;\n</code></pre> \n<p>Add the following to <code>api/models/db.js</code>:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">require('./users');\nconst mongoose = require('mongoose');\nconst dbURI = 'mongodb://localhost:27017/meanAuth';\n\nmongoose.set('useCreateIndex', true);\nmongoose.connect(dbURI, {\n  useNewUrlParser: true,\n  useUnifiedTopology: true\n});\n\nmongoose.connection.on('connected', () =&gt; {\n  console.log(`Mongoose connected to ${dbURI}`);\n});\nmongoose.connection.on('error', (err) =&gt; {\n  console.log(`Mongoose connection error: ${err}`);\n});\nmongoose.connection.on('disconnected', () =&gt; {\n  console.log('Mongoose disconnected');\n});\n</code></pre> \n<p>Add the following to <code>api/routes/index.js</code>:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">const ctrlAuth = require('../controllers/authentication');\nconst ctrlProfile = require('../controllers/profile');\n\nconst express = require('express');\nconst router = express.Router();\n\n// profile\nrouter.get('/profile/:userid', ctrlProfile.profileRead);\n\n// authentication\nrouter.post('/register', ctrlAuth.register);\nrouter.post('/login', ctrlAuth.login);\n\nmodule.exports = router;\n</code></pre> \n<p>Add the following to <code>api/controllers/profile.js</code>:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">module.exports.profileRead = (req, res) =&gt; {\n  console.log(`Reading profile ID: ${req.params.userid}`);\n  res.status(200);\n  res.json({\n    message : `Profile read: ${req.params.userid}`\n  });\n};\n</code></pre> \n<p>Add the following to <code>api/controllers/authentication.js</code>:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">module.exports.register = (req, res) =&gt; {\n  console.log(`Registering user: ${req.body.email}`);\n  res.status(200);\n  res.json({\n    message : `User registered: ${req.body.email}`\n  });\n};\n\nmodule.exports.login = (req, res) =&gt; {\n  console.log(`Logging in user: ${req.body.email}`);\n  res.status(200);\n  res.json({\n    message : `User logged in: ${req.body.email}`\n  });\n};\n</code></pre> \n<p>Ensure that Mongo is running and then, finally, start the server with <code>npm run start</code>. If everything is configured properly, you should see a message in your terminal that Mongoose is connected to <code>mongodb://localhost:27017/meanAuth</code>, and you should now be able to make requests to, and get responses from, the API. You can test this with a tool such as <a href=\"https://www.postman.com/\">Postman</a>.</p> \n<p> Continue reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/mean-stack-angular-angular-cli/?utm_source=rss\">MEAN Stack: Build an App with Angular and the Angular CLI</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=QH5kpKYX-gk:01GZgIlr7P0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=QH5kpKYX-gk:01GZgIlr7P0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=QH5kpKYX-gk:01GZgIlr7P0:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=QH5kpKYX-gk:01GZgIlr7P0:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/QH5kpKYX-gk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Sun, 29 Mar 2020 13:00:13 +0000","feedId":6128,"bgimg":"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/1584495070mean-stack-angular.png","linkMd5":"f13dda5a88ab65fa5df6c1f5143d2854","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn37@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-24-673_b8488d10606c4836.webp","destWidth":600,"destHeight":339,"sourceBytes":7934,"destBytes":7934,"author":"Jurgen Van de Moere","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/1584495070mean-stack-angular.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn37@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-24-673_b8488d10606c4836.webp","http://www.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/1453465473CombinedScreenshots-1024x620.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn36@2020_4/2020/08/24/22-51-39-769_c5ea9d9ccfb34ea1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn15@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-39-311_6409ebad5acff93a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn3@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-47-113_bf83e999bebef320.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=QH5kpKYX-gk:01GZgIlr7P0:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn28@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-40-955_46e73d48622d10c1.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/QH5kpKYX-gk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn50@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-51-35-094_0994eb36f1b7c135.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598309483282},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","title":"Web Developer Workflow Tools: A Beginner&#8217;s Guide","link":"https://www.sitepoint.com/?p=175773","description":"<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/web-developer-workflow-tools/?utm_source=rss\" title=\"Web Developer Workflow Tools: A Beginner’s Guide\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1585885374workflow-tools.png\" alt=\"Workflow Tools Every Web Developer Should Know About\" srcset=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1585885374workflow-tools-300x170.png 300w, https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1585885374workflow-tools.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /> </a> \n<p><strong>Here’s a primer for the tools all web developers should get to know, from basic Bash commands to web browser add-ons that will debug your web apps and automate navigation tests, plus continuous integrations pipelines.</strong></p> \n<p>Keep in mind this article is intended to cover the tools that the largest number of web developers will share a need to learn, not a comprehensive listing.

Who knows, folks at Microsoft might figure the naming thing out by version 8 or 9. 🤷‍♂️</p> \n<h3 id=\"cygwinalsowindows\">Cygwin (also Windows)</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://cygwin.com/\"><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Cygwin_logo.svg/180px-Cygwin_logo.svg.png\" align=\"right\" /></a></p> \n<p>You missed the Bash on Windows?

For those of you used to the power of the Bash shell but working regularly on a Windows environment, there’s an alternative.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://cygwin.com/\">Cygwin</a> is a POSIX-compatible environment that runs natively on Microsoft Windows, where the installation directory behaves like the root and follows a similar directory layout to that found in Unix-like systems.</p> \n<h2 id=\"codeeditors\">Code Editors</h2> \n<p>You almost certainly know what a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-code_editor\">source-code editor</a> is, but you might not know about some of their <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_user\">power features</a>, such git integration.</p> \n<p>There are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment\">integrated development environments</a> (IDEs) such as <a href=\"http://netbeans.apache.org/\">NetBeans</a> and <a href=\"https://www.eclipse.org/\">Eclipse</a> — but they’re bloated with features we mostly won’t care about anyway.</p> \n<p>As web developers, we’re more inclined towards <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-platform_software\">cross-platform tools</a>. Let’s take a look at a few of them.</p> \n<h3 id=\"atom\">Atom</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://atom.io/\"><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Atom_icon.svg/180px-Atom_icon.svg.png\" align=\"right\" /></a></p> \n<p>Not surprisingly, as it’s developed by GitHub, <a href=\"https://atom.io/\">Atom</a> has the finest embedded Git control of any text editor, specifically aimed for GitHub repositories.</p> \n<p>But that’s not all. The “hackable text editor for the 21st Century” is incredibly easy to customize (see the <a href=\"https://atom.io/docs\">docs</a>), and a rich <a href=\"https://atom.io/packages\">packages</a> and <a href=\"https://atom.io/themes\">themes</a> ecosystem has flourished around it.

but never in a team environment? Are you familiar with <a href=\"http://www.sitepoint.com/git-for-beginners/\">the basics of Git</a> but unsure how large teams use Git at work?</strong></p> \n<p>In this post, I’ll talk about the basic Git techniques that you must be familiar with before you join a team. I’ve listed them in an order that you’d logically follow to contribute to a repository, as the importance of each step is paramount. Let’s now jump into the list.</p> \n<h2 id=\"1cloninggettingstartedinateam\">1. Cloning: Getting Started in a Team</h2> \n<p>If you’ve used Git for personal projects, you may only have initialized a project from scratch and added to it over time. When you’re working on an existing codebase, the first step is to clone the codebase into your local system. This enables you to work on your copy of the repository without any interference from other changes.</p> \n<p>To clone a repository, run the <code>git clone</code> command, followed by the path to the repository:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">git clone /path/to/repo\n</code></pre> \n<p>If your source doesn’t reside in the same system, you can SSH to a remote system and clone too:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">git clone username@remote_system_ip:/path/to/repo/on/remote\n</code></pre> \n<p>If you’re cloning from a source on the Internet, you can simply add the URL:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">git clone https://github.com/sdaityari/my_git_project.git\n</code></pre> \n<p>Whenever you’re cloning a repository, you’ve <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-The-Protocols\">the choice of multiple protocols</a> to connect to the source. In the GitHub example above, I’ve used the <code>https</code> protocol.</p> \n<h2 id=\"2managingremotesingit\">2. Managing Remotes in Git</h2> \n<p>Once you’ve cloned your repository, it still maintains a pointer to the source. This pointer is an example of a remote in Git. A remote is a pointer to another copy of the same repository. When you clone a repository, a pointer <code>origin</code> is automatically created which points to the source.</p> \n<p>You can check a list of remotes in a repository by running the following command:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">git remove -v\n</code></pre> \n<p>To add a remote, you can use the <code>git remote add</code> command:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">git remote add remote_name remote_address\n</code></pre> \n<p>You can remove a remote using the <code>git remote remove</code> command:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">git remote remove remote_name\n</code></pre> \n<p>If you’d like to change the address of a remote, you can use the <code>set-url</code> command:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">git remote set-url remote_name new_remote_address\n</code></pre> \n<h2 id=\"3branchingingit\">3. Branching in Git</h2> \n<p>The biggest advantage of Git over other version control systems is the power of its branches. Before I jump into the essentials of branching, you may be wondering <em>what a branch is</em>. A branch is a pointer to a commit in your repository, which in turn points to its predecessor. Therefore, a branch represents a list of commits in chronological order. When you create a branch, you effectively create only a new pointer to a commit. However, in essence, it represents a new, independent path of development.</p> \n<p>If you’ve been working on your own project, you may never have consciously used branches. By default, Git uses the <code>master</code> branch for development. Any new commits are added to this branch.</p> \n<p>Branching is necessary for Git to bifurcate lines of work in a project. At a single time, there may be many developers who are working on a variety of different problems. Ideally, these problems are worked on in different branches to ensure logical separation of new code until code review and merge.</p> \n<p>To check a list of branches and the current active branch, run the following command:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">git branch\n</code></pre> \n<p>To create a new branch, run the following command:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">git branch new_branch\n</code></pre> \n<p>Even though Git creates a new branch, notice that your active branch is still the old one. To start development in a new branch, run the following:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">git checkout new_branch\n</code></pre> \n<p>To create a new branch and change the active branch, run the following command:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">git checkout -b new_branch\n</code></pre> \n<p>To rename the current branch, run the following command:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">git branch -m new_renamed_branch\n</code></pre> \n<p>Use the <code>-D</code> option to remove a branch:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">git branch -D new_renamed_branch\n</code></pre> \n<p>Here’s a detailed guide on <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/git-branching/\">branching in Git</a>.</p> \n<h2 id=\"4updateyourlocalrepositorymerging\">4. Update your Local Repository: Merging</h2> \n<p>While we’ve checked the basics of branching in Git, the next logical step is to merge a branch into your base branch when you’ve finished working on a problem. To merge a branch, run the following command:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">git checkout base_branch\ngit merge new_branch\n</code></pre> \n<p>While it may sound like an easy process, merging is potentially the most time-consuming process in Git, as it can give rise to conflicts.</p> \n<h2 id=\"5handleconflicts\">5. Handle Conflicts</h2> \n<p>Imagine that you’re working on a file in a new branch. After you commit the changes, you request Git to merge your new branch with your base branch. However, the same part of the same file in the base branch has been updated since you created the new branch. How does Git decide which changes to keep and which changes to discard?</p> \n<p>Git always tries to not lose any data in the process of a merge. If the changes to the same file were done in different parts of the file, you could get away by keeping both sets of changes. However, if Git is unable to decide which changes to keep, it raises a conflict.</p> \n<p>When a conflict has been raised, running <code>git status</code> on your repository shows a list of files that were modified in both branches being merged. If you open any file with a conflict, you’d notice the following set of lines:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD\n...\n...\n========\n...\n...\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; new_branch\n</code></pre> \n<p>The part of the file between <code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD</code> and <code>========</code> contains that code which is present in the base branch. The lines of code between <code>========</code> and <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; new_branch</code> are present in the <code>new_branch</code> branch. The developer who’s merging the code has the responsibility to decide what part of the code (or a mix of both parts) should be included in the merge. Once edited, remove the three sets of lines shown, save the file, and commit the changes.</p> \n<p> Continue reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/git-techniques-to-know-before-you-join-a-team/?utm_source=rss\">10 Git Techniques You Need to Know Before You Join a Team</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=pWFYLfhHcjY:5UnbDbn2ylw:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=pWFYLfhHcjY:5UnbDbn2ylw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=pWFYLfhHcjY:5UnbDbn2ylw:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=pWFYLfhHcjY:5UnbDbn2ylw:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/pWFYLfhHcjY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 10 Mar 2020 23:00:42 +0000","feedId":6128,"bgimg":"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1583410943git-techniques.png","linkMd5":"e3ad45f01fe6ef18575fd69d80b7b3d9","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn53@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-26-042_719967dd0a4561db.webp","destWidth":600,"destHeight":339,"sourceBytes":7966,"destBytes":7966,"author":"Shaumik Daityari","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1583410943git-techniques.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn53@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-26-042_719967dd0a4561db.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn15@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-39-311_6409ebad5acff93a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn3@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-47-113_bf83e999bebef320.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=pWFYLfhHcjY:5UnbDbn2ylw:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn18@2020_4/2020/08/24/22-51-38-708_abc572af67a25446.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/pWFYLfhHcjY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn58@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-43-636_3621cc2633f3ba77.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598309483295},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","title":"Deno Module System: A Beginner&#8217;s Guide","link":"https://editor.sitepoint.com/?p=176806","description":"<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/deno-module-system-a-beginners-guide/?utm_source=rss\" title=\"Deno Module System: A Beginner’s Guide\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1596086356deno-modules.png\" alt=\"Deno Modules\" srcset=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1596086356deno-modules-300x158.png 300w, https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1596086356deno-modules-768x404.png 768w, https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1596086356deno-modules-1024x539.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /> </a> \n<p><strong>Learn about the Deno module system – the biggest workflow change you’ll encounter if you’re coming from Node.js.

Before discussing Deno, let me take you back to a simpler time…</p> \n<h2 id=\"nodejsmodules\">Node.js Modules</h2> \n<p>JavaScript didn’t have a standard module system in 2009. This was partly because of its browser heritage and ES6 / ES2015 was several years away.</p> \n<p>It would have been inconceivable for Node.js not to provide modules, so it adopted CommonJS from a choice of community workarounds. This led to the development of the Node Package Manager, or <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/\">npm</a>, which allowed developers to easily search, use, and publish their own JavaScript modules.</p> \n<p>npm usage grew exponentially. It’s become the most popular package manager ever devised and, by mid-2020, hosts almost 1.5 million modules with more than 800 new ones published every day (source: <a href=\"http://www.modulecounts.com/\">modulecounts.com</a>).</p> \n<h2 id=\"denomodules\">Deno Modules</h2> \n<p>Deno opts for <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/understanding-es6-modules/\">ES2015 Modules</a> which you <code>import</code> from an absolute or relative URL:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">import { something } from 'https://somewhere.com/somehow.js';\n</code></pre> \n<p>The script at that URL must <code>export</code> functions or other values accordingly, e.g.</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">export function something() {\n  console.log('something was executed');\n}\n</code></pre> \n<p>Deno uses an identical module system to that implemented in modern web browsers.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html\">Node.js also supports ES2015 modules</a> … but it’s complicated and remains experimental.

Our API-first, serverless platform offers a diverse range of features for enterprises who want to manage and optimize their AWS ecosystem.</strong></p> \n<p>With such a developer-focused foundation, we needed to provide customers with a performant, reactive web app, with an intuitive user-experience that didn’t hide the power and functionality of our API. Data access through our console also needed to be built to the same high standard of security and compliance as the rest of our product.</p> \n<p>This post will cover what we set out to achieve when building the Stax Console, our experience building a serverless GraphQL API to power it, and the lessons we learned along the way.</p> \n<h2 id=\"serverlessbydesign\">Serverless By Design</h2> \n<p>We wanted to produce a solution that was serverless from the start, to match the architecture we use for the rest of the product. One of the biggest benefits we’ve seen from going all in on <a href=\"https://www.stax.io/how-it-works/?utm_source=sitepoint&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=sp-serv-ext&amp;utm_content=how\" rel=\"sponsored\">serverless architectures</a> at Stax is uptime and reliability. Avoiding relying on a server that can become a single point of failure allows us to meet our Service-Level Agreement, and ensure customers can access the platform during peak load times. Using <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/\" rel=\"sponsored\">AWS Lambda</a> means queries from our front-end scale out horizontally and there’s always enough compute resources to process requests.</p> \n<p>Using serverless products also improves security during development, as services like AWS Lambda provide baked-in compliance and service levels out of the box. Allowing Amazon to handle upgrades and patching of the infrastructure that our code runs on allows us to focus on building software instead of managing hardware.</p> \n<p>The minimal infrastructure overhead when going serverless has allowed our team to fully own the deployment and monitoring of our GraphQL API. For example, developers can add new <a href=\"https://www.stax.io/networks/?utm_source=sitepoint&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=sp-serv-ext&amp;utm_content=net\" rel=\"sponsored\">Networks</a> functionality using separate Lambda functions to those used to fetch account data, minimizing the blast radius from pushing a new change to production.</p> \n<h2 id=\"earlydays\">Early Days</h2> \n<p>The first iteration of our Console had a fairly traditional web architecture. A React single-page application (SPA) called the Stax REST API directly, which is a serverless solution using <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/\" rel=\"sponsored\">AWS API Gateway</a> and AWS Lambda in front of a relational database. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/\" rel=\"sponsored\">AWS Cognito</a> handles user authentication and sign-on for both the Console and REST API.</p> \n<p>We ran into a few technical issues with this approach:</p> \n<ol> \n <li><strong>Tooling</strong>. Modern front-end frameworks evolve quickly. Consuming data from REST APIs with React was complex and it was difficult to manage state.</li> \n <li><strong>Stability</strong>. The tight coupling of our front-end SPA to back-end REST API was efficient, but the contract between systems was constantly changing as features developed which risked breaking our user interface.</li> \n <li><strong>Real-Time Updates</strong>. We would need to build our own WebSocket implementation to push data to our front-end SPA to provide real-time updates. This would have been complex to implement in both the front end and back end. </li> \n</ol> \n<p>It also became apparent that as Stax grew as a product, the Console needed to integrate with other back-end services than our REST API, such as Cost and Compliance data for accounts and our Customer Support Case service. Interfacing with multiple APIs and protocols, all with differing authentication mechanisms, led us to consider a <a href=\"https://samnewman.io/patterns/architectural/bff/\" rel=\"sponsored\">Back End for Front End</a> pattern with a single GraphQL API.</p> \n<h2 id=\"ourconsolearchitecturenow\">Our Console Architecture Now</h2> \n<p>The architecture centers on a <a href=\"https://graphql.org/\" rel=\"sponsored\">GraphQL</a> API layer that acts as a proxy between our front-end and back-end services. GraphQL is a query language for APIs; it allows developers to define the types of data in a system (the schema), and wire up functions to fetch data from different sources (resolvers). Relationships between data can be expanded in a single GraphQL query. For example, a single request can resolve a <a href=\"https://www.stax.io/workloads/?utm_source=sitepoint&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=sp-serv-ext&amp;utm_content=work\" rel=\"sponsored\">Stax Workload</a> and the user that deployed it in one go.</p> \n<p>A key reason GraphQL suited our needs is that data can be fetched from any source by a resolver and be presented to a front end as a single interface. This means that as Stax grows, we can refactor and optimize back-end services with minimal impact to our front-end developers and customers. Authentication is also massively simplified. The front-end authenticates to our GraphQL API in one place, which handles connections to various REST and GraphQL APIs and event sources behind the scenes.</p> \n<p>At Stax, we’re closely partnered with AWS, and try to use native AWS solutions where possible as part of our development philosophy. We opted to use <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/index.html\" rel=\"sponsored\">AWS AppSync</a>, a fully managed serverless GraphQL implementation as the core of our service.</p> \n<p>AWS AppSync implements the main GraphQL directives, including GraphQL Subscriptions that manage WebSocket connections between clients and your GraphQL API. AWS Lambda fetches and transforms data in GraphQL resolver functions, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/\" rel=\"sponsored\">AWS DynamoDB</a> is used for serverless data stores, and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/\" rel=\"sponsored\">AWS EventBridge</a> triggers Lambda functions in response to system events.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1596594179stax-console-graphql-layer-1024x675.png\" alt=\"Our current Stax Console architecture makes use of GraphQL, AWS AppSync, AWS Dynamo and AWS EventBridge\" width=\"1024\" height=\"675\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-176932\" /></p> \n<p> Continue reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/how-we-built-a-serverless-web-app-for-the-stax-console/?utm_source=rss\">How We Built a Serverless Web App for the Stax Console</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=VPLn6N0LhYc:1IMOj1VtcSI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=VPLn6N0LhYc:1IMOj1VtcSI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=VPLn6N0LhYc:1IMOj1VtcSI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=VPLn6N0LhYc:1IMOj1VtcSI:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/VPLn6N0LhYc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 04 Aug 2020 20:10:20 +0000","feedId":6128,"bgimg":"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1596594340Stax-Serverless-Web-App.png","linkMd5":"006d50c34dca580ab1eddb69a37a0211","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn14@2020_3/2020/08/24/22-51-24-753_dcfe0513daff1b00.webp","destWidth":998,"destHeight":743,"sourceBytes":10560,"destBytes":10560,"author":"Adam Quigley","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1596594340Stax-Serverless-Web-App.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn14@2020_3/2020/08/24/22-51-24-753_dcfe0513daff1b00.webp","https://editor.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1596594179stax-console-graphql-layer-1024x675.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn30@2020_3/2020/08/24/22-51-35-719_46170056cf1f22ef.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn15@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-39-311_6409ebad5acff93a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn3@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-47-113_bf83e999bebef320.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=VPLn6N0LhYc:1IMOj1VtcSI:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn53@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-35-308_04b725b4325cefcb.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/VPLn6N0LhYc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn31@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-51-41-100_49e754aec55d03b6.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598309483249},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","title":"Build a Native Desktop GIF Searcher App Using NodeGui","link":"https://www.sitepoint.com/?p=174965","description":"<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/build-native-desktop-gif-searcher-app-using-nodegui/?utm_source=rss\" title=\"Build a Native Desktop GIF Searcher App Using NodeGui\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/1581383719nodegui.png\" alt=\"Build a Native Desktop GIF Searcher App Using NodeGui\" srcset=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/1581383719nodegui-300x170.png 300w, https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/1581383719nodegui.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /> </a> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://docs.nodegui.org/\">NodeGui</a> is an open-source library for building cross-platform, native desktop apps with Node.js. NodeGui apps can run on macOS, Windows, and Linux. The apps built with NodeGui are written using JavaScript, styled with CSS and rendered as native desktop widgets using the <a href=\"https://doc.qt.io/\">Qt framework</a>.</strong></p> \n<p>Some of the features of NodeGui are:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>native widgets with built-in support for dark mode</li> \n <li>low CPU and memory footprint</li> \n <li>styling with CSS including complete support for Flexbox layout</li> \n <li>complete Node.js API support and access to all Node.js compatible npm modules</li> \n <li>excellent debugging support using Chrome’s DevTools</li> \n <li>first-class TypeScript support</li> \n</ul> \n<p>NodeGui is powered by the Qt framework, which makes it CPU and memory efficient compared with other Chromium-based solutions such as Electron. This means that applications written using NodeGui <em>do not</em> open up a browser instance and render the UI in it. Instead, all the widgets are rendered natively.</p> \n<p>This tutorial will demonstrate how to install NodeGui and use it to build a meme searcher that lives in the system tray and communicates with the <a href=\"https://developers.giphy.com/\">GIPHY API</a>.</p> \n<p>The full source code for this tutorial is <a href=\"https://github.com/sitepoint-editors/memesearchapp-nodegui-tutorial\">available on GitHub</a>.</p> \n<h2 id=\"installationandbasicsetup\">Installation and Basic Setup</h2> \n<p>For this tutorial it’s assumed that you have <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/download/\">Node.js v12</a> or greater installed. You can confirm that both Node and npm are available by running:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\"># This command should print the version of Node.js\nnode -v\n\n# This command should print the version of npm\nnpm -v\n</code></pre> \n<p>If you need help with this step, check out our <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/quick-tip-multiple-versions-node-nvm/\">tutorial on installing Node</a>.</p> \n<h2 id=\"installcmakeandcompilationtools\">Install CMake and Compilation Tools</h2> \n<p>NodeGui requires CMake and C++ compilation tools for building the native C++ layer of the project. Make sure you install CMake &gt;= 3.1 along with a C++ compiler that supports C++11 and up. The detailed instructions are a bit different depending on your operating system.</p> \n<h3 id=\"macos\">macOS</h3> \n<p>It’s recommended to install CMake using Homebrew. Run the following commands in a terminal after installing Homebrew:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">brew install cmake\nbrew install make\n</code></pre> \n<p>You can confirm the installation by running:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\"># This command should print the version of CMake which should be higher than 3.1\ncmake --version\n\nmake --version\n</code></pre> \n<p>Lastly, you need GCC/Clang to compile C++ code. Verify that you have GCC installed using this command:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">gcc --version\n</code></pre> \n<p>If you don’t have GCC installed, make sure you install <em>Command Line Tools for Xcode</em> or <em>XCode Developer tools</em> from <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/download/more/\">Apple’s developer page</a>.</p> \n<h3 id=\"windows\">Windows</h3> \n<p>You can install CMake on Windows by downloading the latest release from the <a href=\"https://cmake.org/download/\">CMake download page</a>.</p> \n<p>It’s strongly recommend you use Powershell as the preferred terminal in Windows.</p> \n<p>You can confirm the CMake installation by running:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\"># This command should print the version of CMake which should be higher than 3.1\ncmake --version\n</code></pre> \n<p>Lastly, you need a C++ compiler. One possibility would be to <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio?view=vs-2017\">install Visual Studio 2017 or higher</a>. It’s recommended you choose the <strong>Desktop development with C++</strong> workload during the installation process.</p> \n<h3 id=\"linux\">Linux</h3> \n<p>We’ll focus on Ubuntu 18.04 for the purposes of this tutorial. It’s recommended to install CMake using the package manager. Run the following commands in a terminal:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">sudo apt-get install pkg-config build-essential\nsudo apt-get install cmake make\n</code></pre> \n<p>You can confirm the installation by running:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\"># This command should print the version of CMake which should be higher than 3.1\ncmake --version\n\nmake --version\n</code></pre> \n<p>Lastly, you need GCC to compile C++ code. Verify that you have GCC installed using the command:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\"># gcc version should be &gt;= v7\ngcc --version\n</code></pre> \n<h2 id=\"helloworld\">Hello World</h2> \n<p>In order to get started with our NodeGui meme app, we’ll clone the starter project.</p> \n<p><em>Note: Running this requires Git and npm.</em></p> \n<p>Open a terminal and run:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">git clone https://github.com/nodegui/nodegui-starter memeapp\ncd memeapp\nnpm install\nnpm start\n</code></pre> \n<p>If everything goes well, you should see a working hello world NodeGui app on the screen.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/158038460101-hello-world.png\" alt=\"Hello World NodeGui example\" /></p> \n<p>By default, the <a href=\"https://github.com/nodegui/nodegui-starter\">nodegui-starter project</a> is a TypeScript project. However, in this tutorial we’ll be writing our application in JavaScript. In order to convert our starter to a JS project, we’ll make the following minor changes:</p> \n<ol> \n <li> <p>Delete the <code>index.ts</code> file in the <code>src</code> folder.</p> </li> \n <li> <p>Create a new file <code>index.js</code> in the <code>src</code> directory with the following contents:</p> <p><strong>src/index.js</strong></p> <pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">const { QMainWindow, QLabel } = require('@nodegui/nodegui');\n\nconst win = new QMainWindow();\nwin.setWindowTitle('Meme Search');\n\nconst label = new QLabel();\nlabel.setText('Hello World');\n\nwin.setCentralWidget(label);\nwin.show();\n\nglobal.win = win;\n</code></pre> </li> \n</ol> \n<p>As far as development is concerned, a NodeGui application is essentially a Node.js application. All APIs and features found in NodeGui are accessible through the <code>@nodegui/nodegui</code> module, which can be required like any other Node.js module. Additionally, you have access to all Node.js APIs and Node modules. NodeGui uses native components instead of web-based components as building blocks.</p> \n<p>In the above example, we’ve imported <a href=\"https://docs.nodegui.org/docs/api/generated/classes/qmainwindow/\">QMainWindow</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.nodegui.org/docs/api/generated/classes/qlabel\">QLabel</a> to create a native window that displays the text “Hello World”.</p> \n<p>Now run the app again:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npm start\n</code></pre> \n<p><img src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/158038460202-js-hello-world.png\" alt=\"Hello World JavaScript version\" /></p> \n<p>Now that we have our basic setup ready, let’s start building our meme searcher 🥳.</p> \n<p><em>Note: If something doesn’t work while following this tutorial, check your <code>package.json</code> file to ensure that the starter project has pulled in the most up-to-date version of NodeGui.</em></p> \n<h2 id=\"displayingananimatedgif\">Displaying an Animated GIF</h2> \n<p>Since memes are generally animated GIFs, we’ll start by creating a basic window that displays a GIF image from a URL.</p> \n<p>To do this, we’ll make use of <a href=\"https://docs.nodegui.org/docs/api/generated/classes/qmovie\">QMovie</a> along with QLabel. QMovie is not a widget but a container that can play simple animations. We’ll use it in combination with QLabel.</p> \n<p>An example usage of QMovie looks like this:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">const movie = new QMovie();\nmovie.setFileName('/absolute/path/to/animated.gif');\nmovie.start();\n\nconst animatedLabel = new QLabel();\nanimatedLabel.setMovie(movie);\n</code></pre> \n<p>Since, we want to load an image from a URL, we can’t use <code>QMovie</code>‘s <a href=\"https://docs.nodegui.org/docs/api/generated/classes/qmovie#setfilename\">setFileName</a> method, which is reserved only for local files. Instead, we’ll download the GIF image using <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios\">axios</a> as a buffer and use the QMovie method <a href=\"https://docs.nodegui.org/docs/api/generated/classes/qmovie#loadfromdata\">loadFromData</a> instead.</p> \n<p>So let’s start with the axios installation:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npm i axios\n</code></pre> \n<p>Now let’s create a function that will take a URL as a parameter and will return a configured <code>QMovie</code> instance for the GIF:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">async function getMovie(url) {\n  const { data } = await axios.get(url, { responseType: 'arraybuffer' });\n  const movie = new QMovie();\n  movie.loadFromData(data);\n  movie.start();\n  return movie;\n}\n</code></pre> \n<p>The <code>getMovie</code> function takes in a URL, tells axios to download the GIF as a buffer, and then uses that buffer to create a <code>QMovie</code> instance.</p> \n<p>You can think of <code>QMovie</code> as a class that handles the inner logic of playing the GIF animation frame by frame. <code>QMovie</code> is not a widget, so it can’t be shown on the screen as it is. Instead, we’ll use a regular <code>QLabel</code> instance and set <code>QMovie</code> to it.</p> \n<p>Since <code>getMovie</code> returns a promise, we need to make some changes to the code. After some minor refactoring, we end up with the following.</p> \n<p><strong>src/index.js</strong></p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">const { QMainWindow, QMovie, QLabel } = require('@nodegui/nodegui');\nconst axios = require('axios').default;\n\nasync function getMovie(url) {\n  const { data } = await axios.get(url, { responseType: 'arraybuffer' });\n  const movie = new QMovie();\n  movie.loadFromData(data);\n  movie.start();\n  return movie;\n}\n\nconst main = async () =&gt; {\n  const win = new QMainWindow();\n  win.setWindowTitle('Meme Search');\n\n  const label = new QLabel();\n  const gifMovie = await getMovie(\n    'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e3/Animhorse.gif'\n  );\n  label.setMovie(gifMovie);\n\n  win.setCentralWidget(label);\n  win.show();\n  global.win = win;\n};\n\nmain().catch(console.error);\n</code></pre> \n<p>The <code>main</code> function is our entry point. Here we create a window and a label. We then instantiate a <code>QMovie</code> instance with the help of our <code>getMovie</code> function, and finally set the <code>QMovie</code> to a <code>QLabel</code>.</p> \n<p>Run the app with <code>npm start</code> and you should see something like this:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/158038460503-animation.gif\" alt=\"Basic animation example showing a galloping horse\" /></p> \n<h2 id=\"fetchinggifsfromthegiphyapi\">Fetching GIFs from the GIPHY API</h2> \n<p>Giphy.com has a public API which anyone can use to build great apps that use animated GIFs. In order to use the GIPHY API, you should register at <a href=\"https://developers.giphy.com\">developers.giphy.com</a> and obtain an API key. You can find <a href=\"https://support.giphy.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020283431-Request-A-GIPHY-API-Key\">further instructions here</a>.</p> \n<p>We’ll be using the <a href=\"https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api/endpoint/#search\">search endpoint</a> feature for implementing our meme search.</p> \n<p>Let’s start by writing a <code>searchGifs</code> function that will take a <code>searchTerms</code> parameter as input and request GIFs using the above endpoint:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">const GIPHY_API_KEY = 'Your API key here';\n\nasync function searchGifs(searchTerm) {\n  const url = 'https://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/search';\n  const res = await axios.get(url, {\n    params: {\n      api_key: GIPHY_API_KEY,\n      limit: 25,\n      q: searchTerm,\n      lang: 'en',\n      offset: 0,\n      rating: 'pg-13'\n    }\n  });\n  return res.data.data;\n}\n</code></pre> \n<p>The result of the function after execution will look something like this:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">[\n  {\n    \"type\": \"gif\",\n    \"id\": \"dzaUX7CAG0Ihi\",\n    \"url\": \"https://giphy.com/gifs/hello-hi-dzaUX7CAG0Ihi\",\n    \"images\": {\n      \"fixed_width_small\": {\n        \"height\": \"54\",\n        \"size\": \"53544\",\n        \"url\": \"https://media3.giphy.com/media/dzaUX7CAG0Ihi/100w.gif?cid=725ec7e0c00032f700929ce9f09f3f5fe5356af8c874ab12&amp;rid=100w.gif\",\n        \"width\": \"100\"\n      },\n      \"downsized_large\": {\n        \"height\": \"220\",\n        \"size\": \"807719\",\n        \"url\": \"https://media3.giphy.com/media/dzaUX7CAG0Ihi/giphy.gif?cid=725ec7e0c00032f700929ce9f09f3f5fe5356af8c874ab12&amp;rid=giphy.gif\",\n        \"width\": \"410\"\n      },\n      ...\n    },\n    \"slug\": \"hello-hi-dzaUX7CAG0Ihi\",\n    ...\n    \"import_datetime\": \"2016-01-07 15:40:35\",\n    \"trending_datetime\": \"1970-01-01 00:00:00\"\n  },\n  {\n    type: \"gif\",\n    ...\n  },\n  ...\n]\n</code></pre> \n<p>The result is essentially an array of objects that contain information about each GIF. We’re particularly interested in <code>returnValue[i].images.fixed_width_small.url</code> for each image, which contains the URL to the GIF.</p> \n<h2 id=\"showingalistofgifsusingtheapisresponse\">Showing a List of GIFs Using the API’s Response</h2> \n<p>In order to show a list of GIFs, we’ll create a <code>getGifViews</code> function that will:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>create a <a href=\"https://docs.nodegui.org/docs/api/generated/classes/qwidget\">QWidget</a> container</li> \n <li>create a <code>QMovie</code> widget for each GIF</li> \n <li>create a <code>QLabel</code> from each <code>QMovie</code> instance</li> \n <li>attach each <code>QLabel</code> as a child of the <code>QWidget</code> container</li> \n <li>return the <code>QWidget</code> container</li> \n</ol> \n<p>The code looks like this:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">async function getGifViews(listOfGifs) {\n  const container = new QWidget();\n  container.setLayout(new FlexLayout());\n\n  const promises = listOfGifs.map(async gif =&gt; {\n    const { url, width } = gif.images.fixed_width_small;\n    const movie = await getMovie(url);\n    const gifView = new QLabel();\n    gifView.setMovie(movie);\n    gifView.setInlineStyle(`width: ${width}`);\n    container.layout.addWidget(gifView);\n  });\n\n  await Promise.all(promises);\n\n  container.setInlineStyle(`\n      flex-direction: 'row';\n      flex-wrap: 'wrap';\n      justify-content: 'space-around';\n      width: 330px;\n      height: 300px;\n  `);\n\n  return container;\n}\n</code></pre> \n<p>Let’s break this down a bit.</p> \n<p>First, we create our container widget. <code>QWidget</code>s are essentially empty widgets that act as containers. They’re similar to <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements in the web world.</p> \n<p>Next, in order to assign child widgets to the <code>QWidget</code>, we need to give it a layout. A <strong>layout</strong> dictates how the child widgets should be arranged inside a parent. Here we choose <a href=\"https://docs.nodegui.org/docs/api/generated/classes/flexlayout\">FlexLayout</a>.</p> \n<p>Then, we use our <code>getMovie</code> function to create a <code>QMovie</code> instance for each GIF URL. We assign the <code>QMovie</code> instance to a <code>QLabel</code> (named <code>gifView</code>) and give it some basic styling using the <code>setInlineStyle</code> method. Finally, we add the <code>QLabel</code> widget to the container’s layout using the <code>layout.addWidget</code> method.</p> \n<p>Since this is all happening asynchronously, we wait for everything to resolve using <code>Promise.all</code>, before setting some container styles and returning the container widget.</p> \n<p> Continue reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/build-native-desktop-gif-searcher-app-using-nodegui/?utm_source=rss\">Build a Native Desktop GIF Searcher App Using NodeGui</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=z5djjDkCWV4:NqLSoIO_MqA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=z5djjDkCWV4:NqLSoIO_MqA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=z5djjDkCWV4:NqLSoIO_MqA:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=z5djjDkCWV4:NqLSoIO_MqA:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/z5djjDkCWV4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 09 Mar 2020 14:49:31 +0000","feedId":6128,"bgimg":"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/1581383719nodegui.png","linkMd5":"ab80d84012af1071dd45f961b13fedc5","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn58@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-25-903_4ac613dcceed640a.webp","destWidth":600,"destHeight":339,"sourceBytes":12984,"destBytes":12984,"author":"Atul Ramachandran","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/1581383719nodegui.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn58@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-25-903_4ac613dcceed640a.webp","https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/158038460101-hello-world.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn33@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-43-348_42c92310c9537316.webp","https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/158038460202-js-hello-world.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn12@2020_6/2020/08/24/22-51-36-211_99149a033b73c661.webp","https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/158038460503-animation.gif":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn37@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-38-110_e912b8ed86f787ea.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn15@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-39-311_6409ebad5acff93a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn3@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-47-113_bf83e999bebef320.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=z5djjDkCWV4:NqLSoIO_MqA:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn77@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-37-531_31ba78b4b6634a15.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/z5djjDkCWV4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn72@2020_4/2020/08/24/22-51-39-652_4a6a6ffca93e759a.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598309483297},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","title":"How to Build Your First Discord Bot with Node.js","link":"https://www.sitepoint.com/?p=173997","description":"<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/discord-bot-node-js/?utm_source=rss\" title=\"How to Build Your First Discord Bot with Node.js\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/157247449972-Developing-Robot.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/157247449972-Developing-Robot-300x200.png 300w, https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/157247449972-Developing-Robot-768x512.png 768w, https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/157247449972-Developing-Robot-1024x683.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /> </a> \n<p><strong>Nowadays, bots are being used for automating various tasks. Since the release of Amazon’s Alexa devices, the hype surrounding automation bots has only started to grow. Besides Alexa, other communication tools like Discord and Telegram offer APIs to develop custom bots.</strong></p> \n<p>This article will solely focus on creating your first bot with the exposed Discord API. Maybe the most well-known Discord bot is the Music Bot. The music bot lets you type a song name and the bot will attach a new user to your channel who plays the requested song. It’s a commonly used bot among younger people on gaming or streaming servers.</p> \n<p>Let’s get started with creating a custom Discord bot.</p> \n<p><em>By the way, you can join <a href=\"https://discord.gg/PyAM7tv\">SitePoint’s Discord community with this link</a>. Come talk tech with us and get notified about our new articles.</em></p> \n<h2 id=\"prerequisites\">Prerequisites</h2> \n<ul> \n <li>Node.js v10 or higher installed (basic knowledge)</li> \n <li>a Discord account and Discord client</li> \n <li>basic knowledge of using a terminal</li> \n</ul> \n<h2 id=\"step1setuptestserver\">Step 1: Set Up Test Server</h2> \n<p>First of all, we need a test server on which we can later test our Discord bot. We can create a new server by clicking the plus icon on the left of the screen.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/157231152901-create-server.png\" alt=\"click create server\" width=\"1020\" height=\"510\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-173999\" /></p> \n<p>A pop-up will be displayed that asks you if you want to join a server or create a new one. Of course, we want to create a new server.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/157231157302-select-create-1024x823.png\" alt=\"select create server\" width=\"1024\" height=\"823\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-174000\" /></p> \n<p>Next, we need to input the name for our server. To keep things simple, I’ve named the server <code>discord_playground</code>. If you want, you can change the server location depending on where you’re located to get a better ping.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/157231237203-server-name-1024x823.png\" alt=\"server name\" width=\"1024\" height=\"823\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-174003\" /></p> \n<p>If everything went well, you should see your newly created server.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/157231241104-new-server-1024x494.png\" alt=\"new server\" width=\"1024\" height=\"494\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-174004\" /></p> \n<h2 id=\"step2generatingauthtoken\">Step 2: Generating Auth Token</h2> \n<p>When we want to control our bot via code, we need to register the bot first under our Discord account.</p> \n<p>To register the bot, go to the <a href=\"https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/\">Discord Developers Portal</a> and log in with your account.</p> \n<p>After logging in, you should be able to see the dashboard. Let’s create a new application by clicking the <em>New Application</em> button.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/157231247905-dev-dashboard-1024x420.png\" alt=\"developer dashboard\" width=\"1024\" height=\"420\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-174005\" /></p> \n<p>Next, you’ll see a pop-up that asks you to input a name for your application. Let’s call our bot <code>my-greeter-bot</code>. By clicking the <em>Create</em> button, Discord will create an API application.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/157231253706-create-app.png\" alt=\"create application\" width=\"956\" height=\"818\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-174006\" /></p> \n<p>When the application has been created, you’ll see the overview of the newly created <code>my-greeter-bot</code> application. You’ll see information like a client ID and client secret. This secret will be used later as the authorization token.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/157231283207-overview-greeter-1024x645.png\" alt=\"overview greeter bot\" width=\"1024\" height=\"645\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-174007\" /></p> \n<p>Now, click on the <em>Bot</em> menu option in the <em>Settings</em> menu. Discord will build our <code>my-greeter-bot</code> application and add a bot user to it.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/157231287808-add-bot-1024x284.png\" alt=\"add bot\" width=\"1024\" height=\"284\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-174009\" /></p> \n<p>When the bot has been built, you get an overview of your custom bot. Take a look at the <em>Token</em> section. Copy this authorization token and write it down somewhere, as we’ll need it later to connect to our bot user.</p> \n<p><img

(in)famous trends of the last decade.</strong></p> \n<p>In this article, I’ll talk about what a personal brand is and how building one can help boost your career. I’ll show you how to stake your claim in the online space as well as three paths you can follow to level up your brand. That’s plenty to talk about, so let’s get this started.</p> \n<h2 id=\"theargumentforapersonalbrandasadeveloper\">The argument for a personal brand as a developer</h2> \n<p>Our first stop is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_branding\">Wikipedia</a>, where we can find the following definition:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>Personal branding is the practice of marketing people and their careers as brands. It is an ongoing process of developing and maintaining a reputation and impression of an individual, group, or organization.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>That’s the part most of people have in mind when they think about personal branding. They think about the current diva of the day. About famous media celebrities. About publicity stunts that are meant to push you into the limelight. About presenting a fake facade in order to obtain undeserved rewards. And many other less-than-pleasant examples.</p> \n<p>However, there’s another aspect to personal branding — the other side of the coin, so to speak. Right after the definition above, the Wikipedia article has the following phrase:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>In <em>Be Your Own Brand</em>, first published in 1999, marketers David McNally and Karl Speak wrote: “Your brand is a perception or emotion, maintained by somebody other than you, that describes the total experience of having a relationship with you.”</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>In other words, your personal brand includes what other people say about you when you’re not there. It includes your reputation, your body of work, the testimonials other people give about you. Nowadays it includes your tweets and your posts on Facebook. To many people, your pictures on Instagram matter just as much (if not more) as your contributions to open-source software. Want to travel in the USA? Be prepared to let them know all your social media accounts for the last five years. (Sources: <a href=\"https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2019/06/04/us-visa-applicants-required-to-hand-over-social-media-info/\">Sophos</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48486672\">BBC</a>). And the examples can continue.</p> \n<p>Everything you say and do affects your public image and your reputation. And that can have devastating impact on your career. Remember the Aria Richards case back in 2013? She was a developer taking part in a conference where she published a tweet about some male developers making sexual jokes behind her, including their picture. In the fallout, one of the guys was fired, but Aria lost her job as well, because her action was deemed to be damaging to the reputation of the company employing her. (Sources: <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/03/how-dongle-jokes-got-two-people-fired-and-led-to-ddos-attacks/\">ArsTechnica</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/techie-adria-richards-fired-after-tweeting-about-mens-comments/\">CBSNews</a>).</p> \n<p>Fortunately, it’s not just about mitigating possible damage. A great personal brand can increase your leverage at a level you wouldn’t dream about it. It can put you in a better light when applying to a new job, and you’ll have better negotiating power when discussing the salary and the perks of the position. If you have your own business, it can bring you more and better clients and projects. What’s not to like about it?</p> \n<p>But there’s one caveat in all this: be authentic. Don’t do it to project something you aren’t, or as a money-grabbing move or, worse, to cover negative aspects. That’s the main reason people react badly when hearing about personal branding.</p> \n<p>This subject alone (the pros and cons of personal branding) can fill a whole book and goes beyond the scope of this article. So, stop letting others write your story and take control of your narrative. All this being said, let’s push forward.</p> \n<h2 id=\"stakeyourclaimandestablishyourpresence\">Stake your claim and establish your presence</h2> \n<p>The first phase in building your personal brand is staking your claim in the online space and laying down the foundations for further expansion. It is, in my opinion, the most important part of the process. If you do nothing else from the other things we’ll talk about later, but you work on this part, I’m confident you’ll get a lot further than many other people.</p> \n<p>We’re currently living in the age of social media, so you might be surprised to hear that this foundation is actually your own website. Yes, a website. The old-fashioned kind, where you buy a domain name, arrange hosting and upload the files on the server for everyone else on the Internet to find.</p> \n<p>“That’s the dumbest idea I’ve heard,” you might say. “I don’t need a website. I have my CV on LinkedIn, my pictures on Facebook and Instagram, my articles on Medium, my code on GitHub and I keep in touch with everyone on Twitter. Why would I waste time and effort with a website that I have to promote as well?”</p> \n<p>From a certain point of view, all that sounds quite reasonable. But all those options have one thing in common: they’re all third-party platforms, and you’re actually renting the right to use them. You might not pay with money, but they are gathering data about you and your habits that’s either used to target ads your way or it’s passed to third parties for the same reasons. Remember, if you’re not paying for something, then you are the product being sold.</p> \n<p>It all comes down to a simple truth: you can’t build your home on rented land. You can lose access to social media at any moment. All these platforms have somewhere in their terms and conditions a clause that allows them to terminate their service to you at any time without having to provide an explanation. Or your account could get hacked or deleted. Your tens or hundreds of thousands of followers? All gone in a blink of an eye if you lose access to the platform.</p> \n<p>That’s why you need something you own completely — a place to present yourself without being beholden to a platform that only cares about their own interests. You need a way to gather contacts, followers, connections and clients and be able to keep them. Yes, websites and servers do get hacked. But in that case, all you need to do is install the latest backup and you’re up and running again.</p> \n<p>Let’s get down to the trinity of items needed to establish your online presence:</p> \n<ol> \n <li><strong>A domain name</strong></li> \n</ol> \n<p>You need your own custom domain name for multiple reasons. It gives you more legitimacy and it opens the gates for further options down the road. <code>www.johnnydev.com</code> is a lot better than <code>johnnydev2335.github.io</code>, don’t you think? We can have a very long discussion over whether it’s better to choose a “brand name” or your own given name for the domain. However, that’s a conversation for another time and place.</p> \n<ol start=\"2\"> \n <li><strong>Hosting</strong></li> \n</ol> \n<p>There are plenty options of free hosting for developers: GitHub Pages, Netlify and many more. In many cases, that’s all you need to have a website up and running. For some of the more advanced options, though, it’s better to get some classic dedicated hosting.</p> \n<ol start=\"3\"> \n <li><strong>Custom email address</strong></li> \n</ol> \n<p>This is the same story as with the domain name above. I think we can agree that <code>johnny@johnnydev.com</code> is more professional than <code>johnnydev2335@gmail.com</code> or some other email address you created when you were 16 years old.</p> \n<p>Now all you have to do is upload your site and let everyone know about it. You can go from something as simple as a single static page to something complex like a WordPress blog or a static site generator like Gatsby or Hugo. Don’t despair if design isn’t your strong point. There are plenty of free themes and templates available.</p> \n<p>Remember, you don’t have to code the website yourself. You get extra brownie points and bragging rights for writing as much code as possible yourself, but that’s not a requirement. If time’s at a premium for you, just grab a free template or theme and get started. Be sure to check the code for any hidden, unpleasant surprises, though, or use trusted sources, like curated collections and communities. All major players, like WordPress, Gatsby or Hugo, come with curated themes that you can choose from.</p> \n<h3 id=\"onceyouhaveawebsite\">Once you have a website</h3> \n<p>Congratulations! You just became the proud owner of your own piece of online real estate. You how have a place where you can link all your social media profiles, upload your CV, write some blog posts or even articles. If you want to take it even further and remove further your dependency on other platforms, you can start your own email list. But that’s a topic for another time. For now, we’ll focus on three paths you can take to further increase your influence, your reputation and, ultimately, your personal brand. These are paths that other developers have taken before, and they got a lot of benefits out of that choice. They’re also not mutually exclusive. You can mix and match until you get the combination that works best for you.</p> \n<p> Continue reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/personal-brand-boost-developer-career/?utm_source=rss\">How to Boost Your Developer Career with a Personal Brand</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=1e1168l59rE:8ho_UKl_IHs:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=1e1168l59rE:8ho_UKl_IHs:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=1e1168l59rE:8ho_UKl_IHs:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=1e1168l59rE:8ho_UKl_IHs:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/1e1168l59rE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 21 Apr 2020 00:00:54 +0000","feedId":6128,"bgimg":"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1586397781personal-branding.png","linkMd5":"19c195ddcc906591e1da5588c479cca1","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn77@2020_6/2020/08/24/22-51-25-800_e3d7c011d617a414.webp","destWidth":600,"destHeight":340,"sourceBytes":11542,"destBytes":11542,"author":"Adrian Sandu","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1586397781personal-branding.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn77@2020_6/2020/08/24/22-51-25-800_e3d7c011d617a414.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn15@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-39-311_6409ebad5acff93a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn3@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-47-113_bf83e999bebef320.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=1e1168l59rE:8ho_UKl_IHs:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn94@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-51-44-835_ee1d9e183b4c05a0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/1e1168l59rE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn8@2020_6/2020/08/24/22-51-43-090_defb040a5b473787.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598309483279},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","title":"8 Top WordPress Multipurpose Themes and Their Cool Features","link":"https://editor.sitepoint.com/?p=176126","description":"<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/top-wordpress-multipurpose-themes/?utm_source=rss\" title=\"8 Top WordPress Multipurpose Themes and Their Cool Features\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1588813942multipurpose-themes.png\" alt=\"null\" srcset=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1588813942multipurpose-themes-300x170.png 300w, https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1588813942multipurpose-themes.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /> </a> \n<p><em>This sponsored article was created by our content partner, <a href=\"https://bawmedia.com\" rel=\"sponsored\">BAW Media</a>.

Thank you for supporting the partners who make SitePoint possible.</em></p> \n<p>Businesses across just about every industry are learning to prioritize collecting data along the customer journey. And to an increasing degree, data reporting and interactive visualizations are a big component of the value that apps have to offer users, whether these users are within your organization, external stakeholders or mass market end users.</p> \n<p>It doesn’t matter if your product is an executive dashboard that surfaces supply chain efficiency issues, a “quantifiable self” app that tracks biometrics for gamified fitness achievement or a business app that helps users keep track of project objectives – data storytelling is playing a bigger role in the interfaces of all digital products.</p> \n<p>At the same time, app churn continues to haunt product teams, as the marketplace gets more and more saturated with apps that have overlapping use cases and functionalities – all the more reason to make quantifiable accomplishment a core component to your app’s interface. There’s arguably no better way to ensure app loyalty than to give users the sense that it’s a key component in their ongoing triumphs.</p> \n<p>With this in mind, it’s easy to see why pretty much every mobile and web app today needs some sort of built-in analytics capabilities. Mobile app analytics can help you increase your product’s stickiness and <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/5-simple-ux-principles-guide-product-design/\">deliver better user experiences</a>. In turn, you’re able to create a high-value app for users that’s likely to be used more frequently.</p> \n<p>So, the question isn’t whether or not you should add analytics capabilities to your app. It’s whether you should build your own or use a third-party solution?</p> \n<p>The short answer is that it depends on a number of factors.</p> \n<p>If you choose to build these analytics capabilities on your own, you’ll have more control over the app’s functionality and branding. In addition, you’ll be able to ensure that it functions exactly how you want it to, even if you need to set aside a budget for ongoing development and compatibility updates.</p> \n<p>On the flip side, buying a third-party embedded analytics solution often makes for a far much less expensive option overall <em>and</em> you’ll be able to deploy the analytics capabilities in your app faster. Plus, you’ll get access to high-quality source components right off the bat, because you’ll be building on the experience of industry experts as opposed to an internal team that’s building out the capabilities from scratch on an as-needed basis.</p> \n<p>In this article, we’ll dig deeper into the build versus buy dilemma of adding analytics capabilities to apps and explain why it’s better to use embedded analytics than build your own app components.

With the new GitHub CLI tool, you can execute many of these actions without leaving the command-line interface.</p> \n<h2 id=\"setup\">Setup</h2> \n<p>To get started, simply visit the <a href=\"https://cli.github.com/manual/installation\">installation page</a> and find instructions on how to install GitHub CLI for your operating system. For Windows and macOS, you can use package managers to install and keep GitHub CLI up to date. For Linux users, you’ll need to download the package from the <a href=\"http://github.com/cli/cli/releases/latest\">latest release</a> page. There are Signed MSI installers for Windows users too, but be aware you have to re-download and update the tool manually if you opt for this. The easiest way for Windows users is to use the <a href=\"https://scoop.sh/\">scoop</a> package manager.</p> \n<p>Below are snapshots of install instructions for each supported platform:</p> \n<ul> \n <li> <p>Windows:</p> <pre><code class=\"powershell language-powershell\">scoop bucket add github-gh https://github.com/cli/scoop-gh.git\nscoop install gh\n</code></pre> </li> \n <li> <p>macOS:</p> <pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">brew install github\n</code></pre> </li> \n <li> <p>Debian/Ubuntu Linux:</p> <pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">sudo apt install git &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo dpkg -i gh_*_linux_amd64.deb\n</code></pre> </li> \n <li> <p>Fedora/Centos Linux:</p> <pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">sudo yum localinstall gh_*_linux_amd64.rpm\n</code></pre> </li> \n <li> <p>Arch Linux:</p> <pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">yay -S github-cli\n</code></pre> </li> \n</ul> \n<p>On Windows, I would recommend the use of the <a href=\"https://gitforwindows.org/\">Git Bash</a> terminal. This interface will allow you to access common Linux commands and Bash features such as autocompletion. It’s also officially supported by Visual Studio Code via terminal integration.</p> \n<p>After installing GitHub CLI, you’ll need to authenticate your account. Running any command will trigger this authentication process. For example, try <code>gh repo view cli/cli</code>. For first-time users, you’ll be prompted with the following:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/159161888901-gh-authentication.png\" alt=\"GitHub authentication\" /></p> \n<p>Simply press the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key to start the process as illustrated below:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/159161889102-gh-authorize.png\" alt=\"Gitub authorization\" /></p> \n<p>Once you provide your password, you’ll get a “Successfully authenticated GitHub CLI” message. You’re now able to interact with the GitHub platform via the command-line terminal. The next step is to implement autocomplete, which is optional. Simply add this line to your <code>~/.bash_profile</code>:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">eval \"$(gh completion -s bash)\"\n</code></pre> \n<p>You can also run the above command in your current terminal to get the autocomplete feature without restarting your terminal. To confirm it’s working, type <code>gh repo</code>, then press <kbd>tab</kbd> twice. It should show you four different commands you can append to the current <code>repo</code> command.</p> \n<h2 id=\"commandstructure\">Command Structure</h2> \n<p>The <code>gh</code> command structure is tree-like and easy to remember. There are basically two levels of commands. The first level only consists of six commands:</p> \n<p> Continue reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/github-cli/?utm_source=rss\">GitHub CLI: A Guide to GitHub from the Command Line</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=FGFI9wInlnk:ngg0NfyARrs:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=FGFI9wInlnk:ngg0NfyARrs:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=FGFI9wInlnk:ngg0NfyARrs:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=FGFI9wInlnk:ngg0NfyARrs:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/FGFI9wInlnk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Sun, 21 Jun 2020 21:12:31 +0000","feedId":6128,"bgimg":"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1592442845github-cli.png","linkMd5":"a5a970d82ecfafd6d823f004e2786161","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn26@2020_3/2020/08/24/22-51-25-269_0544770c43f68b11.webp","destWidth":600,"destHeight":339,"sourceBytes":6256,"destBytes":6256,"author":"Michael Wanyoike","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1592442845github-cli.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn26@2020_3/2020/08/24/22-51-25-269_0544770c43f68b11.webp","https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/159161888901-gh-authentication.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn28@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-39-374_9bf8f664e45bd73d.webp","https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/159161889102-gh-authorize.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn100@2020_6/2020/08/24/22-51-47-082_2aa30212994086da.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn15@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-39-311_6409ebad5acff93a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn3@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-47-113_bf83e999bebef320.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=FGFI9wInlnk:ngg0NfyARrs:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn1@2020_3/2020/08/24/22-51-36-198_a0536afd250f877d.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/FGFI9wInlnk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn17@2020_4/2020/08/24/22-51-35-140_a00c59e879ea905e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598309483262},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","title":"7 Collaborative Coding Tools for Remote Pair Programming","link":"https://www.sitepoint.com/?p=171845","description":"<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/collaborative-coding-tools-for-remote-pair-programming/?utm_source=rss\" title=\"7 Collaborative Coding Tools for Remote Pair Programming\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1588917293THG_M78_02.jpg\" alt=\"Remote Pair Programming Tools\" srcset=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1588917293THG_M78_02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1588917293THG_M78_02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1588917293THG_M78_02-1024x683.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /> </a> \n<p>Fifteen years ago, most online collaboration and remote work involved email threads, Skype calls, and endlessly re-zipping projects for sharing after each iteration.</p> \n<p>Things have changed a lot — many for the better (Google Docs!) and some things for worse (<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/the-real-future-of-remote-work-is-asynchronous/\">always-on messaging</a>). Either way, it’s fair to say that a lot of the friction has been removed from remote work.</p> \n<p>While other tools have moved ahead, real-time code collaboration has been a point of contention and viable solutions have only recently arrived on the scene. Developers working on the world’s top code editors have put forward their solutions, and they’re pretty good.</p> \n<p>You might <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/jobs/\">work on a distributed team</a> and need collaborative coding tools to serve you every day — a category that suddenly includes most of us, thanks to COVID-19.

While many code collaboration tools are bound to the host’s perspective, Microsoft’s entrant allows each person to navigate between files and make changes to code on their own terms.</p> \n<p>Live Share can share your workspace, terminal, and local servers, and you can communicate over voice from within the tool. This is a polished option with other useful touches, like group debugging and a focus-and-follow feature that allows you to draw the attention of your collaborators.

After the host opens a “portal”, their active tab becomes a shared workspace, and collaborators follow the host as they move between files.

It does borrow heavily from other popular code editors, mostly Sublime Text and Atom. However, its success mainly comes from its ability to provide better performance and stability. In addition, it also provides much-needed features like IntelliSense, which were only available in full-sized IDEs like Eclipse or Visual Studio 2017.</p> \n<p>The power of VS Code no doubt comes from the <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode\">marketplace</a>. Thanks to the wonderful open-source community, the editor is now capable of supporting almost every programming language, framework and development technology. Support for a library or framework comes in various ways, which mainly includes snippets, syntax highlighting, <a href=\"https://emmet.io/\">Emmet</a> and IntelliSense features for that specific technology.</p> \n<h2 id=\"vscodeextensionsbycategory\">VS Code Extensions by Category</h2> \n<p>For this article, I’ll focus on VS Code extensions specifically targeting JavaScript developers. Currently, there are many VS Code extensions that fit this criterion, which of course means I won’t be able to mention all of them. Instead, I’ll highlight VS Code extensions that have gained popularity and those that are indispensable for JavaScript developers. For simplicity, I’ll group them into ten specific categories.</p> \n<h2 id=\"snippetextensions\">Snippet Extensions</h2> \n<p>When you first install VS Code, it comes with a several built-in snippets for JavaScript and Typescript. Snippets help you write repetitive code quickly. However, you may find these may not be enough. You can easily create your own, or you can simply install an extension that includes a bunch of new useful snippets. A quick tip if you want snippets to show on top of suggestions is to use this configuration:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">{\n  \"editor.snippetSuggestions\": \"top\"\n}\n</code></pre> \n<p>Here are some of the most popular snippet extensions for JavaScript developers.

Hence, extensions such as <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.js-atom-grammar\">JavaScript Atom Grammar</a> are no longer needed.</p> \n<p>However, we still have a few syntax highlighting extensions that are quite useful when it comes to certain types of projects and file extensions. Here’s a few:</p> \n<ul> \n <li> <p><a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mgmcdermott.vscode-language-babel\">Babel JavaScript</a>, by Michael McDermott.

You’ll realize that people have strong opinions about which coding style to use. Nevertheless, everyone on the same team needs to use the same coding style regardless of their opinion.</p> \n<p>However, it’s quite common for programmers to forget which coding styling they agreed to work with. To enforce the rules, we need to use <strong>linters</strong> that compare your code with the rules you’ve established. You define your rules by picking a popular coding style such as <a href=\"https://standardjs.com\">Standard</a>, <a href=\"https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html\">Google</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/airbnb/javascript\">Airbnb</a>. You can use them as is or use a configuration file to customize the rules. VS Code doesn’t have a built-in JavaScript linter, so you’ll need to install an extension.</p> \n<p>Here are the extensions we have available:</p> \n<ul> \n <li> <p><a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint\">ESLint</a>, by Dirk Baeumer.

This extension (259k+ installs) simply integrates <a href=\"https://github.com/standard/standard\">JavaScript Standard Style</a> into VS Code. You’ll need to install <code>standard</code> or <code>semiStandard</code> as a dev dependency in your project. No configuration file is required. You’ll need to disable VS Code’s built-in validator for this extension to work.</p> </li> \n <li> <p><a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ajhyndman.jslint\">JSLint</a>, by Andrew Hyndman.

To fix this, we need to go back and fix the indentation in each line. In addition, we need to ensure braces and tags are properly formatted in a readable format. This process can quickly get tedious.</p> \n<p>Luckily, we have extensions that can do the work for us. Please note extensions such as <code>Prettier</code> and <code>Beautify</code> can’t both be active simultaneously.</p> \n<ul> \n <li> <p><a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode\">Prettier Code Formatter</a>, by Esben Petersen. This is the most popular extension that supports formatting of JavaScript, TypeScript and CSS using <a href=\"https://github.com/prettier/prettier\">Prettier</a>.

Each framework has a lot to offer and it’s not easy to choose between them. Whether you’re a newcomer trying to figure out where to start, a freelancer picking a framework for your next project, or an enterprise-grade architect planning a strategic vision for your company, you’re likely to benefit from having an educated view on this topic.</strong></p> \n<p>To save you some time, let me tell you something up front: this article won’t give a clear answer on which framework is better. But neither will hundreds of other articles with similar titles. I can’t tell you that, because the answer depends on a wide range of factors which make a particular technology more or less suitable for your environment and use case.</p> \n<p>Since we can’t answer the question directly, we’ll attempt something else. We’ll compare Angular and React, to demonstrate how you can approach the problem of comparing any two frameworks in a structured manner on your own and tailor it to your environment. You know, the old “teach a man to fish” approach. That way, when both are replaced by a BetterFramework.js in a year’s time, you’ll be able to re-create the same train of thought once more.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/1492644427RvsA_B-01.png\" alt=\"Two knights jousting, with React and Angular logos on their shields\" /></p> \n<p><em>We’ve just overhauled this guide to reflect the state of React, Angular, and their respective advantages and disadvantages in 2020.</em></p> \n<h2 id=\"wheretostart\">Where to Start?</h2> \n<p>Before you pick any tool, you need to answer two simple questions: “Is this a good tool per se?” and “Will it work well for my use case?” Neither of them mean anything on their own, so you always need to keep both of them in mind. All right, the questions might not be that simple, so we’ll try to break them down into smaller ones.</p> \n<p>Questions on the tool itself:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>How mature is it and who’s behind it?</li> \n <li>What kind of features does it have?</li> \n <li>What architecture, development paradigms, and patterns does it employ?</li> \n <li>What is the ecosystem around it?</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Questions for self-reflection:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Will I and my colleagues be able to learn this tool with ease?</li> \n <li>Does it fit well with my project?</li> \n <li>What is the developer experience like?</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Using this set of questions, you can start your assessment of any tool, and we’ll base our comparison of React and Angular on them as well.</p> \n<p>There’s another thing we need to take into account. Strictly speaking, it’s not exactly fair to compare Angular to React, since Angular is a full-blown, feature-rich framework, while React just a UI component library. To even the odds, we’ll talk about React in conjunction with some of the libraries often used with it.</p> \n<h2 id=\"maturity\">Maturity</h2> \n<p>An important part of being a skilled developer is being able to keep the balance between established, time-proven approaches and evaluating new bleeding-edge tech. As a general rule, you should be careful when adopting tools that haven’t yet matured due to certain risks:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>The tool may be buggy and unstable.</li> \n <li>It might be unexpectedly abandoned by the vendor.</li> \n <li>There might not be a large knowledge base or community available in case you need help.</li> \n <li>Both React and Angular come from good families, so it seems that we can be confident in this regard.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3 id=\"react\">React</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://reactjs.org/\">React</a> is developed and maintained by Facebook and used in their products, including Instagram and WhatsApp. It has been around for around since 2013, so it’s not exactly new. It’s also one of the most popular projects on GitHub, with more than 150,000 stars at the time of writing. Some of the other notable companies using React are Airbnb, Uber, Netflix, Dropbox, and Atlassian. Sounds good to me.</p> \n<h3 id=\"angular\">Angular</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://angular.io/\">Angular</a> has been around since 2016, making it slightly younger than React, but it’s also not a new kid on the block. It’s maintained by Google and, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbFLorQWlOQ&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=358\">as mentioned by Igor Minar</a>, even in 2018 was used in more than 600 hundred applications in Google such as Firebase Console, Google Analytics, Google Express, Google Cloud Platform and more. Outside of Google, Angular is used by Forbes, Upwork, VMWare, and <a href=\"https://www.madewithangular.com/\">others</a>.</p> \n<h2 id=\"features\">Features</h2> \n<p>Like I mentioned earlier, Angular has more features out of the box than React. This can be both a good and a bad thing, depending on how you look at it.</p> \n<p>Both frameworks share some key features in common: components, data binding, and platform-agnostic rendering.</p> \n<h3 id=\"angular-1\">Angular</h3> \n<p>Angular provides a lot of the features required for a modern web application out of the box. Some of the standard features are:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>dependency injection</li> \n <li>templates, based on an extended version of HTML</li> \n <li>class-based components with lifecycle hooks</li> \n <li>routing, provided by <code>@angular/router</code></li> \n <li>Ajax requests using <code>@angular/common/http</code></li> \n <li><code>@angular/forms</code> for building forms</li> \n <li>component CSS encapsulation</li> \n <li>XSS protection</li> \n <li>code splitting and lazy loading</li> \n <li>test runner, framework and utilities for unit-testing.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Some of these features are built into the core of the framework and you don’t have an option not to use them. This requires developers to be familiar with features such as dependency injection to build even a small Angular application. Other features such as the HTTP client or forms are completely optional and can be added on an as-needed basis.</p> \n<h3 id=\"react-1\">React</h3> \n<p>With React, you’re starting with a more minimalistic approach. If we’re looking at just React, here’s what we have:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>instead of classic templates, it has JSX, an XML-like language built on top of JavaScript</li> \n <li>class-based components with lifecycle hooks or simpler functional components</li> \n <li>state management using setState and hooks.</li> \n <li>XSS protection</li> \n <li>code splitting and lazy loading</li> \n <li>error handling boundaries</li> \n <li>utilities for unit-testing components</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Out of the box, React does not provide anything for dependency injection, routing, HTTP calls, or advanced form handling. You are expected to choose whatever additional libraries to add based on your needs which can be both a good and a bad thing depending on how experienced you are with these technologies. Some of the popular libraries that are often used together with React are:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://reactrouter.com\">React-router</a> for routing</li> \n <li>Fetch (or <a href=\"https://github.com/axios/axios\">axios</a>) for HTTP requests</li> \n <li>a wide variety of techniques for CSS encapsulation</li> \n <li><a href=\"https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/\">Enzyme</a> or <a href=\"https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro\">React Testing Library</a> for additional unit-testing utilities</li> \n</ul> \n<p>The teams I’ve worked with have found the freedom of choosing your libraries liberating. This gives us the ability to tailor our stack to particular requirements of each project, and we haven’t found the cost of learning new libraries that high.</p> \n<p> Continue reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/react-vs-angular/?utm_source=rss\">React vs Angular: An In-depth Comparison</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=DO5NliNasAw:AnaUnx8vTMU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=DO5NliNasAw:AnaUnx8vTMU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=DO5NliNasAw:AnaUnx8vTMU:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=DO5NliNasAw:AnaUnx8vTMU:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/DO5NliNasAw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Sun, 23 Aug 2020 19:00:25 +0000","feedId":6128,"bgimg":"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/1492644427RvsA_B-01.png","linkMd5":"c9cdb92a528c588f5d31ca349750f3d2","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn14@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-51-24-723_c9a73b83b05c84fc.webp","destWidth":900,"destHeight":500,"sourceBytes":21478,"destBytes":21478,"author":"Pavels Jelisejevs","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/1492644427RvsA_B-01.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn14@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-51-24-723_c9a73b83b05c84fc.webp","https://www.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/1492644427RvsA_B-01.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn23@2020_4/2020/08/24/22-51-45-202_29e48cc4e25b8b1e.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn15@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-39-311_6409ebad5acff93a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn3@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-47-113_bf83e999bebef320.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=DO5NliNasAw:AnaUnx8vTMU:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn9@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-51-35-383_4bb0816e569006e8.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/DO5NliNasAw":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn81@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-38-085_f41d600609d209a1.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598309483244},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","title":"How to Prototype a Web App with Django and Vue.js","link":"https://www.sitepoint.com/?p=175926","description":"<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/web-app-prototype-django-vue/?utm_source=rss\" title=\"How to Prototype a Web App with Django and Vue.js\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1587347568django-vue.png\" alt=\"Prototyping a Web App with Django and Vue.js\" srcset=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1587347568django-vue-300x170.png 300w, https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1587347568django-vue.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /> </a> \n<p><strong>Wouldn’t it be cool if you could prototype a custom web application that’s <a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/build-responsive-bootstrap-website/\">responsive</a> (mobile-ready), <a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/reactive-web-apps/\">reactive</a> (light-speed fast), with a full-featured&nbsp;<a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/admin/\">admin interface</a>&nbsp;to manage the content — all in no time?

Setting Up the Database with Django</h2> \n<p>Here we’ll define the back-end database with Django, which we’ll later integrate with a front-end storage with Vuex.</p> \n<h3 id=\"djangomodels\">Django Models</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/models/\">Models</a> are Django’s way to implement an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_database\">object-relational database management system</a> (ORDBMS). In other words, plain text files where you can define database tables and fields, and from where these will propagate to the application layer and the DB engine.</p> \n<p>Let’s code the following models for our app in <code>myapp/models.py</code>:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"python language-python\">from django.db import models\n\nclass Article(models.Model):\n    \"\"\"Table schema to store articles.\"\"\"\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=64)\n    author = models.ForeignKey('myapp.Author', on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n    content = models.TextField()\n    slug = models.CharField(default='', max_length=64)\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return '%s' % self.name\n\nclass Author(models.Model):\n    \"\"\"Table schema to store auhtors.\"\"\"\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=64)\n    slug = models.CharField(default='', max_length=64)\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return '%s' % self.name\n</code></pre> \n<p>Notice that we implemented a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_URL#Slug\">URL slug</a> for both articles and authors.</p> \n<p>For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/\">Model API reference</a> on the Django documentation site.</p> \n<h3 id=\"djangoadmin\">Django Admin</h3> \n<p>Before we can manage these models through the admin site, we’ll first need to <a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/admin/#django.contrib.admin.AdminSite.register\"><code>register</code></a> them so that Django makes them available to us.</p> \n<p>Let’s simply edit <code>myapp/admin.py</code> so that it looks like this:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"python language-python\">from django.contrib import admin\n\nfrom .models import Article\nfrom .models import Author\n\n# register models to use in admin site\nadmin.site.register(Article)\nadmin.site.register(Author)\n</code></pre> \n<p>Read more about the <a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/admin/\">Django admin site</a> on the Django documentation site.</p> \n<h3 id=\"djangomigrations\">Django Migrations</h3> \n<p>From the Django’s <a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/migrations/\">Migrations documentation</a>:</p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>Migrations are Django’s way of propagating changes you make to your models (adding a field, deleting a model, etc.) into your database schema.</p>\n</blockquote> \n<p>In short: migrations do <em>everything</em>; no SQL commands required.</p> \n<p>First, let’s create the migration files:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">(myenvironment) $ python manage.py makemigrations\n</code></pre> \n<pre><code class=\"text language-text\">Migrations for 'myapp':\n  myapp\\migrations\\0001_initial.py\n    - Create model Author\n    - Create model Article\n</code></pre> \n<p>Now let’s use that information to update the database:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">(myenvironment) $ python manage.py migrate\n</code></pre> \n<pre><code class=\"text language-text\">Operations to perform:\n  Apply all migrations: admin, auth, contenttypes, myapp, sessions\nRunning migrations:\n  Applying contenttypes.0001_initial...

OK\n</code></pre> \n<p>Don’t mind the long list. That’s because that was our first migration, so not only our <code>Author</code> and <code>Article</code> tables were created, but also all of Django’s default schemas.</p> \n<p>For more info, see <a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/migration-operations/\">Migration operations</a> in the Django documentation site.</p> \n<h2 id=\"3abasicinterfacewithvuecomponentsinadjangotemplate\">3.

We’ll see that possibilities exist to activate the SSL/TLS layer even when it’s not enabled by default.</p> \n<p><em>Note: if you’re looking for instructions on how to set up SSL with NGINX when configuring it to work as a reverse proxy for a Node app, check out our quick tip, “<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/configuring-nginx-ssl-node-js/\">Configuring NGINX and SSL with Node.js</a>”.</em></p> \n<p>Let’s start with a short review of the current state of HTTPS.</p> \n<h2 id=\"httpseverywhere\">HTTPS Everywhere</h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2\">The HTTP/2 specification</a> was published as RFC 7540 in May 2015, which means at this point it’s a part of the standard. This was a major milestone. Now we can all upgrade our servers to use HTTP/2. One of the most important aspects is the backwards compatibility with HTTP 1.1 and the negotiation mechanism to choose a different protocol. Although the standard doesn’t specify mandatory encryption, currently no browser supports HTTP/2 unencrypted. This gives HTTPS another boost. Finally we’ll get HTTPS everywhere!</p> \n<p>What does our stack actually look like? From the perspective of a website running in the browser (at the application level) we have to traverse the following layers to reach the IP level:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>Client browser</li> \n <li>HTTP</li> \n <li>SSL/TLS</li> \n <li>TCP</li> \n <li>IP</li> \n</ol> \n<p>HTTPS is nothing more than the HTTP protocol on top of SSL/TLS. Hence all of HTTP’s rules still apply. What does this additional layer actually give us? There are multiple advantages: we get authentication by having keys and certificates; a certain kind of privacy and confidentiality is guaranteed, as the connection is encrypted in an asymmetric manner; and data integrity is also preserved, as transmitted data can’t be changed during transit.</p> \n<p>One of the most common myths is that using SSL/TLS is computationally expensive and slows the server down. This is certainly not true anymore. We also don’t need any specialized hardware with cryptography units. Even for Google, <a href=\"https://www.imperialviolet.org/2010/06/25/overclocking-ssl.html\">the SSL/TLS layer accounts for less than 1% of the CPU load and the the network overhead of HTTPS as compared to HTTP is below 2%</a>. All in all, it wouldn’t make sense to forgo HTTPS for the sake of a little overhead.</p> \n<p>As Ilya Grigorik puts it, there is but one performance problem:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\" data-dnt=\"true\" data-theme=\"light\"> \n <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">TLS has exactly one performance problem: it is not used widely enough. Everything else can be optimized: <a href=\"https://t.co/1kH8qh89Eg\">https://t.co/1kH8qh89Eg</a></p> \n <p>— Ilya Grigorik (@igrigorik) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/igrigorik/status/436618170397646848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 20, 2014</a></p>\n</blockquote> \n<p><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p> \n<p>The most recent version is TLS 1.3. TLS is the successor of SSL, which is available in its latest release SSL 3.0. The changes from SSL to TLS preclude interoperability, but the basic procedure is, however, unchanged. We have three different encrypted channels. The first is a public key infrastructure for certificate chains. The second provides public key cryptography for key exchanges. Finally, the third one is symmetric. Here we have cryptography for data transfers.</p> \n<p>TLS 1.3 uses hashing for some important operations. Theoretically, it’s possible to use any hashing algorithm, but it’s highly recommended to use SHA2 or a stronger algorithm. SHA1 has been a standard for a long time but has recently become obsolete.</p> \n<p>HTTPS is also gaining more attention for clients. Privacy and security concerns have always been around, but with the growing amount of online accessible data and services, people are getting more and more concerned. For those sites that don’t implement it, there is a useful browser extension — <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere\">HTTPS Everywhere from the EFF</a> — which encrypts our communications with most websites.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1583329162https-everywhere.png\" alt=\"HTTPS-everywhere\" /></p> \n<p>The creators realized that many websites offer HTTPS only partially. The plugin allows us to rewrite requests for those sites that offer only partial HTTPS support. Alternatively, we can also block HTTP altogether (see the screenshot above).</p> \n<h2 id=\"basiccommunication\">Basic Communication</h2> \n<p>The certificate’s validation process involves validating the certificate signature and expiration. We also need to verify that it chains to a trusted root. Finally, we need to check to see if it’s been revoked. There are dedicated, trusted authorities in the world that grant certificates. In case one of these were to become compromised, all other certificates from the said authority would get revoked.</p> \n<p>The sequence diagram for an HTTPS handshake looks as follows. We start with the initialization from the client, which is followed by a message with the certificate and key exchange. After the server sends its completed package, the client can start the key exchange and cipher specification transmission. At this point, the client is finished. Finally the server confirms the cipher specification selection and closes the handshake.</p> \n<p><img src=\"http://www.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1442392132sequence.png\" alt=\"HTTPS-sequence\" /></p> \n<p>The whole sequence is triggered independently of HTTP. If we decide to use HTTPS, only the socket handling is changed. The client is still issuing HTTP requests, but the socket will perform the previously described handshake and encrypt the content (header and body).</p> \n<p>So what do we need to make SSL/TLS work with an Express.js server?</p> \n<h2 id=\"https\">HTTPS</h2> \n<p>By default, Node.js serves content over HTTP. But there’s also an <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/https.html\">HTTPS module</a> that we have to use in order to communicate over a secure channel with the client. This is a built-in module, and the usage is very similar to how we use the HTTP module:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"jsx language-jsx\">const https = require(\"https\"),\n  fs = require(\"fs\");\n\nconst options = {\n  key: fs.readFileSync(\"/srv/www/keys/my-site-key.pem\"),\n  cert: fs.readFileSync(\"/srv/www/keys/chain.pem\")\n};\n\nconst app = express();\n\napp.use((req, res) =&gt; {\n  res.writeHead(200);\n  res.end(\"hello world\\n\");\n});\n\napp.listen(8000);\n\nhttps.createServer(options, app).listen(8080);\n</code></pre> \n<p>Ignore the <code>/srv/www/keys/my-site-key.pem</code> and and <code>/srv/www/keys/chain.pem</code> files for the moment. Those are the SSL certificates we need to generate, which we’ll do a bit later. This is the part that changed with Let’s Encrypt. Previously, we had to generate a private/public key pair, send it to a trusted authority, pay them and probably wait for a bit in order to get an SSL certificate. Nowadays, Let’s Encrypt instantly generates and validates your certificates for free!</p> \n<h2 id=\"generatingcertificates\">Generating Certificates</h2> \n<h3 id=\"certbot\">Certbot</h3> \n<p>The TLS specification demands a certificate, which is signed by a trusted certificate authority (CA). The CA ensures that the certificate holder is really who they claim to be. So basically when you see the green lock icon (or any other greenish sign to the left side of the URL in your browser) it means that the server you’re communicating with is really who it claims to be. If you’re on facebook.com and you see a green lock, it’s almost certain you really are communicating with Facebook and no one else can see your communication — or rather, no one else can read it.</p> \n<p>It’s worth noting that this certificate doesn’t necessarily have to be verified by an authority such as Let’s Encrypt. There are other paid services as well. <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/q/10175812\">You can technically sign it yourself</a>, but then (as you’re not a trusted CA) the users visiting your site will likely see a large scary warning offering to get them back to safety.</p> \n<p>In the following example, we’ll use the <em>Certbot</em>, which is used to generate and manage certificates with Let’s Encrypt.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://certbot.eff.org/\">On the Certbot site</a> you can find instructions on how to install <em>Certbot</em> for almost any OS/server combination. You should choose the options that are applicable to you.</p> \n<p>A common combination for deploying Node apps is NGINX on the latest LTS Ubuntu and that’s what I’ll use here.</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">sudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install software-properties-common\nsudo add-apt-repository universe\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot\nsudo apt-get update\n</code></pre> \n<h4 id=\"webroot\">Webroot</h4> \n<p><a href=\"https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#webroot\">Webroot is a Certbot plugin</a> that, in addition to the Certbot default functionality (which automatically generates your public/private key pair and generates an SSL certificate for those), also copies the certificates to your webroot folder and verifies your server by placing some verification code into a hidden temporary directory named <code>.well-known</code>. In order to skip doing some of these steps manually, we’ll use this plugin. The plugin is installed by default with <em>Certbot</em>. In order to generate and verify our certificates, we’ll run the following:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">certbot certonly --webroot -w /var/www/example/ -d www.example.com -d example.com\n</code></pre> \n<p>You may have to run this command as sudo, as it will try to write to <code>/var/log/letsencrypt</code>.</p> \n<p>You’ll also be asked for your email address. It’s a good idea to put in a real address you use often, as you’ll get a notification if your certificate is about to expire. The trade-off for Let’s Encrypt issuing a free certificate is that it expires every three months. Luckily, renewal is as easy as running one simple command, which we can <a href=\"https://www.howtogeek.com/101288/how-to-schedule-tasks-on-linux-an-introduction-to-crontab-files/\">assign to a cron job</a> and then not have to worry about expiration. Additionally, it’s a good security practice to renew SSL certificates, as it gives attackers less time to break the encryption. Sometimes developers even set up this cron to run daily, which is completely fine and even recommended.</p> \n<p>Keep in mind that you have to run this command on a server to which the domain specified under the <code>-d</code> (for domain) flag resolves — that is, your production server. Even if you have the DNS resolution in your local hosts file, this won’t work, as the domain will be verified from outside. So if you’re doing this locally, it will most likely fail, unless you opened up a port from your local machine to the outside world and have it running behind a domain name which resolves to your machine. This is a highly unlikely scenario.</p> \n<p>Last but not least, after running this command, the output will contain paths to your private key and certificate files. Copy these values into the previous code snippet — into the <code>cert</code> property for certificate, and the <code>key</code> property for the key:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"jsx language-jsx\">// ...\n\nconst options = {\n  key: fs.readFileSync(\"/var/www/example/sslcert/privkey.pem\"),\n  cert: fs.readFileSync(\"/var/www/example/sslcert/fullchain.pem\") // these paths might differ for you, make sure to copy from the certbot output\n};\n\n// ...\n</code></pre> \n<p> Continue reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/how-to-use-ssltls-with-node-js/?utm_source=rss\">How to Use SSL/TLS with Node.js</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=d1amf2iSpyA:hVaO0YUOT1U:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=d1amf2iSpyA:hVaO0YUOT1U:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=d1amf2iSpyA:hVaO0YUOT1U:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=d1amf2iSpyA:hVaO0YUOT1U:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/d1amf2iSpyA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 08 Apr 2020 15:00:19 +0000","feedId":6128,"bgimg":"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1585717345ssl-tls.png","linkMd5":"ce34b5f76db5d342ae0e3bfde7dea030","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn25@2020_3/2020/08/24/22-51-24-742_63ec78a5e83081c5.webp","destWidth":600,"destHeight":339,"sourceBytes":8190,"destBytes":8190,"author":"Florian Rappl","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1585717345ssl-tls.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn25@2020_3/2020/08/24/22-51-24-742_63ec78a5e83081c5.webp","https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1583329162https-everywhere.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn89@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-51-43-108_e137658e4ef458d3.webp","http://www.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1442392132sequence.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn77@2020_3/2020/08/24/22-51-38-796_18098b281188e923.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn15@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-39-311_6409ebad5acff93a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn3@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-47-113_bf83e999bebef320.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=d1amf2iSpyA:hVaO0YUOT1U:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn13@2020_6/2020/08/24/22-51-42-525_3fae321a3599e02f.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/d1amf2iSpyA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn15@2020_2/2020/08/24/22-51-43-459_a36c6be0ec5c40e0.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598309483278},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","title":"How to Debug a Node.js Application: Tips, Tricks and Tools","link":"https://www.sitepoint.com/?p=151978","description":"<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/debug-node-app-tips-tricks-tools/?utm_source=rss\" title=\"How to Debug a Node.js Application: Tips, Tricks and Tools\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/1491329546nodebugsA-01.png\" alt=\"Two figures in protective suits with weapons, battling a giant spider-like bug\" srcset=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/1491329546nodebugsA-01-300x167.png 300w, https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/1491329546nodebugsA-01-768x427.png 768w, https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/1491329546nodebugsA-01.png 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /> </a> \n<p><strong>Software development is complex and, at some point, your Node.js application will fail.

Fixing a bug is often easy — a corrected character or additional line of code solves the problem. Finding that bug is another matter, and developers can spend many unhappy hours trying to locate the source of an issue. Fortunately, Node.js has some great tools to help trace errors.</p> \n<h3 id=\"terminology\">Terminology</h3> \n<p>Debugging has its own selection of obscure jargon, including the following:</p> \n<table> \n <thead> \n  <tr> \n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\">Term</th> \n   <th>Explanation</th> \n  </tr> \n </thead> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\">breakpoint</td> \n   <td>the point at which a debugger stops a program so its state can be inspected</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\">debugger</td> \n   <td>a tool which offers debugging facilities such as running code line by line to inspect internal variable states</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\">feature</td> \n   <td>as in the claim: “it’s not a bug, it’s a feature”.

The most common is <code>NODE_ENV</code>, which is typically set to <code>development</code> when debugging.</p> \n<p>Environment variables can be set on Linux/macOS:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">NODE_ENV=development\n</code></pre> \n<p>Windows <code>cmd</code>:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">set NODE_ENV=development\n</code></pre> \n<p>Or Windows Powershell:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">$env:NODE_ENV=\"development\"\n</code></pre> \n<p>Internally, an application will enable further debugging features and messages. For example:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">// is NODE_ENV set to \"development\"?\nconst DEVMODE = (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development');\n\nif (DEVMODE) {\n  console.log('application started in development mode on port ${PORT}');\n}\n</code></pre> \n<p><code>NODE_DEBUG</code> enables debugging messages using the Node.js <code>util.debuglog</code> (see below), but also consult the documentation of your primary modules and frameworks to discover further options.</p> \n<p>Note that environment variables can also be saved to a <code>.env</code> file. For example:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"env language-env\">NODE_ENV=development\nNODE_LOG=./log/debug.log\nSERVER_PORT=3000\nDB_HOST=localhost\nDB_NAME=mydatabase\n</code></pre> \n<p>Then loaded using the <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv\"><code>dotenv</code> module</a>:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">require('dotenv').config();\n</code></pre> \n<h2 id=\"nodejsdebuggingcommandlineoptions\">Node.js Debugging: Command Line Options</h2> \n<p>Various <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html\">command-line options</a> can be passed to the <code>node</code> runtime when launching an application. One of the most useful is <code>--trace-warnings</code>, which outputs stack traces for process warnings (including deprecations).</p> \n<p>Any number of options can be set, including:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><code>--enable-source-maps</code>: enable source maps (experimental)</li> \n <li><code>--throw-deprecation</code>: throw errors when deprecated features are used</li> \n <li><code>--inspect</code>: activate the V8 inspector (see below)</li> \n</ul> \n<p>By way of an example, let’s try to log <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html#crypto_crypto_default_encoding\">the crypto module’s <code>DEFAULT_ENCODING</code> property</a>, which was deprecated in Node v10:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">const crypto = require('crypto');\n\nfunction bar() {\n  console.log(crypto.DEFAULT_ENCODING);\n}\n\nfunction foo(){\n  bar();\n}\n\nfoo();\n</code></pre> \n<p>Now run this with the following:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">node index.js\n</code></pre> \n<p>We’ll then see this:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"text language-text\">buffer\n(node:7405) [DEP0091] DeprecationWarning: crypto.DEFAULT_ENCODING is deprecated.\n</code></pre> \n<p>However, we can also do this:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">node --trace-warnings index.js\n</code></pre> \n<p>That produces the following:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"text language-text\">buffer\n(node:7502) [DEP0091] DeprecationWarning: crypto.DEFAULT_ENCODING is deprecated.\n    at bar (/home/Desktop/index.js:4:22)\n    at foo (/home/Desktop/index.js:8:3)\n    at Object.&lt;anonymous&gt; (/home/Desktop/index.js:11:1)\n    at Module._compile (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:1151:30)\n    at Object.Module._extensions..js (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:1171:10)\n    at Module.load (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:1000:32)\n    at Function.Module._load (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:899:14)\n    at Function.executeUserEntryPoint [as runMain] (internal/modules/run_main.js:71:12)\n    at internal/main/run_main_module.js:17:47\n</code></pre> \n<p>This tells us that the deprecation warning comes from the code in line 4 (the <code>console.log</code> statement), which was executed when the <code>bar</code> function ran. The <code>bar</code> function was called by the <code>foo</code> function on line 8 and the <code>foo</code> function was called on line 11 of our script.</p> \n<p>Note that the same options can also be passed to <a href=\"https://nodemon.io/\">nodemon</a>.</p> \n<h2 id=\"consoledebugging\">Console Debugging</h2> \n<p>One of the easiest ways to debug an application is to output values to the console during execution:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">console.log( myVariable );\n</code></pre> \n<p>Few developers delve beyond this humble debugging command, but they’re missing out on <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/console.html\">many more possibilities</a>, including these:</p> \n<table> \n <thead> \n  <tr> \n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"><code>console</code> method</th> \n   <th>description</th> \n  </tr> \n </thead> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"><a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/console.html#console_console_log_data_args\"><code>.log(msg)</code></a></td> \n   <td>output a message to the console</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"><a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/console.html#console_console_dir_obj_options\"><code>.dir(obj,opt)</code></a></td> \n   <td>uses <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/util.html#util_util_inspect_object_options\"><code>util.inspect</code></a> to pretty-print objects and properties</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"><a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/console.html#console_console_table_tabulardata_properties\"><code>.table(obj)</code></a></td> \n   <td>outputs arrays of objects in tabular format</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"><a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/console.html#console_console_error_data_args\"><code>.error(msg)</code></a></td> \n   <td>output an error message</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"><a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/console.html#console_console_count_label\"><code>.count(label)</code></a></td> \n   <td>a named counter reporting the number of times the line has been executed</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"><a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/console.html#console_console_countreset_label\"><code>.countReset[label]</code></a></td> \n   <td>resets a named counter</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"><a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/console.html#console_console_group_label\"><code>.group(label)</code></a></td> \n   <td>indents a group of log messages</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"><a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/console.html#console_console_groupend\"><code>.groupEnd(label)</code></a></td> \n   <td>ends the indented group</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"><a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/console.html#console_console_time_label\"><code>.time(label)</code></a></td> \n   <td>starts a timer to calculate the duration of an operation</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"><a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/console.html#console_console_timelog_label_data\"><code>.timeLog([label]</code></a></td> \n   <td>reports the elapsed time since the timer started</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"><a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/console.html#console_console_timeend_label\"><code>.timeEnd(label)</code></a></td> \n   <td>stops the timer and reports the total duration</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"><a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/console.html#console_console_trace_message_args\"><code>.trace()</code></a></td> \n   <td>outputs a stack trace (a list of all calling functions)</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"><a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/console.html#console_console_clear\"><code>.clear()</code></a></td> \n   <td>clear the console</td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p><code>console.log()</code> accepts a list of comma-separated values.

It’s like “productive volunteering” (if you’ll humor me). It’s a fantastic way to build something bigger than you, give back to the community, and level up your skills.</p> \n<p>In this article, we’re going to talk about practical ways for you to get involved in open source TypeScript projects. We’ll first cover assessing your level then jump into how you can find opportunities.</p> \n<h2 id=\"assessingyourlevel\">Assessing Your Level</h2> \n<p>Before you get started contributing to open source, you want to find your comfort level. Where are you at skill-wise? What level of complexity are you wanting to solve? How much time do you want to spend? These are important questions to consider before diving in. This information will guide us during the process of finding opportunities.</p> \n<p>To simplify things, we will create three levels:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Level 1</li> \n <li>Level 2</li> \n <li>Level 3</li> \n</ul> \n<p>In each level, we will provide a description and an example contribution for someone at that level. Let’s take a look.</p> \n<h3 id=\"level1newtotypescript\">Level 1: New to TypeScript</h3> \n<p>The first level in our three-level TypeScript skills assessment is for those who are “new to TypeScript.” You might find yourself here if any of this description resonates with you:</p> \n<p><em>You are new to TypeScript. You feel comfortable enough with JavaScript that you decided to give TypeScript a try. You have looked at the docs briefly. Maybe you’ve gone through a tutorial or two and. Maybe you’ve watched a video about TypeScript on YouTube. “Beginner” feels accurate when labeling your TypeScript skills.</em></p> \n<p>Below are a few examples of things you might contribute to while you are at this level:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>updates to documentation \n  <ul> \n   <li><a href=\"https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader/issues/1024\">open-source libraries</a></li> \n   <li><a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript-Handbook/pull/1115\">TypeScript Handbook</a> or website</li> \n   <li><a href=\"https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/react-typescript-cheatsheet/pull/155\">creating links to the TypeScript playground for examples</a></li> \n  </ul> </li> \n</ul> \n<h3 id=\"level2comfortablewithtypescript\">Level 2: Comfortable with TypeScript</h3> \n<p>The next level in our system is where I imagine most people self-categorize. Read the description and see if this relates to how you are currently feeling:</p> \n<p><em>You’ve used TypeScript in a few projects. You feel comfortable with TypeScript and understand how to fix general type errors. You’re not an expert when it comes to understanding issues, but you sure know how to find the answer. Maybe you’ve written a handful of interfaces or type aliases. You know a decent number of TypeScript tricks or tips. The compiler isn’t your bestie, but you consider yourselves acquaintances.</em> </p> \n<p>At this level, you might feel comfortable contributing in the following ways:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>fixing bugs \n  <ul> \n   <li>fixing a type error</li> \n   <li>making a switch statement exhaustive</li> \n  </ul> </li> \n <li>adding small features \n  <ul> \n   <li>converting <code>any</code> to the correct type</li> \n  </ul> </li> \n <li>updating docs with new examples, templates, etc. \n  <ul> \n   <li>contributing to a <a href=\"https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets\">cheatsheet</a></li> \n  </ul> </li> \n</ul> \n<h3 id=\"level3readyfortypescriptchallenges\">Level 3: Ready for TypeScript Challenges</h3> \n<p>The last level we’ll have is for people who feel quite comfortable with TypeScript and are ready for a challenge!

When you need to navigate through a React application with multiple views, you’ll need a router to manage the URLs. React Router takes care of that, keeping your application UI and the URL in sync.</strong></p> \n<p>This tutorial introduces you to React Router v5 and a whole lot of things you can do with it.</p> \n<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2> \n<p>React is a popular library for creating single-page applications (SPAs) that are rendered on the client side. An SPA might have multiple <strong>views</strong> (aka <strong>pages</strong>), and unlike the conventional multi-page apps, navigating through these views shouldn’t result in the entire page being reloaded. Instead, we want the views to be rendered inline within the current page. The end user, who’s accustomed to multi-page apps, expects the following features to be present in an SPA:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Each view in an application should have a URL that uniquely specifies that view. This is so that the user can bookmark the URL for reference at a later time. For example, <code>www.example.com/products</code>.</li> \n <li>The browser’s back and forward button should work as expected.</li> \n <li>The dynamically generated nested views should preferably have a URL of their own too. For example, <code>example.com/products/shoes/101</code>, where 101 is the product ID.</li> \n</ul> \n<p><strong>Routing</strong> is the process of keeping the browser URL in sync with what’s being rendered on the page. React Router lets you handle routing <em>declaratively</em>. The declarative routing approach allows you to control the data flow in your application, by saying “the route should look like this”:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"jsx language-jsx\">&lt;Route path=\"/about\" component={About} /&gt;\n</code></pre> \n<p>You can place your <code>&lt;Route&gt;</code> component anywhere you want your route to be rendered. Since <code>&lt;Route&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;Link&gt;</code> and all the other React Router APIs that we’ll be dealing with are just components, you can easily get used to routing in React.</p> \n<p><em>A note before getting started. There’s a common misconception that React Router is an official routing solution developed by Facebook. In reality, it’s a third-party library that’s widely popular for its design and simplicity. If your requirements are limited to routers for navigation, you could implement a custom router from scratch without much hassle. However, understanding how the basics of React Router will give you better insights into how a router should work.</em></p> \n<h2 id=\"overview\">Overview</h2> \n<p>This tutorial is divided into different sections. First, we’ll be setting up React and React Router using npm. Then we’ll jump right into React Router basics. You’ll find different code demonstrations of React Router in action. The examples covered in this tutorial include:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>basic navigational routing</li> \n <li>nested routing</li> \n <li>nested routing with path parameters</li> \n <li>protected routing</li> \n</ol> \n<p>All the concepts connected with building these routes will be discussed along the way. The entire code for the project is available on <a href=\"https://github.com/sitepoint-editors/react-router-demo\">this GitHub repo</a>. Once you’re inside a particular demo directory, run <code>npm install</code> to install the dependencies. To serve the application on a development server, run <code>npm start</code> and head over to <code>http://localhost:3000/</code> to see the demo in action.</p> \n<p>Let’s get started!</p> \n<h2 id=\"settingupreactrouter\">Setting up React Router</h2> \n<p>I assume you already have a development environment up and running. If not, head over to “<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/getting-started-react-jsx/\">Getting Started with React and JSX</a>”. Alternatively, you can use <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/create-react-app/\">Create React App</a> to generate the files required for creating a basic React project. This is the default directory structure generated by Create React App:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\"> react-router-demo\n    ├── .gitignore\n    ├── package.json\n    ├── public\n    │   ├── favicon.ico\n    │   ├── index.html\n    │   └── manifest.json\n    ├── README.md\n    ├── src\n    │   ├── App.css\n    │   ├── App.js\n    │   ├── App.test.js\n    │   ├── index.css\n    │   ├── index.js\n    │   ├── logo.svg\n    │   └── registerServiceWorker.js\n    └── yarn.lock\n</code></pre> \n<p>The React Router library comprises three packages: <code>react-router</code>, <code>react-router-dom</code>, and <code>react-router-native</code>. <code>react-router</code> is the core package for the router, whereas the other two are environment specific. You should use <code>react-router-dom</code> if you’re building a website, and <code>react-router-native</code> if you’re on a mobile app development environment using React Native.</p> \n<p>Use npm to install <code>react-router-dom</code>:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npm install --save react-router-dom\n</code></pre> \n<h2 id=\"reactrouterbasics\">React Router Basics</h2> \n<p>Here’s an example of how our routes will look:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"jsx language-jsx\">&lt;Router&gt;/* App component */\nclass App extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      &lt;div&gt;\n        &lt;nav className=\"navbar navbar-light\"&gt;\n          &lt;ul className=\"nav navbar-nav\"&gt;\n            /* Link components are used for linking to other views */\n            &lt;li&gt;\n              &lt;Link to=\"/\"&gt;Homes&lt;/Link&gt;\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            &lt;li&gt;\n              &lt;Link to=\"/category\"&gt;Category&lt;/Link&gt;\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            &lt;li&gt;\n              &lt;Link to=\"/products\"&gt;Products&lt;/Link&gt;\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n          &lt;/ul&gt;\n        &lt;/nav&gt;\n        /* Route components are rendered if the path prop matches the current URL*/\n        &lt;Route path=\"/\" component={Home} /&gt;\n        &lt;Route path=\"/category\" component={Category} /&gt;\n        &lt;Route path=\"/products\" component={Products} /&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n    );\n  }\n}\n  &lt;Route exact path=\"/\" component={Home} /&gt;\n  &lt;Route path=\"/category\" component={Category} /&gt;\n  &lt;Route path=\"/login\" component={Login} /&gt;\n  &lt;Route path=\"/products\" component={Products} /&gt;\n&lt;/Router&gt;\n</code></pre> \n<h3 id=\"router\">Router</h3> \n<p>You need a router component and several route components to set up a basic route as exemplified above. Since we’re building a browser-based application, we can use two types of routers from the React Router API:</p> \n<ol> \n <li><code>&lt;BrowserRouter&gt;</code></li> \n <li><code>&lt;HashRouter&gt;</code></li> \n</ol> \n<p>The primary difference between them is evident in the URLs that they create:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"jsx language-jsx\">// &lt;BrowserRouter&gt;\nhttp://example.com/about\n\n// &lt;HashRouter&gt;\nhttp://example.com/#/about\n</code></pre> \n<p>The <code>&lt;BrowserRouter&gt;</code> is more popular amongst the two because it uses the HTML5 History API to keep track of your router history. The <code>&lt;HashRouter&gt;</code>, on the other hand, uses the hash portion of the URL (<code>window.location.hash</code>) to remember things. If you intend to support legacy browsers, you should stick with <code>&lt;HashRouter&gt;</code>.</p> \n<p>Wrap the <code>&lt;BrowserRouter&gt;</code> component around the App component.</p> \n<h4 id=\"indexjs\">index.js</h4> \n<pre><code class=\"jsx language-jsx\">/* Import statements */\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport ReactDOM from \"react-dom\";\n\n/* App is the entry point to the React code.*/\nimport App from \"./App\";\n\n/* import BrowserRouter from 'react-router-dom' */\nimport { BrowserRouter } from \"react-router-dom\";\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  &lt;BrowserRouter&gt;\n    &lt;App /&gt;\n  &lt;/BrowserRouter&gt;,\n  document.getElementById(\"root\")\n);\n</code></pre> \n<p><em>Note: A router component can only have a single child element. The child element can be an HTML element — such as div — or a react component.</em></p> \n<p>For the React Router to work, you need to import the relevant API from the <code>react-router-dom</code> library. Here I’ve imported the <code>BrowserRouter</code> into <code>index.js</code>. I’ve also imported the <code>App</code> component from <code>App.js</code>. <code>App.js</code>, as you might have guessed, is the entry point to React components.</p> \n<p>The above code creates an instance of history for our entire App component. Let me formally introduce you to history.</p> \n<h3 id=\"history\">history</h3> \n<blockquote> \n <p><code>history</code> is a JavaScript library that lets you easily manage session history anywhere JavaScript runs. <code>history</code> provides a minimal API that lets you manage the history stack, navigate, confirm navigation, and persist state between sessions. — <a href=\"https://github.com/ReactTraining/history\">React Training docs</a></p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Each router component creates a history object that keeps track of the current location (<code>history.location</code>) and also the previous locations in a stack. When the current location changes, the view is re-rendered and you get a sense of navigation. How does the current location change? The history object has methods such as <code>history.push()</code> and <code>history.replace()</code> to take care of that. <code>history.push()</code> is invoked when you click on a <code>&lt;Link&gt;</code> component, and <code>history.replace()</code> is called when you use <code>&lt;Redirect&gt;</code>. Other methods — such as <code>history.goBack()</code> and <code>history.goForward()</code> — are used to navigate through the history stack by going back or forward a page.</p> \n<p>Moving on, we have Links and Routes.</p> \n<h3 id=\"linksandroutes\">Links and Routes</h3> \n<p>The <code>&lt;Route&gt;</code> component is the most important component in React router. It renders some UI if the current location matches the route’s path. Ideally, a <code>&lt;Route&gt;</code> component should have a prop named <code>path</code>, and if the pathname is matched with the current location, it gets rendered.</p> \n<p>The <code>&lt;Link&gt;</code> component, on the other hand, is used to navigate between pages. It’s comparable to the HTML anchor element. However, using anchor links would result in a browser refresh, which we don’t want. So instead, we can use <code>&lt;Link&gt;</code> to navigate to a particular URL and have the view re-rendered without a browser refresh.</p> \n<p>We’ve covered everything you need to know to create a basic router. Let’s build one.</p> \n<h3 id=\"demo1basicrouting\">Demo 1: Basic Routing</h3> \n<h4 id=\"srcappjs\">src/App.js</h4> \n<pre><code class=\"jsx language-jsx\">/* Import statements */\nimport React, { Component } from \"react\";\nimport { Link, Route, Switch } from \"react-router-dom\";\n\n/* Home component */\nconst Home = () =&gt; (\n  &lt;div&gt;\n    &lt;h2&gt;Home&lt;/h2&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n);\n\n/* Category component */\nconst Category = () =&gt; (\n  &lt;div&gt;\n    &lt;h2&gt;Category&lt;/h2&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n);\n\n/* Products component */\nconst Products = () =&gt; (\n  &lt;div&gt;\n    &lt;h2&gt;Products&lt;/h2&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n);\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      &lt;nav className=\"navbar navbar-light\"&gt;\n        &lt;ul className=\"nav navbar-nav\"&gt;\n          &lt;li&gt;\n            &lt;Link to=\"/\"&gt;Homes&lt;/Link&gt;\n          &lt;/li&gt;\n          &lt;li&gt;\n            &lt;Link to=\"/category\"&gt;Category&lt;/Link&gt;\n          &lt;/li&gt;\n          &lt;li&gt;\n            &lt;Link to=\"/products\"&gt;Products&lt;/Link&gt;\n          &lt;/li&gt;\n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n      &lt;/nav&gt;\n      /* Route components are rendered if the path prop matches the current URL */\n      &lt;Route path=\"/\" component={Home} /&gt;\n      &lt;Route path=\"/category\" component={Category} /&gt;\n      &lt;Route path=\"/products\" component={Products} /&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  );\n}\n</code></pre> \n<p>We’ve declared the components for Home, Category and Products inside <code>App.js</code>. Although this is okay for now, when the component starts to grow bigger, it’s better to have a separate file for each component. As a rule of thumb, I usually create a new file for a component if it occupies more than 10 lines of code. Starting from the second demo, I’ll be creating a separate file for components that have grown too big to fit inside the <code>App.js</code> file.</p> \n<p>Inside the App component, we’ve written the logic for routing. The <code>&lt;Route&gt;</code>‘s path is matched with the current location and a component gets rendered. The component that should be rendered is passed in as a second prop.</p> \n<p>Here <code>/</code> matches both <code>/</code> and <code>/category</code>. Therefore, both the routes are matched and rendered. How do we avoid that? You should pass the <code>exact= {true}</code> props to the router with <code>path='/'</code>:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"jsx language-jsx\">&lt;Route exact={true} path=\"/\" component={Home} /&gt;\n</code></pre> \n<p>If you want a route to be rendered only if the paths are exactly the same, you should use the exact props.</p> \n<h2 id=\"nestedrouting\">Nested Routing</h2> \n<p>To create nested routes, we need to have a better understanding of how <code>&lt;Route&gt;</code> works. Let’s do that.</p> \n<p><code>&lt;Route&gt;</code> has three props that you can you use to define what gets rendered:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>component</strong>. We’ve already seen this in action. When the URL is matched, the router creates a React element from the given component using <code>React.createElement</code>.</li> \n <li><strong>render</strong>. This is handy for inline rendering. The render prop expects a function that returns an element when the location matches the route’s path.</li> \n <li><strong>children</strong>. The children prop is similar to render in that it expects a function that returns a React element. However, children gets rendered regardless of whether the path is matched with the location or not.</li> \n</ul> \n<h3 id=\"pathandmatch\">Path and match</h3> \n<p>The <strong>path</strong> is used to identify the portion of the URL that the router should match. It uses the Path-to-RegExp library to turn a path string into a regular expression. It will then be matched against the current location.</p> \n<p>If the router’s path and the location are successfully matched, an object is created and we call it the <strong>match</strong> object. The match object carries more information about the URL and the path. This information is accessible through its properties, listed below:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><code>match.url</code>. A string that returns the matched portion of the URL. This is particularly useful for building nested <code>&lt;Link&gt;</code>s</li> \n <li><code>match.path</code>. A string that returns the route’s path string — that is, <code>&lt;Route path=\"\"&gt;</code>. We’ll be using this to build nested <code>&lt;Route&gt;</code>s.</li> \n <li><code>match.isExact</code>. A boolean that returns true if the match was exact (without any trailing characters).</li> \n <li><code>match.params</code>. An object containing key/value pairs from the URL parsed by the Path-to-RegExp package.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Now that we know all about <code>&lt;Route&gt;</code>s, let’s build a router with nested routes.</p> \n<h3 id=\"switchcomponent\">Switch Component</h3> \n<p>Before we head for the demo code, I want to introduce you to the <code>&lt;Switch&gt;</code> component. When multiple <code>&lt;Route&gt;</code>s are used together, all the routes that match are rendered inclusively. Consider this code from demo 1. I’ve added a new route to demonstrate why <code>&lt;Switch&gt;</code> is useful:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"jsx language-jsx\">&lt;Route exact path=\"/\" component={Home}/&gt;\n&lt;Route path=\"/products\" component={Products}/&gt;\n&lt;Route path=\"/category\" component={Category}/&gt;\n&lt;Route path=\"/:id\" render = {()=&gt; (&lt;p&gt; I want this text to show up for all routes other than '/', '/products' and '/category' &lt;/p&gt;)}/&gt;\n</code></pre> \n<p>If the URL is <code>/products</code>, all the routes that match the location <code>/products</code> are rendered. So, the <code>&lt;Route&gt;</code> with path <code>:id</code> gets rendered along with the <code>Products</code> component. This is by design. However, if this is not the behavior you’re expecting, you should add the <code>&lt;Switch&gt;</code> component to your routes. With <code>&lt;Switch&gt;</code>, only the first child <code>&lt;Route&gt;</code> that matches the location gets rendered.</p> \n<p> Continue reading <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/react-router-complete-guide/?utm_source=rss\">React Router v5: The Complete Guide</a> on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com\">SitePoint</a>. </p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\"> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=eqdQC0khaAU:Q70g63dFBww:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=eqdQC0khaAU:Q70g63dFBww:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?a=eqdQC0khaAU:Q70g63dFBww:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=eqdQC0khaAU:Q70g63dFBww:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\" /></a> \n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/eqdQC0khaAU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\" />","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 27 Apr 2020 15:00:02 +0000","feedId":6128,"bgimg":"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/1587032757react-router.png","linkMd5":"595809fd463ed102037385921c0e386f","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn53@2020_4/2020/08/24/22-51-24-743_a295f55ad6dbe0eb.webp","destWidth":600,"destHeight":339,"sourceBytes":9920,"destBytes":9920,"author":"Manjunath M","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/1587032757react-router.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn53@2020_4/2020/08/24/22-51-24-743_a295f55ad6dbe0eb.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn15@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-39-311_6409ebad5acff93a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn3@2020_5/2020/08/24/22-51-47-113_bf83e999bebef320.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SitepointFeed?i=eqdQC0khaAU:Q70g63dFBww:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn34@2020_1/2020/08/24/22-51-35-373_8a68467b65b6cf8a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SitepointFeed/~4/eqdQC0khaAU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn5@2020_4/2020/08/24/22-51-43-829_961ea48a93bdaf85.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598309483289},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 06:51:23","title":"Create New Express.js Apps in Minutes with Express Generator","link":"https://www.sitepoint.com/?p=163399","description":"<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/create-new-express-js-apps-with-express-generator/?utm_source=rss\" title=\"Create New Express.js Apps in Minutes with Express Generator\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/1585291419express-generator.png\" alt=\"Create New Express.js Apps in Minutes with Express Generator\" srcset=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/1585291419express-generator-300x170.png 300w, https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/1585291419express-generator.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /> </a> \n<p><strong><a style=\"font-weight:bold\" href=\"https://expressjs.com/\">Express.js</a> is a Node.js web framework that has gained immense popularity due to its simplicity. It has easy-to-use routing and simple support for view engines, putting it far ahead of the basic Node HTTP server.</strong></p> \n<p>However, starting a new Express application requires a certain amount of boilerplate code: starting a new server instance, configuring a view engine, and setting up error handling.</p> \n<p>Although there are various starter projects and boilerplates available, Express has its own command-line tool that makes it easy to start new apps, called the <a href=\"https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html\">express-generator</a>.</p> \n<h2 id=\"whatisexpress\">What is Express?</h2> \n<p>Express has a lot of features built in, and a lot more features you can get from other packages that integrate seamlessly, but there are three main things it does for you out of the box:</p> \n<ol> \n <li><strong>Routing</strong>. This is how <code>/home</code> <code>/blog</code> and <code>/about</code> all give you different pages. Express makes it easy for you to modularize this code by allowing you to put different routes in different files.</li> \n <li><strong>Middleware</strong>. If you’re new to the term, basically middleware is “software glue”. It accesses requests before your routes get them, allowing them to handle hard-to-do stuff like cookie parsing, file uploads, errors, and more.</li> \n <li><strong>Views</strong>. Views are how HTML pages are rendered with custom content. You pass in the data you want to be rendered and Express will render it with your given view engine.</li> \n</ol> \n<h2 id=\"gettingstarted\">Getting Started</h2> \n<p>The first thing you’ll need is to get Node and npm installed on your machine. To do this, either head to <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/download/\">the official Node download page</a> and grab the correct binaries for your system, or use a version manager such as nvm. We cover installing Node using a version manager in our quick tip, “<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/quick-tip-multiple-versions-node-nvm/\">Install Multiple Versions of Node.js Using nvm</a>”.</p> \n<p>Starting a new project with the Express generator is as simple as running a few commands:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npm install express-generator -g\n</code></pre> \n<p>This installs the Express generator as a global package, allowing you to run the <code>express</code> command in your terminal:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">express myapp\n</code></pre> \n<p>This creates a new Express project called <code>myapp</code>, which is then placed inside of the <code>myapp</code> directory:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">cd myapp\n</code></pre> \n<p>If you’re unfamiliar with terminal commands, this one puts you inside of the <code>myapp</code> directory:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npm install\n</code></pre> \n<p>If you’re unfamiliar with npm, it’s the <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/beginners-guide-node-package-manager/\">default Node.js package manager</a>. Running <code>npm install</code> installs all dependencies for the project. By default, the <code>express-generator</code> includes several packages that are commonly used with an Express server.</p> \n<h3 id=\"options\">Options</h3> \n<p>The generator CLI takes half a dozen <a href=\"https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html\">arguments</a>, but the two most useful ones are the following:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>-v \n   <ejs |hbs|hjs|jade|pug|twig|vash=\"\"></ejs></strong>. This lets you select a view engine to install. The default is <code>jade</code>. Although this still works, it has been deprecated and you should always specify an alternative engine.</li> \n <li><strong>-c \n   <less |stylus|compass|sass=\"\"></less></strong>. By default, the generator creates a very basic CSS file for you, but selecting a CSS engine will configure your new app with middleware to compile any of the above options.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Now that we’ve got our project set up and dependencies installed, we can start the new server by running the following:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npm start\n</code></pre> \n<p>Then browse to <a href=\"http://localhost:3000\">http://localhost:3000</a> in your browser.</p> \n<h2 id=\"applicationstructure\">Application Structure</h2> \n<p>The generated Express application starts off with four folders.</p> \n<h3 id=\"bin\"><code>bin</code></h3> \n<p>The <code>bin</code> folder contains the executable file that starts your app. It starts the server (on port 3000, if no alternative is supplied) and sets up some basic error handling. You don’t really need to worry about this file, because <code>npm start</code> will run it for you.</p> \n<h3 id=\"public\"><code>public</code></h3> \n<p>The <code>public</code> folder is one of the important ones: ​<em>everything​</em> in this folder is accessible to people connecting to your application. In this folder, you’ll put JavaScript, CSS, images, and other assets that people need when they load your website.</p> \n<h3 id=\"routes\"><code>routes</code></h3> \n<p>The <code>routes</code> folder is where you’ll put your router files. The generator creates two files, <code>index.js</code> and <code>users.js</code>, which serve as examples of how to separate out your application’s route configuration.</p> \n<p>Usually, you’ll have a different file here for each major route on your website. So you might have files called <code>blog.js</code>, <code>home.js</code>, and/or <code>about.js</code> in this folder.</p> \n<h3 id=\"views\"><code>views</code></h3> \n<p>The <code>views</code> folder is where you have the files used by your templating engine. The generator will configure Express to look in here for a matching view when you call the <code>render</code> method.</p> \n<p>Outside of these folders, there’s one file that you should know well.</p> \n<h2 id=\"appjs\"><code>app.js</code></h2> \n<p>The <code>app.js</code> file is special, because it sets up your Express application and glues all of the different parts together. Let’s walk through what it does. Here’s how the file starts:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">var createError = require('http-errors');\nvar express = require('express');\nvar path = require('path');\nvar cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');\nvar logger = require('morgan');\n</code></pre> \n<p>These first six lines of the file are required. If you’re new to Node, be sure to read “<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/understanding-module-exports-exports-node-js/\">Understanding module.exports and exports in Node.js</a>”.</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">var indexRouter = require('./routes/index');\nvar usersRouter = require('./routes/users');\n</code></pre> \n<p>The next two lines of code <code>require</code> the different route files that the Express generator sets up by default: <code>routes</code> and <code>users</code>.</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">var app = express();\n</code></pre> \n<p>After that, we create a new app by calling <code>express()</code>. The app variable contains all of the settings and routes for your application. This object glues together your application.</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">app.set('views', path.join(__dirname, 'views'));\napp.set('view engine', 'jade');\n</code></pre> \n<p>Once the app instance is created, the templating engine is set up for rendering views. This is where you’d change the path to your view files if necessary.</p> \n<p>After this, you’ll see Express being configured to use middleware. The generator installs several common pieces of middleware that you’re likely to use in a web application:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">app.use(logger('dev'));\napp.use(express.json());\napp.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }));\napp.use(cookieParser());\napp.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));\n</code></pre> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>logger</strong>. When you run your app, you might notice that all the routes that are requested are logged to the console. If you want to disable this, you can just comment out this middleware.</li> \n <li><strong>express.json</strong>. You might notice that there are two lines for parsing the body of incoming HTTP requests.

It’s built on the <a href=\"https://v8.dev/\">V8 JavaScript runtime</a> and written in C++ — so it’s fast. Originally, it was intended as a server environment for applications, but developers started using it to create tools to aid them in local task automation. Since then, a whole new ecosystem of Node-based tools (such as <a href=\"http://gruntjs.com/\">Grunt</a>, <a href=\"http://gulpjs.com/\">Gulp</a> and <a href=\"https://webpack.js.org\">webpack</a>) has evolved to transform the face of front-end development.</strong></p> \n<p>To make use of these tools (or packages) in Node.js, we need to be able to install and manage them in a useful way. This is where npm, the Node package manager, comes in. It installs the packages you want to use and provides a useful interface to work with them.</p> \n<p>In this guide, we’re going to look at the basics of working with npm. We’ll show you how to install packages in local and global mode, as well as delete, update and install a certain version of a package. We’ll also show you how to work with <code>package.json</code> to manage a project’s dependencies.

Let’s do that now.</p> \n<h2 id=\"installingnodejs\">Installing Node.js</h2> \n<p>Head to the Node.js <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/download/\">download page</a> and grab the version you need. There are Windows and Mac installers available, as well as pre-compiled Linux binaries and source code. For Linux, you can also install Node via the package manager, <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/\">as outlined here</a>.</p> \n<p>For this tutorial, we’re going to use v12.15.0. At the time of writing, this is the current <a href=\"https://github.com/nodejs/Release#release-schedule\">Long Term Support (LTS) version of Node</a>.</p> \n<p><em>Tip: You might also consider <a href=\"http://sitepoint.com/quick-tip-multiple-versions-node-nvm\">installing Node using a version manager</a>. This negates the permissions issue raised in the next section.</em></p> \n<p>Let’s see where node was installed and check the version:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">$ which node\n/usr/bin/node\n$ node --version\nv12.15.0\n</code></pre> \n<p>To verify that your installation was successful, let’s give Node’s REPL a try:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">$ node\n&gt; console.log('Node is running');\nNode is running\n&gt; .help\n.break    Sometimes you get stuck, this gets you out\n.clear    Alias for .break\n.editor   Enter editor mode\n.exit     Exit the repl\n.help     Print this help message\n.load     Load JS from a file into the REPL session\n.save     Save all evaluated commands in this REPL session to a file\n\nPress ^C to abort current expression, ^D to exit the repl\n</code></pre> \n<p>The Node.js installation worked, so we can now focus our attention on npm, which was included in the install:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">$ which npm\n/usr/bin/npm\n$ npm --version\n6.13.7\n</code></pre> \n<h2 id=\"updatingnpm\">Updating npm</h2> \n<p>npm, which originally stood for Node Package Manager, is a separate project from Node.js. It tends to be updated more frequently. You can check the latest available npm version on this <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm\">page</a>. If you realize you have an older version, you can update as follows.</p> \n<p>For Linux and Mac users, use the following command:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npm install -g npm@latest\n</code></pre> \n<p>For Windows users, the process might be slightly more complicated. This is what it says on the <a href=\"https://github.com/npm/cli/#windows-install-or-upgrade\">project’s home page</a>:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>Many improvements for Windows users have been made in npm 3 – you will have a better experience if you run a recent version of npm. To upgrade, either use <a href=\"https://github.com/felixrieseberg/npm-windows-upgrade\">Microsoft’s upgrade tool</a>, <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/download/\">download a new version of Node</a>, or follow the Windows upgrade instructions in the <a href=\"https://npm.community/t/installing-upgrading-npm/251/2\">Installing/upgrading npm</a> post.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>For most users, the upgrade tool will be the best bet. To use it, you’ll need to open PowerShell as administrator and execute the following command:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser -Force\n</code></pre> \n<p>This will ensure you can execute scripts on your system. Next, you’ll need to install the <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-windows-upgrade\">npm-windows-upgrade</a> tool. After you’ve installed the tool, you need to run it so that it can update npm for you. Do all this within the elevated PowerShell console:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npm install --global --production npm-windows-upgrade\nnpm-windows-upgrade --npm-version latest\n</code></pre> \n<h2 id=\"nodepackagedmodules\">Node Packaged Modules</h2> \n<p>npm can install packages in local or global mode. In local mode, it installs the package in a <code>node_modules</code> folder in your parent working directory. This location is owned by the current user.</p> \n<p>If you’re not using a <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/quick-tip-multiple-versions-node-nvm/\">version manager</a> (which you probably should be), global packages are installed in <code>{prefix}/lib/node_modules/</code>, which is owned by root (where <code>{prefix}</code> is usually <code>/usr/</code> or <code>/usr/local</code>). This means you would have to use <code>sudo</code> to install packages globally, which could cause permission errors when resolving third-party dependencies, as well as being a security concern.</p> \n<p>Let’s change that!</p> \n<figure> \n <img src=\"https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/1426064914package_manager-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"Parcel delivery company\" />\n <figcaption \"=\"\">\n  Time to manage those packages\n </figcaption>\n</figure> \n<h2 id=\"changingthelocationofglobalpackages\">Changing the Location of Global Packages</h2> \n<p>Let’s see what output <code>npm config</code> gives us:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">$ npm config list\n; cli configs\nmetrics-registry = \"https://registry.npmjs.org/\"\nscope = \"\"\nuser-agent = \"npm/6.13.7 node/v12.15.0 linux x64\"\n\n; node bin location = /usr/bin/nodejs\n; cwd = /home/sitepoint\n; HOME = /home/sitepoint\n; \"npm config ls -l\" to show all defaults.\n</code></pre> \n<p>This gives us information about our install. For now, it’s important to get the current global location:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">$ npm config get prefix\n/usr\n</code></pre> \n<p>This is the prefix we want to change, in order to install global packages in our home directory. To do that create a new directory in your home folder:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">$ cd ~ &amp;&amp; mkdir .node_modules_global\n$ npm config set prefix=$HOME/.node_modules_global\n</code></pre> \n<p>With this simple configuration change, we’ve altered the location to which global Node packages are installed. This also creates a <code>.npmrc</code> file in our home directory:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">$ npm config get prefix\n/home/sitepoint/.node_modules_global\n$ cat .npmrc\nprefix=/home/sitepoint/.node_modules_global\n</code></pre> \n<p>We still have npm installed in a location owned by root. But because we changed our global package location, we can take advantage of that. We need to install npm again, but this time in the new, user-owned location. This will also install the latest version of npm:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">npm install npm@latest -g\n</code></pre> \n<p>Finally, we need to add <code>.node_modules_global/bin</code> to our <code>$PATH</code> environment variable, so that we can run global packages from the command line. Do this by appending the following line to your <code>.profile</code>, <code>.bash_profile</code>or <code>.bashrc</code> and restarting your terminal:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">export PATH=\"$HOME/.node_modules_global/bin:$PATH\"\n</code></pre> \n<p>Now our <code>.node_modules_global/bin</code> will be found first and the correct version of npm will be used:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">$ which npm\n/home/sitepoint/.node_modules_global/bin/npm\n$ npm --version\n6.13.7\n</code></pre> \n<p><em>Tip: you can avoid all of this if you use a Node version manager. Check out this tutorial to find out how: <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/quick-tip-multiple-versions-node-nvm/\">Installing Multiple Versions of Node.js Using nvm</a>.</em></p> \n<h2 id=\"installingpackagesinglobalmode\">Installing Packages in Global Mode</h2> \n<p>At the moment, we only have one package installed globally — the npm package itself. So let’s change that and install <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/uglify-js\">UglifyJS</a> (a JavaScript minification tool). We use the <code>--global</code> flag, but this can be abbreviated to <code>-g</code>:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">$ npm install uglify-js --global\n/home/sitepoint/.node_modules_global/bin/uglifyjs -&gt; /home/sitepoint/.node_modules_global/lib/node_modules/uglify-js/bin/uglifyjs\n+ uglify-js@3.7.7\nadded 3 packages from 38 contributors in 0.259s\n</code></pre> \n<p>As you can see from the output, additional packages are installed. These are UglifyJS’s dependencies.</p> \n<h2 id=\"listingglobalpackages\">Listing Global Packages</h2> \n<p>We can list the global packages we’ve installed with the <code>npm list</code> command:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">$ npm list --global\nhome/sitepoint/.node_modules_global/lib\n├─┬ npm@6.9.0\n│ ├── abbrev@1.1.1\n│ ├── ansicolors@0.3.2\n│ ├── ansistyles@0.1.3\n│ ├── aproba@2.0.0\n│ ├── archy@1.0.0\n....................\n└─┬ uglify-js@3.5.3\n  ├── commander@2.19.0\n  └── source-map@0.6.1\n</code></pre> \n<p>The output, however, is rather verbose. We can change that with the <code>--depth=0</code> option:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">$ npm list -g --depth=0\n/home/sitepoint/.node_modules_global/lib\n├── npm@6.13.7\n└── uglify-js@3.7.7\n</code></pre> \n<p>That’s better; now we see just the packages we’ve installed along with their version numbers.</p> \n<p>Any packages installed globally will become available from the command line. For example, here’s how you would use the Uglify package to minify <code>example.js</code> into <code>example.min.js</code>:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">$ uglifyjs example.js -o example.min.js\n</code></pre> \n<h2 id=\"installingpackagesinlocalmode\">Installing Packages in Local Mode</h2> \n<p>When you install packages locally, you normally do so using a <code>package.json</code> file. Let’s go ahead and create one:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">$ mkdir project &amp;&amp; cd project\n\n$ npm init\npackage name: (project)\nversion: (1.0.0)\ndescription: Demo of package.json\nentry point: (index.js)\ntest command:\ngit repository:\nkeywords:\nauthor:\nlicense: (ISC)\n</code></pre> \n<p>Press <kbd>Return</kbd> to accept the defaults, then press it again to confirm your choices. This will create a <code>package.json</code> file at the root of the project:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">{\n  \"name\": \"project\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"description\": \"\",\n  \"main\": \"index.js\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test\": \"echo \\\"Error: no test specified\\\" &amp;&amp; exit 1\"\n  },\n  \"author\": \"\",\n  \"license\": \"ISC\"\n}\n</code></pre> \n<p><em>Tip: If you want a quicker way to generate a <code>package.json</code> file use <code>npm init --y</code>.</em></p> \n<p>The fields are hopefully pretty self-explanatory, with the exception of <code>main</code> and <code>scripts</code>. The <code>main</code> field is the primary entry point to your program, and the <code>scripts</code> field lets you specify script commands that are run at various times in the life cycle of your package. We can leave these as they are for now, but if you’d like to find out more, see the <a href=\"https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json\">package.json documentation on npm</a> and this article on <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/guide-to-npm-as-a-build-tool/\">using npm as a build tool</a>.</p> \n<p>Now let’s try and install <a href=\"http://underscorejs.org/\">Underscore</a>:</p> \n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">$ npm install underscore\nnpm notice created a lockfile as package-lock.json.
