Now that staff is relegated to their homes, the corporate sector is scrambling to woo their teams from a distance.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=427458\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-427458\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-427458\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/08/Parcel-catering-pinch-food-design-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"810\" height=\"810\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/08/Parcel-catering-pinch-food-design-3.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/08/Parcel-catering-pinch-food-design-3-800x800.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/08/Parcel-catering-pinch-food-design-3-100x100.jpg 100w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/08/Parcel-catering-pinch-food-design-3-768x768.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/08/Parcel-catering-pinch-food-design-3-300x300.jpg 300w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/08/Parcel-catering-pinch-food-design-3-500x500.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p> \n<p>Similarly, non-profits have found value in Parcel as a replacement for the opulent galas and fundraisers they were accustomed to hosting in a pre-face mask world. Where they would once invite 1500 donors to dress in black tie and toast to monies raised, the pivot to offering “guests” a uniquely memorable catering experience in their homes is the only way to maintain a steep price-tag per ticket.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=427459\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-427459\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-427459\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/08/Parcel-catering-pinch-food-design-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"810\" height=\"963\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/08/Parcel-catering-pinch-food-design-4.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/08/Parcel-catering-pinch-food-design-4-800x951.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/08/Parcel-catering-pinch-food-design-4-768x913.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/08/Parcel-catering-pinch-food-design-4-500x594.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=427460\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-427460\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-427460\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/08/Parcel-catering-pinch-food-design-5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"810\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/08/Parcel-catering-pinch-food-design-5.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/08/Parcel-catering-pinch-food-design-5-800x790.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/08/Parcel-catering-pinch-food-design-5-100x100.jpg 100w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/08/Parcel-catering-pinch-food-design-5-768x759.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/08/Parcel-catering-pinch-food-design-5-500x494.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=427461\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-427461\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-427461\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/08/Parcel-catering-pinch-food-design-6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"810\" height=\"810\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/08/Parcel-catering-pinch-food-design-6.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/08/Parcel-catering-pinch-food-design-6-800x800.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/08/Parcel-catering-pinch-food-design-6-100x100.jpg 100w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/08/Parcel-catering-pinch-food-design-6-768x768.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/08/Parcel-catering-pinch-food-design-6-300x300.jpg 300w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/08/Parcel-catering-pinch-food-design-6-500x500.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p> \n<p>Parcel is available now.

The hookah remains popular today, especially across the Levant, where smoking from the water pipe is enjoyed as a relaxing and recreational social activity. The Stündenglass – “hourglass” in German – on the other hand looks only distantly like its traditional counterpart.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=426471\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-426471\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-426471\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/08/Stundenglass_v2_NoBG_LowAngle_2-810x810.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"810\" height=\"810\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/08/Stundenglass_v2_NoBG_LowAngle_2-810x810.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/08/Stundenglass_v2_NoBG_LowAngle_2-800x800.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/08/Stundenglass_v2_NoBG_LowAngle_2-100x100.jpg 100w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/08/Stundenglass_v2_NoBG_LowAngle_2-768x768.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/08/Stundenglass_v2_NoBG_LowAngle_2-300x300.jpg 300w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/08/Stundenglass_v2_NoBG_LowAngle_2-500x500.jpg 500w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/08/Stundenglass_v2_NoBG_LowAngle_2.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p>\n<blockquote><p>We drew influences from the silhouette of the hourglass and its dependability&#8230;a design style that blends traditional Middle Eastern hookah’s style with contemporary elegance and innovation.</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>&#8211; Michael Trzecieski, Design Director Stündenglass</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=426481\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-426481\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-426481\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/08/studenglass-kinetic-motion-lean-810x456.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"810\" height=\"456\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/08/studenglass-kinetic-motion-lean-810x456.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/08/studenglass-kinetic-motion-lean-800x450.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/08/studenglass-kinetic-motion-lean-768x432.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/08/studenglass-kinetic-motion-lean-500x281.jpg 500w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/08/studenglass-kinetic-motion-lean.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p>\n<p>The Stündenglass may look complex, but its actually a fairly simple design to set up and operate. Using a pair of borosilicate glass globes screwed vertically into place onto a black anodized metal base using an aluminum hookah bowl kit or a glass bowl, users fill one globe with water before lighting up their main ingredient. The hourglass design works gravitationally, forcing vapor out and through the water into a contact-less mouthpiece via the pressurized airflow action as water transfers from one glass bowl to another. The Stündenglass operates with technical, rather than technological, action.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jr0YH-7ykz4\" width=\"810\" height=\"456\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">﻿</span></iframe></p>\n<p>The smoke produced can be inhaled using a hose attachment reminiscent of the traditional hookah, or apropos of these days, using a contact-less stem attachment. The $499 Stündenglass also offers the option to add and connect a <a href=\"https://www.gpen.com/products/g-pen-connect-vaporizer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Grenco G Pen vaporizer</a> using a male adapter, inviting the ability to enjoy cannabis concentrates in lieu of flower or flavored tobacco. But it&#8217;s more likely those drawn to the novelty of using a gravity pipe will prefer keeping their setup simple, especially considering the relative ease of the fire up and flip action the Stündenglass delivers.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=426472\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-426472\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-426472\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/08/Stundenglass_v2_NoBG_MidAngle_2-810x810.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"810\" height=\"810\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/08/Stundenglass_v2_NoBG_MidAngle_2-810x810.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/08/Stundenglass_v2_NoBG_MidAngle_2-800x800.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/08/Stundenglass_v2_NoBG_MidAngle_2-100x100.jpg 100w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/08/Stundenglass_v2_NoBG_MidAngle_2-768x768.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/08/Stundenglass_v2_NoBG_MidAngle_2-300x300.jpg 300w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/08/Stundenglass_v2_NoBG_MidAngle_2-500x500.jpg 500w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/08/Stundenglass_v2_NoBG_MidAngle_2.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Huston and Stündenglass Design Director Michael Trzecieski both note a great level of attention was placed not only upon the water pipe&#8217;s function, but also the presentation of its finely machined form. And indeed, the dual chamber design presents a rather striking presence even when not in use, a futuristic object that seemingly wouldn&#8217;t look out of place in a laboratory. The design erases all memories of college-era bongs with the likeness of a luxurious object imparted with the look, feel, and branding associated with an expensive piece of technology.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=426473\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-426473\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-426473\" src=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/08/studenglass-kinetic-motion-2-810x1022.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"810\" height=\"1022\" srcset=\"https://design-milk.com/images/2020/08/studenglass-kinetic-motion-2-810x1022.jpg 810w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/08/studenglass-kinetic-motion-2-800x1009.jpg 800w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/08/studenglass-kinetic-motion-2-768x969.jpg 768w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/08/studenglass-kinetic-motion-2-500x631.jpg 500w, https://design-milk.com/images/2020/08/studenglass-kinetic-motion-2.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" /></a></p>\n<p>With the pandemic putting a temporary stop to the usual &#8220;smoke and pass it along&#8221; socializing enjoyed with the cannabis culture, Stündenglass hopes to appeal to users seeking a modern day means for enjoying a contact-less high with others tinged with a modicum of old world vibe.
