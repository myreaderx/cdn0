In recent years, <strong>the Gig Economy</strong> has taken over. Startups like Uber, Airbnb, Instacart, and others have been able to find product/market fit and scale their businesses.</p>\n<p>But what&#8217;s the next? The essay below argues: &#8220;<strong>The Passion Economy</strong>.&#8221; And my a16z colleague Li Jin unpacks this idea more thoroughly.</p>\n<p>(And quick plug, if you want to read more essays like this — this article was originally posted on a16z.com and you can<strong> <a href=\"https://pages.a16z.com/Email?utm_source=Chen&#38;utm_medium=referral&#38;utm_campaign=passion_economy\">subscribe to the newsletter here</a></strong>)</p>\n<p>The Passion Economy theme unifies a number of themes that we at a16z have been working on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Reinventing the service economy</strong>. We&#8217;ve written about this <a href=\"https://andrewchen.co/how-marketplaces-will-reinvent-the-service-economy/\">here</a>. There will be many new software platforms that allow creators/influencers/service providers to work on what they love and earn income from that work</li>\n<li><strong>Easy-to-use tools</strong>. Within the platform, there are deep SaaS tools that help people in the Passion Economy actually do their work &#8212; particularly key when the work is purely digital in nature, like video streaming or audio broadcasting</li>\n<li><strong>Massive distribution</strong>. People need to get found &#8212; both by their customers and their audience &#8212; and we now can plug into platforms with billions of consumers. Platforms will need to provide marketplace-like features that lean transactional, or more like an ongoing subscription relationship</li>\n<li><strong>Pragmatic education/training</strong>. College aren&#8217;t built to teach the skills for the Passion Economy, and people will instead turn to online schools/programs/training for lifelong learning in the ever-changing ecosystem</li>\n<li><strong>Every startup is a Fintech</strong>. Fintech services that help facilitate both business and personal needs &#8212; whether that&#8217;s creative financing options, solopreneur banking services, or working capital</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If this resonates, it&#8217;s because this is a list of the massive trends that are reinventing the way we work. As a society, we are right in the thick of this movement &#8212; but it&#8217;s helpful to give it a distinct name, although you might argue startups like Udemy, Patreon, Shopify, Substack, and many others have already been blazing this path.</p>\n<p>I love this trend as someone who has worked deeply both in the passion economy &#8212; writing this blog combined with investing/advising startups &#8212; and also in a more traditional role in the gig economy at Uber. We&#8217;re seeing a lot of activity across the entire market and it feels like a meaningful addition to add both opportunities for Gig Economy and the Passion Economy together.</p>\n<p>Thanks,<br />\nAndrew</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h1 class=\"entry-header__title\">The Passion Economy and the Future of Work, by Li Jin</h1>\n<p>The top-earning writer on the paid newsletter platform Substack earns more than $500,000 a year from reader subscriptions. The top content creator on Podia, a platform for video courses and digital memberships, makes more than $100,000 a month. And teachers across the US are bringing in thousands of dollars a month teaching live, virtual classes on Outschool and Juni Learning.</p>\n<p>These stories are indicative of a larger trend: call it the “creator stack” or the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ljin18/status/1169753411639640064\">“enterprization of consumer.”</a> Whereas previously, the biggest online labor marketplaces flattened the individuality of workers, new platforms allow anyone to monetize unique skills. Gig work isn’t going anywhere—but there are now more ways to capitalize on creativity. Users can now build audiences at scale and turn their passions into livelihoods, whether that’s playing video games or producing video content. This has huge implications for entrepreneurship and what we’ll think of as a “job” in the future.</p>\n<h2>The Evolution of The Passion Economy</h2>\n<p>In the past decade, on-demand marketplaces in the <a href=\"https://andrewchen.co/how-marketplaces-will-reinvent-the-service-economy/\">“Uber for X” era</a> established turnkey ways for people to make money. Workers could easily monetize their time in specific, narrow services like food delivery, parking, or transportation. These marketplaces automated the matching of supply and demand, as well as pricing, to enhance liquidity. The platforms were convenient for both the user and the provider: since they took care of traditional business hurdles like customer acquisition and pricing, they allowed the worker to focus solely on the service rendered.</p>\n<p>But though these platforms provided a path to self-employment for millions of people, they also homogenized the variety between service workers, prioritizing consistency and efficiency. While the promise was “Be your own boss,” the work was often one-dimensional.</p>\n<h2>Monetizing Individuality</h2>\n<p>New digital platforms enable people to earn a livelihood in a way that highlights their individuality. These platforms give providers greater ability to build customer relationships, increased support in growing their businesses, and better tools for differentiating themselves from the competition. In the process, they’re fueling a new model of internet-powered entrepreneurship.</p>\n<p>It’s akin to the dynamic between Amazon—the standardized, mass-produced monolith—and the indie-focused Shopify, which allows users to form direct relationships with customers. That shift is already evident in marketplaces for physical products; it’s now extending into services.</p>\n<p>These new platforms share a few commonalities:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>They’re accessible to everyone, not only existing businesses and professionals</li>\n<li>They view individuality as a feature, not a bug</li>\n<li>They focus on digital products and virtual services</li>\n<li>They provide holistic tools to grow and operate a business</li>\n<li>They open doors to new forms of work</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4707\" src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/190434-AH-Economy-Charts-FINAL-ART-Economy.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"660\" srcset=\"http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/190434-AH-Economy-Charts-FINAL-ART-Economy.jpg 881w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/190434-AH-Economy-Charts-FINAL-ART-Economy-273x300.jpg 273w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/190434-AH-Economy-Charts-FINAL-ART-Economy-768x845.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p>\n<h4><b>1. They’re accessible to everyone, not only existing businesses and professionals</b></h4>\n<p>New consumer products are making it easy for anyone to become an entrepreneur. In the mid-2010s, the rise of the influencer industry allowed top-tier creators to monetize through advertising. These platforms expanded to support a broader range of money-making activities, from manufacturing physical products (e.g. Vybes, Hipdot, Genflow) to creating personalized videos (Cameo, VIPVR, Celeb VM).</p>\n<p>Now the ability to make a living off creative skills has trickled down to individuals at scale, helping everyday people to launch and grow businesses. Previously, only established businesses could access software engineering talent to build websites or apps; now, no-code website and app builders like Webflow and Glide have democratized that ability. Startups are also building mobile-first, lightweight versions of incumbent desktop software: Kapwing, for instance, is a web and mobile editor for videos, GIFs, and images that aims to displace legacy creative software.</p>\n<p>Companies have the opportunity to engage entrepreneurs in the early stages, then capture economic value as they grow. They might start with a <a href=\"http://cdixon.org/2010/01/03/the-next-big-thing-will-start-out-looking-like-a-toy/\">very basic offering</a> and add product capabilities as their customers earn revenue and develop new needs.</p>\n<p><strong>2. They view individuality as a feature, not a bug</strong></p>\n<p>Whereas previous services marketplaces were rigidly built for standardized jobs, new platforms highlight variation among workers in categories that can benefit from more diversity in user choice.</p>\n<p>Take Outschool, an online marketplace for live video classes in which teachers are predominantly former school teachers and stay-at-home parents. On the platform, instructors can develop their own curricula or browse lists of courses requested by users. Beyond the subject matter, the marketplace’s UI emphasizes each teacher’s background, experience, and self-description. Parents and students can message instructors directly.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4708\" src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Outschool-teacher-1024x699.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"410\" srcset=\"http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Outschool-teacher-1024x699.jpg 1024w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Outschool-teacher-300x205.jpg 300w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Outschool-teacher-768x524.jpg 768w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Outschool-teacher.jpg 1972w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p>\n<p><em>Above: Outschool lets teachers sign up to teach engaging video sessions to kids</em></p>\n<p>For new platforms, this model can pose a sizeable risk: once consumers are able to work directly with a preferred provider on an ongoing basis, they may take that relationship offline. Marketplaces can combat disintermediation by offering workflow tools, like scheduling and invoicing, and by building in additional incentives that make it worthwhile for providers and users to remain on-platform. Marketplaces that cultivate these direct relationships can also succeed by focusing on areas—like education and tutoring—in which consumers might have repeated matching needs with a variety of different providers over time.</p>\n<p><strong>3. They focus on digital products and virtual services</strong></p>\n<p>Whereas past generations of entrepreneurship-enabling platforms typically focused on selling physical products (e.g. Amazon, Etsy, Ebay, Shopify) or in-person services (e.g. Taskrabbit, Care.com, Uber), new creator platforms are focused on digital products. A platform built specifically for packaging and selling digital products looks different than a platform that is built for tangible goods.</p>\n<p>Podia, Teachable, and Thinkific are all SaaS platforms that allow creators to make and sell video courses and digital memberships. Previously, these types of “knowledge influencers” had to either conduct classes in-person (restricting them to local customers); jerry-rig platforms meant for physical products, like Shopify; or customize sites like Wix and Squarespace. New platforms capitalize on the idea that expertise has economic value beyond a local, in-person audience.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4710\" src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Thinkific-1-1024x907.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"531\" srcset=\"http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Thinkific-1-1024x907.jpg 1024w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Thinkific-1-300x266.jpg 300w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Thinkific-1-768x680.jpg 768w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Thinkific-1.jpg 1127w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p>\n<p><em>Above: Thinkific lets you create, market, and sell online courses</em></p>\n<p>On the interior design marketplace Havenly, designers work remotely and interact with clients entirely online. For designers, the benefit is a steady stream of clients without the heavy lifting—since Havenly takes care of marketing—and the flexibility to work whenever, wherever. For clients, the benefit is access to a service that would otherwise be expensive or inaccessible.</p>\n<p><strong>4. They provide holistic tools to grow and operate a business</strong></p>\n<p>Unlike discovery-focused marketplaces, which monetize through advertising, membership fees, or cost-per-lead, new platforms in the creator stack are often monetized through SaaS fees that increase as customers grow. Others take a percentage of the creator’s earnings. This means that platforms are incentivized to help creators succeed and grow, rather than driving discrete, one-time transactions.</p>\n<p>Some platforms offer marketing tools like custom landing pages, coupons, and affiliate programs. Others provide behind-the-scenes support: Walden, for instance, connects new entrepreneurs with coaches for strategy and accountability.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, support may be bundled into platforms that help providers start a business. For instance, Prenda—a managed marketplace of K-8 microschools—provides teachers (called Guides) with curricula, computers, software, supplies, and assistance in navigating the necessary regulatory requirements and insurance.</p>\n<p><strong>5. They open doors to new forms of work entirely</strong></p>\n<p>New digital platforms enable forms of work we’ve never seen before:</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4709\" src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/190434-AH-Economy-Charts-FINAL-ART-Creators-1024x578.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"339\" srcset=\"http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/190434-AH-Economy-Charts-FINAL-ART-Creators-1024x578.jpg 1024w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/190434-AH-Economy-Charts-FINAL-ART-Creators-300x169.jpg 300w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/190434-AH-Economy-Charts-FINAL-ART-Creators-768x433.jpg 768w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/190434-AH-Economy-Charts-FINAL-ART-Creators.jpg 1894w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p>\n<p>For a more extensive model of how human capital can give rise to new industries, look to China. On the microblogging site <a href=\"https://twitter.com/conniechan/status/1105642887931355136\">Weibo</a>, for instance, users sell content such as Q&#38;As, exclusive chat groups, and invite-only live streams through memberships or a la carte purchases. This has spawned a wave of non-traditional influencers—financial advisors, bloggers, and professors—beyond typical beauty and fashion tastemakers.</p>\n<h2>Factors to consider: Marketplaces vs. SaaS</h2>\n<p>When building a company in this space, it’s important to consider the needs of the creators you’re targeting, as well as their desired audience. There are tradeoffs between marketplaces and SaaS platforms. What’s the difference?</p>\n<p>Marketplaces are entirely plug and play, meaning providers can sign up and start earning revenue with minimal set-up. The strength of a marketplace’s two-sided network effect is directly correlated to the value it provides as an intermediary between supply and demand. One example of this model is Medium, which charges readers a subscription fee to access stories across the entire platform. The amount of money a writer makes is proportionate to the amount of time readers spend engaging with their stories.</p>\n<p>By contrast, SaaS platforms require creators to work independently to acquire customers. Such platforms might help with distribution—providing tools for marketing, managing customer relationships, and attribution—but users are largely responsible for growing their own businesses. On Substack, for example, features include a writer homepage, mailing list, payments, analytics, and a variety of different subscription offerings. Substack collects a portion of the creator’s subscription revenue.</p>\n<p>In the marketplace model, writers count on Medium to drive reader traffic and subscriptions. On the SaaS platform (Substack), writers drive their own direct traffic and subscriptions; they can export their subscriber list at any time.</p>\n<p>Marketplaces bring value for creators looking to be discovered and attract customers over time. SaaS tools often make sense for more established creators who already have a customer base. In response to this dynamic, many startups are building SaaS platforms that aim to poach large creators from existing marketplaces.</p>\n<h3>Looking Ahead</h3>\n<p>New integrated platforms empower entrepreneurs to monetize individuality and creativity. In the coming years, the passion economy will to continue to grow. We envision a future in which the value of unique skills and knowledge can be unlocked, augmented, and surfaced to consumers.</p>\n<p>If you’re building a company in this space, we’d love to chat!</p>\n<p>This was <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2019/10/08/passion-economy/\">originally posted to the a16z blog</a>, which you can <strong><a href=\"https://pages.a16z.com/Email?utm_source=Chen&#38;utm_medium=referral&#38;utm_campaign=passion_economy\">subscribe to here</a></strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://andrewchen.co/passion-economy/\">The Passion Economy (Guest essay by Li Jin)</a> is also published on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://andrewchen.co\">andrewchen</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 04 Nov 2019 16:00:42 +0000","feedId":83,"bgimg":"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/190434-AH-Economy-Charts-FINAL-ART-Economy.jpg","linkMd5":"54066c2c758738d6b8811617dfd9da79","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn91@2020_5/2020-07-24/1595596428194_11ce9a46d2b333f4.webp","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/190434-AH-Economy-Charts-FINAL-ART-Economy.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn91@2020_5/2020-07-24/1595596428194_11ce9a46d2b333f4.webp","http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Outschool-teacher-1024x699.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn47@2020_6/2020-07-24/1595596439213_d83e80cb93fc07fa.webp","http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Thinkific-1-1024x907.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn11@2020_5/2020-07-24/1595596443497_677d18c334597e96.webp","http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/190434-AH-Economy-Charts-FINAL-ART-Creators-1024x578.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn7@2020_3/2020-07-24/1595596438704_6ecc132a8b158124.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-07-24 21:13:38","updatedTime":"2020-07-24 13:13:38","title":"Announcing Pietra and a16z — my first ex-Uber investment!","link":"http://andrewchen.co/?p=4617","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4618\" src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pietra_logo.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"216\" srcset=\"http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pietra_logo.png 982w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pietra_logo-300x108.png 300w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pietra_logo-768x277.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p>\n<p>Dear readers,</p>\n<p>Many of you may have read the recent New York Times article &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/technology/silicon-valley-network-mafias.html\">Uber and Airbnb Alumni Fuel Tech’s Next Wave</a>&#8221; which is about how alumni of successful startups often split off and start new companies, and how ecosystems of investors/advisors form around these new companies to support them. In the NYT article, I mention that a16z has invested in 2 ex-Uber teams, and today, I&#8217;m excited to announce the first one &#8212; Pietra &#8212; a new startup building a marketplace for the jewelry industry.</p>\n<p>In the announcement, I talk both about Pietra, and Ro/Pan and the team and also about the characteristics of ex-Uber alumni that make me excited to invest in them: 1) the ceo mentality of ops teams and &#8220;programs and platforms.&#8221; 2) unique expertise with marketplaces and network effects, and 3) deep scaling and technology infra.</p>\n<p>I included the entire Pietra announcement below, which was originally published on the <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2019/03/27/marketplaces-network-effects-next-startup-talent-pietra/\">a16z blog here</a>.</p>\n<p>Thanks!<br />\nAndrew</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p class=\"entry-header__title\"><strong>Marketplaces, Pietra, and the Network Effects of Next Startup Talent</strong></p>\n<div class=\"entry-content__post-body wp-content\">\n<p>One of my focus areas as an investor is marketplaces, because I’ve seen firsthand how they can transform an industry — especially when they also have network effects that can lead to huge scale and impact. And while marketplaces have been evolving into new areas for a while — including <u><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2018/11/27/services-marketplaces-service-economy-evolution-whats-next/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">services</a></u> — I especially love how marketplaces show up in interesting and sometimes unexpected places, places where technology has not gone before.</p>\n<p>One such area is jewelry (yes, jewelry!). Even though gemstones and jewelry have been at the center of art, commerce, and culture since the dawn of human civilization — going from stone jewelry created 40,000 years ago in Africa to the trade routes between East and West to Fifth Avenue in New York to the Instagram feed on your phone — the technology for discovering, designing, and purchasing jewelry online hasn’t evolved much at all. Yet jewelry is one of the categories that could benefit most from modern trends such as social media, mobile, and mass personalization. This is especially true for the incredible variety of artisans and boutique jewelry vendors out there who currently can’t access bigger markets, or the deep technology expertise and stacks of bigger players.</p>\n<p>That’s why I’m excited to announce Andreessen Horowitz’ seed investment in Pietra, a new startup focused on a <em>marketplace</em> for the jewelry and especially the diamonds industry. If you wanted to buy a diamond engagement ring, the process goes something like this: “Do you know where I can buy a diamond?” “I might know a guy.” That “guy” (more often a family business, an aggregator, or other player) then sells you a diamond with very little transparency into supply, pricing, or other things. That kind of exchange is ripe for technology to come in between and mediate things — not only efficiently connecting suppliers to buyers, but also expanding supply and demand for both sellers and buyers beyond local limits.</p>\n<p>Jewelry represents $200B+ of annual spend, but remains a highly fragmented and opaque market… it’s yet another way marketplace businesses can provide more transparency, variety, and even education for consumers. So <a href=\"http://www.hellopietra.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pietra</a> aims to fully modernize the jewelry buying experience across every touchpoint by offering beautiful, mobile-first product discovery; chat and collaboration tools to better engage, negotiate, and purchase jewelry; and vetted suppliers, along with curated product lines from boutique jewelers, influencers, and celebrities.</p>\n<p>The team comes with decades of deep expertise in fashion, luxury commerce, <em>and</em> marketplaces. Co-founders Ronak Trivedi and Pan Pan are two of my former colleagues from Uber, where they led key efforts on UberPOOL and grew it from a new product only available in San Francisco to a global product supporting hundreds of millions of trips per year and billions in gross bookings. That kind of scale matters in a market like this. In fact, many of the core marketplace lessons and mindsets from Uber — combined with the team’s experience in the jewelry industry, deep customer insights, and passion for design — led to their starting Pietra.</p>\n<p>I’m also personally very excited about the new wave of “network mafias” <u><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/technology/silicon-valley-network-mafias.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">coming</a></u> from people trained at Bay Area startups who go on to do new and different things, often borrowing from lessons learned in their previous startups. Classic examples include Paypal, and more recent examples include Square and others. For Uber alumni in particular — which I can personally speak to since I worked there for three years — there are three mindsets that are compelling to me and that I love seeing in startup founders are: (1) an entrepreneurial mindset that’s baked in at all levels; (2) specialized expertise that can transfer across industries; and (3) technical challenges coupled with networks of talent.</p>\n<p>Because rideshare grew city by city at Uber, it led to an entrepreneurial team structure where each city had a General Manager (GM) who served as the de facto CEO of the city, acting like a mini-startup in the context of the larger organization. Surge pricing and driver incentives were first manually implemented by local teams with SQL queries and spreadsheets, and only later widely implemented in code by the software teams at headquarters. When I first joined Uber, each product team was also set up to be full stack, without dependencies into other teams, allowing them to build fast and iterate quickly to solve challenges. This kind of mindset — everyone’s the CEO of their own mini-startup unit — is key to fast cycles of innovation.</p>\n<p>To make rideshare work as a global product, folks at Uber had to solve challenges in areas as diverse as Jakarta to Portland to ridesharing and food delivery. Whether it was solving the cold-start problem in a new market, or figuring out the best pricing and incentives, or growing network effects in a highly competitive market, those insights can be translated to new industries. Starting any new company requires founders to turn a series of insights into actions and products.</p>\n<p>To be clear, it’s not just marketplace expertise that’s important here — it’s also about solving deep technical challenges at scale in areas such as machine learning, data, infrastructure, mapping, automation, and much more.

I reach for my podcasts whenever I’m commuting, whenever I’m doing a long walk between offices, or if I’m doing random stuff around the house. No wonder the consumer investment team ended up digging into this trend by doing a market map report &#8212; the analysis led by Li Jin, Avery Segal and Bennett Carroccio, including work from myself, Connie Chan, and others.</p>\n<p>See below for a long-form analysis everything we’ve observed in the podcasting industry. It was <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2019/05/23/podcast-ecosystem-investing-2019/\">originally published on a16z.com</a>. There’s a lot to read here, but I wanted to highlight a couple of my takeaways and what I’m looking for now:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Podcasting is big, mainstream, but severely undermonetized &#8212; and some of the biggest opportunities in the podcasting space lay in pivoting the business model from ads into some kind of direct payment. I’m looking for startups that can change the game there.</li>\n<li>The bigger idea is actually “audio”, not specifically podcasting. And in fact, the combined revenue of Headspace and Calm are more than half of the entire podcasting market. Whoa! I’d be interested in other products that tap into the trends around AirPods, Alexa, voice assistants, etc., but may not directly sound like podcasting</li>\n<li>After this analysis, I’m looking for really differentiated verticals of audio. Meditation is one, but what about something that’s at a much higher price point? For example, something that’s very business-focused and can be put on a corporate credit card? It could create a strong advantage around paid marketing if a product has high subscription retention or ARPU, allowing them to make higher bids in the various ad networks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The report covers things in more detail at the end, but that’s the tldr; from an investment standpoint.</p>\n<p>The other quick plug I want to give &#8212; get a copy of the PDF version of the deck by joining the a16z newsletter:</p>\n<p><strong> <a href=\"https://pages.a16z.com/Podcasting-Ecosystem-Slides.html?utm_campaign=acpromo&#38;utm_medium=website&#38;utm_source=acweb&#38;utm_content=podcastlandscape\">Subscribe to the a16z newsletter here.</a></strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pages.a16z.com/Podcasting-Ecosystem-Slides.html?utm_campaign=acpromo&#38;utm_medium=website&#38;utm_source=acweb&#38;utm_content=podcastlandscape\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4629\" src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Ad-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"599\" height=\"169\" srcset=\"http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Ad-3.jpg 886w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Ad-3-300x85.jpg 300w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Ad-3-768x217.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px\" /></a></p>\n<p>The a16z team uses the newsletter to circulate resources, including podcasts, op-eds, presentations, and more.

There are now over 700K free podcasts available and thousands more launching each week.</p>\n<p>As new tech platforms hit scale, we on the consumer team have been closely watching the future of media and the technology driving it — in all forms. We’re interested in investing in the next wave of consumer products and startups coming into the ecosystem, and that includes the audio ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Our investment philosophy is to not be too prescriptive, so we do the kind of “market map” overview below to help us have a “prepared mind” when we see new startups in the space. The below deck and commentary (with some sections redacted, of course) was presented to the extended consumer team, including general partners Connie Chan and Andrew Chen, who are investing in this space. If you’re working on anything interesting in this area, we’d love to hear from you!</p>\n<h3>From niche internet community to one-third of Americans</h3>\n<p>Over the course of the last 10 years, podcasts have steadily grown from a niche community of audiobloggers distributing files over the internet, to one-third of Americans now listening monthly and a quarter listening weekly.</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-4658\" src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF.jpg 960w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-300x169.jpg 300w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /><br />\n<em>Americans listening weekly to podcasts grew from 7% in 2013 to 22% in 2019. 65% of monthly podcast listeners have been listening for less than 3 years.</em></p>\n<p>People are already spending a lot of time on podcasts, and it’s growing: listeners are consuming 6+ hours per week and consuming more content every year.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4630\" src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-1.jpg 960w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-1-300x169.jpg 300w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-1-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p>\n<p><em>Among weekly podcast listeners, there’s high consumption: 7 episodes per week and nearly 1 hour per day.</em></p>\n<p>The demographic of podcast listeners is not your average American.

While podcasts differ widely in terms of content, format, production value, style, and length, they’re all distributed through RSS, or Really Simple Syndication, a standardized web feed format that is used to publish content. For podcasts, the RSS feed contains all the metadata, artwork, and content of a show.</p>\n<p>To listen to a podcast, a user adds the RSS feed to their podcast client (such as Apple Podcasts, Spotify, etc.), and the client then accesses this feed, checks for updates, and downloads any new files. Podcasts can be accessed from computers, mobile apps, or other media players. On the podcast creator side, creators host the RSS feed as well as the show’s content and media on a hosting provider, and submit the shows to various directories, such as Apple’s podcast directory.</p>\n<p>Podcast content is typically available for free, though creators can choose to set up private RSS feeds that require payment to access.</p>\n<p>Current headlines about podcasts today hail them as the next major content medium, describing them as “suddenly hot”, as the next battlefield for content, and as an “antidote” for our current news environment:</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4660\" src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/podcast_news-1024x956.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"560\" srcset=\"http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/podcast_news-1024x956.png 1024w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/podcast_news-300x280.png 300w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/podcast_news-768x717.png 768w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/podcast_news.png 1608w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p>\n<p>How did this “suddenly” happen? As with all tech trends, it had a longer and slower start before going more mainstream. Let’s time travel back 15 years ago, when there were no smartphones and the internet was accessed only through desktop computers.</p>\n<p>In February 2004, journalist Ben Hammersley wrote about the emergent behavior of automatically downloading audio content in a February <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/feb/12/broadcasting.digitalmedia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">article</a> in <em>The Guardian</em>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“MP3 players, like Apple’s iPod, in many pockets, audio production software cheap or free, and weblogging an established part of the internet; all the ingredients are there for a new boom in amateur radio. But what to call it? Audioblogging? Podcasting? GuerillaMedia?”</p></blockquote>\n<p>In doing so, Hammersley accidentally invented the term we still use today, “podcasting” — a portmanteau of “iPod” and “broadcast” — for this kind of content. The word was added to the Oxford English Library later that year.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4634\" src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-5.jpg 960w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-5-300x169.jpg 300w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-5-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p>\n<p>In 2005, podcasts were added to the iTunes store, with Steve Jobs saying, “Podcasting is the next generation of radio, and users can now subscribe to over 3,000 free Podcasts and have each new episode automatically delivered over the Internet to their computer and iPod.”</p>\n<p>In 2007, the first iPhone was introduced, but it wouldn’t be until 2012 that Apple created the Podcasts app. The release of this app is widely considered an inflection point for the industry, as it put podcasts a single tap away for hundreds of millions of users around the world. Ironically, a few months later, Google discontinued its own podcast app called Google Listen.</p>\n<p>In 2014, the first season of <i>Serial</i> aired, considered to be the first breakout podcast, with its narrative audio journalism drawing in 5M downloads in the first month.</p>\n<p>In the past 5 years, there’s been an explosion of listening behavior and innovative content. New devices made it easier to listen: Alexa launched in 2015, Google Home and AirPods in 2016. And an explosion of new content — ranging from daily news to narrative to talks shows — met the growing listener appetite. In tandem, ad spend has been growing steadily each year, from $69 to $220M in 2017 [<a href=\"https://ksmmedia.com/intel/tuning-in-to-podcasting/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">source</a>].</p>\n<h2>The app landscape</h2>\n<h3>Many apps for listening to podcasts, but little differentiation or loyalty</h3>\n<p>Apple Podcasts played a pivotal role in the development of the industry and remains the dominant app for listening. However, its market share has fallen in the last few years, from over 80% to 63%. The corollary to this stat is that historically, podcasting has been predominantly an iOS user behavior, given that Google didn’t have its own native application, something that changed last summer with the launch of Google Podcasts.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4635\" src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-6.jpg 960w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-6-300x169.jpg 300w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-6-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p>\n<p><em>Apple’s share of the podcasting market has slipped from over 80% to 63%, while Spotify has quickly grown to almost 10% of the market.</em></p>\n<p>Spotify — which has made a big push into podcasts in just the past couple years — now accounts for almost 10% of listening.</p>\n<p>Beyond these two large companies, there’s a long tail of listening apps from smaller companies. Most of these apps all have roughly the same content, given widely open directories of podcast RSS feeds. And there’s hundreds more listening apps out there. The barriers to entry for creating a new podcast app are quite low, since content is all distributed via RSS feeds and anyone can access them. There are also tools for creators to create their own podcast app from their own RSS feed.</p>\n<p>A note on comparing listening apps: metrics between apps are not entirely an apples-to-apple comparison, as some apps (like Apple Podcasts, Overcast, and Stitcher) auto-download shows that users subscribe to, whereas others (e.g. Spotify, Castbox) don’t continuously download new episodes. This affects comparisons between apps and may overstate the traction of listening apps that auto-download shows. The industry has not standardized around what defines a download or listen.</p>\n<h3>A taxonomy of consumer podcast apps</h3>\n<p>From our research, users seldom feel passionately — either positively or negatively — about the podcast app they’re using. This suggests that the audio content itself is the core element users are engaging with, and since the content is the same on all apps, users don’t feel particular affinity to any one listening app.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4636\" src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-7.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-7.jpg 960w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-7-300x169.jpg 300w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-7-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p>\n<p><em>Three major categories of consumer podcast listening apps: the incumbent, large existing audience and new podcast focus, and long tail listening apps.</em></p>\n<p>I categorized consumer podcast listening apps into three major categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The incumbent: Apple Podcasts</li>\n<li>Companies with large, existing audiences who are newly focusing on podcasts</li>\n<li>Long-tail listening apps</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The major feature of Apple Podcasts is that — despite its shortcomings in user-facing features and monetization — it’s pre-installed on all iPhones, making it a tap away for 900M people worldwide. We estimate that Apple Podcasts has 27M monthly active users in the U.S., based on App Annie, so a sizeable absolute number but relatively small compared to the total install base. Though Apple accounts for the majority of podcast listening, the company currently doesn’t monetize podcasting at all — all ads that you hear on podcasts are a result of advertisers and podcasters connecting off-platform.</p>\n<p>For some users, the app is a basic, functional listening app, as compared to other media apps and products, with rudimentary categorization and discovery features. For some creators, the features it currently lacks include native monetization capabilities, in-depth analytics, demographic information for listeners, or any attribution for where listeners come from. Since Apple Podcasts launched in 2012, the app itself has changed very little. The <em>New York Times </em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/08/business/media/podcasts-surge-apple.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">wrote</a> in 2016 that “the iTunes podcasting hub that Mr. Jobs introduced remains strikingly unchanged,” and beyond adding more analytics features in 2017, the same still holds true today.</p>\n<p>In the second category, there’s a number of media and technology companies that have large existing audiences making a big push into podcasts, including Spotify, Pandora, and iHeartRadio. The strategies for these companies are mostly centered around leveraging their existing audiences to cross-promote podcasts; using listener data to personalize listening experiences or to help surface relevant podcasts; and leveraging their reach and existing monetization mechanisms to help creators earn more revenue. Google, which launched a standalone Podcasts app last year, has <a href=\"https://blog.pacific-content.com/exclusive-inside-the-new-google-podcasts-strategy-that-could-double-audiences-worldwide-b556cdc26e43\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">talked</a> about making podcasts a first-class citizen in terms of surfacing podcast content in search results, as well as the growth opportunity that Google users worldwide represent in terms of potential podcast listeners.</p>\n<p>Finally, there’s the long tail of podcast apps. These are comprised of startups and a fair number of non-VC funded companies. These apps are predominantly competing on the basis of better user-facing features such as improved discovery, search, and social capabilities, as well as creator monetization including their own ad networks or direct user monetization features. Increasingly, startups in this last category are also looking for other ways to distinguish themselves outside of listening experience — including experiments with exclusive, sometimes paid, content.</p>\n<p>A discussion about shifting user behavior around consuming podcasts would be incomplete without calling out Spotify. In just the past few years, Spotify has burst onto the podcast landscape, moving from being music-centered to “audio-first”, and becoming the second largest platform for listening after Apple Podcasts.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4637\" src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-8.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-8.jpg 960w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-8-300x169.jpg 300w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-8-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p>\n<p><em>Spotify’s market share in podcasting has grown to 9% in a few short years based on data from Libsyn, a podcast hosting provider, and the company has laid out plans to become a destination for all types of audio content.</em></p>\n<p>Interestingly, Spotify may be growing the market of podcast listeners: the data below from Megaphone (formerly Panoply Media) shows that downloads of podcasts from Spotify happen in geographies that historically had fewer podcast downloads.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4638\" src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-9.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-9.jpg 960w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-9-300x169.jpg 300w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-9-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p>\n<p><em>Downloads data suggests that Spotify is growing the audience of podcasting.</em></p>\n<p>Spotify also accounts for two of the largest podcast acquisitions in industry history — Gimlet and Anchor — which occurred earlier this year.

Examples of companies in this category include traditional media companies like the <em>New York Times</em>, where audio was treated as an experiment before <i>The Daily</i><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/07/how-the-daily-michael-barbaro-became-the-ira-glass-of-new-york-times\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> became</a> a major hit in 2017; radio platforms like iHeartRadio, which bought Stuff Media to double down on podcasting; and digital media companies like Barstool Sports, a sports and pop culture blog which produces a number of podcasts. These companies can leverage their existing user base to drive listenership for the podcast — and if the podcast becomes popular, vice versa.</li>\n<li><strong>Podcast production companies</strong> focused mainly — if not exclusively — on podcasting, which necessitates building a viable business from podcasting alone. Their revenue primarily comes from advertising, which means those podcasts need to amass large, repeatedly engaged listener bases. Examples include Gimlet (the creator of <em>Reply All</em>, <em>StartUp</em>, <em>Crimetown</em>, and others), acquired by Spotify in early 2019; and Wondery (<em>Over My Dead Body</em>, <em>Generation Why</em>, <em>Dr. Death</em>).</li>\n<li><strong>Large indies and personality-driven talk shows</strong> primarily hosted by one or two personalities. These podcasts monetize mostly through ads, donations, and sometimes merchandise or live events. Examples include Tim Ferriss, Sam Harris, Rachel Hollis, Karen Kilgariff and Georgia Hardstark (<em>My Favorite Murder</em>), Roman Mars (<em>99% Invisible</em>), Joe Rogan, and many others.</li>\n<li><strong>Non-media businesses and nonprofits</strong> that also produce podcasts. The primary goal behind these podcasting initiatives is mostly brand-building and marketing, rather than driving revenue. Mailchimp and HBS podcasts fall into this category.</li>\n<li>Lastly, there are the <strong>individual hobbyists</strong> creating and posting content — often un-monetized and with very limited audiences. Podcasting tools like Anchor and others are democratizing the ability to launch a podcast, which will lead to more and more hobbyist creators.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that these categories serve as a rough segmentation of the creator landscape, because there is a lot of overlap and blurriness between some of them.</p>\n<p>For instance, NPR — the #1 podcast publisher in terms of downloads — produces many hit podcasts including <em>Hidden Brain</em>, <em>How I Built This</em>, <em>Planet Money</em>, and others, and is considered by some as having raised the profile of the medium overall. NPR sells ads on its podcasts and has teams of designers, planners, and strategists, but is technically a non-profit media organization. While podcasting has deep roots in public radio — <em>This American Life</em>, for instance, launched in 1995 under WBEZ (Chicago Public Radio) — the non-profit aspect of these organizations has implications on the business. Alex Blumberg, the CEO of Gimlet and a cofounder and producer of <em>Planet Money</em>, was <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2019/03/are-we-in-a-podcast-bubble.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reportedly</a> frustrated with NPR’s slow decision-making and strict rules around advertising, which led him to found Gimlet: “‘We should be making more; people want more… There should be the Planet Money of technology! Of cars!’”</p>\n<h3>Rich variety of content</h3>\n<p>The top iTunes podcasts chart from May 2019 is interesting for its glimpse into the tastes of Americans who have iPhones. A small number of publishers account for multiple top shows, including Wondery and NPR. We can also see how much Americans love crime/mystery content, as well as talk shows!</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4643\" src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-14.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-14.jpg 960w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-14-300x169.jpg 300w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-14-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p>\n<p>While NPR and iHeartRadio have roughly the same number of monthly downloads, NPR is able to accomplish this with just 48 shows vs. iHeartRadio’s 170.

Despite double-digit percent growth in podcast advertising over the last few years, podcasts are still in a very nascent, disjointed stage of monetization today.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4645\" src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-16.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-16.jpg 960w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-16-300x169.jpg 300w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-16-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p>\n<p>Today, podcasts primarily monetize via ads and listener donations. Though we’ve heard anecdotally from advertisers that podcast ads are effective — and are unique in their ability to reach a hard-to-access, attractive demographic — the ad buying experience is manual and tedious. Especially compared to purchasing other forms of digital advertising, since the dominant listening platform (Apple) doesn’t offer a way for hosts and brands to connect.</p>\n<p>As a result, you’ll see price sheets floating around online for major shows, with set rates to sponsor episodes, based on historic downloads figures. Ad networks in the podcasting space like Midroll Media and AdvertiseCast aim to make this process easier, while more new listening platforms are also enabling easier advertising, for instance by selling ads on behalf of shows in its network.</p>\n<p>But advertising doesn’t always cover the entire cost of producing a show, even for hit shows. <em>Serial</em> is one of the most successful podcasts ever — and the first ever podcast to reach <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2014/12/18/showbiz/feat-serial-podcast-btn/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">5 million downloads</a> — and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/nov/26/serial-season-two-podcast-confirmed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">asked for donations</a> in order to fund the production of the second season. This American Life also publishes requests for donations, including <a href=\"https://www.thisamericanlife.org/about/announcements/please-donate-to-support-the-show\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">these</a> <a href=\"https://www.thisamericanlife.org/about/announcements/please-donate-to-support-our-free-podcast-and-streaming\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">blog</a><a href=\"https://www.thisamericanlife.org/about/announcements/please-donate-now-to-support-the-show\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">posts</a> detailing the high costs of producing the show, with Ira Glass <a href=\"https://www.thisamericanlife.org/about/announcements/please-donate-now-to-support-the-show\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">writing</a>, “People sometimes ask me if it’s frustrating, having to request donations directly from listeners. It’s not. It’s the fairest way to fund anything: the people who like these stories and want them to exist, we pitch in a few bucks.”</p>\n<p>Donations to podcasters primarily happen off-platform today, via third-party tools such as Patreon, PayPal, and Venmo. The top podcaster on Patreon, Chapo Trap House, a political humor podcast, earns over $131K per month from almost 30K patrons (<a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/chapotraphouse\">link</a>). Himalaya, the U.S. podcasting app backed by the Chinese company Ximalaya, has a donations feature. And some other listening apps also have introduced one-off tipping capability or patronage features.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4646\" src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-17.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-17.jpg 960w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-17-300x169.jpg 300w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-17-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p>\n<p>Another monetization mechanism that companies are experimenting with is branded content. As opposed to advertising — which first start with the content and then sell ads to monetize — branded shows create a podcast in collaboration with a company, for a fee. Examples include The Mission, which is selling to enterprises to create branded podcasts — for instance, a podcast called The Future of Cities, sponsored by Katerra; and Gimlet, which has collaborated on shows like The Venture with Virgin Atlantic. By removing dependence on ads for monetization, branded shows like these are able to go deeper into a subject matter and create more niche content that doesn’t rely on listening volume to generate revenue.</p>\n<p>There’s also a lot of activity happening right now in the subscription and membership space. Recently-launched podcasting app Luminary Media (which bills itself as the “Netflix for podcasts”) charges $8 a month for access to a slate of more than 40 exclusive podcasts, and the app also has a free listening experience. The launch has been bumpy, with issues ranging from podcasters <a href=\"https://podcastbusinessjournal.com/luminary-does-a-belly-flop-on-twitter/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">taking offense at their tweet</a> that “Podcasters don’t need ads”; to controversy about <a href=\"https://hotpodnews.com/luminary-cleans-up-the-show-notes-links-situation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">removing links in show notes</a>, including donation and affiliate links that help podcasters monetize; to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/25/18515840/luminary-podcast-startup-proxy-server-show-takedown\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">using a </a>proxy server to serve podcasts, which made it challenging for podcasters to receive accurate analytics. Luminary’s launch serves to signal a few things — that the golden age of investing in podcasting is underway in terms of dollars flowing in, but also that getting the buy-in of creators is just as important as winning over consumers in building a new platform.</p>\n<p>The model of subscription premium audio content is popular in China, where Ximalaya, a unicorn consumer audio platform, has a subscription feature for $3 monthly that enables users to access over 4000 e-books and over 300 premium audio courses or podcasts. Audio content is also available a la carte starting at $0.03 per short, serialized book chapter, or anywhere from $10 to $45 for paid audio courses.</p>\n<p>Other monetization models we’ve seen include grants or foundation support, ticket sales for live events, and merchandise sales. There’s also licensing deals happening with the likes of HBO, Amazon, Fox, and other content companies who view podcasts as a source of intellectual property and want to adapt them into movies and TV shows. For instance, Gimlet’s scripted podcast <em>Homecoming</em> debuted as an Amazon Original Series in November 2018. The directionality of influence goes both ways: some podcasts are offshoots of other content — such as HBO’s <em>Chernobyl</em> podcast which discusses each episode of the mini-series — or written content — like <em>Binge Mode</em>’s deep dive into Harry Potter.</p>\n<h3>Podcast ad revenue is growing but is still tiny compared to other content formats</h3>\n<p>In 2019, the podcast industry ad revenue is estimated to hit over $500 million dollars, having doubled each year for the past few years. However, overall industry revenue is still tiny compared to that of other content mediums.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4647\" src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-18.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-18.jpg 960w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-18-300x169.jpg 300w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-18-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4648\" src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-19.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-19.jpg 960w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-19-300x169.jpg 300w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-19-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p>\n<p>In particular, based on average revenue per active user per hour, podcasts monetize at a <i>fraction</i> of other content types.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4649\" src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-20.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-20.jpg 960w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-20-300x169.jpg 300w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-20-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /><br />\n<em>Though podcast ad revenue is growing, the medium monetizes at a fraction of the rates of other content types (source: Nielsen via <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/state-of-podcasts-2018-takeaways-from-podcast-movement-on-monetization-diversity-and-discovery-eea7ccd0eed2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hacker Noon</a>)</em></p>\n<h3>Limitations of podcast advertising</h3>\n<p>Based on our conversations, lag in monetization isn’t due to lack of efficacy of ads. Various studies, including by Nielsen and Midroll Media, <a href=\"https://radioink.com/2018/12/19/nielsen-podcast-ads-do-the-job-for-brands/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">have found that</a> podcast ads meaningfully increase purchase intent.</p>\n<p>Why is podcasting monetization so low? Reasons include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inability to monetize directly on the dominant platform, Apple Podcasts.</li>\n<li>The long tail of podcasters not being able to monetize because advertisers only want to work with podcasts that have a high level of listenership. Given the lack of advertising inside major listening apps, advertisers need to connect off-platform with podcasters — whether directly or through an ad network. This manual process means that for most advertisers, the long tail of podcasts requires too much time and effort to find and work with.</li>\n<li>Lack of clarity around actual listens. For a long time, downloads were used to proxy delivered ads, but a “download” doesn’t necessarily mean a “play”.</li>\n<li>Detailed listener data is also not available. There’s also a lack of sophisticated targeting tools on par with what Facebook and other digital platforms offer advertisers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Today, podcast ads are primarily direct response, with ads read by hosts. You’re probably familiar with ads on podcasts with hosts talking about a product and verbally sharing a discount code. Podcast ad attribution is very rudimentary: the common methods of attribution are vanity URLs (for instance, <a href=\"http://www.ecommercewebsite.com/%3Cpodcastname&#38;gt\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ecommercewebsite.com/&#60;podcastname&#62;</a>); promo codes entered at checkout; and surveys asking users, “How did you hear about us?”</p>\n<p>Despite all these issues and barriers to monetization, podcasts are still able to command a premium CPM of $25 to $50, based on downloads, due to their efficacy. And the highest performing shows can cost even more.</p>\n<h3>How much are podcasters making?</h3>\n<p>While the majority of shows don’t monetize at all, the most successful ones can earn substantial revenue through advertising. A couple of data points: in July 2018, The <em>New York Times</em>’ <em>The Daily</em> podcast was <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/07/how-the-daily-michael-barbaro-became-the-ira-glass-of-new-york-times\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">projected</a> to book in the low eight-figures revenue in 2018 from ads, and had 5 million listeners monthly and 1 million listeners daily, or about $2 to $10 revenue per monthly listener. For context, <em>The Daily</em> was only started in January 2017. For comparison, in 2018, Spotify <a href=\"https://investors.spotify.com/financials/press-release-details/2019/Spotify-Technology-SA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Fourth-Quarter-2018/default.aspx\">earned</a> $605M from 111M monthly ad-supported listeners, or $5.45 per free listener.</p>\n<p>The <em>New York Times</em> as a whole had $709 million in digital revenue in 2018, so podcasting is still small relative to their entire business, but has an outsized impact on brand awareness. Michael Barbaro, the host of <em>The Daily</em>, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/07/how-the-daily-michael-barbaro-became-the-ira-glass-of-new-york-times\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">shared</a> in <i>Vanity Fair</i> that “When we started the show, we had many goals. We didn’t realize we were going to make money that was actually going to get pumped back into the company.”</p>\n<p>Blogger and podcaster Tim Ferriss has <a href=\"https://tim.blog/2016/04/11/tim-ferriss-podcast-business/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">written</a> that if he wanted to fully monetize the show at his current rates, he could make between $2-$4 million per year depending on how many episodes and spots he offers.</p>\n<p>Some back-of-the-envelope calculations around how much podcasters are making: Assuming CPMs of $25-50, if a podcast is in the top 1% in terms of downloads episode, or has 35,000 downloads per episode, each episode could generate about $4,000 per episode with two ad slots.</p>\n<h2>Audio trends and lessons from China</h2>\n<p>Over the past five years, dedicated audio apps in China have been growing quickly. In fact, online audio market users grew by over <a href=\"http://www.sohu.com/a/299233480_533924\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">22% in China in 2018</a>, a faster rate than either mobile video or reading. Looking at China can illustrate potential business models — partly through adopting an audio-centric approach <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2019/04/02/podcast-about-podcasting-industry-ecosystem-state-of-podcasting-2019/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">rather than adhering to</a> a strict definition of podcasting.</p>\n<p>Ximalaya FM, which last raised $580 million in August 2018 with a $3.6 billion valuation, is an audio platform with over <a href=\"https://baijiahao.baidu.com/s?id=1629036408113068530&#38;wfr=spider&#38;for=pc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">530 million total users</a> and <a href=\"https://t.cj.sina.com.cn/articles/view/5869808767/15dde2c7f001009fue\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">80 million monthly active users</a>.

The <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2018/12/05/connie-chan-advertising-models-content-product-china/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">monetization models </a>are just as diverse: there’s advertising, subscriptions, a la carte purchases, and donations / tipping. Interestingly, not all paid content is included in their subscription membership (similar to Amazon Prime Video’s mix of free and paid content), but members get an additional 5% discount on any exclusive content.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4650\" src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-21.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-21.jpg 960w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-21-300x169.jpg 300w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-21-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p>\n<p><em>China’s unicorn audio platform Ximalaya helps illustrates creativity in product and business models.</em></p>\n<p>As a result of the platform’s diverse purchasing models, the discover leaderboard filters not only by content category, but also according to monetization method, top hosts, most subscribers, and what’s trending on that very day.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4651\" src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-22.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-22.jpg 960w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-22-300x169.jpg 300w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-22-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p>\n<p><em>Ximalaya leaderboards can be sorted by top grossing content, top hosts, highest number of subscribers, and also by category of content.</em></p>\n<p>The app contains many different tabs with categorized content to allow users to optimize their listening experience.

Meanwhile, the Discover tab curates audio content into a custom social network so users can see not just the most popular content, but also what people are saying about it.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4653\" src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-24.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-24.jpg 960w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-24-300x169.jpg 300w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Podcast-Deep-Dive-April-2019-FOR-BLOG_PDF-24-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p>\n<p><em>Ximalaya social features include live audio broadcasting — monetized via virtual gifting — and a social feed of other users’ activity.</em></p>\n<p>Ximalaya illustrates a potential path for the development of audio platforms in the U.S., through its wide range of content types, monetization strategies, and interactivity. Examining the product may also hint at experiments it could run with Himalaya, its U.S. podcasting startup.</p>\n<p>Beyond Ximalaya, social audio is a growing category in China, with apps like Hello (live audio broadcasting); KilaKila (an anime community with live audio and video broadcasting); and WeSing (a social karaoke app), all of which monetize through virtual gifts. Other apps such as Soul, Zhiya, and Bixin leverage audio for making friends, dating, and even video game companionship. These apps showcase the potential of audio to serve as a platform for social interactivity — voices act as a core component of users’ identity and are the medium through which individuals interact.</p>\n<h2>Startup trends, challenges, and opportunities</h2>\n<h3>Biggest outcomes: no large standalone companies yet</h3>\n<p>Early 2019 saw the two largest ever exits in the podcasting industry — but against the larger backdrop of venture-backed companies, the exits were still small.

Most of these exits have been “acquihires” of small listening apps that were subsequently shut down post-acquisition.

Consumer listening apps for general podcast content</h3>\n<p>A lot of startup activity is happening on the consumer side of listening apps: Many startups are capitalizing on the opportunity to create a better listener experience, given that Apple Podcasts is relatively simple and bare-bones, and until recently, there has been no default listening app for Android users. Issues these apps are addressing include better discovery of podcasts through algorithms, curation, or social signals; more effective ways to search for relevant content (e.g. by automatically transcribing podcasts so as to be able to search within them); or improved social features.</p>\n<p>We on the consumer team tend to believe that better podcast discovery, recommendations, and other user-facing features alone aren’t sufficient to draw a large listener base. The core of what users are interacting with on a listening app is the content itself — after all, it’s normal for listeners to start playing audio content, then to background the app or put their phones away, so the listening app becomes secondary to the content. As a result, many podcasting startups have expressed interest in offering some flavor of exclusive content, as well as monetization options for creators, in order to further differentiate themselves.</p>\n<p>Here’s a small sample of the approaches some of these new listening apps are taking:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Charging consumers directly for podcasts — these apps’ exclusive podcasts account for a relatively small share of all of the content available in these apps. Examples include Luminary and Brew, both of which have subscription models for access to exclusive content, in addition to allowing users to listen to widely available free podcasts.</li>\n<li>Adding a social layer onto podcasts — to help with discovery and/or to capture the conversation happening around podcasts. Some early companies in this space include Breaker, Swoot, and others.</li>\n<li>Offering translation and transcription — essentially enabling <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2019/04/02/podcast-about-podcasting-industry-ecosystem-state-of-podcasting-2019/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">episode-level rather than show-level discovery</a>. Castbox, for instance, offers podcasts in multiple languages, as well as the ability to search within podcasts by transcribing content. The app also recently launched live audio broadcasting that allows anchors to interact with listeners via voice, text, and call-in and to earn tips from followers.</li>\n<li>Adding context — Since podcasts expose listeners to so much new information and prompt questions, these could be more seamlessly explored without disrupting the listening experience. Entale, for example, is a “visual podcast app” that uses AI to showcase relevant information to users as the podcast is playing — this could be displaying the Amazon link to a book that someone mentions, or linking to the Wikipedia page about a speaker’s biography.</li>\n<li>Specializing by vertical — For parents growing increasingly cognizant of exposing kids to screen time, having a curated selection of audio content targeted towards kids, suitable for entertainment and learning, can be valuable. Leela Kids, for example, is a children’s podcast app that curates kids-safe content.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2. Vertical consumer audio apps</h3>\n<p>Beyond general and for-kids podcasts, there’s also a number of adjacent audio apps with more focused content, including those targeting education, audio books, fiction, health and wellness and fitness. By focusing on a specific subject matter and going very deep, these apps aim to create <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2015/01/22/the-full-stack-startup/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">full-stack</a> listening experiences that combine original content around that particular vertical; user monetization mechanisms; and other value-added features that enhance the user experience and help users achieve their goals.</p>\n<p>To give a few examples, Calm and Headspace are both guided audio meditation apps, which offer both free and subscription-only content that’s exclusive to their own platforms. Both have features beyond just the content itself that help users with mindfulness — for instance, daily reminders, streaks, visualizations and videos, etc. In the ASMR (autonomous sensory meridian response) vertical, Tingles is an app where fans can watch or listen to videos of ASMR content, filter by specific categories, and support creators through subscriptions. In the fitness category, Aaptiv, ClassPass Go, and MoveWith are examples of companies offering audio fitness classes across a variety of exercise types.</p>\n<h3>3. Podcast production companies</h3>\n<p>Lastly, there’s a surge of venture-backed podcast production companies creating podcast content and distributing it through third-party listening platforms. Examples of these include Wondery, the studio behind a number of hit shows including <em>Dirty John</em>, <em>Dr. Death</em>, and <em>American History Tellers</em>; and WaitWhat, the content incubator that developed <em>Masters of Scale</em> with Reid Hoffman and <em>Should This Exist</em>.</p>\n<p>Most podcast producers are creating entertainment-focused, general interest content that appeals to a wide audience, likely because of their monetization model, which is primarily ad-supported. Since these content studios distribute through other platforms and don’t have direct relationships with end users, they need to monetize through advertising, which necessitates content that appeals to a wide audience and promotes lengthier consumption times and ongoing listening.</p>\n<p>Successful production studios could be prime acquisition targets for media companies as efficient sources of IP, or for consumer listening apps as a way to differentiate based on content — and a number of startups in this space have already been acquired. Another possibility is that once these content companies generate enough listener traction, they could create distribution platforms of their own, and use these as a way to deepen listener relationships and diversify revenue, for instance by charging users for, say, early access to content, back catalogs, exclusive content, or other features.</p>\n<h2>So what are we interested in investing in?</h2>\n<p>Given the challenges with monetization, how can startups create a path to becoming a sustainable business? With the distribution and capital advantages that incumbents have — coupled with the fact that Apple and Google own the end mobile platforms, where are the opportunities for startups? And how do we evaluate these opportunities?</p>\n<p>To understand startup opportunities, it’s important to consider where the incumbents and large audio companies like Spotify, Pandora, and iHeartRadio are uniquely advantaged:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Consumer traction and awareness, and a large audience to which podcasts can be cross-promoted</li>\n<li>Large budgets for content production and acquisition</li>\n<li>User data on preferences and existing media consumption</li>\n<li>Existing monetization mechanisms, such as through ads, subscription</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So how to navigate creating a large opportunity, given the above advantages?</p>\n<p>We think the most promising players will combine the following aspects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Focus on <i>audio</i></strong><strong> content broadly, rather than exclusively podcasts.</strong> Just as the lines between blogs, articles, and other written content online have blurred, the same is happening with all audio content, and so we are interested in all types of content delivered via listening. As outlined above, podcasting was historically synonymous with audio distributed via RSS — now, with the rise of exclusive, paid podcasts, <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2019/04/02/podcast-about-podcasting-industry-ecosystem-state-of-podcasting-2019/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the distinction</a> between podcasting and other audio content is becoming less meaningful.</li>\n<li><strong>The potential for network effects.</strong> We’ve written extensively about <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2016/03/07/all-about-network-effects/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">network effects</a> and <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2018/12/13/16-metrics-network-effects/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">how to measure them</a>; the consumer team loves businesses with network effects! Network effects in audio could take different forms. Like many content platforms, there’s a two-sided marketplace network effect, where more high-quality content makes the platform more valuable to consumers, and more users makes it more appealing for content producers to distribute their content there. All things being equal, most users would prefer to use the platform that has the largest, best inventory of audio content. A social audio app could also have direct network effects, where the experience becomes better with more users/friends.</li>\n<li>While we prefer full-stack startups that own the experience end to end (positive feedback loops from listening app to content to monetization), we wouldn’t rule out breakout apps that are strong on any one aspect.</li>\n<li><strong>High-quality differentiated and deeper content vs. broad, free libraries of shallower content.</strong> Since the large incumbents seek content that appeals to their large user bases, they’re less focused on seemingly niche, in-depth content. We also believe that for certain high-value content verticals, there’s potential to shift the burden of payment to businesses, schools, or other organizations — rather than on to end consumers.</li>\n<li><strong>Consumption experience that enhances the experience of the audio content.</strong> This could be through live, social audio, or other features that increase stickiness and engagement. For instance, Headspace’s meditation streaks, animations, multi-level categorization, and session length options differentiate and enhance the experience, compared to listening to meditation audio content on general podcast listening apps.</li>\n<li><strong>Alternative monetization </strong><strong>beyond solely ads</strong> (Connie Chan <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2018/12/07/when-advertising-isnt-enough-multimodal-business-models-product-strategy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">has written</a> a lot about this). Given the dominance of existing large platforms like Google and Facebook for ad targeting, it’s becoming increasingly challenging to build a new large company based on advertising alone. We are bullish about audio companies that are aiming to monetize users directly — this could be accomplished through charging for content that has higher perceived ROI, or by introducing payments as a way to alter the content experience (e.g. social recognition after tipping in live streams). More importantly, it’s also a way to align incentives of consumers with content creators.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What could some examples of these startups look like?</h3>\n<h4>1. Vertical audio platforms</h4>\n<p>We’re excited about startups that are going deep within a particular vertical and building a full-stack audio experience tailored to that vertical. There’s less chance of incumbents competing directly here, given the more niche focus and fundamental differences in feature sets needed to enhance the user experience. We also see greater willingness for users to pay for content that has higher perceived ROI — for instance, various fitness and meditation/wellness audio apps have already gained high levels of traction in usage and monetization.</p>\n<h4>2. Interactive, social audio… finally</h4>\n<p>While people have been talking about it for years, we think there’s still an opportunity to finally have truly interactive, social audio. Without being too prescriptive on what this looks like (we want founders to tell us!), the fact is, audio content today is still largely broadcast in nature, with a one-directional flow of information from creator to listener. While there are some conversations happening around audio content (including on Twitter, Reddit, and other forums), they happen in a fragmented, isolated way, and on platforms that aren’t designed for that purpose.</p>\n<p>Call-ins to radio and live talk shows are two current forms of interactive audio, with the social element fundamentally contributing to the content itself. Twitch also has podcasters who use the platform to live stream themselves while recording, sometimes responding to user comments which become part of the show’s content. There’s a number of startups enabling users to comment on static podcast content, but the social experience needs to become even more interactive to attract a wider audience and pull users off existing platforms. In China, live audio broadcast, group karaoke, and even audio dating products are flourishing, and there may be an opportunity to create an audio product that is more interactive and social for U.S. audiences, too.</p>\n<h4>3. Platforms that helps creators own their end users and monetize content</h4>\n<p>Most creators are disintermediated from their end listeners, since they produce content that is distributed solely through various third-party platforms. Given the brand equity and large followings that some creators have established, we believe that there’s an opportunity to give these creators a way to distribute their own content, own their customers, and to monetize through alternative sources besides advertising and off-platform donations.</p>\n<p>Some influential podcast publishers have developed their own solutions to engage and/or monetize their own audiences, including Slate Plus, <a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2014/04/what-is-slate-plus-editor-david-plotz-on-slates-new-membership-program.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a paid membership program</a> from Slate with podcast benefits including ad-free and bonus podcast; The Athletic, which <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/the-athletic-launches-podcast-network-65f115a8-da39-409b-98df-80d74a325966.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">launched over 20 exclusive shows</a> behind a paywall in April; and BBC Sounds, an app <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/help/sounds-intro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">that puts music, podcasts, and radio</a> from BBC into one personalized destination.</p>\n<p>But for creators who don’t have the technical or financial resources to develop their own apps or piece together various third-party solutions to accept payments or manage members, there could be a turnkey platform for creators. Down the line, there’s opportunity to create a network of these creators and listeners, along the lines of “come for the tool, stay for the network.”</p>\n<h3>The future</h3>\n<blockquote><p>“If you think of audio as the way you think of, say, film, like we’re still in the black-and-white period of podcasting. What’s color going to look like? What’s 3-D going to look like?”</p></blockquote>\n<p>I love this quote from the host of <em>Today, Explained</em>, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/podcasts/2019/3/27/18283083/today-explained-sean-rameswaram-vox-kara-swisher-recode-decode-podcast-interview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sean Rameswaram</a> — since we are still indeed in the black-and-white phase of podcasting.</p>\n<p>Taking a step back, it’s amazing how much progress the industry has made since the Apple Podcasts app was introduced 7 years. It’s still early days, so if you’re building something that is related to any of these aspects, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/ljin18\">please drop me a line</a>!</p>\n<p>The post <a

network effects that makes Silicon Valley what it is</strong>. The uniqueness of the Silicon Valley tech ecosystem, how network effects conspire to create a “rich get richer” situation for cities, and why new communication tools enabling distributed teams to work together across continents could mean that there will be no “next Silicon Valley.”</li>\n<li><strong>Big companies versus small ones</strong>. Ada shares her insights on the contrasting skill sets needed when working at a big company versus a small startup, after having herself gone from a small startup to a huge organization like LinkedIn back to a two-person startup with her husband.</li>\n<li><strong>Personal life OKRs</strong>. How to port the concept of OKRs — objectives and key results, a personnel management framework originated by legendary Intel CEO Andy Grove — to your personal life from your business (and why you would want to). We talk about you can use them to help manage your exercise, social life and relationship with your SO.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course, we also chat about some of our favorite products, including an app that lets you pop in to a luxury hotel for a few hours to shower or have a nap, a super cool way to greet visitors to your office, and a new app for emailing yourself.</p>\n<p>Here it is below as an embed, but if you don&#8217;t see it inline, <a href=\"https://simplecast.com/s/81994ef7\">you can listen to the podcast via this link too</a>.

It&#8217;s a night and day difference from a big company.” — Ada</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>“If you graph cities, there&#8217;s a power law: the biggest cities are really big and there&#8217;s this long tail of all these little tiny cities, and the reason for that is that there&#8217;s a network effect within cities. These ecosystems emerge because the designers are here, because the engineers are here, because the capital is here, because the marketing people are here, and on and on and on.” — Andrew</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>“When it comes to working at a large company, it&#8217;s much more cerebral and much more about the heart.

This is the first brother and sister duo and hopefully the first of many. Thanks for having me over here. First off, Andrew, you joined Andreessen Horowitz, is it six months ago?</p>\n<p>Andrew: Yeah, I think I&#8217;m on month five. I&#8217;m quickly reaching my half year mark, which has gone incredibly fast.</p>\n<p>Ryan: Are you completely swamped with meetings and pitches or how has it changed since before Andreessen Horowitz?</p>\n<p>Andrew: Yeah, so when I was at Uber I really loved meeting with startups and hearing about new ideas and staying in touch with the tech community, but I can only do it first thing in the morning and on weekends and it quickly filled up my schedule. So I would work at Uber and then I would do that [meet with founders] basically. The idea that I would do the thing that I wanted to do for fun, like as my full time job sort of feels like I&#8217;ve won an ice cream eating competition and the prize is more ice cream. I could do as much as I want, which is super awesome.</p>\n<p>Ryan: Yeah. And so your, your background, just maybe for those that aren&#8217;t super familiar, you were at Uber right before this and then what&#8217;s your short version of your history?</p>\n<p>Andrew: Yeah, yeah, totally. We were just talking about. So Ada and I, who&#8217;s my little sister, by the way, I want to clarify —</p>\n<p>Ada: [laughter, eye-rolling and protestation]</p>\n<p>Andrew: So we grew up in Seattle, and we both made our way to the Bay Area. Actually, the funny thing is my first job ever was actually in venture capital and was something I did right after college. Then after that I ended up working at a series of startups, I moved to the Bay Area 10 years ago to start my own company. I had actually met Marc and Ben [of Andreesen Horowitz] here and they actually led the seed round for a startup I was working on during the Facebook platform days when everyone was working on crazy viral apps.</p>\n<p>Ryan: So that&#8217;s around when we met.</p>\n<p>Andrew: Yeah, right. Yeah, that&#8217;s exactly, that&#8217;s right around when we met and they invested out of a Horowitz Andreessen Angel Fund, which was really funny because that would have been like H16N and so different. So, I met them and I worked on that for a while and ended up basically deciding that it&#8217;d be better to go to a larger organization, ended up at Uber running various growth teams there. So I spent three years there, like a really, really fun experience —</p>\n<p>Ryan: Probably pretty wild too, right?</p>\n<p>Andrew: — Yeah, the first 18 months was like really, really incredible startup like hockey stick growth, then the last 18 months were very eventful and everyone&#8217;s read about it in the news. So I don&#8217;t have to summarize that.</p>\n<p>Ryan: Yeah, and Ada, you&#8217;ve had a pretty interesting journey at Microsoft, LinkedIn, Survey Monkey, and then a two-person startup with your husband.</p>\n<p>Ada: Yeah. Yeah. Actually multiple two person startups as well as, I spent some time in the game space as well at Mochi Media. So, after I graduated from college, I was in Seattle at Microsoft for a year and Microsoft at the time I think was around 80,000-100,000 employees? Very, very structured. Worked in the ad center space and the online advertising space when search marketing was just becoming a thing and exactly 367 days or so later, moved out to the Bay Area in 2007 and so worked at a tiny little startup that had just raised Series A called Mochi Media, which was an online games ad network, and spent multiple years there after it was ultimately acquired by Shanda Games and then actually started my first company which was a contact management app called Connected. It was all about contact management without the work. We raised some funding for that, ultimately sold it to LinkedIn and I had my experience sort of joining LinkedIn as a just as a company that was really maturing at the time. They had just had their IPO. There are about 1700 employees and experienced hyper growth for the first time, focused on things like relaunching Connected as LinkedIn Contacts, growth, learning a lot about subscriptions and consumer SaaS and was recruited out of that to work at Survey Monkey, where I was SVP of Marketing and then recently left a couple of years back to start a new company that&#8217;s actually a husband and wife team with Sachin Rekhi and we started a company called <a href=\"http://notejoy.com\">Notejoy</a>, which is a collaborative notes app for teams and so we&#8217;re really focused on, how do we actually create a fast and focused workspace for teams that gets them out of the noise of chat and email.</p>\n<p>Ryan: Yeah, team collaboration and productivity is so important because if you can even improve collaboration and efficiency within a team by like even just 10 percent, it can have such a huge impact on both your productivity but also just like your joy.</p>\n<p>Ada: That was actually part of the inspiration behind the name and it&#8217;s one of those things where even when you go to a small team like small tight-fitting teams or larger organizations, you see this friction today that still exists when it comes to communication and collaboration and just think about how many decrepit out-of-date Wikis you see and Google Docs that are sort of lost in the ether and then people joining and getting forwarded random emails from way back when because that&#8217;s the only place that knowledge lives, we were really thinking about how do we create something that tackles that and productivity has always been a huge space where I&#8217;ve been passionate about.</p>\n<p>Ryan: This is a really broad question, but what&#8217;s it like working at such a big company like LinkedIn and Microsoft and others to now just you and your husband?</p>\n<p>Ada: Yeah, I mean it&#8217;s hugely different and I think the biggest dimension where I would say working at a large company versus a small startup is different is that effective execution looks completely different. It&#8217;s a night and day difference. So when you&#8217;re executing at a small startup or a small team or even just by yourself, it really comes down to ideating, picking and prioritizing and then rolling up your sleeves and getting things done as quickly as possible from an execution pace. When it comes to working at a large company, it&#8217;s actually much more cerebral, right? And it&#8217;s much more in the heart. You&#8217;re actually thinking about how do you communicate and collaborate across the cross functional group of teams to get the initiative done. So can you communicate what it&#8217;s about? Can you motivate people to get it done? Can you manage all of the pieces?</p>\n<p>Ada: And the irony of it is that sometimes when you&#8217;re working on projects with large scale, because the skillset is so different, it actually feels like you&#8217;re not doing anything at all yourself. You&#8217;re actually merely managing the appendages of all the other groups and trying to make sure that everyone&#8217;s staying on track and executing. And so as organizations scale, the execution work around how much collaboration it takes gets orders of magnitude greater in terms of how hard it is to get everyone aligned and marching in the same direction versus one person. And so, I really think that that&#8217;s one of the biggest differences, like you go to a startup to learn how to do things and maybe not very well and you go to a large company to see how things are done really well, but across a broad range of disciplines and functions and really see how the whole thing comes together as an engine sort of humming smoothly and operating.</p>\n<p>Ryan: You mentioned communication is one skill or trait of people in larger companies. And Andrew, you used to blog, I mean you still do, but you used to blog a lot. That&#8217;s largely how I think you built a pretty massive following over the past decade or so. How did you even get into writing to begin with?</p>\n<p>Andrew: So, first I love writing. That&#8217;s kind of the very first thing, and I was always one of these, teenagers where like, I kept a journal and I would like write in it and then delete it and then start a new one and literally I was the only audience. I just like enjoyed it myself. And so before starting my current professional blog, I think I had like three other blogs that I had started over the years. Just basically, just getting going and then deleting them and not really sticking with it over time.</p>\n<p>Ryan: Why did you delete the previous blogs?</p>\n<p>Andrew: Because you get bored with it, and you&#8217;re just kinda like, okay, I&#8217;m done, kind of thing. And then like I think on those it was literally, it&#8217;s like who&#8217;s reading it? It&#8217;s like Ada, like my parents, like —</p>\n<p>Ada: — Fun fact about Andrew&#8217;s early blogs: he would actually forcibly subscribe us to the emails to make sure that we wouldn&#8217;t miss anything.</p>\n<p>Ryan: That was before some of the ICANN email laws and certainly before GDPR.</p>\n<p>Andrew: Yeah, right. Yeah, exactly. So I think, don&#8217;t tell a 20 year old who they can subscribe to a blog or not. So I really enjoyed that. And then when I moved to the Bay Area 10 years ago, what I basically decided to do was I was like, I&#8217;m gonna write down everything that I&#8217;m learning and I&#8217;m just gonna start, like going out and so the funny thing, I was learning so much in my first year that I was just writing a lot of, like pretty random snippets, some of it would be like a paragraph or two, and I would do it like, maybe twice a week or something like that. So like pretty often and that&#8217;s actually how I met Marc Andreessen originally. It turned out that he somehow randomly had stumbled on my blog via Hacker News and then through that, had ended up seeing some of my content and then he cold emailed me and that&#8217;s how I met him in 2007. So it was like a pretty random and amazing adventure but at the time, I was an entrepreneur in residence. I was a 24 year old entrepreneur in residence actually across the street from here, which is really funny. And one of the things that my colleagues would tell me is they would say like, why are you wasting your time blogging, you&#8217;re giving away all your best ideas? Like, what are you doing? Like, these are the secrets that you&#8217;re going to use to understand the thing. And at the time I was like, well, I&#8217;m never going to be a venture capitalist so like it doesn&#8217;t matter. And so as a result, I&#8217;m just going to give away all this stuff and then, and it&#8217;s obviously so ironic now that like, so much of the job is, is obviously, sharing your ideas and giving back to the community via Twitter and Medium and writing, writing essays and all that.</p>\n<p>Ryan: Now that&#8217;s the norm.</p>\n<p>Andrew: Yeah, right, exactly. Yeah. And in fact it was like, it would have been considered very contrarian I think to actually share a bunch. But anyway, so I&#8217;ve kept it up and I think, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m well into the many, many hundreds of essays, over 10 years and I think at times I&#8217;ve taken like a hiatus, I think I took a two year hiatus in the middle. But like I think my goal now is really to publish like regularly, but to do it at the kind of like a high level of quality and to go deeper into ideas and to sort of break new concepts and new kinds of data to the community versus literally the, the early days it was like, it&#8217;d be like 500 words, like what did I learn today kind of thing.</p>\n<p>Ryan: So I&#8217;m going to take a tie into that a little bit. You mentioned a term called, correct me if I&#8217;m wrong, but something along the lines of mullet startups, is that correct? Or do you remember that there&#8217;s a tweet in a conversation with you and some others around the distributed nature of companies?</p>\n<p>Andrew: Oh yeah, okay, mullet, yes.</p>\n<p>Ryan: Mullet startups is a catchy term because it&#8217;s a trend that we&#8217;ve identified. Product Hunt is a mullet startup I guess, we&#8217;re headquartered in San Francisco, but we have a distributed team.</p>\n<p>Andrew: So The Economist&#8217;s cover for this week is Peak Valley, is, is it over in Silicon Valley?</p>\n<p>Ryan: Right.</p>\n<p>Andrew: So then I think there&#8217;s been, there&#8217;s been a lot of like really interesting dialogue around that. I think, and obviously a lot of it has to do with like housing and the Bay Area and there&#8217;s so much to unpack there, right? But I think that one of the reactions to it has been that we see many companies, with their leadership and their executives in the Bay Area, but when it comes to hiring engineers and designers and all sorts of other folks, then they&#8217;re much more likely to distribute the team, anywhere.</p>\n<p>Ryan: Right.</p>\n<p>Andrew: And so, yeah, to your point, this is sort of the mullet, because it&#8217;s sort of business in the front and party in the back kind of thing. AndI think it&#8217;s fascinating because it is actually just the reverse of one of the models that we&#8217;ve seen over the years where, for example, you&#8217;ll have a really strong technical team out of Paris or out of Israel or out of Singapore and they&#8217;ll get started, they&#8217;ll get funded and then they&#8217;ll realize, okay, hey, all of our customers are in the US, let&#8217;s move the CEO and the sales and marketing function to the Bay Area. And so you end up with the, the mullet, but just like kind of, but now you do it in reverse. Right. So I think that&#8217;s like a pretty interesting, reverse mullet, which is kind of an interesting trend these days.</p>\n<p>Ryan: Yeah. So it&#8217;s just you two right now Ada at Notejoy, but if you were to, let&#8217;s say you needed to hire 10 people tomorrow, how would you approach it? Would you hire in the Bay Area or would you go remote?</p>\n<p>Ada: Yeah, I mean that&#8217;s actually a fascinating question because it&#8217;s something that we&#8217;ve debated and thought about because things have changed so much. Not only from the costs, but then also, what is the ability for you to access and interact with people at scale, if they&#8217;re located in other places. We actually talked to this close friend of mine who&#8217;s a founder who, built his company and scaled it to revenue, pretty substantial revenue in the Bay Area. And he basically said to us, if I were to do it again, I believe that Silicon Valley is the worst place to self-fund a company or to start a company or even to have funding and try to build a team. And the biggest challenge that he was having was actually access to talent. I think it would really depend. I think on one hand I think we have really strong networks within the Bay Area and so it would be possible to kind of peel people off and that&#8217;s really how many startups start with their founding team. They pull people that they respect, that they work with, that have shared belief in to kind of create that initial nucleus of a team and that gets you to your first couple of headcount. So maybe we can get to 10 that way, but I do think that now when it&#8217;s coming to scale, like yeah, we would definitely be looking very closely at could we build a remote team and create a really distributed workforce for Notejoy.</p>\n<p>Andrew: I think one of the distinctions is do you hire a lot of folks who are doing the kind of individual contributor work versus the managers because I do think that it ends up being really hard once you want to find the engineering director that&#8217;s managed 200 engineers to find that elsewhere, versus it being, kind of a main thing. So, so there&#8217;s a really interesting thing about cities, right? Which is like if you graph the population of cities and sort of like, stack rank them, you&#8217;ll see that there&#8217;s a power law in it. And like the biggest cities are really, really, really big and then there&#8217;s this like there&#8217;s this long tail of all these like little tiny cities. And the reason for that is that there&#8217;s really like a network effect within cities, right? Like, whether it&#8217;s show business in LA or it&#8217;s, finance in New York, like these ecosystems that emerge happen because, you end up with the designers who are here because the engineers are here because the marketing people are here because the capital is here because and on and on and on and all in one place. And so one of my colleagues here at Andreessen Horowitz, Darcy, had mentioned, he tweeted the idea that, one of two things will happen, right? Either these network effects continue to hold, meaning that then, actually the Bay Area will just continue to be what it is, right? Or, we actually make really interesting structural shifts in how we organize teams and workforces and all that stuff. In which case the network effects become less strong. But what that means is not that then all of a sudden, some other city like becomes a quote unquote the next Silicon Valley. It actually just means that everyone just lives where they want to live and eat and that&#8217;s that. And so, so if you believe that thesis, then you&#8217;d actually say there is no quote unquote next Silicon Valley. It either just continues or it&#8217;ll just be distributed. Right. I think that&#8217;s like a pretty interesting —</p>\n<p>Ada: — I think you see that already emerging even within online communities. So when you think about where the discourse actually taking place, right, it&#8217;s taking place on Medium, it&#8217;s taking place on Twitter, it&#8217;s taking place on Product Hunt. We went through the experience of launching on Product Hunt and we were really amazed by how international the community was in contrast to the earlier startup Connected that we&#8217;d done several years before that. It may not be as important in the future for everyone to be physically co-located in the same space.</p>\n<p>Ryan: Yeah. I&#8217;m super fascinated by this space and I&#8217;m actually committed to investing in a company that&#8217;s rethinking how people communicate with a distributed and remote team by video because we have a lot of different tools out there like Zoom and Google Hangouts and others and they are all kind of utilities in that they&#8217;re not much different from each other. It&#8217;s just like a big screen with your face on it and they&#8217;re rethinking, in a world where everyone is distributed or a group of people are distributed and another group of people are working from their home, how do you communicate more effectively? Yeah, I find it an interesting trend. I think one observation too is that the mullet strategy can work really well if your home base is where your customers are. So like you said Andrew earlier, like if you&#8217;re building an entertainment company, it&#8217;s probably good to have connections and live in LA so that you can be around those people and that can create a lot of serendipity in business partnerships and so on, but you don&#8217;t necessarily need your entire team there. You can also have them around the world. If you can build a culture that can facilitate working effectively remote. I&#8217;m pro-remote, if it makes sense for your company. Just saying, I&#8217;m slightly biased. It&#8217;s been five years now with Product Hunt running distributed.</p>\n<p>Andrew: I think what&#8217;s hard is that basically there&#8217;s a whole class of interactions were being in person is actually better. And so if you&#8217;re meeting people for the first time in a partnership type scenario or a sales kind of scenario or in investing kind of scenario, like you do want to go old school, you do want to see the other person. and so I think in those cases, that&#8217;s where, that&#8217;s actually, I think where the network effects actually kick it right where then it&#8217;s like, okay, yeah, let&#8217;s get everyone clustered together, in those cases.</p>\n<p>Ryan: SF in particular, is so dense. I mean, granted I&#8217;m driving down to Menlo Park, but it&#8217;s a small, short trip. Whereas LA and New York as well, it&#8217;s actually hard to have a lot of meetings within a five hour period because everyone is distributed across different locations. I&#8217;m curious to hear from an investing side, are you actively looking at sort of the future of work or distributed teams and looking to invest in companies building for that?</p>\n<p>Andrew: Totally. I mean I think, I think there&#8217;s a couple different angles on the future of work that are, that are worth mentioning. So I think one is, I learned a ton of really, really interesting lessons at Uber, but I think one of the most important ones is that there are 80 million hourly workers in America. Right? And so these are folks that are often working multiple part time jobs, they don&#8217;t have steady sources of income, and what they&#8217;re often doing is they are driving Uber kind of between their other things, right. And so I think when you look at that, you&#8217;re like, wow, like the future of work has to encompass that industry, which is what are all the other kinds of interesting work that can actually happen? So like just to call out a couple really interesting ones: there&#8217;s a company called VIPKID which caters to — the consumer side is basically kids in China and then the supply side of the market is basically often like Midwestern like ex-teachers, stay at home moms, that kind of thing and they&#8217;re spending time on video together and they&#8217;re getting this whole experience around teaching and tutoring. And this is something that you can do from your home. Like super interesting. Right? There&#8217;s obviously lots of really interesting things happening in real estate. Our portfolio company, Airbnb obviously provides a lot of really important, supplemental income —</p>\n<p>Ryan: If your HOA will actually allow it. I&#8217;m speaking from experience. They will not allow me, unfortunately to rent my place out. But it&#8217;s pretty typical, right?</p>\n<p>Andrew: I mean, I think within all these different kinds of work, there&#8217;s obviously different rules that need to be be in place and that&#8217;s true for rideshare and that&#8217;s true for many other things as well. But I think that&#8217;s kind of one notion of a future of work that I think is important for us to consider even though it&#8217;s sort of outside the tech bubble a little bit, but it&#8217;s a really huge market. I think the flip side is, I&#8217;ve been an on again off again advisor to Dropbox for many years and I&#8217;ve known that team for a while and when you look at what these horizontal products are trying to do, it&#8217;s sort of like, we&#8217;re in a world where, if we can get all of these professional white collar workers — just make their jobs better, right? And just like make all these workflows, these really complicated workflows that you know for the most part are still being managed in spreadsheets and docs and chat and sort of like streamline all that. There&#8217;s tons and tons of opportunity across many different dimensions.</p>\n<p>Ryan: So let&#8217;s talk about some apps or products you guys love. Ada, what&#8217;s on your home screen that people need to know about or is there a product you use maybe every day, every week that is bettering your life, changing your life?</p>\n<p>Ada: Yeah, that&#8217;s a great question. So I am a huge fan of personal productivity and so, every year I make my New Year&#8217;s resolutions and one of my resolutions for example, was get to a point where I was working out three times a week and the challenge that I always had was the accountability, right? And tracking. And so this is probably not a particularly popular app, but one of my favorite apps for that is actually this iOS app called HabitShare. And it basically lets you share accountability, like share your to do list, like check I did it today and set a goal and make sure that you&#8217;re keeping track of how accountable you are against it. I&#8217;m a huge fan of that. And then I think Andrew actually introduced me to this, but I love this app called Captio as well and it&#8217;s a very quick way to email yourself and you wouldn&#8217;t think that it&#8217;s that many taps to email yourself to remember a quick idea. But after you experienced it, it&#8217;s pretty mind-blowing.</p>\n<p>Andrew: Can we just go on a quick tangent about Ada&#8217;s goal setting strategy?</p>\n<p>Ryan: Yes. This is one of the reasons why we had brothers and sisters on the show.</p>\n<p>Andrew: Yeah. So one of the things that&#8217;s impressive, but also a little bit scary is the the level of — she actually uses OKRs, objectives and key results. There&#8217;s a whole book about it. In order to handle her goals, but this is the best part. Her husband also does the same, Sachin also does the same and they actually will score each other on the OKRs. Do you want to talk about this a little?</p>\n<p>Ada: True story. So, both my husband and I love productivity. I mean, this is why we&#8217;ve been spending all of our time working on Notejoy, but I spent probably a decade of my life at this point thinking about productivity apps and so OKRs is actually something that we&#8217;ve adopted as a process from LinkedIn, which originally came from Google, which originally came from another company before that. It&#8217;s widely adopted.</p>\n<p>Ryan: John Doerr actually wrote a book about it recently.</p>\n<p>Ada: Yeah, that&#8217;s right. And so with objectives and key results, we actually found that it was a really good way of establishing goals that are both measurable as well as very distinct specific. And so we actually do annual OKRs is on a personal level, whether it&#8217;s around like personal infrastructure, like fitness or how to relate to your life —</p>\n<p>Andrew: — You have like a KR that&#8217;s like hanging out with friends three times per month.</p>\n<p>Ada: Yeah. So I actually had a reconnection OKR at one point where I basically made a list of people, 50 people that brought me joy that I was really engaged with, always wanted to get to know better, the bar was basically just interesting and that I hadn&#8217;t spoken to in four to six months and then the goal was basically to take a one month period and meet with half of them and it was actually one of the most energizing and transforming goals that I&#8217;d had because it was a great way to kind of have a focused effort at reconnecting with people and building relationships. And yeah, we score each other on it so we actually have business OKRs in terms of managing the business that we do on a quarterly basis and then I have annual OKRs around some of my goals such as like learning a new skill or whatever else. Thanks for bringing that up.</p>\n<p>Andrew: I do not use OKRs to score anything in my life. Do you?</p>\n<p>Ryan: Not really. I mean, that is extremely nerdy but also I&#8217;m kind of inspired because the beauty of OKRs is when you craft the right OKRs it&#8217;s binary, like you pass it or you didn&#8217;t and a lot of people they set goals like New Year&#8217;s resolutions and they&#8217;re like, I want to work out more and that&#8217;s their goal. And they end up not actually pursuing it oftentimes in part because it&#8217;s not specific. It&#8217;s like, well does that mean you need to work out three times a week, minimum, for the rest of the year, and what are your goals and what are your outcomes and expectations out of that?</p>\n<p>Ada: Right. Yes. I actually tapped into this HabitShare app in addition to that and specifically with the fitness goal, it was actually, Q1 was like, okay, get to once a week, twice a week, Q3, is at three times a week. And so that&#8217;s actually how I&#8217;ve been tracking and achieving it.</p>\n<p>Ryan: Love it.</p>\n<p>Andrew: Okay. So one of my favorite things on Twitter is I, I tried to do this at least once a year where I will just screenshot my, my homescreen and then I&#8217;ll just ask everybody else to just do the same and then like reply and it&#8217;s really cool. First of all it&#8217;s a very personal thing what your home screen is and so I always have to look at it and be like, is there anything like weird on here I don&#8217;t want, a stealth beta company —</p>\n<p>Ryan: — Right, right, exactly. Yeah, stuff like that.</p>\n<p>Andrew: Exactly. And then, and then similarly like looking at other people&#8217;s homescreens are really interesting. Like occasionally you&#8217;ll see people where they&#8217;ll, they&#8217;ll like sort their homescreen by like color and that&#8217;s how they organize everything and I&#8217;m just like, that&#8217;s insane. Anyway, so I was going to mention some of the apps that are like on my home screen these days. So I think one, as Ada mentioned, there&#8217;s an app called Captio which is great but this morning actually you had tweeted something that the Fin team had come out with a new app called Nota Bene, which is sort of like Captio on steroids. So I actually just installed, I put it on my home screen, I&#8217;m actually really excited to try it.</p>\n<p>Ryan: Yeah. What, what does it allow you to do for those that aren&#8217;t familiar with Kaptio?</p>\n<p>Andrew: Right. So, basically both of these apps they allow you to, you basically open up the app, there&#8217;s a blank text screen, you type in whatever you want and then you just hit send and then it emails you. So that&#8217;s Captio. And then what Nota Bene does is it has a couple more aliases. It has things like, this is something that like I actually really want and need which is sending to my work email versus my home email. And then I might do like work email plus like admin, is a thing. And so I think that&#8217;s Fin&#8217;s hook to try to get you into the workflow, that way. But yeah. So, I think that that one I use all the time. I was mentioning that, for my first year on the job at Andreessen Horowitz, I moved down to downtown Palo Alto but I&#8217;m spending two days a week in the city and so one of the things that I&#8217;m finding is that, I&#8217;m trying different kinds of like, solutions for like, oh, if I want a place to hang out and do email, like what should I use? And so one of the things that I&#8217;ve been trying out over over the last couple months now has been Breather, which lets you rent , basically like a conference room that&#8217;s been built out and kind of doing meetings there. Another one is Spacious, which just got launched actually I think in the last couple of weeks. It&#8217;s a really cool concept. So what they do is they basically, you have these really high end restaurants, right? And like they have a very nice interior and all that stuff, but they&#8217;re basically closed the entire day all the way until like 5:00 PM. And so the idea is between nine to five or eight to five or whatever the hours are, can they actually just literally put like one person there and just have like coffee and water and then you use the interior of this beautiful restaurant. So one of the places in SF is the Press Club, right? Which is this great —</p>\n<p>Ryan: — Yeah, great spot.</p>\n<p>Andrew: It&#8217;s tons of space and so, you can basically just hang out in the press club during the day and it&#8217;s basically completely empty and it&#8217;s like —</p>\n<p>Ryan: — How much does it cost typically?</p>\n<p>Andrew: It&#8217;s like a membership basis. I think it&#8217;s like 90 bucks a month or something like that. And they have spots in Cole Valley and Hayes Valley and the Castro and a bunch of other places. Another one that&#8217;s kind of like this, it&#8217;s pretty interesting I think when I first heard this idea I like laughed because I thought it was so funny, but, but now I actually have like used it like in a real way which is a company called Recharge and that it lets you rent hotels by the minute. And so you&#8217;re kind of like, what is the use case for that? The actual use case is, you need a place to make a phone call. Right. And so in the same way that like Breather or Spacious, it&#8217;s like, it&#8217;s sort of like, oh well you have all this built-in inventory and like maybe you hold out a room —</p>\n<p>Ryan: — Or maybe just a shower. Some people are traveling, flying. I just need in between meetings to have a shower.</p>\n<p>Andrew: Right, right. And then you can pay like one fourth the price of a hotel, and like that actually is like kind of useful. So anyway, those are fun. I think I&#8217;m now up to, I&#8217;m trying one of these like kind of almost on a weekly basis which has been pretty cool.</p>\n<p>Andrew: We&#8217;re going to talk about Reddit a little bit? Yeah, because I&#8217;m like a daily active user. I don&#8217;t check it all the time, like I&#8217;d probably check it not as often as Twitter, but it&#8217;s like, it&#8217;s like my default late night read, when I want to just like chill out,</p>\n<p>Ryan: You can just turn your brain off. It&#8217;s different than Twitter, it&#8217;s different from any other community. I actually got a book, a pre-release book by Christine. She&#8217;s been writing about this for years now, about the history of Reddit. It&#8217;s about 400-500 pages long. You would enjoy it.</p>\n<p>Andrew: Well, I just bought a Alexis&#8217;s book that he had written a couple years ago, so yeah. I&#8217;ve been into Reddit for like several years now, but it&#8217;s funny, one of my good friends, Noah Kagan was literally like, you need to go to your favorite subreddits and sign up and follow and actually set up your Reddit and then it&#8217;s amazing.</p>\n<p>Ryan: Kind of like Twitter.</p>\n<p>Andrew: Exactly. Right. Right. And I think I didn&#8217;t get it because I would go to the homepage and I would kind of be like, well this is kinda fun, is this like another cat memes website or whatever? I think the one that I want to recommend that folks start out with is actually if you just go to the /bestof subreddit. So it&#8217;s like <a href=\"http://reddit.com/r/bestof\">reddit.com/r/bestof</a>. Then it basically just links to some of the best comments on Reddit over the last 24 hours and then you can actually sort it by the last month or something like that. So I think anyway, that that&#8217;s a good one. But yeah, I follow a ton of different subreddits at this point. The other one I really like is r/firstworldanarchists and that&#8217;s basically, when you have like a sign that&#8217;s like don&#8217;t step here and then someone takes a photo, like they&#8217;re stepping in the grass or whatever, that&#8217;s like my kind of like rule breaking. Anyway. So yeah, so there&#8217;s that. And then the one, one, one last thing I&#8217;ll mention is Bose Quiet Comfort — the wireless noise canceling things as I&#8217;ve been commuting from SF and Palo Alto are like amazing. And so they actually have an app that lets you like adjust, how much noise cancellation you want so I use it all the time.</p>\n<p>Ryan: These are the ones that just go in your ear, right? Kinda like Airpods?</p>\n<p>Andrew: Right. The battery actually hangs on your neck and then they go into your ear. So they&#8217;re not over-ear, they&#8217;re the ones that go in. But I actually, I have both and yeah, I prefer this one the most and I like bring it with me everywhere at this point.</p>\n<p>Ryan: Do you live on, on Reddit at all Ada?</p>\n<p>Ada: I&#8217;m probably a weekly active user. I check it in and I just like to see r/bestof and see what people are talking about. But you&#8217;re right. I mean it&#8217;s such a, it&#8217;s such a passive way to kind of see a lot of interesting content stream by.</p>\n<p>Ryan: What&#8217;s also nice about Reddit in a world where content is delivered by algorithms and people you follow and things like that, like on Twitter and Facebook and so on. It&#8217;s kind of refreshing to go to a place like Reddit where you can get out of your bubble and you can explore the weirdest stuff if you really want to. It&#8217;s not socially curated, it&#8217;s not personally curated necessarily to like everything that Reddit knows about you, but it&#8217;s really a community of people geeking out about this stuff. One of my favorite subreddits, I don&#8217;t visit Reddit all that often, I try to actually avoid it because it&#8217;s kind of a rabbit hole, but one subreddit I love is called r/internetisbeautiful and we&#8217;ll find there&#8217;s actually a lot of really weird projects and websites and little hacks that people are building and it&#8217;s almost always delightful. You go there and find something weird, just some crazy website that someone created and the name, r/internetisbeautiful is just such a wonderful feeling. It&#8217;s really, really well crafted subreddit. Cool. Thanks for having me over here. By the way, is there anything else you&#8217;d like to to plug — anything in the portfolio maybe Andrew? Or anything at Notejoy, Ada?</p>\n<p>Andrew: We were talking about how when when you were just signing in at Andreessen Horowitz, I was like, oh, you should install the Envoy app. Yeah. Because it makes it so much easier. You literally get a photo of your face on it and you just tap on it and then like, and you go in and it works over Bluetooth. So anyway, so I always like to plug Envoy, it&#8217;s one of our portfolio companies.</p>\n<p>Ryan: I mentioned this earlier, but we didn&#8217;t get into it. Envoy is such an interesting company. I&#8217;m fascinated by social graphs and when you look at the uniqueness of a social graph like Twitter and Facebook and LinkedIn and, and I think some of the most interesting ones that are less talked about is one, like Slack is very interesting, like the people that are in your Slack team or the people that you actually work with, no one else has access to that sort of graph right now. And Envoy is also really fascinating. It&#8217;s like a graph of the people and business partners and people that you&#8217;re meeting at your company. No one else has that.</p>\n<p>Andrew: Well, I mean I think it wouldn&#8217;t surprise you to know that the CEO, Larry, was actually really early employee at Twitter. Right. And so a lot of the sort of thinking around both the product experience and just like how nice it is. I think we&#8217;ve gotten to, to this whole trend now where your office and your office experience is this extension of your brand. And so now people like really care about it. So they don&#8217;t want like this kind of kludgy pen and paper thing. And that product experience is so important. But to your point on the graph is, totally agree — I think that&#8217;s also one of the reasons why it&#8217;s like, Envoy&#8217;s pretty special in sort of the pantheon of these like B2B companies in that it actually grows virally. Like the way that the company grows is that people experience it and they&#8217;re like wow, this is really nice. And then as soon as they go back to their office they&#8217;re like we should have one. And there&#8217;s really not that many products that grow that way. Dropbox grows that way, Slack grows that way. It&#8217;s like a viral B2B thing. And so I think, in, in the same way it&#8217;s like that, that graph means that not only is it spreading virally and enables that spread, but then the other part I think is wow, okay, cool, you get a list of all the people that are visiting and who they&#8217;re visiting and then that can then feed into like all your other like, offline data.</p>\n<p>Ryan: Or CRM.</p>\n<p>Andrew: Yeah, so you take your offline data and turn it into online stuff and it&#8217;s another touchpoint which is super important.</p>\n<p>Ryan: You don&#8217;t have Envoy at the headquarters, Ada?</p>\n<p>Ada: No.</p>\n<p>Andrew: I think she has a doorbell.</p>\n<p>Ryan: Old school doorbell. So yeah, what&#8217;s down the pipe?</p>\n<p>Ada: What&#8217;s new on the pipe is that we&#8217;ve actually been doing a ton of mobile enhancements and so we&#8217;re actually bringing Android very soon in terms of bringing it out as an app. It&#8217;s interesting now because the bar for consumer and business apps is so much higher than it used to be, right? Like it&#8217;s actually really important to be fully multi-platform, so we&#8217;ve always had Mac and PC and then the browser and we&#8217;ve had iOS but it&#8217;s really exciting to actually bring that to Android because that&#8217;s been a big factor for a lot of teams that are trying to adopt Notejoy as an overall group and so yeah, just cranking and hard at work.</p>\n<p>Ryan: Cool. Awesome. Well thanks for coming on. This will be the first of hopefully many brother-sister Product Hunt Radio shows.</p>\n<p>Andrew: Awesome.

First it was big in Japan, then teens. Now we all use it. Then it was baked into Slack and everything else. (Btw, this is an amazing read of pre-smart phone Japanese mobile: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_mobile_phone_culture …)</p>\n<p>Want to know what B2B communication/collaboration will look like in 5 years? It&#8217;s inevitable that livestreaming, virtual goods, asynch video, etc all eventually end up in the enterprise. There&#8217;s a 3-5 year lag, but it definitely happens</p>\n<p>TikTok is a great example that&#8217;s mid-phase.

What’s your biggest miss so far in tech?</strong></p>\n<p>In terms of a totally wrong / bad prediction.

I managed to fix that bad prediction <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f60e.png\" alt=\"😎\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>11. What is your least popular but deeply held opinion on tech/startups? <a href=\"https://twitter.com/andrewchen/status/1025817195174080512\">Lively discussion here</a></strong></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>12. The Law of Shitty Cohorts.</strong></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not unusual for a startup to have &#8220;meh&#8221; retention. But then usually, team says it will improve retention via better activation, lifecycle marketing, improving product features, etc.</p>\n<p>But the law of shitty cohorts says this is unlikely to happen.</p>\n<p>The reason is that the early cohorts of users &#8212; let&#8217;s say the first couple million or so &#8212; are usually your best cohorts. They found you via word of mouth, they are the early adopters of tech, and you have no market saturation yet.</p>\n<p>However, as you scale, each cohort gets worse</p>\n<p>In rideshare, all the urban dwelling power users who don&#8217;t have cars, and use apps every day &#8211; they&#8217;ve all signed up. Now we&#8217;re acquiring rural/suburban users who have cars and only use it to get to the airport. Huge difference.</p>\n<p>When you buy users with paid ads, it&#8217;s even worse</p>\n<p>So even while teams improve their product, activation, and lifecycle, there&#8217;s an opposite (and sometimes even stronger force!) of worse cohorts joining your product over time.</p>\n<p>(Inspired by the <a href=\"https://andrewchen.co/the-law-of-shitty-clickthroughs/\">Law of Shitty Clickthroughs</a>)</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>13. My order of operations when I sit down with a startup to figure out how to grow their new product.</strong></p>\n<p>1) first, is it working?<br />\nUsually the answer is no :) I look at retention rates, DAU/MAU, session lengths, how many visits are driven via push notifs, etc etc. Lots of benchmarking</p>\n<p>2) if it is working, then how do we scale it?<br />\nI look at the acquisition mix &#8212; how are new users finding the product? Are they using all the channels that other similar products are already doing?</p>\n<p>If there&#8217;s something that&#8217;s working, can we scale it to be much, much larger?</p>\n<p>3) what can we do in the product to amplify all of the above?</p>\n<p>Since product is expensive to build, let&#8217;s focus on top of funnel and work all the way down. Optimizing acquisition, then activation, then retention/churn, then reactivation (for later stage)</p>\n<p>Tbh, #1 is the hardest!</p>\n<p>Longer discussion on this <a href=\"https://andrewchen.co/investor-metrics-deck/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>14. The Head/Heart/Hands framework </strong></p>\n<p>Or in emoji form, <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f469.png\" alt=\"👩\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />/<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2764.png\" alt=\"❤\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />/<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/270b.png\" alt=\"✋\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />- for company cultures and personalities at work. The idea is that every work culture can be described as a pie chart of these three factors. (credit to my friends/coworkers at Uber who first described to me)</p>\n<p>Not only does each company have this breakdown, so does each individual on the team. And the more their individual profile matches that of the overall company, the more in sync they are, the easier it is to get things done. Or that&#8217;s the theory.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f469.png\" alt=\"👩\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> Head = how much of the culture emphasizes analytical ability, strategy, planning, etc. Cultures that are strong at this do a lot of analysis, information gathering, etc to try and make the right choices, but sometimes at the cost of moving quickly or bringing everyone along</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2764.png\" alt=\"❤\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> Heart = how much the culture emphasizes team cohesion + happiness. Teams that do this invest a lot on internal values, having a clear mission, making decisions that consider the team&#8217;s views, not just business outcomes. Lots of obvious downsides when this goes too far, too</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/270b.png\" alt=\"✋\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />Hands = how much the culture emphasizes action, and getting things done. Cultures that do this can move quickly, are iterative, and are agile in the market. But they break things, can have a &#8220;fire first, aim later&#8221; mentality where a lot of energy is wasted</p>\n<p>People said Uber 1.0 was a 30% head, 5% heart, 65% hands kind of place. Ridiculously indexed on action. Often doing the wrong thing for the first few iterations, but with so much activity, things would get figured out later. Needed more love for drivers and team though</p>\n<p>Another startup that I&#8217;m close with, which will be unnamed, is more like 30% head, 50% heart, 20% hands. Great culture, people were close friends, didn&#8217;t get much done. Yet another is 70% head, 20% heart, 10% hands. Incredibly intelligent but doesn&#8217;t ship.</p>\n<p>I like this framework in that it says, hey, there&#8217;s no right tradeoff &#8211; it&#8217;s just different. Some industries require hardcore orientation in one way, and others in another way. The VC industry doesn&#8217;t need 75% hands, for instance</p>\n<p>Similarly, if someone&#8217;s not working out in one culture- they might in another culture, where things resonate. Perhaps they are too action-oriented in a place that requires a lot more deep thinking because decisions are hard to reverse. Again, there&#8217;s no &#8220;best&#8221; working style</p>\n<p>As with Myers-Briggs, this exercise is more for fun, than science. However, you&#8217;d be surprised by how interesting of a conversation it generates. Ask someone to break down their company&#8217;s head/heart/hands, and press for examples. You&#8217;ll learn a ton</p>\n<p>When you&#8217;re interviewing at a company, this can be a fun thing to ask. Otherwise if you ask &#8220;what&#8217;s the company culture like?&#8221; you&#8217;ll often just get generic stuff like, &#8220;oh people are are so smart and nice.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A related question is: &#8220;What&#8217;s something that happens in this company culture that doesn&#8217;t at other places?&#8221; Or, &#8220;who&#8217;s the type of person who&#8217;s successful here who might not be at other places?&#8221; (or the reverse). Interesting to understand the contrasts</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>15. the LA consumer startup ecosystem</strong></p>\n<p>the LA consumer startup ecosystem is coming into its own &#8212; Honey, Snap, Riot Games, Tinder, Bird, Dollar Shave Club.</p>\n<p>The most $1B+ consumer startups outside of the Bay Area?</p>\n<p>A few years back, I might have guessed that NYC would be the emerging leader. But pretty clear it&#8217;s LA.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>16. &#8220;The One That Didn&#8217;t Work Out.&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p>Startup founders, you know what I mean: We spend years on a product &#8211; starting it from scratch, recruiting friends, getting it off the ground. We think we&#8217;ll spend years on this. This is the one. We tell that to ourselves, investors, and friends</p>\n<p>We celebrate all the milestones we&#8217;re supposed to. The first office. First check in. The product launch. Fun emails from the first users. An important hire. Team dinners. These are wonderful, great memories!</p>\n<p>When it&#8217;s time to raise money, we tell potential investors that this is it. We&#8217;re gonna work on this for years, because we believe. And we do! But that&#8217;s not what happens&#8230;</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a messy second year. Traction&#8217;s not as good as what we want. Or maybe new users are showing up, but retention sucks. Some of the key hires leave. Fundraising isn&#8217;t as easy as it should be. Monetization is slow. It&#8217;s tough</p>\n<p>When things get hard, it&#8217;s easy to go into hermit mode. Don&#8217;t go to tech events, because people will ask how things are going, and you don&#8217;t want to pretend it&#8217;s great. Because it&#8217;s not. Easier to stay at home and watch Netflix</p>\n<p>You know the end of this story: A few years in, the once shiny new startup acquired by a larger company. Or it&#8217;s shut down. People maybe even make a ton of money. But the team splits up. The product that you stared at, every day, for years, gets shut down. It&#8217;s time to move on</p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s hard to move on. It feels weird to walk past your old office. You don&#8217;t talk to your team anymore. You move your old photos, old decks, old prototypes into a folder deep in your Dropbox drive. Better to not think about it!</p>\n<p>Yes, this is a story of my own journey for a startup I had years ago that didn&#8217;t work out. But I know it&#8217;s not just me. It&#8217;s many of my friends, and many of you, who are on their new startup, or a new big tech job, but still remember the one that didn&#8217;t work</p>\n<p>You may have seen the wonderful tweetstorm by @dflieb about Bump from 10 years ago. You can see how much he grew from his journey. Even though Bump didn&#8217;t thrive, it&#8217;s now part of Google Photos and the ideas impact hundreds of millions of people. He should be proud! https://twitter.com/dflieb/status/1050990035892199424</p>\n<p>The recent @andrewmason interview on Groupon is the same. You can tell how much he both cherished his experience and also how rough it was. Worth reading: https://twitter.com/andrewchen/status/1051576009454116867</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a wonderful journey that happens in the creation and ending of new products. The majority of startup journeys look like this &#8211; even in the success case &#8211; and we all learn a ton from building them. It&#8217;s an amazing experience, but also, it can be rough.</p>\n<p>If you have the same Dropbox folder I do, it&#8217;s time to open it up. Scroll through the old photos, open up the old decks. It may be the startup that didn&#8217;t work out, but it&#8217;s also the one that made you stronger and smarter.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>17. Uber alumni and the next generation of founders</strong></p>\n<p>There’s a TON of new startups coming from Uber alumni &#8211; I know of a half dozen in stealth, and Bird is already a breakout. It’s obv that the creativity and hustle required to make Uber work in its early years has trained hundreds of entrepreneurs. Very bullish on this group</p>\n<p>As y’all know, Uber had a very decentralized mode of operation with each city being run as its own company. Each GM owned their P&#38;L, hired their own people, and in the early years, would just put Facebook ads and other expenses on their credit cards! Great background</p>\n<p>The product teams looked like this too. We had a “Programs and Platforms” model courtesy of Amazon / @jeffholden where each program was full stack, and the PMs ran hard again their mission/KPIs without introducing interdependencies</p>\n<p>For everyone who joined in the early years &#8211; 2010 to 2014 &#8211; they’ve already hit their 4 year mark and many are spinning out. The really early folks are investing. Folks like @williampbarnes @joshmohrer have formed angel groups supporting alumni spinouts (and other startups too!)</p>\n<p>From an investor standpoint, myself, @fffabulous @akad have all joined venture firms ready to invest in the next generation</p>\n<p>The ATG / Otto folks are making moves as well. My good friend @drewjgray joined as CTO of the autonomous startup @voyage with @olivercameron. Also Kodiak, Kache, and many others.</p>\n<p>Let’s talk about my fav topic, <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f6f4.png\" alt=\"🛴\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />. @limebike has folks like my good friend @uber_ed_baker as an advisor, and is slowly collecting ex-Uber alumni (and Lyft! And other on-demand folks). Bird’s exec team consists of Uber’s prev “Supply growth” team &#8211; @travisv, RF, Schnell, others</p>\n<p>Not everyone is doing startups, of course. Lots of folks on “sabbataquit” &#8211; Uber’s policy of allowing sabbaticals after 3 years of work means that people often do this before leaving. And then they keep traveling, sometimes for a year+. Many folks doing that</p>\n<p>Whether they are starting, joining, or on sabbatical, it’s clear that this group knows a lot of important, venture-fundable markets well.

What do you look for in an investment?</strong></p>\n<p>This one is hard to answer generically — it’s easy to say, great team! Or big market! Or technology differentiation! Or something generic like that. However, being in venture capital is about being in the “exceptions” business.</p>\n<p>There were hundreds of mobile photo apps prior to Instagram and Snapchat, and they would have been money-losing investments. Same for social networks before Facebook, or there were more than a dozen investor-backed search engines before Google.</p>\n<p>My job is to find the exception to the rule, and pick an individual company that will stand out, and I don’t have to be bullish about an entire category of companies. In practice, this happens also because individually, I’m focused on doing 2–3 investments per year, and don’t have the capacity to, say, invest in every single company working on XYZ.</p>\n<p>All of that said, beyond the obvious things (team, market, product, etc.) there are a few things that make me lean into understanding a company, in particular.</p>\n<p>First, it’s interesting when a startup using a new platform or a new technology in a clever way. For example, Instagram Stories and Snap Stories are a huge new short-form video format, and an app that might interact with these stories in an interesting way might be compelling. Or because esports is so huge, if someone builds on the idea that perhaps games content could be streamable-first, then that’s intriguing too. Taking advantage of a new technology helps answer the “Why now?” question and explains why it’s a fresh opportunity that should be tried. If your new startup could have been built 15 years ago, perhaps the idea’s already been tried and just isn’t that good.</p>\n<p>Second, technology changes constantly but people stay the same. And their motivations — in particular, to spend time with friends, to date, to be able to earn more, to find better work over their careers, to take care of their pets, etc., etc. — also stay constant over time. So when a new startup purports to create new consumer behavior, I’m sometimes skeptical. But if a product allows people to tap into a pre-existing motivation but in a new, fresh way, then I’m interested.</p>\n<p>Third, I like to see a strong insight around how the product will grow. For example, it’s important if a new video streaming startup, for instance, has deep relationships with the YouTube/Instagram influencer community to get it off the ground. Or if a new workplace collaboration tool is built to tap into calendars and be inherently viral through cal invites. The reason for this is that we are in an interesting era of new technology products where in general building the technology is not all that hard. Startups typically don’t fail because of technology issues, given open source, AWS, lots of collaboration tools, a network of smart people, etc., etc. This used to be the case decades ago, but these days, startups fail because they don’t get traction in the market. As a result, I like to see something clever and insightful in how the product will get off the ground — especially if it’s driven by viral growth, or some form of organic, as opposed to paid marketing.</p>\n<p>Usually at the stage where I am seeing companies, one of the big things I’m evaluating for is “it works!” I usually look at their growth metrics, cohort charts, acquisition mix, engagement data, etc., and try to make sure that it’s sticky now and will remain so over time. Once I validate this, then I move onto some of the bigger qualitative questions like the ones above — what’s the trick that makes it grow? Why now? What new technology does it exploit? What classic human motivation does it tap into?</p>\n<p>And finally, I want to reiterate that it’s all about finding the exceptions. You can spend as much time as you want analyzing a space, but it’s just about picking the individual startup you like most.</p>\n<p>[PS. <a href=\"https://andrewchen.co/consumer-startups-at-a16z/\">Here&#8217;s also a deck I published a few months back</a> that is the more visual, longer-form answer to this question]</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>2. How long should a founder be without salary?</strong></p>\n<p>I’m a believer in free markets, and also in thinking long-term.</p>\n<p>When founders first get their company off the ground, they often take risk and go without salary. However, as soon as they raise a real amount of money — either from institutional seed funds, a large group of friends/family, or with a VC — I think the founders should pay themselves basically market rate (within reason)</p>\n<p>The reason for this, especially if there are cofounders, is that starting a company is already hard enough. Your customers are leaving you, recruiting is hard, employees will occasionally quit. It’s hard to think long term, about all of this when you&#8217;re worried about your paycheck.</p>\n<p>If on top of all of this stress, the founders are paying themselves way below market, to the point where they are burning their savings, that’s just not a good thing. It creates a lot of stress, and unwanted behavior from the perspective of an investor.</p>\n<p>Obviously if there’s a case where the founders were highly compensated before and it would impact the runway, OK, then great, there’s an opportunity to trade off a longer runway by capping the cash compensation. If the team wants to do that, great.</p>\n<p>But in general, I believe in market rates for everyone, including the founders and the employees, within reason.</p>\n<p>[PS. I tweeted this out and my friend <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Suhail/status/1107042429100650496\">Suhail Doshi responded</a> with a pretty cool rule of thumb:</p>\n<blockquote><p>My rule of thumb is&#8230;<br />\n&#8211; seed funding: what you’d pay your lowest paid employee<br />\n&#8211; when you’re growing a bit: your lowest paid engineer<br />\n&#8211; scaling: mid level engineer<br />\n&#8211; successful: market for ceo pay<br />\n&#8211; not growing: cut back to your previous comp until you are / helps survive</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is pretty great. Thanks Suhail!]</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>3. What distribution channels should a new consumer internet startup consider in 2019?</strong></p>\n<p>First, let me start with the negative. It’s been said (and written) that we are kind of in a funky consumer internet winter, compared to 2007 when we had the Facebook platform and the iOS/Android platforms and so on. As a result, the conclusion is that there’s a general industry malaise and everything sucks and we should all go home, etc., etc.</p>\n<p>It’s my conclusion that this is a vastly overhyped POV about consumer.</p>\n<p>Last year, when Fortnite went from zero to 200M+ users, how could you not be excited about consumer tech? Or where we see Kylie Jenner built a multi-hundred million dollar revenue stream selling stuff on Instagram? Or you have a content creator like Ryan, the kid that makes unboxing videos, generating $20M+ per year?</p>\n<p>There’s a lot of exciting opportunities out there. In my first few months at a16z, I met hundreds of companies in my first 3 months. Hundreds! There’s a lot of innovation and entrepreneurs out there trying to do great things.</p>\n<p>Yes, it’s true that you can’t just build well-designed social photo apps and still expect to succeed. You have to do something different, and evolve with the time. But IMHO there are still fantastic opportunities.</p>\n<p>OK, now going past the preamble and answering the question directly:</p>\n<p>The best distribution channels for your startup are the ones that only make sense for your product to use — meaning it’s proprietary, and people can’t just tap into the same channel right away. The problem with Facebook ads as a channel, for instance, is that if you’re a mattress startup buying ads, you’re not just competing against all the other mattress companies but you’re also competing with the cool new protein shake company. Contrast that to Dropbox, which has primarily grown using shared folders inside the workplace — they own that channel, and the only others who could compete on that are folks who have some kind of shared folder functionality. The performance of the channel is unlikely to degrade over time via competition because it’s proprietary.</p>\n<p>If you agree, then the obvious question is, if I’m a startup looking for a proprietary channel, which one do I use? That’s hard to answer generically, so I won’t attempt to do so. However, the better observation is that if you are starting a brand new company, then you have the opportunity to both pick the idea — and have a hypothesis about product/market fit — as well as to pick its growth strategy at the same time. If you can think about both at its inception, then you can start thinking about a proprietary channel from day 1.</p>\n<p>I think this is not the answer the person who wrote the question wanted to hear, so let me also try to give some more trend-driven ideas too.</p>\n<p>I like video. There’s a lot of video being created and consumed, and I like the idea of a “video-native” product that is designed to create a lot of video as part of user engagement. Or create a lot of opportunities for streaming.</p>\n<p>I like social data in the workplace. If you are building a workplace collaboration tool, whether it’s horizontal like Slack or more vertical like Figma, most of the files and systems you touch understand who all the users are inside the company. In particular, the calendar is a very rich data asset full of people and their relationships, and I feel that’s underleveraged by startups seeking to grow. I love the pattern of putting, say, ZOOM links, inside of calendar requests, and think more startups might end up finding opportunities to do the same.</p>\n<p>I also like “in-real-life virality.” If you walk around and see a bunch of lime green scooters, and people are using them, then you will want to try it too. Magically, no customer acquisition cost! Or if you see people walking around playing Pokemon Go, then you might want to try it also, since they are out and about, and enjoying it so much. I think this is an underrated channel.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>4. What investment have you made that is the most out there?</strong></p>\n<p class=\"ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start\">One day I was in the Mission district of San Francisco, and saw a huge line of people. I wondered what they were waiting for, and naturally, the curiosity got the best of me and I got in line too. As I looked around in line, I read the sign for the place. There was a huge aardvark icon, and lettering that said BOBA GUYS.</p>\n<p class=\"ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start\">I had heard of Boba Guys before, and remember that every time I saw one of their stores, I would skip it because the line was too long. Business was that good.</p>\n<p class=\"ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start\">While waiting, I tried to google to figure out who their founders were. No luck. Eventually I found a Kickstarter page with some info, for a store they had opened near Union Square, and found their names. Just my luck, they were already following me on Twitter. I DM’d them, ordered my boba — hong kong style with pearls — and waited.</p>\n<p class=\"ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start\">A week later, they replied. We met for lunch near Hayes Valley, and I didn’t know what to expect. Maybe I could invest money into this thing? Did I even want to? It’s just milk and tea, right? But so was Coca Cola, or Starbucks, or Blue Bottle.</p>\n<p class=\"ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start\">To my surprise, both Andrew and Bin were fantastic. They had great consumer packaged goods experience, had worked at Timbuk2, and came with a 20-slide deck prepared. The deck had retail comps versus other high-end stores, financial projections, and more. It blew my mind. These were very obviously the most talented bubble tea store operators on the planet.</p>\n<p class=\"ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start\">As a quick segue, I had been going to pitches for high-end restaurants with a few friends prior to that, but had never invested. Going to a restaurant pitch was extremely fun, as you went with a group of friends, met the chef, and they made the entire food menu and all the drinks too. You hung out and could invest after. But I never liked the model because it felt like it could never scale. It’d be a fun hobby, but it’d be hard to make money. But it helped prepare my mind for investing in retail, and a beverage play like Boba Guys.</p>\n<p class=\"ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start\">Back to bubble tea, I realized after the pitch that although it wasn’t a tech company, I should figure out a way to invest. Andrew, Bin, and I had a great conversation — the first of many, and then I rallied some of my friends to put a syndicate together to invest.</p>\n<p class=\"ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start\">The bonus to all of this is that I now have a Boba Guys Black Card. This is a special investor card that lets me get my daily bubble tea fix for free. It’s amazing, and the investment was worth it just for the bragging rights with that.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><strong>5. Which commonly-discussed growth metrics in consumer tech businesses are the most meaningless and/or misleading?</strong></p>\n<div class=\"u-serif-font-main--large\">\n<div class=\"ui_qtext_expanded\">\n<p class=\"ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start\">These are the obvious offenders:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cumulative charts for anything. These can only go up and to the right</li>\n<li>Registered users. Totally useless, although sometimes I like to ask about this as a ratio to active users to get a sense for how efficiently the user acquisition is happening</li>\n<li>Any retention metrics that aren’t standardized into cohort curves. Sometimes people will give a single snapshot number, like a “3 months later, X% still use the app!” and that’s not that helpful</li>\n<li>Install numbers, without signups or activated signups or something more meaningful</li>\n<li>For marketplace companies, “revenue” that’s actually “gross bookings” or GMV. Or GMV that counts in weird things, like security deposits or one-time setup charges</li>\n<li>ARR meaning, “annual revenue run rate” as opposed to “annual recurring revenue.” Please, let’s just stick to ARR for recurring, not run rate. Thanks.</li>\n<li>Taking the peak revenue of any single day and annualizing it as the headline number</li>\n<li>Unlabeled X and Y axes in charts</li>\n<li>Cohort curves that are some complex subset of users that make the retention look better</li>\n<li>Showing “CAC” that’s actually blended CAC, and when you just look at the Paid CAC, it’s way above LTV</li>\n<li>Actually LTV. Because who really cares about the lifetime of a user — startups should just manage to margin earned by a customer you acquire over the first 6–12 months, not the lifetime. That’s how you will make your ad spend decisions</li>\n<li>Any misleading ratios where the denominator and numerator are totally non-obvious. Stick to actives, please.</li>\n<li>Active user definitions that are complicated (must have visited 3 sessions in the last week, and done one action out of a list of 5). It makes all the downstream calculations on retention, engagement, etc., misleading since you’re throwing away all the data for the less active users</li>\n<li>If you have a desktop app, and web, and mobile, break down the metrics for all three. Don’t combine, please</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start\">There are many, many more… but that’s a quick start.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"w48jJbSd29\"></div>\n<div><strong>6. What is your advice for startup CEOs?</strong></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<p class=\"ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start\">I have a lot of advice, but maybe I will share the top 10 that come into my head:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You’re not doing this alone. You have friends, family, your investors, and employees rooting you on. Talk to them</li>\n<li>Everything seems like it sucks — metrics go up and down. Customers leave. An employee quits. Product/market fit could be a lot better. But this is how it feels even if it’s a rocket ship. Important to put into perspective</li>\n<li>Your job changes dramatically over time. Your first job is to build the machine — the product that attracts the customers, and generates the revenue. But eventually it turns into a job where you’re building the machine that builds the machine. It’s all about hiring, leading, managing, etc., etc. Prepare for this to feel weird when it transitions — especially spending 25%+ of your time hiring</li>\n<li>Everyone’s gotten very data-driven these days, which is great, but you should set your strategy, and then your metrics should follow. It’s to verify that your strategy is working — having a lot of dashboards is no substitute for strong product insight and strategy.</li>\n<li>Some people say to stay off Twitter and forget the distraction. I say the opposite &#8211; find interesting, knowledgeable people from social media, and DM them to meet in person. Stay outbound. Use it for recruiting, networking, fundraising and more.</li>\n<li>Raising money is a really, really important thing. It can feel like a great milestone, but it’s just the beginning.</li>\n<li>Ben Horowitz’s book The Hard Things About Hard Things is the best book about being a CEO and managing your own psychology as you set out to do this crazy hard thing. It’s fantastic. Read and re-read it.</li>\n<li>Also read and re-read High Output Management by Andy Grove.</li>\n<li>Build long-term relationships with your employees, investors, and people in the ecosystem. Hopefully your startup thrives, but maybe it won’t — and you’ll still want to build a long-term network because there will be more to do in the future</li>\n<li>Don’t worry about generic startup advice — including lists like this one :) Make sure you find advice that’s tailored to your startup’s stage, industry, and specific situation. Talk to experts who are willing to dig in.

And since I&#8217;m focused mostly on consumer companies &#8211; is there anything exciting happening? After all, if we&#8217;re &#8220;between&#8221; platforms, and there isn&#8217;t something as big as the iPhone coming up, is there anything interesting left?</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m really bullish about what&#8217;s around the corner &#8211; and I want to unpack what I&#8217;m looking for, how I&#8217;ve drawn insights from history, and what&#8217;s around the corner. In the 70 slide deck below, I cover a couple key concepts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Accelerating technology adoption</strong>. Why the telephone took 50+ years to adopt, but the mobile phone was &#60;10 years</li>\n<li>Three historical examples and their modern antecedents\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Content marketing</strong>. The origin of the Michelin Guide and why content marketing still works</li>\n<li><strong>Viral growth</strong>. How chain letters were invented and rethinking its effectiveness in the framework of viral growth</li>\n<li><strong>Marketplaces</strong>. How to bootstrap marketplace businesses and the cold-start problem, and what the story of toothpaste can tell us about that</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The most exciting new technologies coming around the corner, and how to evaluate them for producing new startups\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Video</strong>. Why video is big, and will get even bigger</li>\n<li><strong>Offline</strong>. How the <a href=\"https://andrewchen.co/irl-channel/\">offline-to-online channel</a> has been used by scooters and rideshare, to great effect</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>My investing thesis</strong>. The intersection of growth hacking, new tech, and pre-existing consumer motivations</li>\n<li><strong>Closing</strong>. Technology changes, but people stay the same</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I presented all of this at the Andreessen Horowitz Summit in 2018, which gathers our portfolio companies, partners, LPs, and close friends. It&#8217;s great to be able to publish it here as well. Hope you enjoy it.</p>\n<p>Another note is that this is closely related to, and complimentary, to this deck: <a href=\"https://andrewchen.co/investor-metrics-deck/\">The red flags and magic numbers that investors look for in your startup’s metrics.</a> If the below deck is the macro view of how I&#8217;m looking at markets, industries, and technologies, then the metrics deck gives my POV on how to diligence each company.</p>\n<p>Finally, before I jump in, it&#8217;s true that I talk about what sectors I&#8217;m into as well &#8211; and here are few areas I&#8217;m digging into:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unbundling my Uber expertise\n<ul>\n<li>Marketplaces (particularly the $10T service economy &#8211; <a href=\"https://andrewchen.co/how-marketplaces-will-reinvent-the-service-economy/\">more on that here</a>)</li>\n<li>Transportation and travel</li>\n<li>The future of work (Bottoms up SaaS, full-stack autonomy, etc)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Next generation entertainment and networks of people+content\n<ul>\n<li>eSports, gaming, virtual worlds</li>\n<li>Reinventing traditional media (Podcasting, eBooks, etc)</li>\n<li>Content creator / influencer economy</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>&#8230; plus, anything else that looks like a network with network effects</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Obviously if you are working on anything in this area, and have some traction in the US, would love to talk more.

But to hit this topic, I want to start by zooming out. Here&#8217;s a graph of many of the new consumer technologies that have been introduced in the US over the past 100 years. The X-axis is years, and the Y-axis is the % of US households that tech reached.</p>\n<p>Each line represents a different technology &#8211; you can see the car, the radio, air conditioning, the microwave, and so on. Lots of important consumer tech that was new at some point. But you also see something pretty interesting &#8211; some of the most important tech took decades to adopt.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at the telephone, in particular.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.003-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>Above: Now, remember that the motivation of communicating with your friends and family has been around since the dawn of time. But when you look at the phone, it took 5 decades to break into the majority of US households. Wow! And of course at the time, there were other technologies competing for engagement &#8211; there was the telegraph, postal mail, etc. In fact, early on the phone was marketed as the &#8220;speaking telegraph.&#8221; Nevertheless, for something we now take for granted, several decades is a long time.</p>\n<p>Why is that?</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.004-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>Above: Here&#8217;s why. These were the kinds of instructions that had to be packaged alongside the Bell Telephone System &#8211; how to hold the phone, which side went to your ear and which side was next to your mouth. And if someone called, you were supposed to say hello!</p>\n<p>While the human motivation was there to speak to friends and family, we had to build the behavior from scratch.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.005-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>Above: Let&#8217;s contrast this to the cell phone, which took a much shorter time to conquer the market. And in fact, if you were to think about the next few years after it hit mass penetration in the US households, we also know it hit several billion active handsets worldwide. Some developing countries are truly mobile-first &#8211; they have mobile phones before they have computers, land lines, or reliable access to water.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.006-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>Above: Each new technology is able to build on each other. You can use radio ads to market the TV. You can use the TV to market mobile phone services. And so we see an accelerating adoption rate of new technology introduction.</p>\n<p>What a time to be alive! It&#8217;s only going to go faster.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.007-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>Above: And yet, even with the backdrop of all of these new technologies, we are still fundamentally the same people from many eras ago. We haven&#8217;t physically changed much.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.008-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>Above: We are the same humans who painted the walls of caves, because we love art, and love creativity.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.009-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>Above: We are the same people who built massive theaters, because we love to be entertained.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.010-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>We took selfies as soon as the technology allowed.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.011-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>&#8230; and it turns out, we have always loved scooters. In fact, the US Postal Service tried these gas-powered units out to deliver mail a century ago.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.012-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>Above: In other words, while technology changes rapidly, people stay the same. And that&#8217;s the opportunity.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.013-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>When we spot new startups who can take advantage of a moment in time, at the intersection of new technology, pre-existing human motivation, and can find a clever growth trick to get going &#8211; that&#8217;s exciting. That gets my attention.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s look at a couple historical examples where these kinds of intersections have happened, and also some modern echoes of their impact.</p>\n<p>First example, we&#8217;ll go back in time.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.014-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>Above: It&#8217;s 1900, and there&#8217;s a new technology &#8211; cars. But there&#8217;s only 3,000 automobiles in France, because they&#8217;re hand-made, they break down all the time, and it&#8217;s not actually clear why they are superior to horses.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.015-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>Above: They look like this.</p>\n<p>In the introduction of these new technology, there forms an ecosystem of new companies that stand to benefit from more cars on the road. There&#8217;s gas stations, there&#8217;s maintenance businesses, and there&#8217;s also tires.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.016-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>Above: One of these companies you&#8217;re familiar with &#8211; they&#8217;re called the Michelin Tire Company. And certainly you recognize the Michelin Man on the left over here.</p>\n<p>Now they have a tough problem to get their business to grow. Remember, there&#8217;s only 3,000 cars. Selling tires is hard because what you actually need is to get car owners to drive more, and to create more car owners as well. That&#8217;s tricky! It&#8217;s a very indirect problem that requires a clever solution.</p>\n<p>What was Michelin&#8217;s solution? We&#8217;re all familiar with the answer: They created the Michelin Guide.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.017-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>Above: This small red book is one of the first Michelin Guides, given out with the subtitle, &#8220;Free for Drivers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This is a really clever effort for Michelin, because by packaging all the destination restaurants across France, and eventually Europe and the world, they gave people a reason to drive. And for existing automobile-owners, a reason to visit more towns and drive longer. And in fact, the Michelin Guide is so successful that many of us today don&#8217;t have much need for their tires, but certainly rely on their recommended restaurants.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.018-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>This is a great example of a &#8220;hack&#8221; that gets their core business growing. And today, we&#8217;d call it Content Marketing, and it still works.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s us a contemporary example that builds on their content marketing push.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.019-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>Google wants us all to be engaged in their mobile apps, search functions, and other properties &#8211; but they want to be relevant in our lives in other ways too, for example in our culture and media. One way Google does this is that they have a great app, called the &#8220;Google Arts and Culture&#8221; app, which demonstrates the world&#8217;s great works of art. They have virtual tours of museums, 360 degree photos, videos, and more.</p>\n<p>But the best feature they built is the &#8220;take a selfie and see what kind of famous artwork you resemble&#8221; feature. As we saw earlier, we&#8217;ve always been obsessed with selfies. So this was successful. Very, very successful.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.020-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>Above: We saw famous people like Kumail from HBO&#8217;s Silicon Valley take selfies and publish them &#8211; this is a pretty good one! And not only did celebrities  share their photos, many everyday consumers did too. A lot of them.</p>\n<p>This was so viral, in fact, that eventually this app was downloaded millions of times.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.021-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>In early 2018, it became the most downloaded app at that time. More than YouTube. More than Facebook. Wow! That&#8217;s fantastic.</p>\n<p>But what does this have to do with Google? This is such an indirect way for Google to tell their message, and to engage us in their products. But it&#8217;s a much fancier form of content marketing that lives in a mobile app. It worked for Michelin a hundred years ago, and it works for Google today too.</p>\n<p>The second example I&#8217;ll talk about is more of a consumer user-generated content play. It starts in 1775.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.022-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>Above: In 1775, the US Postal Service was founded!</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.023-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>You may know that this guy &#8211; Benjamin Franklin &#8211; started it.</p>\n<p>One way to think of the service, in contemporary jargon: The postal service was a new user-to-user communications platform that allows millions of consumers to communicate with each other for the first time. Before social media, and before email, the postal service let people do what we now take for granted.</p>\n<p>There are, of course, a lot of reasons to use the postal service &#8211; there&#8217;s personal correspondence, bills, advertising, and many other uses. But one of the major uses of mail came unexpectedly, and introduced millions of people to new ways to use mail &#8211; the chain letter! It turns out sometimes, as a platform, you&#8217;re super lucky, and your customers find new ways to engage and grow your service for you.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.024-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>In the photo above, you can see one of the world&#8217;s first chain letters. When enterprising individuals started to experiment with postal mail, they figured out they could get a ton of engagement when they worded the letters a certain way, and promised certain things.</p>\n<p>The variant above behaved like the following: When you received one, it asked you to remove the top name, add your name to the bottom of the list, and mail a new dime to everyone on the list. And then to share the chain letter with 5 of your friends within 3 days. Specific, clear call-to-actions. If you followed the instructions in the letter, you would receive 15,625 letters with $1,500+ in dimes. In today&#8217;s dollars, this is about $33,000. What a great outcome! For folks who&#8217;d never seen this kind of letter, and who saw their friends slowly getting rich &#8211; one dime at a time &#8211; this was enticing.</p>\n<p>These chain letters worked. In fact, they worked really well &#8211; too well. Within the first few months, this chain letter reached tens of millions of copies. It eventually became so successful that the US Postal Service had to shut it all down.</p>\n<p>And thus, to this day, chain letters are illegal to send on the US Postal Service!</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.025-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>The chain letter was a clever creation, of course, but today we&#8217;d just call this viral user acquisition. Getting people to tell their friends and family to spread the word is something that&#8217;s always worked &#8211; and it works today as well! The modern version is far more sophisticated.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.026-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>Above: Companies like Airbnb and Uber have referral programs, where you can send credits to your friends that can be redeemed on their trips. And you get credits in your account when they accept it too &#8211; it&#8217;s a reciprocal give/get program. Of course, we&#8217;ve improved the whole thing based on the latest tech. It integrates into Facebook Messenger and your email addressbook. It has tracking codes so you can see how well it circulates, and you A/B test the whole thing to make sure it&#8217;s highly optimized to be viral and spread.</p>\n<p>Yet in the end, the mechanics are the same &#8211; you can get people to tell their friends and family, if you make it enticing for them, and also for yourself.</p>\n<p>The last historical example I&#8217;ll use is a story about the &#8220;cold start&#8221; problem &#8211; but we&#8217;ll use grocery stories and toothpaste as our example.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.027-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>In the early 1900s, it was the dawn of consumer packaged goods companies, who were still figuring out their distribution models. Amazingly, many of the household goods that we&#8217;re now familiar with hadn&#8217;t been invented yet. People still weren&#8217;t really bathing on a regular basis. It was an earlier, simpler time for CPG companies.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.028-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>The amazing thing about the story of toothpaste &#8211; the above is a box by Pepsodent &#8211; is that toothpaste had to be invented. Even more amazing, people needed to be taught how to use toothpaste, and why.</p>\n<p>You could advertise to spread the word with consumers, of course, but there was a second problem: How do you get the toothpaste in the hands of consumers?</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4582\" src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.029-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.029-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.029-300x169.jpeg 300w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.029-768x432.jpeg 768w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.029.jpeg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p>\n<p>Above: Across the US, there were tons of &#8220;mom and pop&#8221; grocery stores like these. They needed to carry the toothpaste so that consumers could come in and buy them. The problem is, they don&#8217;t want to stock the toothpaste (which they would need to buy) if consumers weren&#8217;t asking for it. And of course, consumers wouldn&#8217;t ask for the product &#8211; at least you couldn&#8217;t count on it &#8211; unless it was in stock.</p>\n<p>This is a classic chicken and egg problem. So how do you solve this?</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.030-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>Above: The answer was simple: Advertising, and lots of it, and coupons too. First, it was important for the CPG companies to convince consumers that they had a yucky film on their teeth that could only be solved with toothpaste. And then they offered them coupons to come and try it.</p>\n<p>Before running a big campaign like this, they could go to the grocery stores and say, &#8220;We&#8217;re about to create a ton of consumer demand! Folks are going to come in and ask for toothpaste, so now&#8217;s the time to stock it.&#8221; This solves the chicken and egg.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.031-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>Solving the chicken and egg problem was hard then, and it&#8217;s hard now. And yet it&#8217;s something that every marketplace company has to do.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.032-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>Above: If this example sounds familiar, it&#8217;s because it was used recently by our portfolio company Instacart too. Today, Instacart has deep relationships with the nation&#8217;s top grocers. But when they first got started, they just built a great app, got consumers buying things, and started dispatching shoppers to pick up their orders. As more demand was built, eventually Instacart could approach the grocery chains and set up a formal partnership to make the experience even better.</p>\n<p>A hundred years ago, CPGs used advertising and coupons to drive demand to solve their chicken and egg. Today, startups use awesome mobile apps to create demand and to solve the same problem. It still works.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.033-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>Above: As you might imagine, you could go for hours on these kinds of historical examples.

And there are a ton of exciting ones right around the corner. But let&#8217;s first cover many of the new platforms that have hit major scale.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.037-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>We have IoT devices, particularly voice assistants that live inside Google Homes and Amazon Echoes.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.038-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>We have over a hundred million units of smart TV devices that combine media and computing. That&#8217;s exciting.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.039-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>We have platforms like YouTube with over a billion active users. Wow!</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.040-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>And wearables with hundreds of millions of units that sometimes run apps themselves, or help augment experiences on your phone.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.041-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>Not only there many platforms at scale, but it&#8217;s exciting to see a couple emerging categories as well.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.042-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>There are Nintendo Switches, which have sold tens of millions of units. They focus on games, of course, but you can run cloud-connected games like Fortnite. And perhaps people will creative about what kinds of other apps work too.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.043-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>All modern appliances are adding internet-connectivity. Fridges are an obvious one, but we all have seen Amazon add Alexa to microwaves too. What&#8217;s next after that??</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.044-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>There continue to be companies working on smart glasses. Above is from North, who are making Augmented Reality inside a pair of glasses that almost look identical to the ones you already have on your face. I think this will be a really compelling category in the next decade.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.045-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>And finally, as autonomous cars come out, we&#8217;ll have to rethink the entire driving experience to mostly be a riding experience. I expect a lot more video, gaming, and interactive media in the car. This is an emerging area too over the next decade.</p>\n<p>So there are a ton of new technologies right around the corner. We just need one or two to break out, in addition to the surefire opportunities around marketplaces, B2B, mobile, and other existing categories.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.046-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>The question is: Which platforms am I most excited about? What are examples of growth tactics that are working now that are super clever? In the intersection of the three things I mentioned earlier, what would I zoom in on?</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s talk through a couple.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.047-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>The first category of products I&#8217;d call &#8220;Video Native&#8221; products.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.048-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>Above: The new technology at scale is video. We already talked about how big it is &#8211; but let&#8217;s give a really concrete example.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.049-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>You all remember Gangnam Style, our favorite Korean pop song from 2013. And we&#8217;ve all heard Despacito (even if you don&#8217;t know you have). <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJQP7kiw5Fk\">Here&#8217;s the link if you need a refresher</a>.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kJQP7kiw5Fk\" width=\"600\" height=\"320\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Both videos are very popular, and have been viewed billions of times.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.050-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>It took Gangnam Style nearly 5 years to be viewed three billion times. It&#8217;s an amazing feat, but even more amazing is that it took Despacito just a year!</p>\n<p>Today, as of this writing, Depacito has been viewed 5.7 billion times. Wow.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.051-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>Video is huge, but not just for music videos. It can be used by many other forms of entertainment and media to boost their growth as well.</p>\n<p>My hypothesis: One of the big opportunities right now is that any product that automatically generates video when users engage will create more video sharing activity, thus more viral acquisition and engagement.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.052-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>No wonder eSports are such a big deal right now. And it&#8217;s one of the reasons I&#8217;ve been spending time in this space.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.053-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>When you look at a game like League of Legends, created by Riot Games, you see some amazing stats.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.054-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>The 2017 League of Legends championship was viewed by over 100 million live viewers. Compare that to Wimbeldon, which had a mere 9.4 million viewers. That&#8217;s over 10X. And yet we think of video games as a vertical niche &#8211; it&#8217;s certainly not. It&#8217;s mainstream, and it&#8217;s big.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.055-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>One startup I&#8217;m excited about is Sandbox VR and the category of location-based virtual reality (LBVR). I think this is the format that is most likely to break virtual reality into the mainstream &#8211; not in-home. Sandbox asks for people to bring their friends, as a group, to a retail location to use what I think is the best VR experience on the planet. You wear haptic suits, there&#8217;s a motion capture system, props, and special effects. It&#8217;s next level.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FBZjl4RZ_i8\" width=\"600\" height=\"320\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">﻿</span></iframe></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s an incredible experience &#8211; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBZjl4RZ_i8\">you can see the trailer here</a> and try it in San Mateo <a href=\"https://sandboxvr.com/sf/location/san-mateo/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.056-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>With your friends, you fight pirates and zombies. And pirate zombies. They currently have two games, with more coming.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.057-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>The whole experience is cool, but part of the reason I&#8217;m excited about the company is that they have an awesome growth tactic that connects directly to video.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.058-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>Above: Every time you go with friends, it&#8217;s an event &#8211; you take a ton of pictures and video. In fact, Sandbox helps you generate a mixed reality video with that&#8217;s shareable. You publish it on Facebook and other social media, and it looks like so much fun that friends want to try it too. All of this generates viral growth! It&#8217;s a fantastic growth tactic.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s no wonder that one of the company&#8217;s slogans is &#8211; &#8220;Fun to play, but fun to watch too.&#8221;</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.059-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>The second example I want to use is &#8220;Offline to Online.&#8221; We all know about going online to offline, which has been enabled by companies like Amazon, eBay, and more. You can think of the first generation of marketplaces and internet products as filling this niche. However, this is the other way around.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.060-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>Above: The fundamental technology shift that&#8217;s allowing this is everything to do with maps, GPS, and AR &#8211; all in your pocket, on your mobile phone. This enables both new product experiences but also new growth tactics too.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.061-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>The growth hack I have in mind is that you can now have highly visible offline experiences that then drive people towards using their app. As online channels become saturated &#8211; Facebook and Google ads are expensive, there are literally millions of apps in the app store &#8211; it turns out the real world gets pretty attractive.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s look at some examples:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.062-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>First, there&#8217;s Pokemon Go, by Niantic. You see yourself on a map, with Pokemon all around you. Collect them all! It&#8217;s fun, but it also means that people are watching others play. Sometimes this is a small reminder, if you see a small group gathered trying to collect a rare Pokemon.</p>\n<p>But sometimes it gets big &#8211; really big.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.063-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a photo of tends of thousands of people who showed up for a Pokemon event. This is just one example, but Niantic does events all over the world, all the time.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.064-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>Of course, rideshare looks like this too. Who can forget the pink mustaches from across the city that remind us to try and use Lyft?</p>\n<p>Transportation is an intrinsically viral product &#8211; they are social activities. You bring your friends and loved ones in the car with you, to share the costs. Even the fully utilitarian version – going from point A to point B – can be social, since there’s often a person on the other side. These mean that the rideshare companies all benefit from significant viral and organic traffic to their products.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.065-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>Scooters are another great example. Our portfolio company Lime has their scooters deployed across a city, and each scooter is literally a mini-billboard to try it out. And the first time you&#8217;ve seen someone ride a scooter, they probably had a big smile on their face! It looks fun. And because of that, they benefit from the offline to online effect.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.066-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>Above: So these are two quick examples &#8211; I&#8217;m keeping my eye on more, but again, it&#8217;s all about the intersection of new tech, existing consumer behavior, and an insight about growth. If you can get these three together, it&#8217;s super interesting.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/a16z_summit_deck_2018.067-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>There are a ton of new plaforms hitting scale. I&#8217;m also interested in GSuite, which is hitting critical mass across SMBs and enterprises. I mentioned Alexa. You can see products like Twitch and Tik Tok growing quickly &#8211; with the former adding extensions and the ability for apps to integrate.

Serial Entrepreneur &#8212; investors want to back them, newbies want to learn from them, and people want to work on their teams. It turns out that, yes, being a repeat entrepreneur comes with big advantages, but there are difficulties too! And when you go through a tough experience like launching a new product, it’s often the case that you want a “do over” on many aspects. Of course, you try to fix them in your next attempt. What does a serial entrepreneur want to do better on their second, or third, or fourth try?</p>\n<p>Well, let’s ask <strong>Justin Kan</strong>, who has started many, many companies and has a point of view. In fact, 10 points of view. As many of you know, Justin is a repeat entrepreneur who co-founded Kiko Software (a Web 2.0 calendar that pre-dated Google Calendar by 4 years); Justin.tv (a lifecasting platform); Twitch.tv (a live streaming platform for esports, music, and other creatives now part of Amazon); Socialcam. He was also a partner at YC, and will be a dad soon! (congrats Justin!)</p>\n<p>His new company, Atrium, is one of my first investments at Andreessen Horowitz. It’s a tech-enabled law firm serving startups &#8212; <a href=\"https://www.atrium.co/\">learn more here</a>.</p>\n<p>Justin reflects on his journey and shares 10 + 1 lesson he’s learned along the way.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Cbav_Dt2s\"><b>Here’s the video.</b></a></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q-Cbav_Dt2s\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>I wanted to add a quick summary of some of his points, as they are super interesting, and share with all of you. And for the lazy who don’t have time to watch a full interview, I added some notes below. Enjoy!</p>\n<p>Thanks,<br />\nAndrew</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><b>The paradox of choice: choosing a focus</b></p>\n<p>Justin says:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Once you see some success … The world opens up. They want you to be a VC, they want you to work on projects with them, you can start any company that you want, which is great… but it’s a paradox of choice, and focus can be a huge problem”</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is the biggest, surprising thing about being a repeat entrepreneur, which is how easy it is to get pulled in a ton of directions. And also that you might not be as patient and let something develop, since your perceived opportunity cost is high. Justin ended up trying many different options &#8212; including as a partner of YC &#8212; and didn’t feel like he was learning/growing and the feedback cycle is too slow. Justin ended up picking a new startup because it’s the #1 vehicle for personal growth.</p>\n<p><b>Tradeoffs between B2B versus B2C companies</b></p>\n<p>Justin says:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“When we started Kiko, we had no skills. I never had a full-time job in my life … We were not good. When you have nothing going for you except that you are willing to put in long hours, and blood sweat and tears, you should focus on market risk… Now as someone with abilities and skills, you should focus on execution risk”</p></blockquote>\n<p>I often spend my time in the intersection of pure consumer startups and also consumerized enterprise, and notice that there are huge differences. One of the biggest ones is that B2B startups have relatively stable go-to-market motions &#8212; you have sales, marketing, and sell into buyers that you understand. Because of this, it’s mostly about execution and if the market size is big enough. Consumer is fascinating because the distribution channels are constantly changing &#8212; 15 years ago, SEO and email viral growth was the big thing. Then 10 years ago, it was mobile and Facebook platform. Right now you are seeing a lot that’s just word of mouth or touching the <a href=\"https://andrewchen.co/irl-channel/\">IRL channel</a>.</p>\n<p><b>Market risk vs execution risk</b></p>\n<p>Justin says:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“When Justin.tv pivoted to Twitch, no one believed there was a market. Even Emmett was skeptical. The good part was that competition was low. ”</p></blockquote>\n<p>And also:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“It takes a lot of people with nothing to lose to discover [hit startups].”</p></blockquote>\n<p>I’ve written about how random consumer products seem to be &#8212; the past decade’s hits were: An app that lets you get into strangers’ cars. An app that lets you stay at random peoples’ houses. Disappearing photos. A site that doesn’t let you play video games, but you can watch other people play. Seriously? This is the <a href=\"https://andrewchen.co/dumb-idea-paradox/\">Dumb Idea Paradox</a>.</p>\n<p><b>Fundraising strategy: go big or stay lean?</b></p>\n<p>Justin says:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“I’ve not convinced that raising a ton of money out of the gate is the right strategy. When you have a ton of money you spend a lot of money.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Nearly 10 years ago, Ben Horowitz wrote <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2010/03/17/the-case-for-the-fat-startup/\">The Case for the Fat Startup</a> &#8212; the idea that sometimes you need to raise a boatload of money in order to get your company off the ground. In Atrium’s case, that’s exactly aligned, because the market wants a stable legal provider, and as an execution risk with clear competition, real capital has to go in to prove out the model.</p>\n<p><b>Managing the stress of being a startup CEO (again!)</b></p>\n<p>Justin says:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“I never really worked on self-improvement stuff outside of being a better programmer. But I never worked on anything to make myself smarter, or harder working, or alert more hours of the day. Everything was kind of accidental. If there was a problem in the company, I would be really emotionally avoidant to it.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>The topic of mental health within a startup community has turned into a big deal &#8212; for good reason. Doing a startup is one of the most stressful things you can do in the age of cushy, white-collar jobs, and there haven’t been great ways to cope. Justin talks about his newfound focus on self-improvement, working with coaches, and speaking with his peers.</p>\n<p><b>Seeking out mentors, coaches, and peers for help</b></p>\n<p>Justin says:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“The best part of Silicon Valley is that there are people here who’ve done it before, who are willing to help you.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>And:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“I learn from [Emmett, his Twitch co-founder, his brother who’s cofounder of Cruise, and his friend Steve who runs Reddit]. The problems are actually all the same: I don’t have the right alignment among my team and I don’t have the right executive team. And it’s always some variation of those things.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>I mention in the interview that IMHO this is one of the best things about the Bay Area &#8212; it’s a place focused on long-term relationships, and people help each other over the years. I met Justin over a decade ago and haven’t gotten the chance to work directly until now. And no matter where you are in the ecosystem there are always quite a few folks a step ahead, or a young up-and-comer who has a fresher take on things.</p>\n<p><b>Intentionally designing a culture to avoid the pitfalls of “culture eating strategy”</b></p>\n<p>Justin says:</p>\n<p>“I had never asked myself, what is the kind of company I want to show up to work?”</p>\n<p>There’s a saying that initially, a startup is about building a product that works &#8212; that’s the machine. But eventually you have to transition into building the machine that builds the machine &#8212; meaning company building, as opposed to product building. Culture is the core glue that holds everything together, and sometimes a startup idea is so strong that it works regardless of the culture. But it can be even more effective when it works.</p>\n<p><b>Things he’s still doing in his latest startup—and things he’s doing very differently</b></p>\n<p>Justin says:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Iterating quickly. Speed. Being helpful in the community.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>There’s some things that worked out great in a startup that are worth repeating. This is true when you’ve seen some success, in particular. And there are some things that you want to change completely. Justin talks about the “YC ethos” of iterating quickly and leaning on speed. But as both a16z and his previous companies have done, he argues that it’s important to help the community.</p>\n<p><b>Managing higher expectations</b></p>\n<p>Justin says:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“It’s always a battle with the devil on your shoulder that says you’ll never be good enough. And the way to win that battle is to internalize the idea that whatever happens, you’re gonna be fine. You’re probably going to be the same &#8212; not happier or less happy”</p></blockquote>\n<p>When you read the academic research on happiness, one of the intriguing ideas is that people have a “set point” for their level of happiness, and in general it doesn’t change much. If you get that, then it helps level out the ups and downs of something stressful. This is important to startups, of course, but also to many other things in life!</p>\n<p><b>What he’s reading and listening to</b></p>\n<p>Justin says:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“I’m reading a lot, because I deleted all the entertainment apps off my phone including the browser and I locked it so I can’t install new apps because I was a total phone addict.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>He goes on to list:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Untethered-Soul-Journey-Beyond-Yourself/dp/1572245379\">The Untethered Soul</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Leadership-Self-Deception-Getting-Out-Box/dp/1576759776\">Leadership and Self-Deception</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/15-Commitments-Conscious-Leadership-Sustainable-ebook/dp/B00R3MHWUE\">The 15 Commitments of Conscious Leadership</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://podcasts.joerogan.net/\">Joe Rogan Experience</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Bonus: advice he’d give his 20-year old self</b></p>\n<p>Justin says:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Join Facebook.

Or am I just getting old?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Early on, there&#8217;s often not much to judge it on besides the idea. Sometimes the idea sounds either dumb or trivial. But over the years, I&#8217;ve started to not try to judge too much, especially when it&#8217;s early</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ideas seem pretty random because in the past few years, some of the biggest wins were: An app that lets you get into strangers&#8217; cars. An app that lets you stay at random peoples&#8217; houses. Disappearing photos. A site that doesn&#8217;t let you play video games, but you can watch other people play. Seriously?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you go back a few years earlier, I remember having entire convos about why anyone in the world would want a profile or a website on the internet. Or why phones should be used for calling, and adding email was dumb. It sounds silly, but that was the perspective then</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Dumb Idea Paradox &#8211; the official definition</strong><br />The dumb idea paradox is what happens when an idea sounds dumb, and yet you have a (usually very small) group of people highly engaged in doing it. And maybe that group of people seem to getting bigger and bigger. Will it continue? Will millions ultimately do this thing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When products that have this property &#8212; it&#8217;s counterintuitive behavior PLUS it has traction &#8212; imho they are the most attractive startups in existence. After all, this is an indicator it&#8217;s likely in a new market, and often times, the TAM of these markets ends up being huge!</p>\n<p>In other words, this handy graphic:</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4625\" src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dumb-smart-2x2-1024x215.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"126\" srcset=\"http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dumb-smart-2x2-1024x215.png 1024w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dumb-smart-2x2-300x63.png 300w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dumb-smart-2x2-768x162.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p>\n<p>(Note I made that as a screenshot in GSheets. You&#8217;re welcome)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Natives versus immigrants want different kinds of products</strong><br />Furthermore, these ideas often formed at the seam of the &#8220;natives&#8221; versus the &#8220;immigrants.&#8221; If you are Instagram-native, what you consider a great idea for a new retail space or ecomm brand is likely very different than someone who isn&#8217;t exposed to the same thousands of pics</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The upcoming generation are using tech in a different way. They are Fortnite-native. Minecraft-native. They are streaming-native. They use &#8220;insta&#8221; differently. Food delivery will be considered a human right. The expectations will be very different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For network effects-driven products, it matters that your friends are also into the same thing. If my peers aren&#8217;t playing Fortnite every day, then I won&#8217;t see the same value and engagement. Contrast that to a fully activated network of kids that are on it every day</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thus, I&#8217;m sure that the first time I hear about a wild idea that appeals to this group, it will be easy to dismiss out of hand. And perhaps I&#8217;d be more attracted in something that takes on the same trends, but is more familiar</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Strong and weak technologies</strong><br />My partner Chris Dixon has written about the idea of <a href=\"http://cdixon.org/2019/01/08/strong-and-weak-technologies/\">strong and weak technologies</a>, which often arrive in pairs at the start of a new technological age. The weak version often sounds more practical, but the strong ones often win. Here are some examples:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img class=\"wp-image-4623\" src=\"https://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/weak-strong-tech-932x1024.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/weak-strong-tech-932x1024.png 932w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/weak-strong-tech-273x300.png 273w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/weak-strong-tech-768x844.png 768w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/weak-strong-tech.png 1372w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 932px) 100vw, 932px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The weak version of a technology is often the more plausible, &#8220;immigrant&#8221; version of an idea. The stronger version will sound better to folks who are natives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an investor in consumer companies, I&#8217;m always startled when I see surprisingly strong growth metrics on top of an idea that I don&#8217;t get. It&#8217;s always a signal that I need to dig deeper, at least until I feel like I&#8217;m starting to get it. But it&#8217;s hard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I repeat the question: The next time you hear an idea that sounds dumb, ask yourself &#8212; is it really dumb? Or are you just getting old?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://andrewchen.co/dumb-idea-paradox/\">The Dumb Idea Paradox: Why great ideas often start out by sounding dumb.</a> is also published on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://andrewchen.co\">andrewchen</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 27 May 2019 15:49:47 +0000","feedId":83,"bgimg":"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dumb-idea-paradox.png","linkMd5":"d2626a1dfe2bb3c6a1a2008749159232","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn75@2020_4/2020-07-24/1595596427505_44166ff8fb5e28d8.webp","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dumb-idea-paradox.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn75@2020_4/2020-07-24/1595596427505_44166ff8fb5e28d8.webp","http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dumb-smart-2x2-1024x215.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn23@2020_5/2020-07-24/1595596443609_5dfdbc27f2d1ed24.webp","https://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/weak-strong-tech-932x1024.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn27@2020_2/2020-07-24/1595596435201_331bb66e91cf75a7.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-07-24 21:13:38","updatedTime":"2020-07-24 13:13:38","title":"2018 essay collection on growth metrics, marketplaces, viral growth in the enterprise, and more (PDF included)","link":"http://andrewchen.co/?p=4587","description":"<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4599\" src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_0399-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_0399-1.jpg 1000w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_0399-1-300x225.jpg 300w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_0399-1-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p>\n<p><em>Above: One of my favorite moments in 2018, with the a16z team and POTUS44. </em></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Dear readers,</p>\n<p>Wow, so 2018 was a year with a lot of change &#8211; I started a new job, recommitted myself to writing (and tweeting), traveled a little too much, moved back down to Palo Alto (temporarily!), and much more. And in one of my favorite moments of the year, the office got swarmed by the Secret Service because Barack Obama came to visit &#8211; that was fun.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m also happy to redouble my efforts to writing and publish more, which I can do my new role as an investor at a16z. Previously, my pace was maybe once every other month &#8211; things were always too crazy at Uber, and it didn&#8217;t directly help my job there, so I couldn&#8217;t carve out time. These days, I consider writing as part of my work and dedicate time to it, blocked out on my calendar. As a result, I&#8217;ve been able to publish a few times a month lately &#8211; I want to continue pace into 2019!</p>\n<p>In the spirit of trying something new, I decided to take all of my 2018 essays and turn it into an ebook PDF that you can read at your own leisure.

The deck unpacks a lot of different topics: How &#8220;growth accounting&#8221; metrics are great, but are lagging indicators. How to think about acquisition loops and engagement loops, and how to look for red flags like being overly dependent on a channel, or abusing notifications, to artificially boost metrics. The deck was designed for investors, but for every entrepreneur that wants to honestly evaluate where they are, it&#8217;s a good read too.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://andrewchen.co/consumer-startups-at-a16z/\">Consumer startups are awesome, and here’s what I’m looking for at a16z (70 slide deck)</a>. For the a16z annual summit, I put together a presentation introducing myself and what I&#8217;m excited about in the consumer investing world. It goes over historical precedents for give/get referrals, content marketing, and trying to bootstrap two-sided marketplaces. The deck also explains some of the big technologies and platforms coming down the pipe, and why I&#8217;m particularly excited about esports/gaming, offline experiences, and much more.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://andrewchen.co/how-to-build-a-growth-team/\">How to build a growth team – lessons from Uber, Hubspot, and others (50 slides)</a>. For a recent conference, I put together a series of lessons for companies that are looking to start growth teams. It starts simple, with the question of what growth teams are meant to solve, but also goes into organizational structure, ideal profiles/backgrounds for the team, how to ideate and prioritize projects, and more.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://andrewchen.co/paid-marketing-addiction/\">How startups die from their addiction to paid marketing</a>. It&#8217;s so easy to get your product jumpstarted by buying ads to drive users, and hey, the LTVs and CAC ratios are working! But as I describe in this essay, it&#8217;s also easy to get addicted and ride the cost curves all the way up to the point where it makes no sense, and the degradation of these channels is a given.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://andrewchen.co/how-marketplaces-will-reinvent-the-service-economy/\">What’s next for marketplace startups? Reinventing the $10 trillion service economy, that’s what</a>. Co-authored with a16z partner Li Jin, we write about the next generation of marketplace startups. Whereas the previous generations have been about getting &#8220;stuff&#8221; to people, the next big opportunity will be to get services. The essay talks through why this has been so hard in the past, the benefits of having software intermediate the interactions, and the various ways that supply can get unlocked using technology platforms as the foundation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://andrewchen.co/marketplace-startups-best-essays/\">Required reading for marketplace startups: The 20 best essays</a>. This one&#8217;s not included in the PDF since it&#8217;s just a bunch of links, but wanted to include it here anyway. It&#8217;s a collection of links about marketplaces &#8211; from solving the cold start problem to metrics on marketplaces to specific case studies. It&#8217;s a must-read for anyone working in the space.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://andrewchen.co/why-uber-for-x-failed/\">Why “Uber for X” startups failed: The supply side is king</a>. One of my big lessons from Uber is that the supply side of the market is critical for any startup. I explain in this tweetstorm-turned-essay why the various &#8220;Uber for X&#8221; startups did a poor job satisfying that side of the market, even as the promise for us as consumers sounded great.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://andrewchen.co/power-user-curve/\">The Power User Curve: The best way to understand your most engaged users</a>. At a16z, we often use frequency histograms &#8211; aka &#8220;Power User Curves&#8221; &#8211; to evaluate whether or not there&#8217;s a core community of users who are highly engaged. In this essay, co-authored by Li Jin from a16z, we break down what we look for, the variations on the curves you might see, and how this curve relates to the popular DAU/MAU we also ask for.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://andrewchen.co/dau-mau-is-an-important-metric-but-heres-where-it-fails/\">DAU/MAU is an important metric to measure engagement, but here’s where it fails</a>. The DAU/MAU metric is an important measure of usage frequency, and was popularized by Facebook from the early days. This essay breaks down when its history, when it&#8217;s useful, and where it breaks down.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://andrewchen.co/conservation-of-intent/\">Conservation of Intent: The hidden reason why A/B tests aren’t as effective as they look</a>. Everyone&#8217;s had the frustrating experience of running an A/B test, seeing a big lift, closing it out, and expecting the top level metrics to move a lot. But they don&#8217;t. This post explains why &#8211; &#8220;user intent&#8221; can be thought of as a fixed amount of energy as they approach the top of your funnels, and it&#8217;s hard to move it a lot.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://andrewchen.co/brand-marketing-is-useless-for-startups/\">The Startup Brand Fallacy: Why brand marketing is mostly useless for consumer startups</a>. One of the opinions that always stirs up the hornet&#8217;s nest on Twitter is my opinion is that startups should do less brand marketing, PR, and other related activities and instead just focus on product/market fit and highly accountable performance metrics.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://andrewchen.co/scooter-platform-play/\">The Scooter Platform Play: Why scooter startups are important and strategic to the future of transportation</a>. I&#8217;m a big fan of scooters, and here, I unpack why I&#8217;m excited about the entire category. Because scooters are used more frequently, and for shorter trips than rideshare, it creates a huge opportunity to be the &#8220;starting point&#8221; for transportation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://andrewchen.co/irl-channel/\">The IRL channel: Offline to online, Online to offline</a>. As digital customer acquisition channels become saturated and easily copyable, one of the unique opportunities is the &#8220;IRL Channel&#8221; where people engage your product in their everyday, physical lives. Whether it&#8217;s a group of people walking around playing Pokemon Go, a microwave that has Alexa embedded, or scooters, this is one of the opportunities to combine our offline and online worlds.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://andrewchen.co/andreessen-horowitz/\">I’m joining Andreessen Horowitz!</a>.

I will write more about it coming up, but in the meantime, it’s very timely that my colleague Scott Kupor has written a new book, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Secrets of Sand Hill Road</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, with the fun subtitle “Venture capital and how to get it.” I’ve had the pleasure of reading ahead of its release, and as expected, it’s excellent, and provides a detailed guide and fantastic in depth info on everything you’d want to know about venture capital. As an author, Scott could not have more street cred — he joined and built a16z from the very early years, and is our go-to on all the nitty gritty of the industry for the whole team. </span></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MQT97PV\">You can (and should!) pre-order the book here »</a></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There’s a bunch of great topics, including:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why the skill you need most when raising venture capital is the ability to tell a compelling story.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What to do when VCs get too entangled in the day-to-day operations of the business. </span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why you need to build relationships with potential acquirers long before you decide to sell.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why most VCs typically invest in only one startup in a given business category.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>The math of startups and venture capital</strong><br />\nOf all the topics of the book, one of my favorites has to be the math of startups and venture capital, because it gives us a perspective on the life and death of startups as a whole. Because venture capital is an index of the broader startup ecosystem, it can tell us a lot — everything from how often the Ubers, Dropboxes, Facebooks, and Googles emerge as startups, to how quickly doomed startups typically fail.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of these tell you why many venture capitalists ultimately end up being interested in companies that want (and can!) get big — and it’s not the right way to finance the vast majority of new companies, many of whom are more focused on smaller markets or slower growth business models. I want to share a <a href=\"https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2016/4/28/winning-and-losing\">couple slides that Benedict Evans from a16z presented</a> a few years back to make this point:</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4665\" src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/vc-power-curve-1024x577.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/vc-power-curve-1024x577.png 1024w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/vc-power-curve-300x169.png 300w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/vc-power-curve-768x433.png 768w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/vc-power-curve.png 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p>\n<p>The above tells an amazing story: Over the past few decades, <strong>a small number of startups — 6% — end up driving 60% of the returns</strong>.</p>\n<p>And I suspect if we were to dig into the 6%, we see that just a small number, probably a dozen or so per year, that drive a substantial amount. In other words, the startups that end up big end up really big. These startups aren&#8217;t just unicorns, they are another order of magnitude more successful than that.</p>\n<p>It also tells you why, as an entrepreneur, that investors are so focused on network effects, high margins, technology differentiation, a 10X product experience, etc. — these are the foundational drivers that help create this super huge outcomes.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4666\" src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/vc-big-hits-1024x578.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/vc-big-hits-1024x578.png 1024w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/vc-big-hits-300x169.png 300w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/vc-big-hits-768x433.png 768w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/vc-big-hits.png 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p>\n<p>Above: Here&#8217;s another surprise from the data, which is that the best investors don&#8217;t seem to be better at avoiding startups that fail. It&#8217;s not about the downside. Instead, the data says that a “good” 2-3x fund and a fantastic &#62;5x fund lose money about the same % of the time.</p>\n<p>However, for a fantastic fund, its winners are much, much bigger than everyone else’s. For these top funds, the biggest startups end up generating 90% of the returns. It&#8217;s all about upside! For startups that ask why investors seem so obsessed with market size and say that few ideas are big enough, here&#8217;s the data that explains why.</p>\n<p><strong>The J-Curve</strong><br />\nFinally, there is the concept of the J-curve in venture capital investing in which you look at a basket of startups over a long period — say, 10 years — and see how the returns look. And it often resembles a J, where the early years look pretty bad! And then eventually the big winners get bigger and bigger, picking up momentum to ultimately drive returns for the fund.</p>\n<p>It looks like this:</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4667\" src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/j-curve-1024x780.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"457\" srcset=\"http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/j-curve-1024x780.png 1024w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/j-curve-300x229.png 300w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/j-curve-768x585.png 768w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/j-curve.png 1244w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p>\n<p>This graph demonstrates the phrase that &#8220;lemons ripen early&#8221; &#8212; as <strong>Secrets of Sand Hill Road</strong> discusses. A portfolio of startups will often have early losses as the teams without product/market fit run out of money early. The successful ones that will become the winners take time to emerge. These days, it can take 3-5+ years from the company&#8217;s inception to see its true growth trajectory. As a result, there&#8217;s a J-curve that shows early losses followed by the successful startups making up the different in the later years.</p>\n<p>If you are as fascinated as I am about all of this, I know you&#8217;ll enjoy Scott&#8217;s book. I want to leave you with an excerpt below. In the section, he discusses the J-curve in detail and why it behaves why it does. Hope you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading, and more from me soon.</p>\n<p>Andrew</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3>Secrets of Sand Hill Road: Venture Capital and How to Get It<br />\nby Scott Kupor</h3>\n<p>“Carried Interest”</p>\n<p>The heart of compensation for GPs (at least for those who are successful investors) is carried interest. It’s rumored that the term “carried interest” derives from medieval traders who carried cargo on their ships that belonged to others. As financial compensation for the journey, the traders were entitled to 20 percent of the profits on the cargo. That sounds very civilized, if not rich. I’ve also heard—although my Google search is failing me now—that the carry portion of carried interest referred to the fact that the traders were allowed to keep as profit whatever portion of the cargo they could literally “carry” off the ship of their own volition. I prefer that story.</p>\n<p>Regardless of its historical origins, carried interest in the VC context refers to the portion of the profits that the GP generates on her investments and that she is entitled to keep. As with the management fee, the actual amount of carried interest varies among venture funds but often ranges between 20 and 30 percent of the profits.</p>\n<p>As it turns out, how we define “profits” and how and when the GP decides to distribute those profits to herself and her LPs is a matter for negotiation in the LPA.</p>\n<p>Let’s use a simple example to illustrate.</p>\n<p>Go back to that $100 million venture fund we talked about before, and assume that we are in year three of the fund’s existence. The GP invested $10 million in a portfolio company earlier in the fund’s life, and now the company is sold for $60 million. So, on paper at least, the GP has generated a tidy profit of $50 million for that investment. She’s also invested the rest of the $90 million in other companies, but none of those has yet been sold or gone public. Ah, she can taste the carry check already!</p>\n<p>But how does the money get divvied up between the LPs and the GP? Let’s assume that the GP has a 20 percent carried interest; in simple terms that means that when the fund earns a profit, 20 percent of that goes to the GP.</p>\n<p>So, in our example, the GP is sitting on a $60 million check, of which $50 million represents profit, and wants to give 80 percent of the profit (or $40 million) to the fund’s LPs and keep 20 percent (or $10 million) for herself. The other $10 million in this example will go back to the LPs as a return of their original capital. We’ll come back to this later in this chapter and add some additional complexity to this.</p>\n<p>But wait a second. Is there really a profit on which the GP is entitled to take her 20 percent? The answer is maybe. We need to take a little detour to introduce two other important concepts before we can conclusively answer the question.</p>\n<p>As with fine wine, VC funds should get better with age. In fact, that’s why people in the industry refer to funds by their “vintage year” (or birth year), just as winemakers date mark their wines based on the year of the grape harvest.</p>\n<p>As we discussed earlier, in the early years of a fund, VCs are calling capital from LPs and investing that capital in companies. This is a decidedly negative cash flow motion—money is going out with (likely) no near-term prospect of money coming in. That’s an expected effect, but eventually a VC must harvest some of those investments in the form of those companies going public or being sold.<br />\nThe effect of calling capital from LPs in the early years coupled with the long gestation cycles for companies to grow and ultimately exit—in many cases it takes ten or more years for companies to be sold or go public—creates what is known as the “J curve.”</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4667\" src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/j-curve-1024x780.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"457\" srcset=\"http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/j-curve-1024x780.png 1024w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/j-curve-300x229.png 300w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/j-curve-768x585.png 768w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/j-curve.png 1244w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /><br />\nAs you see in the above picture, the LP has negative cash flow (from the capital it’s giving to the venture firm for investment) in the early years of a fund and (hopefully) positive cash flow in the later years of the fund, a combination both of the capital having already been called and invested and the portfolio companies being sold or going public.</p>\n<p>Venture capital is truly a long-term game. But, as explained in our discussion of the Yale endowment in chapter 4, cash does eventually need to come out the other end. Successful GPs will manage their portfolios to drive to this outcome, which can affect how they interact with entrepreneurs on this topic.</p>\n<p>One phrase you often hear in the hallowed halls of VC firms is “lemons ripen early.” That is, the non-performing companies tend to manifest themselves close in time to the initial investment. Interestingly, this exacerbates the J-curve problem in that not only are VCs investing cash in the early years of a fund, but the non-performing assets are certainly not helping the GP return money to the LPs.</p>\n<p><em>Reprinted with permission of Portfolio Books</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://andrewchen.co/venture-capital-returns/\">Why startups are hard &#8212; the math of venture capital returns tells the story</a> is also published on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://andrewchen.co\">andrewchen</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 03 Jun 2019 17:54:01 +0000","feedId":83,"bgimg":"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/secrets-sand-hill.png","linkMd5":"4ba8f2a7cf357640a0ac18022333aedc","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn67@2020_6/2020-07-24/1595596427793_e5815f3ad54aa235.webp","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/secrets-sand-hill.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn67@2020_6/2020-07-24/1595596427793_e5815f3ad54aa235.webp","http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/vc-power-curve-1024x577.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn23@2020_3/2020-07-24/1595596440907_bf477aac24a5c8e3.webp","http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/vc-big-hits-1024x578.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn39@2020_5/2020-07-24/1595596439253_ac8a43da1d64f113.webp","http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/j-curve-1024x780.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn27@2020_2/2020-07-24/1595596445117_5df60c30063e287b.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-07-24 21:13:38","updatedTime":"2020-07-24 13:13:38","title":"What’s next for marketplace startups?

In this essay, we argue that a breakthrough is on its way: While the first phase of the internet has been about creating marketplaces for goods, the next phase will be about reinventing the service economy. Startups will build on the lessons and tactics to crack the toughest service industries &#8211; including regulated markets that have withstood digital transformation for decades. In doing this, the lives of <em>125 million Americans</em> who work in the services-providing industries will join the digital transformation of the economy.</p>\n<p>In the past twenty years, we&#8217;ve transformed the way people buy goods online, and in the process created Amazon, eBay, JD.com, Alibaba, and other e-commerce giants, accounting for trillions of dollars in market capitalization. The next era will do the same to the $9.7 trillion US consumer service economy, through discontinuous innovations in AI and automation, new marketplace paradigms, and overcoming regulatory capture.</p>\n<p>The service economy lags behind: while services make up 69% of national consumer spending, the Bureau of Economic Analysis estimated that just 7% of services were primarily digital, meaning they utilized internet to conduct transactions.</p>\n<p>We propose that a new age of service marketplaces will emerge, driven by unlocking more complex services, including services that are regulated. In this essay, we’ll talk about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Why services are still primarily offline</li>\n<li>The history of service marketplace paradigms\n<ul>\n<li>The Listings Era</li>\n<li>The Unbundled Craigslist Era</li>\n<li>The “Uber for X” Era</li>\n<li>The Managed Marketplace Era</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The future of service marketplaces\n<ul>\n<li>Regulated services</li>\n<li>Five strategies for unlocking supply in regulated markets</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Future opportunities</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s start by looking at where the service economy is right now and why it’s resisted a full scale transformation by software.</p>\n<div style=\"padding: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; background-color: aliceblue;\">Get essays about marketplaces and more by <a href=\"http://andrewchen.co/subscribe\">subscribing to my newsletter</a>.<br />\n<script>(function() {\n\tif (!window.mc4wp) {\n\t\twindow.mc4wp = {\n\t\t\tlisteners: [],\n\t\t\tforms    : {\n\t\t\t\ton: function (event, callback) {\n\t\t\t\t\twindow.mc4wp.listeners.push({\n\t\t\t\t\t\tevent   : event,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcallback: callback\n\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n})();\n</script><!-- Mailchimp for WordPress v4.5.2 - https://wordpress.org/plugins/mailchimp-for-wp/ --><form id=\"mc4wp-form-5\" class=\"mc4wp-form mc4wp-form-4382 mc4wp-form-theme mc4wp-form-theme-blue mc4wp-ajax\" method=\"post\" data-id=\"4382\" data-name=\"Article\" ><input type=\"hidden\" autocomplete=\"off\" autocorrect=\"off\" name=\"g-SY-U-M-vpVdn-D\" value=\"\" /><div class=\"mc4wp-form-fields\"><input type=\"email\" name=\"EMAIL\" placeholder=\"Your email address\" required style=\"font-size: 26px; max-width: none;\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"referer\" id=\"referer\" value=\"\" />\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"signup\" id=\"signup\" value=\"article\" />\n<input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\" style=\"font-size: 26px; margin-top: 20px;\" />\n<script>\n  document.getElementById(\"referer\").value = document.referrer;\n  \n// Facebook Conversion Event Pixel\nfbq('track', 'Lead', {\nvalue: 0.01,\ncurrency: 'USD'\n});\n// End Facebook Conversion Event Pixel\n</script></div><label style=\"display: none !important;\">Leave this field empty if you're human: <input type=\"text\" name=\"_mc4wp_honeypot\" value=\"\" tabindex=\"-1\" autocomplete=\"off\" /></label><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_mc4wp_timestamp\" value=\"1595596103\" /><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_mc4wp_form_id\" value=\"4382\" /><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_mc4wp_form_element_id\" value=\"mc4wp-form-5\" /><div class=\"mc4wp-response\"></div></form><!-- / Mailchimp for WordPress Plugin --></div>\n<p><strong>Software eating the service economy, but it&#8217;s been slow</strong><br />\nWe’ve all had the experience of asking friends for recommendations for a great service provider, whether it be a great childcare provider, doctor, or hair stylist. Why is that? Why aren’t we discovering and consuming these services in the same digital way we’ve come to expect for goods?</p>\n<p>Despite the rise of services in the overall economy, there are a few reasons why services have lagged behind goods in terms of coming online:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Services are complex and diverse, making it challenging to capture relevant information in an online marketplace</li>\n<li>Success and quality in services is subjective</li>\n<li>Fragmentation &#8211; small service providers lack the tools or time to come online</li>\n<li>Real-world interaction is at the heart of services delivery, which makes it hard to disaggregate parts of a purchase that might be done online</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s unpack each reason below:</p>\n<p>First, on the complexity and diversity of services, services are performed by providers who vary widely, unlike goods which are manufactured to a certain spec. Even the names of services can vary: what one home cleaning service calls a “deep clean” can be different from another provider’s definition. This lack of standardization makes it difficult for a service marketplace to capture and organize the relevant information.</p>\n<p>Second, services are often complex interactions without a clear yardstick of success or quality. The customer experience of a service is often subjective, making traditional marketplace features like reviews, recommendations, and personalization more difficult to implement. Sometimes just getting the job completed (as in rideshare) is sufficient to earn a 5-star review, whereas other higher-stakes services, like childcare, have complex customer value functions, including safety, friendliness, communicativeness, rapport with child, and other subjective measures of success.</p>\n<p>Third, small service providers often lack the tools or time to come online. In many service industries, providers are small business owners with low margins; contrast this with goods manufacturing where there are economies of scale in production, and thus consolidation into large consumer products companies. As a result of industry fragmentation, service providers often don’t have time or budget to devote to key business functions, such as responding to customer requests, promoting and marketing themselves, maintaining a website, and other core functions. While major e-commerce platforms have taken on the role of distribution, merchandising, and fulfilling orders for goods, there are few platforms that service providers can plug into to manage their businesses and reach customers.</p>\n<p>Fourth, real-world interaction is central to services, which can pull other steps of the services funnel into the offline world as well. Many services are produced and consumed simultaneously in real-world interactions, whereas goods entail independent stages of production, distribution, and consumption. The various stages of the goods value chain can be easily unbundled, with e-commerce marketplaces comprising the discovery, transaction, and fulfillment steps. Conversely, since the production and consumption of services usually occur simultaneously offline, the discovery, distribution, and transaction pieces are also often integrated into the offline experience. For instance, since getting a haircut entails going to a salon and having interactions with the providers there, the stages of the value chain that precede and follow that interaction (discovery, booking, and payment) also often get incorporated into the in-person experience.</p>\n<p>All of these factors make it very hard for services to come online as comprehensively and widely as commerce &#8211; but there&#8217;s hope. We&#8217;ve seen multiple eras of bringing the service economy online, and we&#8217;re on the verge of a breakthrough!</p>\n<p><strong>The 4 eras of Service Marketplaces, and what&#8217;s next </strong><br />\nThere have been 4 major generations of service marketplaces, but coverage of services and providers remains spotty, and many don’t provide end-to-end, seamless consumer experiences. Let’s zoom out and talk through each historical marketplace paradigm, and what we’ve learned so far.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4487\" src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/image4-1024x664.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"389\" srcset=\"http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/image4-1024x664.png 1024w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/image4-300x195.png 300w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/image4-768x498.png 768w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/image4.png 1332w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p>\n<p>Above, you can see that there have roughly been four major eras of marketplace innovation when it comes to the service economy.</p>\n<p><strong>1. The Listings Era (1990s)<br />\n</strong>The first iteration of bringing services online involved unmanaged horizontal marketplaces, essentially listing platforms that helped demand search for supply and vice versa. These marketplaces were the digital version of the Yellow Pages, enabling visibility into which service providers existed, but placing the onus on the user to assess providers, contact them, arrange times to meet, and transact. The dynamic here is “caveat emptor”&#8211;users assume the responsibility of vetting their counterparties and establishing trust, and there’s little in the way of platform standards, protections, or guarantees.</p>\n<p>Craigslist’s Services category is the archetypal unmanaged service marketplace. It includes a jumble of house remodeling, painting, carpet cleaners, wedding photographers, and other services. But limited tech functionality means that it feels disorganized and hard to navigate, and there’s no way to transact or contact the provider without moving off the platform.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4488\" src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/image7-1024x615.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"361\" srcset=\"http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/image7-1024x615.png 1024w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/image7-300x180.png 300w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/image7-768x462.png 768w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/image7.png 1183w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve all had the experience of a listings-oriented product, like Craigslist. You find something you want, but everything else &#8211; trust/reviews/payments/etc &#8211; that&#8217;s all up to you!</p>\n<p><strong>2. The Unbundled Craigslist Era (2000s)</strong><br />\nCompanies iterated on the horizontal marketplace model by focusing on a specific sub-vertical, enabling them to offer features tailored to a specific industry. We&#8217;ve all seen the diagram of various companies picking off Craigslist verticals &#8211; it looks something like this:</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4489\" src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/image5-1024x681.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"399\" srcset=\"http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/image5-1024x681.png 1024w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/image5-300x200.png 300w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/image5-768x511.png 768w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/image5.png 1266w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p>\n<p>As a reaction to the &#8220;Wild West&#8221; nature of Craigslist, to improve the customer experience, each startup would create value-add via software. For instance, Care.com carves off the Childcare section of Craigslist, and provides tech value-add in the form of filters, structured information, and other features to improve the customer experience of finding a local caregiver. It’s a huge leap in terms of user experience over Craigslist’s Childcare section.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4490\" src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/image9-1024x750.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"439\" srcset=\"http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/image9-1024x750.png 1024w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/image9-300x220.png 300w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/image9-768x562.png 768w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/image9.png 1942w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p>\n<p>Angie’s List, a home services site founded in 2005, carves off Craigslist’s household services category. The platform has features including reviews, profiles, certified providers, and an online quote submission process. But the marketplace doesn’t encompass the entire end-to-end experience: users turn to Angie’s List for discovery, but still need to message or call providers and coordinate offline.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4491\" src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/image3-1024x774.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"454\" srcset=\"http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/image3-1024x774.png 1024w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/image3-300x227.png 300w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/image3-768x580.png 768w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/image3.png 1282w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p>\n<p>Unmanaged vertical marketplaces like Angie’s List go a step beyond Craigslist and take on some value-add services like certifying providers when they meet certain standards, but customers still need to select and contact the service provider, place their trust in the provider rather than the platform, and transact offline.</p>\n<p>Like previous listing sites, these platforms in this era try to use the ‘wisdom of the crowds’ to promote trust. These platforms have a network effect in that more reviews means more users and more reviews. But user reviews have their limitations, as every user has a unique value function that they’re judging a service against. Without standardized moderation or curation, and without machine learning to automate this process, customers have the onus of sifting through countless reviews and selecting among thousands of providers.</p>\n<p><strong>3. The “Uber for X” Era (2009-)</strong><br />\nIn the early 2010s, a wave of on-demand marketplaces for simple services arose, including transportation, food delivery, and valet parking. These marketplaces were enabled by widespread mobile adoption, making it possible to book a service or accept a job with the tap of a button.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4492\" src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/image10-169x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"280\" height=\"498\" srcset=\"http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/image10-169x300.png 169w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/image10-768x1365.png 768w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/image10-576x1024.png 576w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/image10.png 1125w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px\" /><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4493\" src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/image8-576x1024.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"280\" height=\"498\" srcset=\"http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/image8-576x1024.png 576w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/image8-169x300.png 169w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/image8-768x1365.png 768w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/image8.png 1125w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px\" /></p>\n<p>Companies like Handy, Lugg, Lyft, Rinse, Uber and many others made it efficient to connect to service providers in real-time. They created a full-stack experience around a particular service, optimizing for liquidity in one category. For these transactions, quality and success were more or less binary&#8211;either the service was fulfilled or it wasn’t&#8211;making them conducive to an on-demand model.</p>\n<p>These platforms took on various functions to establish an end-to-end, seamless user experience: automatically matching supply and demand, setting prices, handling transactions, and establishing trust through guarantees and protections. They also often commoditized the underlying service provider (for instance, widespread variance on the driver side of rideshare marketplaces is distilled into Uber X, Uber Pool, Uber Black, Uber XL, etc.).</p>\n<p>Unlike the previous generations of marketplaces, in which the provider ultimately owns the end customer relationship, these on-demand marketplaces became thought of as the service provider, e.g. “I ordered food from DoorDash” or “Let’s Uber there,” rather than the underlying person or business that actually rendered the service.</p>\n<p>Over time, <a href=\"https://andrewchen.co/why-uber-for-x-failed/\">many startups in this category failed</a>, and the ones that survived did so by focusing on and nailing a frequent use case, offering compelling value propositions to demand and supply (potentially removing the on-demand component, which wasn’t valuable for some services), and putting in place incentives and structures to promote liquidity, trust, safety, and reliability.</p>\n<p><strong>4. The Managed Marketplace Era (Mid-2010s)<br />\n</strong>In the last few years, we’ve seen a rise in the number of full-stack or managed marketplaces, or marketplaces that take on additional operational value-add in terms of intermediating the service delivery. While “Uber for X” models were well-suited to simple services, managed marketplaces evolved to better tackle services that were more complex, higher priced, and that required greater trust.</p>\n<p>Managed marketplaces take on additional work of actually influencing or managing the service experience, and in doing so, create a step-function improvement in the customer experience. Rather than just enabling customers to discover and build trust with the end provider, these marketplaces take on the work of actually creating trust.</p>\n<p>In the a16z portfolio, Honor is building a managed marketplace for in-home care, and interviews and screens every care professional before they are onboarded and provides new customers with a Care Advisor to design a personalized care plan. Opendoor is a managed marketplace that creates a radically different experience for buying and selling a home. When a customer wants to sell their home, Opendoor actually buys the home, performs maintenance, markets the home, and finds the next buyer. Contrast this with the traditional experience of selling a home, where there is the hassle of repairs, listing, showings, and potentially months of uncertainty.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4494\" src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/image2-1024x868.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"509\" srcset=\"http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/image2-1024x868.png 1024w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/image2-300x254.png 300w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/image2-768x651.png 768w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/image2.png 1135w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p>\n<p>Managed marketplaces like Honor and Opendoor take on steps of the value chain that platforms traditionally left to customers or providers, such as vetting supply. Customers place their trust in the platform, rather than the counterparty of the transaction. To compensate for heavier operational costs, it’s common for managed marketplaces to actually dictate pricing for services and charge a higher take rate than less-managed marketplace models.</p>\n<p>Managed marketplaces are a tactic to solve a broader problem around accessing high-quality supply, especially for services that require greater trust and/or entail high transaction value. If we zoom out further, there’s many more categories of services that can benefit from managed models and other tactics to unlock supply.</p>\n<p><strong>What&#8217;s next: The future of Service Marketplaces (2018-?) </strong><br />\nWe think the next era of service marketplaces have potential to unlock a huge swath of the 125 million service jobs in the US. These marketplaces will tackle the opportunities that have eluded previous eras of service marketplaces, and will bring the most difficult services categories online&#8211;in particular, services that are regulated. Regulated services&#8211;in which suppliers are licensed by a government agency or certified by a professional or industry organization&#8211;include engineering, accounting, teaching, law, and other professions that impact many people’s lives directly to a large degree. In 2015, 26% of employed people had a certification or license.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4495\" src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/image6-904x1024.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"679\" srcset=\"http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/image6-904x1024.png 904w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/image6-265x300.png 265w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/image6-768x870.png 768w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/image6.png 1458w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p>\n<p>Regulation of services was critical pre-internet, since it served to signify a certain level of skill or knowledge required to perform a job. But digital platforms mitigate the need for licensing by exposing relevant information about providers and by establishing trust through reviews, managed models, guarantees, platform requirements, and other mechanisms. For instance, most of us were taught since childhood never to get into cars with strangers; with Lyft and Uber, consumers are comfortable doing exactly that, millions of times per day, as a direct result of the trust those platforms have built.</p>\n<p>Licensing of service professions create an important standard, but also severely constrains supply. The time and money associated with getting licensed or certified can lock out otherwise qualified suppliers (for instance, some states require a license to braid hair or to be a florist), and often translates into higher fees, long waitlists, and difficulty accessing the service. The criteria involved in getting licensed also do not always map to what consumers actually value, and can hinder the discovery and access of otherwise suitable supply.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4496\" src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/image1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"458\" srcset=\"http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/image1.png 624w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/image1-300x220.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" /></p>\n<p><em>Above: Bureau of Labor Statistics.

As with each wave of previous service marketplaces, these new approaches bring more value-add to unlock the market, with variations in models that are well-suited to different categories.</p>\n<p>The major approaches in unlocking supply in these regulated industries include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Making discovery of licensed providers easier</li>\n<li>Hiring and managing existing providers to maintain quality</li>\n<li>Expanding or augmenting the licensed supply pool</li>\n<li>Utilizing unlicensed supply</li>\n<li>Automation and AI</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>1) Making discovery of licensed providers easier </strong><br />\nSome startups are tackling verticals that lack good discovery of licensed providers. Examples include Houzz, which enables users to search for and contact licensed home improvement professionals, and StyleSeat, which helps users find and book beauty appointments with licensed cosmetologists.</p>\n<p><strong>2) Hiring and managing existing providers to maintain quality</strong><br />\nCompanies can raise the quality of service by hiring and managing providers themselves, and by managing the end-to-end customer experience. Examples are Honor and Trusted, managed marketplaces for elder care and childcare, respectively, which employ caregivers as W-2 employees and provide them with training and tools. In the real estate world, Redfin agents are employees whose compensation is tied to customer satisfaction, unlike most real estate agents who are independent contractors working on commission.</p>\n<p><strong>3) Expanding or augmenting the licensed supply pool</strong><br />\nExpanding the licensed supply pool can take the form of leveraging geographic arbitrage to access supply that&#8217;s not located near demand. Decorist, Havenly, Laurel &#38; Wolf, and other online interior design companies enable interior designers around the world to provide design services to consumers without physically visiting their homes (yes, in many parts of the US interior design requires a license!). With improvements in real-time video, richer telepresence technologies, and better visualization technologies, more synchronous services are also shifting from being delivered in-person to online. Outschool and Lambda School are examples of de-localizing instruction, enabling teachers and students to participate remotely while preserving real-time interaction.</p>\n<p>Another approach is to help suppliers navigate the certification process. A16z portfolio company Wonderschool makes it easier for individuals to get licensed and operate in-home daycares.</p>\n<p>Lastly, there’s the approach of augmenting certified providers so they can serve more customers. Fuzzy, an in-home veterinary service, uses AI and vet technicians to augment the productivity of licensed veterinarians; and a16z portfolio company Atrium builds automation and workflow management to provide efficiency gains in the legal industry.</p>\n<p><strong>4) Utilizing unlicensed supply</strong><br />\nSome companies utilize unlicensed supply&#8211;notably Lyft, Uber, and other peer-to-peer rideshare networks. Another example is Basis, a managed marketplace for guided conversations with trained but unlicensed specialists to help people with anxiety, depression and other mild to moderate mental health issues.</p>\n<p>In the pet space, Good Dog is a marketplace that brings together responsible pet breeders and consumers looking for a dog. Going beyond existing breeder licensing, which the company felt didn’t map to what consumers valued, Good Dog established its own higher set of standards and screening process in conjunction with veterinary and academic experts.</p>\n<p><strong>5) Automation and AI<br />\n</strong>Other startups automate away the need for a licensed service provider altogether. These include MDAcne, which uses computer vision to diagnose and treat acne; and Ike Robotics and other autonomous trucking startups which remove the need for a licensed truck driver.<strong><br />\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Opportunities for companies addressing regulated services<br />\n</strong>The last twenty years saw the explosion of a number of services coming online, from transportation to food delivery to home services, as well as an evolution of marketplace models from listings to full-stack, managed marketplaces. The next twenty years will be about the harder opportunities that software hasn’t yet infiltrated&#8211;those filled with technological, operational, and regulatory hurdles&#8211;where there is room to have massive impact on the quality and convenience of consumers’ everyday lives.</p>\n<p>The services sector represents two-thirds of US consumer spending and employs 80% of the workforce. The companies that reinvent various service categories can improve both consumers’ and professionals’ lives&#8211;by creating more jobs and income, providing more flexible work arrangements, and improving consumer access and lowering cost.</p>\n<p>The companies mentioned in this essay just scratch the surface of regulated industries.

I’ve had folks over to 1455 Market St, the headquarters of Uber, and I’ve reciprocated with visits to the Airbnb offices too. I’ve learned a ton from these conversations, and met awesome people along the way!</p>\n<p>While both consumer marketplaces are very different — one is a city-by-city transportation service, the other a global network of homes — they also share a lot of similarities too: Both were founded within a year of each other, quickly found network effects, made major design innovations that made the consumer experience 10X better, and much more. Importantly, both companies are tremendous growth stories, and have needed to grow both demand but especially supply in all of their markets globally.</p>\n<p>Today, I have a wonderful guest essay to share by <b>Lenny Rachitsky </b>(<a href=\"https://twitter.com/lennysan\">@lennysan</a>) — he’s recently left Airbnb after 7 years, much of his recent years as the product leader on Supply Growth. We&#8217;re all lucky that he&#8217;s now sharing his wisdom more widely!</p>\n<p>This discussion is critical because the supply side — homes/hosts for Airbnb and drivers for Uber — are the most important aspect of most consumer marketplace startups, which I’ve written about this in my previous essay, “<a href=\"https://andrewchen.co/why-uber-for-x-failed/\">Why Uber for X Startups Failed: The Supply Side is King</a>.” Lenny&#8217;s essay below discusses a comprehensive list of tactics and ideas around growing this critical side of the market. It’s fantastic, and I hope you enjoy it.</p>\n<p>Thanks,<br />\nAndrew</p>\n<hr />\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3><img class=\"alignright wp-image-4674 size-full\" src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/lenny.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" />Twenty Eight Ways to Grow Supply in a Marketplace</h3>\n<p>By Lenny Rachitsky</p>\n<blockquote><p>Airbnb now seems like an unstoppable juggernaut, but early on it was so fragile that about 30 days of going out and engaging in person with users made the difference between success and failure.<br />\n— Paul Graham, founder of YC</p></blockquote>\n<p>Deciding to open your home to strangers is a complex decision. Over the course of the seven years that I spent at Airbnb, my work centered around helping people all over the world make this decision. As the number of homes on Airbnb scaled from around 100,000 in 2012 to over 6 million today, I led teams tackling everything from supply growth, to guest booking conversion, to marketplace quality. As a result of this experience, I’m often asked what I’d recommend startups do to grow supply in their marketplace. The truth is that at the root of Airbnb’s success was a very good idea — affordable and unique travel experiences for guests, and great income for hosts. That being said, an idea is nothing without execution.</p>\n<p>Below is an overview of every tactic and strategy I’ve seen used to bootstrap and accelerate supply growth, both at Airbnb and other successful marketplaces. Though some of these worked at Airbnb, and some didn’t, every marketplace has different challenges — my advice is to pick a few tactics that resonate, experiment with them, learn, and adjust.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4692\" src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/airbnb_tactics_list-1024x828.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"485\" srcset=\"http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/airbnb_tactics_list-1024x828.png 1024w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/airbnb_tactics_list-300x243.png 300w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/airbnb_tactics_list-768x621.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Tactic #1: Nail the value prop on your site/app <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f44c.png\" alt=\"👌\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /><br />\n</strong></p>\n<blockquote id=\"e3e1\" class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--h3\"><p>Understanding the context and expectations of your audience is vital to engaging them.

What’s interesting is what happens when we add reputation to the mix — in our case with reviews. When you have less than three reviews, nothing changes. But if you’ve got more than ten, everything changes. High reputation beats high similarity.

It’s hard enough to win one market.</li>\n<li>This often requires doing things that don’t scale at first.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3>Strategy #6: Segment supply <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f469-200d-1f33e.png\" alt=\"👩‍🌾\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f469-200d-2708-fe0f.png\" alt=\"👩‍✈️\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f469-200d-1f52c.png\" alt=\"👩‍🔬\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></h3>\n<blockquote><p>Early on Airbnb presented only one image of itself to hosts. Many types of hosts deemed the platform unsuitable, but opening ourselves and marketing to business travel hosts and luxury home hosts gave those hosts a message they wanted to hear. They could host the types of guest they felt were suitable for their property. This allowed us to onboard inventory we previously couldn’t, and gave existing hosts more optionality in how they marketed to and serviced those guests.<br />\n— Marc McCabe, ex-Head of Airbnb for Business</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>What</strong>: Determine what categories of supply you have and/or want, and dedicate teams to growing that type of supply. Generally, different categories require very different tactics, skills sets, and operating cadences.</p>\n<p><strong>Stage</strong>: Mid/Late-stage</p>\n<p><strong>Examples</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Airbnb: Private homes, vacation rentals, luxury home.</li>\n<li>Uber: Black cars, individual car owner, scooter.</li>\n<li>eBay: Individual sellers, brick and mortar stores, wholesalers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Tips</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When introducing a new class of supply, there are many important considerations, including making sure you have a team whose ass is on the line for making this supply successful, making sure the demand side is set up to convert this new supply well, and avoiding overly diluting your marketplace differentiation.</li>\n<li>New segments often appear organically, and it’s up to you to decide if (and when) you want to double down on segment, or squash it.</li>\n<li>For the more professional segments, you’ll likely need to build advanced tools and integrations in order to fit into their existing workflows.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h3>Final thoughts</h3>\n<p>Looking back at my time at Airbnb, a few things become clear. One, there were no silver bullets — success came from many wins building on each other. Two, most things we tried didn’t have an impact — but enough did. Three, it all only made sense in hindsight. My advice to you as you navigate scaling your marketplace is above all else, stay focused on providing value to your users. Their success will make or break you. Beyond that, avoid spreading your team too thinly across many tactics (aka focus), double down on the things that show promise (aka focus), and never lose sight of your north star (aka focus). Also, focus.</p>\n<p>For more writings about growth, product, management, and related topics, make sure to <a href=\"https://lenny.substack.com/\">subscribe to my new newsletter</a> and <a

href=\"https://twitter.com/TheRialMichelle\">follow her at @TheRialMichelle</a>), then working at Buzzfeed, posted this hilarious infographic with all the &#8220;X for Y&#8221; ideas. <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/michellerial/is-your-startup-idea-already-taken\">Here&#8217;s the original article</a>.</p>\n<p>I had a quick laugh, of course. But then seeing this infographic made me think through some deeper things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What are &#8220;X for Y&#8221; companies and why do they sound compelling?</li>\n<li>Are &#8220;X for Y&#8221; companies actually a good idea?</li>\n<li>When do they work? When do they not?</li>\n<li>.. and finally, what happens when my &#8220;X for Y&#8221; startup idea is taken?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And so this is an attempt to provide some serious ideas for this otherwise funny question.</p>\n<p><strong>People love describing startups as &#8220;X for Y&#8221; &#8212; why?</strong><br />\nA few years back, &#8220;Facebook for X&#8221; companies were all the rage. And then it was &#8220;Uber for X.&#8221; And now I&#8217;m hearing about &#8220;Stripe for X,&#8221; &#8220;Superhuman for X&#8221; and &#8220;Twitch for X.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In fact, Marketwatch <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/everyone-wants-to-be-like-airbnb-and-uber-2015-03-20\">did an analysis</a> of startup company descriptions and found that startups often compared themselves to other companies in their descriptions. Here&#8217;s the list of the most common startup comparisons:</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4715\" src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MW-DI075_startu_20150320110218_ZH.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MW-DI075_startu_20150320110218_ZH.jpg 880w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MW-DI075_startu_20150320110218_ZH-300x169.jpg 300w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MW-DI075_startu_20150320110218_ZH-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p>\n<p>&#8220;X for Y&#8221; comparisons are popular! This is a really common format to describe startup ideas because it accomplishes a couple things all at once: First, it positions you against something successful. Unless it&#8217;s intended as an insult (ha!), no one ever describes their startup as the&#8221;[Failed startup] for X.&#8221; Second, it both conveys a lot of information and also doesn&#8217;t &#8212; when someone who hears the idea, it&#8217;s like a short puzzle to solve to try and understand what it might mean. And yet, as a one-liner, it begs for interactivity, so that people will ask more.</p>\n<p>Third, it makes it easy for the people passionate about what you&#8217;re doing &#8212; your employees, investors, and customers &#8212; to spread the news about what you&#8217;re doing. Nivi, half of the Venture Hacks blog, wrote back in 2008:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The pitch is the perfect tool for fans who are spreading the word about your company. Investors use the pitch when they tell their partners about your startup. Customers use the pitch when they rave about your product. The press uses the pitch when they cover the company.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In other words, short, pithy descriptions tend to travel further, and you want to arm your proponents with a blurb to spread!</p>\n<p>But the real question is, do &#8220;X for Y&#8221; companies actually work? Is this a good strategy?</p>\n<p><strong>The &#8220;X for Y&#8221; companies that have worked</strong><br />\nInterestingly, although you&#8217;d think that this strategy would lead to derivative/uninspired ideas, in practice they have worked.</p>\n<p>I asked Twitter this question and did some googling, and there were a number of compelling examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>YouTube was originally &#8220;Flickr for video&#8221;</li>\n<li>Glassdoor was &#8220;TripAdvisor for jobs&#8221;</li>\n<li>Airbnb was &#8220;eBay for space&#8221;</li>\n<li>Baidu was &#8220;Google for China&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(I&#8217;m sure if you search around, you&#8217;d find even more examples &#8212; tweet at me at @andrewchen if you have others in mind!)</p>\n<p><strong>So which &#8220;X for Y&#8221; companies will work in the future?</strong><br />\nNow that I&#8217;ve talked through all this and you want to go back up to look at the Buzzfeed infographic, you might be asking yourself, which of these ideas are actually good?</p>\n<p>In broad strokes, all the &#8220;X for Y&#8221; ideas end up falling on a spectrum of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>[Successful product] for [<strong>vertical segment</strong>] on side&#8230;</li>\n<li>&#8230; to [Successful product] for [<strong>new category</strong>] on the other</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An example of the former might be something like, &#8220;YouTube for Kids&#8221; &#8212; which is a segment of the existing product. This has the advantage that there&#8217;s a lot of pre-existing behaviors to work off of, and if you go deep enough on the functionality for this vertical, there might be a way to create a differentiated experience. On the other hand, you are also more likely to end up building a sustaining innovation, where an industry incumbent sees it as part of their turf, and they can extend into the category quickly. So what you gain in minimizing execution risk you trade off in terms of increased competitive risk.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, something like &#8220;YouTube for Amazon Echo&#8221; sounds kind of weird and foreign, since it doesn&#8217;t yet exist &#8212; yet it could still possibly make sense as an idea. It might be a social platform to create and play back audio clips from other users, like a UGC podcasting platform. I don&#8217;t know. At this end of the spectrum, you&#8217;re talking about a new category of products and new user behaviors that might make sense. In that way, you take a ton of market risk &#8212; but if it works, you might dominate the whole category.</p>\n<p>And interestingly, in the examples above for YouTube, Glassdoor, Airbnb, etc. &#8212; I&#8217;d argue that they fell more into the new category creation side of the spectrum rather than a segment. At the time the products were created, Flickr didn&#8217;t have much video capability and it wasn&#8217;t a popular format for users. Tripadvisor didn&#8217;t let you review jobs (nor does it today). eBay didn&#8217;t support reserving homes and space. And Google wasn&#8217;t in China. And so these &#8220;X for Y&#8221; concepts, once they worked, had a higher ceiling since it wasn&#8217;t constrained by a giant competitor running them down quickly. The geographical aspect of Baidu was probably, in many ways, the smallest moat in terms of product, but we know that getting into China is special and most of the largest tech giants never made it happen.</p>\n<p><strong>Watch out for broken metaphors</strong><br />\nI&#8217;ve written in the past on why almost all of the &#8220;Uber for X&#8221; startups failed &#8212; <a href=\"https://andrewchen.co/why-uber-for-x-failed/\">you can read that here</a> &#8212; and ultimately, even if the idea sounds cool to your and your startup friends/investors, the value proposition must still be really strong to all the customers and users involved.</p>\n<p>Something like &#8220;Uber for cleaning&#8221; sounds great until you ask if the cleaners actually want to work this way, if consistent/high-quality service can be delivered, and if the unit economics make sense? But it can be catchy for investors. That&#8217;s not enough. Broken metaphors happen when something that&#8217;s meant for an investor pitch becomes ingrained in the product itself. Rarely does the end user care about your startup&#8217;s desire to position itself against another successful startup.</p>\n<p>So go work on &#8220;Tinder for doctors.&#8221; Or &#8220;Birchbox for pizza.&#8221; Use it for the Linkedin blurb describing your company, and on your 5-min accelerator pitch. But don&#8217;t forget, there&#8217;s a reason why &#8220;Uber for X&#8221; startups have mostly failed &#8212; you need to lead with the customer value, not with what is easily described within the startup community.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://andrewchen.co/x-for-y-startup-ideas/\">&#8220;Is your startup idea taken?&#8221; &#8212; and why we love X for Y startups</a> is also published on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://andrewchen.co\">andrewchen</a>.</p>\n","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 06 Nov 2019 16:00:00 +0000","feedId":83,"bgimg":"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/startup_idea_taken.jpeg","linkMd5":"85f07e52b2b0948961bd0945e85af838","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn95@2020_2/2020-07-24/1595596428270_0e8c7650000c039b.webp","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/startup_idea_taken.jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn95@2020_2/2020-07-24/1595596428270_0e8c7650000c039b.webp","https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/261d.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn7@2020_4/2020-07-24/1595596444431_89738354bd9e9720.webp","http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MW-DI075_startu_20150320110218_ZH.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx14/cdn19@2020_4/2020-07-24/1595596445141_44a6d732dea7fdb6.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-07-24 21:13:38","updatedTime":"2020-07-24 13:13:38","title":"The Adjacent User Theory","link":"http://andrewchen.co/?p=4733","description":"<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Guest Post by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/iambangaly\">Bangaly Kaba</a> (EIR @ Reforge, Former VP Growth @ Instacart, Instagram) </em></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bangaly-Kaba.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-4734 alignleft\" src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bangaly-Kaba.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"267\" /></a></em></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>The following was written by Bangaly with contributions by other Reforge EIR&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/elenaverna/\">Elena Verna</a> (Miro, MongoDB, SurveyMonkey) and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/far33d\">Fareed Mosavat</a> (Slack, Instacart, Zynga).

We were growing linearly, not exponentially. For many products that would be viewed as an amazing success, but for a viral social product like Instagram, linear growth doesn&#8217;t cut it. My job was to help the team accelerate and get back to exponential growth. Over the next 3 years, the growth team and I discovered why Instagram had slowed, developed a methodology to diagnose our issues, and solved a series of problems that reignited growth and helped us get to over a billion users by the time I left.</p>\n<p>Our success was anchored on what I now call <em>The Adjacent User Theory</em>. <em>The Adjacent Users</em> are aware of a product and possibly tried using the it, but are not able to successfully become an engaged user. This is typically because the current product positioning or experience has too many barriers to adoption for them.</p>\n<p>While Instagram had product-market fit for 400+ million people, we discovered new groups of users who didn&#8217;t quite understand Instagram and how it fit into their lives. Our insight was that it is critical for growth teams to be continually defining who the adjacent user is, to understand why they are struggling, to build empathy for the adjacent user, and ultimately to solve their problems. And Adjacent User Theory doesn&#8217;t just apply to hyper-growth machines like Instagram, I&#8217;ve seen the dynamic play out again and again at plenty of other product-driven companies.</p>\n<h1>The Importance Of The Adjacent User</h1>\n<p>Solving for the Adjacent user is critical for a few reasons.</p>\n<h2><strong>Solving For The Adjacent User Captures The Potential Of Current Product Market Fit</strong></h2>\n<p>When you have <a href=\"https://brianbalfour.com/essays/market-product-fit\">Product-Market Fit</a>, you have healthy retention curves (they flatten out). But this isn&#8217;t the end goal. Your current retention doesn&#8217;t represent the true potential of your current product-market fit. There is a hypothetical retention curve that sits above that represents this true potential.</p>\n<p>What creates this gap? There are a set of users who show intent for your product but are not quite able to get over the hump. Those are your Adjacent Users. Solving for the Adjacent User through <a href=\"https://www.reforge.com/blog/product-work-beyond-product-market-fit?utm_source=ac&#38;utm_medium=blog\">growth and scaling work</a> helps your product realize its true product-market fit potential.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/current-pmf-retention.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-4735 aligncenter\" src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/current-pmf-retention-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/current-pmf-retention-1024x576.png 1024w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/current-pmf-retention-300x169.png 300w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/current-pmf-retention-768x432.png 768w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/current-pmf-retention-1536x864.png 1536w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/current-pmf-retention.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></a></p>\n<h2><strong>The Impact Of Solving For The Adjacent User Compounds Over time</strong></h2>\n<p>Every year there are massive efforts to getting voters to register and get to the polls. Those voters not only impact the outcome of one election, but can change the engagement of future elections and generations of politics.</p>\n<p>In a similar way, when you enable adjacent users to successfully experience the core value proposition, it not only changes the engagement of near term cohorts but flows through to creating impact for all future cohorts of users. This doesn&#8217;t just impact retention, but flows through your <a href=\"https://www.reforge.com/blog/growth-loops?utm_source=ac&#38;utm_medium=blog\">growth loops</a> to <a href=\"https://www.reforge.com/blog/growth-metric-acquisition-monetization-virality?utm_source=ac&#38;utm_medium=blog\">impact acquisition and monetization</a> as well.</p>\n<h2>The Adjacent User Is A Different Way To Focus Product Efforts</h2>\n<p>Most product teams know their existing users pretty well. But your future audience is always evolving. The challenges that these potential users face in adopting the product increase over time. Without a team dedicated to understanding, advocating, and building for your next set of users, you end up never expanding your audience. This stalls growth, and the product never reaches the level you aspire it to.</p>\n<h1>Going Deeper On The Adjacent User</h1>\n<p>You can think about your product as a series of circles. Each of these circles is defined by the primary user states that someone could be in. For example Power, Core, Casual, Signed Up, Visitor. Each one of these circles have users that are &#8220;in orbit&#8221; around it. These users have an equal or greater chance they drift off into space rather than crossing the threshold to the next state. There is something preventing them from getting over the hump and transitioning into the next state. These are your adjacent users and the goal is to identify who they are and understand their reasons struggling to adopt. As you solve for them, you push the edge of the circle out to capture more of that audience and grow.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-1.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4744\" src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-1.png 1920w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-1-300x169.png 300w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-1-1024x576.png 1024w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-1-768x432.png 768w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-1-1536x864.png 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></a></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2><strong>Instagram Example Of The Adjacent User</strong></h2>\n<p>Lets go through a couple of examples, starting with Instagram. The primary thresholds that a user has to cross to becoming a core user:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Not Signed Up → Signed Up</li>\n<li>Signed Up → Activated</li>\n<li>Casual → Core Usage</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At each one of these thresholds, there are users that are circling around them, that have an equal or greater chance of not crossing the threshold.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Bangaly: &#8220;At Instagram, if a user had more than 10 followers in the first 7 days after signing up there was over a 65% chance that the user would become activated. There was always a group of users on that margin that would struggle to build their audience. But the reasons they struggled varied across different sets of user and changed over time.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/instagramexample.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4737\" src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/instagramexample-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/instagramexample-1024x576.png 1024w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/instagramexample-300x169.png 300w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/instagramexample-768x432.png 768w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/instagramexample-1536x864.png 1536w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/instagramexample.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></a></p>\n<h2><strong>Slack Example Of The Adjacent User</strong></h2>\n<p>Lets go through an example for Slack. The primary thresholds that user has to cross through are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Not Signed Up → Signed Up (Acquisition Teams)</li>\n<li>Signed Up → Casual (Activation Teams)</li>\n<li>Casual → Core Free (Engagement Teams)</li>\n<li>Core Free → <a href=\"https://www.reforge.com/blog/monetization-vs-growth-its-a-false-choice?utm_source=ac&#38;utm_medium=blog\">Monetized</a> (Monetization Teams)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At each one of these thresholds, there are users that are circling around them, that once again have an equal or greater chance of just drifting off into space.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Fareed: <em>&#8220;At Slack, we found that if a user was active 3 days out of the last 7 (3d7), they were right on the edge and had a roughly 50/50 chance of churning or retaining the next week.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/slackexample.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4738\" src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/slackexample-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/slackexample-1024x576.png 1024w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/slackexample-300x169.png 300w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/slackexample-768x432.png 768w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/slackexample-1536x864.png 1536w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/slackexample.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></a></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h2>Why Teams Don&#8217;t Focus On The Adjacent User</h2>\n<p>There are a few things that tend to lead teams away from focusing on the adjacent user:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Focusing On The Power User</li>\n<li>Personas Are The Wrong Tool</li>\n<li>Trying To Hit A Home Run On Every Swing</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The Gravity Of The Power User</h2>\n<p>Product teams by nature are <a href=\"https://andrewchen.co/power-user-curve/\">power users</a> of their own product. The parts of the product that the product team uses, tend to automatically get improved as the pain is right in front of them. But this leads to building for yourself (or your friends). While that can feed the ego, if you are only building for yourself or power users, you won&#8217;t grow. You need to constantly be building for that next user that doesn&#8217;t have the same level of knowledge, intent, or needs that you, your team, and your power users already have.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Working on the adjacent user requires you to cross a cognitive threshold.</em></strong> You have to specifically seek out the definition to &#8220;see&#8221; them and understand their experience, which is likely to be dramatically different from what you see as an employee. Once you see them, you can build empathy for them and their struggles, which in turn informs what you build.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Andrew: <em>&#8220;At Uber, a lot of employees were power users of the Uber product. This led to a lot of voices thinking they knew what we needed to grow just because they used the product a lot. But these were rarely the things that pushed growth of Uber into new audiences.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>\n<h2>Personas Tend To Be The Wrong Tool</h2>\n<p>When trying to answer the question of who they are trying to solve for, product teams often use their stated personas as the answer. But personas, as they are typically defined, have one or more of the following issues:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Current User vs Next User &#8211;</strong> Product personas tend to describe <a href=\"https://caseyaccidental.com/different-persona-types\">who your current users are</a>. The adjacent user is a forecast of who your next user is so that you can enable the things to make them successful.</li>\n<li><strong>Too Static &#8211;</strong> A company will often come up with their personas and anchor on them for years, never evolving and updating them. The definition of your adjacent user should be evolving and changing more frequently as you solve for one and move to another.</li>\n<li><strong>Too Broad &#8211;</strong> Personas tend to be too broad to be actionable. Living beneath a lot of persona definitions are many sub-segments. <strong><em>The adjacent user is about having a view on those sub-segments living at the edge of who the product is working for today.</em></strong></li>\n<li><strong>Not Based on Usage</strong> &#8211; Companies often build personas based on demographic factors and emotional needs. While these are valuable for many applications, they won&#8217;t help you solve adoption issues for adjacent users unless you also include their usage barriers in your definitions.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Trying To Hit A Home Run Every Time</h2>\n<p>Product teams overvalue hitting home runs vs hitting 100 singles back to back. This leads them to take bigger swings by going after bigger markets of new users. <strong><em>They get bogged down by trying to establish product-market fit for a new set of users and never fulfill the potential of their current product-market fit.</em></strong></p>\n<p>Remember, adjacent users are the users who are struggling to adopt your product today. Non-adjacent users could literally be everyone else in the entire world. Sure, non-adjacent users might be a larger market, but the barriers to their adoption are also dramatically higher. Companies that try to go too big too soon and often, skip the next obvious steps and fail to solve their current adoption problems.</p>\n<p>Solving for the adjacent user is often seen as &#8220;optimization&#8221;, which in some organizations is viewed poorly because they represent short-term thinking. <strong><em>Solving for your adjacent user is not short term thinking; it is this disciplined sequential execution that will enable your longer-term roadmap and faster growth</em></strong>. It is short turns on a longer term path, not short term.</p>\n<h1>How To Know The Adjacent User Is Here</h1>\n<p>Until you recognize that they are adjacent users and commit to helping them, they will remain adjacent. <strong><em>They aren&#8217;t going to get there on their own.</em></strong> You have to be passionate about them and learn to view the product from their eyes. If you don&#8217;t focus on them, growth slows and your cohorts decay.</p>\n<h2>Cohort Decay Is Your Signal</h2>\n<p>At a high enough volume of users, you will start to see the effect of the adjacent user show up in your cohorts. Sitting at the edge of each user state is a quantitative metric that indicates conversion from one state to the next. For example, free to paid conversion or signed up to activated.</p>\n<p>When you look at these variables on a cohorted basis, you will almost always see a decline from cohort to cohort over time. This is because there is some segment of adjacent users that are entering that state and struggling to convert to the next.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Elena: <em>&#8220;When you start investing into new channels (especially paid) it is typically a signal to the product org that adjacent users are coming. New channels bring in users that will be different on some vector. Lower intent, less solution aware, less brand aware, pain point not completely formulated, or something else.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>\n<h3>Slack Example of Cohort Decay</h3>\n<blockquote><p>Fareed: &#8220;A common thing I see across freemium SaaS companies I advise, is free to paid conversion decline from cohort to cohort. This is your signal that there are a set of adjacent users on the edge of this state that you need to start solving for.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>What Fareed&#8217;s story is pointing out is that at the edge of Core Free → Paying User, the metric that monitors that edge is free to paid conversion. Over time, if you look at that metric on a cohorted basis, you will start to see the metric go down from cohort to cohort. This can happen at the edge of any user state (signup to activated, activated to core, etc).</p>\n<h1><a href=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-1-1.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-4745 aligncenter\" src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-1-1.png\" alt=\"cohort_decay\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-1-1.png 1920w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-1-1-300x169.png 300w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-1-1-1024x576.png 1024w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-1-1-768x432.png 768w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-1-1-1536x864.png 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></a></h1>\n<h1>Discovering and Defining Your Adjacent Users</h1>\n<p>The first step to seeing the product through the eyes of the Adjacent User is to build a hypothesis of who they are and why they are struggling. How do we do that?</p>\n<h2><strong>The Goal Is To Get Visibility, But Not Perfect Visibility</strong></h2>\n<p>The goal of defining your adjacent users is to get visibility, but not perfect visibility. You need to define the landscape in front of you to understand all your options and figure out which type of adjacent user to focus on. Knowing just one adjacent user segment isn&#8217;t enough because you often have several to choose from.</p>\n<p>But there are equal problems trying to get perfect visibility. You will never have perfect visibility and perfect definitions. If you seek out understanding perfect visibility you will never get started.</p>\n<p>The process is to lay out multiple hypotheses of who the adjacent users are, choose which one to focus on strategically, force your team to look at the product through their lens, experiment and talk to customers to validate and learn, then update the landscape to make your next choice. I like to think about it as a snowball. You know very little at first, but as the snowball turns you collect more information about the adjacent user, which helps you collect more snow (users).</p>\n<h2>Knowing Who Is Successful Today and Why</h2>\n<p>To understand your adjacent users, it is helpful to understand the attributes of who is successful today and why they are successful. The reason this is helpful is that your adjacent user is different on one or more of these attributes (but not all). These attributes create vectors of expansion. Lets go through an example.</p>\n<p>At Instacart, we knew that over 75% of our core, healthy users were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Women</li>\n<li>Urban</li>\n<li>Located In Certain Cities</li>\n<li>Head of Household</li>\n<li>Had one or more kids</li>\n<li>Were more affluent and less price sensitive</li>\n<li>Willing to spend an hour filling up their Instacart Order</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some of these things we knew from data. Some of these thing we knew from customer conversations. Some of them we knew by inference. Each one of these attributes creates vectors of expansion</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Women → Men</li>\n<li>Urban → Suburban</li>\n<li>Cities → Other Cities</li>\n<li>Head of Household → Members of households</li>\n<li>1 Kid → Smaller Families, Couples, Singles</li>\n<li>More Affluent + Less Price Sensitive → More Price Sensitive</li>\n<li>Willingness to put effort in the cart → Less willingness to spend that time</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The more granular you can get, typically the better. But there are a set of common categories for attributes. Which categories are relevant and most impactful depend on the product:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gender</li>\n<li>Age</li>\n<li>Income</li>\n<li>Geo</li>\n<li>Language</li>\n<li>Price Sensitivity</li>\n<li>Tech Enablement</li>\n<li>Customer Maturity</li>\n<li>Device Capability</li>\n<li>Use Case for The Product</li>\n<li>Role</li>\n<li>Company</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/commonattribute.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4740\" src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/commonattribute-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/commonattribute-1024x576.png 1024w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/commonattribute-300x169.png 300w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/commonattribute-768x432.png 768w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/commonattribute-1536x864.png 1536w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/commonattribute.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></a></p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<h2>Who Is The Adjacent User?</h2>\n<p>Once you have hypotheses for who is successful and why they are successful, you can hypothesize possible adjacent users segments. This will involve changing one or more of the vectors that you identified.</p>\n<p>I typically recommend starting with a bottoms-up analysis of your data. You do not need to spend weeks talking to users to get a sense for who your adjacent user is. Look at what is happening on the edges of these states in the data. The data will help you identify places in the product that people are dropping off. This is the starting point to help you develop hypotheses about <em>why</em> different segments of users are dropping off.</p>\n<p>At Instacart, when we initially looked at the data, we found that it took a really long time for current successful users to create their first order. As we looked through that flow, it became an understandable problem. For someone that had never placed an order, there were tens of thousands of products, and this person wanted to find a specific product quickly. Our hypothesis was that current users were very high intent users who were willing to spend an hour filling up their cart versus driving to the store. It led us to start focusing on the discoverability of products within first use to capture users with less intent.</p>\n<p>At Instagram, when we first looked at the data, we started to see an enormous amount of organic web traffic showing up, but they weren&#8217;t converting to sign-ups and healthy users. We didn&#8217;t have any idea why. But through a lot of data exploration, we started to figure out where those users were coming from, why they were coming via web traffic, and other reasons that helped us define the adjacent user.</p>\n<p>When you have an early hypothesis of who the adjacent user is from the data, use that to inform who you recruit for user research. Those customer conversations help you do two things: One, validate and fill in your hypotheses on who the adjacent user is; and two, start to build empathy for the adjacent user and understand why they are struggling.</p>\n<h2>Why Are They The Adjacent User?</h2>\n<p>It is not enough to know who the adjacent user is, but you need to know why they are struggling. To do that, <strong><em>you have to build empathy with the adjacent user</em></strong>. This is the most important part.</p>\n<p>Building empathy for the adjacent user is hard because by definition your team is not living the experience of the adjacent user. Your team are power users of the product. They know the product in and out. To build empathy with the adjacent user and create hypotheses of why they are struggling, I recommend four techniques:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Be The Adjacent User</li>\n<li>Watch The Adjacent User</li>\n<li>Talk To The Adjacent User</li>\n<li>Visit The Adjacent User</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Lets talk about each of these individually.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/empathyadjacentuser.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4741\" src=\"http://andrewchen.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/empathyadjacentuser-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/empathyadjacentuser-1024x576.png 1024w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/empathyadjacentuser-300x169.png 300w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/empathyadjacentuser-768x432.png 768w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/empathyadjacentuser-1536x864.png 1536w, http://1g1uem2nc4jy1gzhn943ro0gz50.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/empathyadjacentuser.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></a></p>\n<h3>Be The Adjacent User</h3>\n<p>You need to force the team to be the adjacent user by experiencing the product in the conditions and settings that the adjacent user is experiencing. This is commonly referred to as dog-fooding. This starts by making sure the team is constantly experiencing new user flows, empty states, and product states that require a certain amount of usage before they become valuable.</p>\n<p>This eventually progresses to building tools to be able to simulate the experience of your adjacent users. For example, at Instagram as our adjacent users increasingly became more international, we needed to find a way to experience the product across many permutations of devices, network speeds, languages, and much more. Facebook built something called Air Traffic Control, which simulated elements of these permutations like network speed so the team could experience the product through the eyes of the adjacent user.</p>\n<p>At Instacart, we had to find ways to experience the product through the eyes of someone in an expansion market like Overland, Kansas. There the store options, delivery windows, and other factors were completely different than what a PM or engineer on the team in San Francisco would be experiencing.</p>\n<p>Living every day as the adjacent user uncovers hidden connections and dependencies in the product that impact the experience for the adjacent user that would have otherwise gone unnoticed.</p>\n<h3>Watch The Adjacent User</h3>\n<p>The second technique is to watch the adjacent user using your product through usability tests. Ideally this is done with trained researchers when possible. Watch the adjacent user try to sign up, activate, see what they struggle on, have them talk about why they are having challenges and what their expectations of the experience are.</p>\n<p>Do not help them until they get stuck so you can observer what kind of workarounds and hacks people create to get the outcomes they want. This is how you start uncovering behavior that explains aberrant data, or behavior for which data doesn&#8217;t exist.</p>\n<h3>Talk To The Adjacent User</h3>\n<p>The third technique is to talk to the adjacent user about why they are trying to use your product, what jobs they are trying to solve, and which <a href=\"https://brianbalfour.com/quick-takes/alternatives-not-competitors\">alternatives</a> they are considering or have already tried. Surveys are fastest to deploy to get signal on where you should spend more time and focus. But surveys alone are not sufficient. You need to talk to users in person to go deeper.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of the post I talked about the example at Instagram where we started to see a large increase in access churn (users logging out, then failing to log back in successfully). Two directions emerged. We could either make it harder for people to log out, or easier to log back in. But to determine which path was best, we needed to understand why people were logging out in increasing volumes.</p>\n<p>We decided to talk to a lot of users who were intentionally logging out. What we found were two things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>People had a real use case for logging out. They logged out either because they had a prepaid phone plan and were worried about background data usage, or they were sharing the phone with a family member.</li>\n<li>These users also commonly used fake email addresses. Email addresses are more of a western paradigm, and new people to the internet internationally don&#8217;t use email, they just text.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Once we understood these two things, it was clear the right strategic direction was to work on making it easier to log back in vs harder to log out and we were able to come up with some creative solutions for the use cases.</p>\n<h3>Visit The Adjacent User</h3>\n<p>The last technique is to visit the adjacent user in their environment. Seeing how your adjacent user uses a product in their environment expands your understanding of their workflow, constraints, and needs. Are B2B customers constantly sharing screens with colleagues for a product that you previously thought of as a personal tool? Are users having performance or usability issues in the real world that you otherwise wouldn’t have considered? Users tend to employ their authentic workarounds and habits in their own environment, which you won’t see in a lab or other manufactured setting.</p>\n<h1>Sequencing Your Adjacent Users</h1>\n<p>One of the biggest failure points is sequencing your adjacent users incorrectly. You want to pick the right adjacent users to go after so that you are building towards longer term value over time.</p>\n<p>If you are familiar with Geoffrey Moore Crossing The Chasm, he referred to something similar called the bowling alley strategy. Find one niche audience that if you solve for them, helps you get to the next audience.</p>\n<p>The center of Moore&#8217;s framework was Customer Maturity: Innovators, Early Adopters, Early Majority, Late Majority, and Laggards. Moore theorized that by solving for the problems of next set of likely adopters you enable the following segments. Adjacent User theory is similar. By enabling your immediate next set of adjacent users, you create the conditions that enable future segments. You can push the boundaries of the core user outcomes down to a lot of vectors, customer maturity being just one.</p>\n<h2>How To Think About Sequencing</h2>\n<p>There are a few keys to sequencing segments of Adjacent Users.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Adjacent User Should Only Be Different On One or Two Attributes</strong></p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s say you have 5 different vectors you can expand on. If your adjacent user definition is different on all 5 of those vectors, or even the majority, choosing that segment is a bad choice. That is like trying to hit a home run on every swing. It is probably going to take too many changes that are too large to enable that segment.</p>\n<p>You need the conviction that you can build something to validate or invalidate the adjacent user definition pretty quickly. The adjacent user is not about capturing one large definition at once, it is about layering on micro definition after micro definition.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Elena: <em>&#8220;A segment that is different on multiple attributes typically requires enabling a new value prop to bring them into the product. That&#8217;s a very big swing. But it&#8217;s not an &#8220;if&#8221; you should be going after them, it&#8217;s a question of &#8220;when.” If you can first add smaller features for adjacent users that only differ on one attribute you can maintain momentum and growth velocity while working up to a new value prop for those multi-attribute users.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>2. Not All Adjacent Users Are Opportunities</strong></p>\n<p>As you explore your adjacent users, you are going to find a lot of possible segments. But just because they exist, does not mean you should choose to serve them. The key here is that the segment still needs to align with the strategic direction of where the product is going.</p>\n<p>Sometimes you will have a lot of insight that an adjacent user exists, but you are unsure if serving them is meaningful and aligns with the strategic direction. This happened while working on Instagram. As we solved access churn (people churning because they had trouble logging back in) we noticed feed posts were going up. At first, we didn&#8217;t know why, but we eventually discovered people had 2nd and 3rd accounts that they were logging back into. One account was public-facing, and one was more private for friends. So the question came up, should we be more intentional about making it easier to create and navigate across multiple accounts? Is that meaningful? Does it align with the strategic direction of the product? We didn&#8217;t have a clear answer and therefore punted on that adjacent user until we had further validation that the 2nd account was an additive opportunity within our strategic direction.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Solve In-House Problems First</strong></p>\n<p>When choosing your adjacent users, it is typically better to solve &#8220;in-house&#8221; problems first. These are users that are already showing up in your funnel and product vs brand new users who aren&#8217;t there yet. Those that are already showing up are displaying intent, but having trouble finishing. Solving for them typically creates more short term impact.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Elena: *&#8221;For B2B products, the way I like to think about sequencing is:</p></blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>First solve for those in the existing user base that can drive additional monetization.</li>\n<li>Second, solve for those in the existing user base that drive additional value in indirect ways. For example, a user might not monetize well but drive tons of viral contribution.</li>\n<li>Third, solve for the brand new adjacent user. These are people not showing up in the user base, but still share traits with the existing user base.&#8221;*</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p>Part of the prioritization should be the impact that you think the adjacent user segment can drive if solved for. The impact is partially driven by the size of the segment today. But one mistake when thinking about impact is to not think about the impact on a longer time horizon. Often times one segment might be larger but not growing, while another could be smaller but have a much larger growth trajectory. When taking that trajectory into account, the second segment may be the better choice.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Fareed: &#8220;When we were looking at international growth opportunities at Slack, we found that both users in France and India had far worse monetization. A lot of teams would have probably chosen to solve for French users since they are a higher income audience.</p></blockquote>\n<p>But users in France weren&#8217;t growing and we didn&#8217;t have a clear hypothesis of why they weren&#8217;t monetizing. On the other hand, India was growing way faster and had a clear hypothesis as to why they weren&#8217;t paying. When looking at it on a slightly longer term horizon, solving for users in India was clearly the higher ROI opportunity.&#8221;</p>\n<h1>The Evolving Adjacent User Landscape</h1>\n<p>The landscape and understanding of your adjacent users are always evolving. When I started at Instagram, the Adjacent User was women 35 &#8211; 45 in the US who had a Facebook account but didn&#8217;t see the value of Instagram. By the time I left Instagram, the Adjacent User was women in Jakarta, on an older 3G Android phone with a prepaid mobile plan. There were probably 8 different types of Adjacent Users that we solved for in-between those two points.</p>\n<p>Your Adjacent User is constantly changing for a few different reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>New Information</strong>As you experiment and solve for one adjacent user, you are constantly gaining new information. This can happen in a few ways:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Unexpected Result &#8211;</strong> You run an experiment and get a result you did not expect.</li>\n<li><strong>New Instrumentation &#8211;</strong> New data instrumentation creates visibility into what is happening in areas you didn&#8217;t have visibility before.</li>\n<li><strong>New Research &#8211;</strong> Through the course of user research to validate hypotheses, you uncover new hypotheses you hadn&#8217;t thought about before.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This new information informs updates to your current adjacent user hypotheses and possibly creates entirely new adjacent user segments.</li>\n<li><strong>New Users Showing Up</strong>As you unlock value for one type of adjacent user, they often start bringing in a new type of adjacent user into your orbit. All healthy products have some acquisition through word of mouth. So when you solve for one adjacent user, their word of mouth brings in their friends who just might be your next type of adjacent user.Unlocking the 35-45yo women in US and Europe on IG brought WOM growth through families. This is an important age group for mothers who would create private IG accounts to share family and kid photos. This influenced their friends to do the same, inspired other relatives to sign up just to see these photos, and their partners ended up joining as well</li>\n<li><strong>New Value Props</strong>As the product team enables new value props in the product, it can fundamentally change what the experience needs to be at the edges of user states for adjacent users to experience the product.At Instagram, this occurred when we launched Stories. Stories didn&#8217;t help activate new users. It actually made it harder. It was hard for new users to have available Stories content because it disappeared after 24hours. Users needed to follow a lot more accounts to have enough content on any given day. The bar was higher and it changed the experience of how we created activation and engagement.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Knowing that the adjacent user is constantly changing, we would reevaluate our understanding of the adjacent user every quarterly planning cycle based on l<a href=\"https://www.reforge.com/experimentation-testing?utm_source=ac&#38;utm_medium=blog\">earnings from experimentation</a> and research. In addition, we would tend to have one off insights a couple of times per year from various events like unexplainable experiment results, press, surveys, or something else. This evolving landscapes highlights the importance of a few different things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Taking Time To Understand <em>The Why</em></strong>Too often teams move on from the positive/negative result of an experiment without understanding why the experiment generated that result. You must take the time to <a href=\"https://www.reforge.com/blog/good-experiment-bad-experiment?utm_source=ac&#38;utm_medium=blog\">understand &#8220;the why&#8217; behind your experimental results</a>. The why helps you understand the next adjacent user. If you don&#8217;t do this you can miss incredibly important shifts in user mindsets as you move from adjacent segment to segment. If you don&#8217;t take the time to understand the why behind your results, you miss the opportunity to build empathy and solve your adjacent user&#8217;s real problems.</li>\n<li><strong>Constantly Working On the Fundamentals Of Registration, Activation, Engagement and Monetization</strong>Too often teams treat key flows in their product as projects. But the adjacent user highlights why you need to be constantly working on the fundamentals of registration, activation, engagement, and monetization. It&#8217;s a continuously evolving user challenge that you need to be constantly re-evaluating. The work never stops.Fareed: &#8220;In the early days of Instacart, the best performing landing page was an all white page, that said &#8220;<em>Instacart, Groceries delivered to your door, put your zip code in&#8221;</em>. Nothing else performed better. The user at that time was very high intent, tech savvy, urban millennial who knew what Instacart was because they heard about it from a friend through the press. As Instacart grew over time, you had to explain what Instacart was, why does it matter, who it is for, what stores we have. The same experiment on the white page a year later had dramatically different results because the adjacent user had changed.&#8221;</li>\n<li><strong>Continually Cross The Cognitive Threshold Of Your Adjacent User</strong>At the beginning of this post, we talked about how working on the adjacent user requires you cross a cognitive threshold of seeing the product experience through their eyes. As the landscape of the adjacent user evolves, you and the team need cross this threshold over and over. It is easy to get sucked back into the gravity of your existing user base. But your job is to constantly expand the definition of who is successful with your product.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>All successful products must eventually shift their focus from core to adjacent users in order to maintain growth rates. Rapid success in your first audience will inherently lead to saturation and declining growth in that segment. While this is certainly an enviable problem to have, solving it is one of the most complex challenges in technology. The most successful companies are the ones that can continuously evolve to serve more adjacent users. The art is selecting the right groups of adjacent users to go after next. If you try to solve all problems for everyone, you&#8217;ll drown across too many issues and waste time acquiring users who have no chance of being successful today.</p>\n<p>Adjacent User Theory demands an entirely different approach to being &#8216;user centric&#8217;. Static personas are OUT. Dynamic evolving personas that incorporate product adoption behavior are the standard to strive for. Every 3-6 months during hyper growth, you have to reorient your team around the next adjacent user, what they care about, and what problems you are solving for them.</p>\n<p>As you are succeed, you&#8217;ll see improving cohort retention, engagement, and monetization in your target adjacent users. You&#8217;ll maintain your growth rate on larger and larger install bases. And you&#8217;ll continuously discover the next adjacent user who could use your product with just a little more help.</p>\n<p>—</p>\n<p><em>If you want to learn more from Bangaly and other leaders from top tech companies, check out Reforge&#8217;s upcoming <a href=\"https://www.reforge.com/?utm_source=ac&#38;utm_medium=blog\">Career Accelerator Programs</a> such as <a href=\"https://www.reforge.com/growth-series?utm_source=ac&#38;utm_medium=blog\">Growth Series</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reforge.com/experimentation-testing?utm_source=ac&#38;utm_medium=blog\">Experimentation and Testing</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.reforge.com/monetization-pricing?utm_source=ac&#38;utm_medium=blog\">Monetization Deep Dive</a>.
