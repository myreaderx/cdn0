Besides using one of the easiest to remember IP addresses, Cloudflare promised that 1.1.1.1 would be one of the fastest DNS services, support DNS-over-HTTPS and DNS-over-TLS, and that it would honor user privacy.</p>\n<p>Cloudflare is one of the options in many, currently experimental, DNS-over-HTTPS implementations in web browsers (Chrome, Firefox) and operating systems (Windows).  <a href=\"https://www.ghacks.net/2020/04/02/cloudflare-launches-1-1-1-1-for-families-with-filter-support/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Cloudflare added optional filters</a> to its service in April 2020 which block block access to undesirable sites on the DNS level.</p>\n<p>Cloudflare launched a companion app for its <a href=\"https://www.ghacks.net/2018/11/12/cloudflare-launches-dns-app-for-android-and-ios/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">DNS service for Android and iOS in 2018</a>, and extended the functionality with its <a href=\"https://www.ghacks.net/2019/09/25/cloudflares-warp-vpn-is-now-available-to-all-a-first-look/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">WARP VPN service</a> in 2019. The application enables the use of the company's DNS service on mobile devices, and users may also connect to the VPN service to improve protection further. Warp users get 100 Megabytes for free but need to subscribe for $4 per month for unlimited data.</p>\n<p>Warp and 1.1.1.1 apps were only available for mobile operating systems up until now. Cloudflare published the first public beta clients of the 1.1.1.1 programs for Microsoft Windows and Apple Macintosh devices <a href=\"https://1.1.1.1/beta/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\">this week</a>.</p>\n<p>The download page reveals that the program is compatible with 64-bit Windows 10 version 1909 and newer versions of Windows, and Mac OS 10.15 or newer. Installation of the Windows client is straightforward; you need to accept the terms on first run before you can start using the client.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-164382\" src=\"https://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/cloudflare-warp.png\" alt=\"cloudflare warp\" width=\"796\" height=\"777\" /></p>\n<p>Cloudflare Warp sits in the system tray area when it is launched. A click displays the main interface featuring a big toggle to connect or disconnect to the VPN network.</p>\n<p>Select the settings icon to switch between using Warp and 1.1.1.1, and only the DNS service 1.1.1.1. The latter may be more convenient than setting up the DNS information manually, but it is better to configure the DNS provider manually as you won't need to run the software on your system for that task.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-164383\" src=\"https://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/cloudflare-warp-1.png\" alt=\"cloudflare warp\" width=\"1215\" height=\"788\" /></p>\n<p>The preferences list some useful options. You can change the DNS protocol from WARP to either DNS-over-HTTPS or DNS-over-TLS, and enable 1.1.1.1 for Families functionality there if you want that.</p>\n<p>The few remaining options allow you to add networks that you want WARP to be disabled on automatically and to reset the encryption keys.</p>\n<p>The service worked fine during tests, but since it is labeled beta, it should only be run in test environments.</p>\n<h3>Closing Words</h3>\n<p>The beta Warp client for desktop systems enables you to connect to the WARP network and use the 1.1.1.1 DNS service. It is easy to use but lacks plenty of options and features, e.g. kill-switch functionality, that dedicated VPN clients from established companies offer. It is a beta version on the other hand and there is a possibility that some options and features will be introduced before it hits stable.</p>\n<p><strong>Now You:</strong> Do you use VPN or DNS services?</p>\n<p>Thank you for being a Ghacks reader.

Pressing the volume -, volume - and the mute button did not make a difference.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-164374\" src=\"https://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Volume-keys-not-working-on-keyboard-in-Windows-10.jpg\" alt=\"Volume keys not working on keyboard in Windows 10\" width=\"781\" height=\"692\" /></p>\n<p>But I was able to fix it after some basic troubleshooting.</p>\n<p>There are a few things that you can do to rule out a hardware/software issue.</p>\n<h4>Diagnosing the problem</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Check whether the speaker/sound card that is connected to the computer works.</li>\n<li>Try plugging in some headphones or a different speaker if possible.</li>\n<li>Does the volume slider on the system tray change the sound level?</li>\n<li>If your speaker has a volume wheel or keys, ensure that it is not turned down all the way.</li>\n<li>Is mute enabled?</li>\n<li>Do all the other keys on the keyboard work?</li>\n<li>In case of laptops, check if the built-in keyboard works and also verify if the volume keys on it are working. You may have to use Fn + another key (for e.g. Fn + F11 or F12) for controlling the volume.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you have done all that and are still facing the problem, proceed to the next section.</p>\n<h4>Troubleshooting the issue</h4>\n<p>This may sound silly, but have you tried rebooting the computer? This simple step fixes a lot of computer related problems.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Next, unplug and replug the keyboard.</li>\n<li>Try connecting it to a different USB port.</li>\n<li>Check device manager for potential issues, if there is an exclamation mark that could indicate a problem.</li>\n<li>Uninstall the keyboard driver (HID), and reboot the computer.</li>\n<li>As a last resort, connect a different keyboard to the computer. If the volume keys work on the 2nd keyboard, then the other one could be faulty.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>My HP 100 Wired USB Keyboard is fairly new. We got it a few weeks ago, and it had been working fine. All other keys on it worked perfectly, except for the three multimedia keys. The laptop's volume keys had no problems, the speakers and headphones were all fine. After doing all the above mentioned steps, I was nearly convinced that the problem could be hardware related, and that I should get the keyboard replaced under warranty.</p>\n<p>There was one more step I could try, Googling for the issue. In this case I had to look up the keyboard model number + the issue I was facing. It's possible that the problem is a known issue, and a fix could be readily available. That is precisely how I found the solution on <a href=\"https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Desktop-Audio/Sound-keys-not-working-on-HP-keyboard/td-p/7209918\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">HP's forums</a>.</p>\n<h4>How to fix volume keys not working on USB Keyboard in Windows 10</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Open the Windows Task Manager and switch to the services tab.</li>\n<li>Check whether the service named \"hidserv\" is running. This was \"stopped\" on my computer. If it is not running on your system, right-click on it and select start. (refer to the 1st image).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-164375\" src=\"https://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/How-to-fix-volume-keys-not-working-on-USB-Keyboard-in-Windows-10.jpg\" alt=\"How to fix volume keys not working on USB Keyboard in Windows 10\" width=\"781\" height=\"692\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Now try the volume keys. Hopefully, it should work as it did for me and you will see the OSD (on-screen display) that indicates a change in the volume level. You don't even have to reboot the computer for the fix to be applied.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is optional, but to avoid manually doing this every time, click on the \"Open Services\" button in the Task Manager window. Or press Win+ R and type \"services.msc\" and hit enter. The service has a slightly different name than the one in the Task Manager, it is called \"Human Interface Device service\". Right-click on it and select properties. Select the Startup type and choose \"Automatic\" from the drop-down menu.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-164376\" src=\"https://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/How-to-fix-volume-keys-not-working-on-keyboard.jpg\" alt=\"How to fix volume keys not working on keyboard\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1040\" srcset=\"https://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/How-to-fix-volume-keys-not-working-on-keyboard.jpg 1920w, https://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/How-to-fix-volume-keys-not-working-on-keyboard-1536x832.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /></p>\n<p>That's it.

But, which one should you use? There are dozens of programs that you could use for the task. To name just a few that we reviewed here on the site: <a href=\"https://www.ghacks.net/2015/01/13/batch-photo-editor-sphoto-puts-you-in-full-control/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">sPhoto</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ghacks.net/2020/06/21/imagesmixer-is-a-freeware-batch-image-converter-renamer-watermark-tool/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">ImagesMixer</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ghacks.net/2020/05/16/batch-resize-rotate-or-convert-images-using-xnresize/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">XnResize</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.ghacks.net/2019/10/01/flexxi-is-an-open-source-batch-image-resizer-for-windows/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Flexxi</a>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-164057\" src=\"https://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Free-Batch-Photo-Resizer-is-a-user-friendly-tool-for-quickly-resizing-multiple-images.jpg\" alt=\"Free Batch Photo Resizer is a user-friendly tool for quickly resizing multiple images\" width=\"677\" height=\"472\" /></p>\n<p>If user-friendliness is an important factor for you, Free Batch Photo Resizer may be something that you want to check out when it comes to batch processing images.</p>\n<p>The program's interface has a large pane on the left where the images that you add for processing will be displayed. Use the first button on the sidebar to the right edge of the window to add the files. The Add Folder button is handy for including a directory that contains several images. Oddly, unlike most batch tools this one does not support drag-and-drop for adding multiple files.  The application supports the following image formats: BMP, JPEG and PNG.</p>\n<p>There is no option to preview the images that you have added in Free Batch Photo Resizer. The only way to check if you have got it correct, is by reading the names from the list pane.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-164056\" src=\"https://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Free-Batch-Photo-Resizer-add-files.jpg\" alt=\"Free Batch Photo Resizer add files\" width=\"677\" height=\"472\" /></p>\n<p>Added the wrong pictures? The Remove All button lets you clear the list of photos in a single click. Or, if you want to exclude a few pictures, select a photo and then click on \"Remove Selected\". This also works with multiple file selection using the Shift and Control keys.</p>\n<p>Before resizing the photos, you should specify the dimensions of the output pictures, aka the new size that they will be saved as. Enter the width and height (in pixels or percentage) to make your choice.</p>\n<p>Free Batch Photo Resizer can maintain the aspect ratio of the images, if you toggle the \"Keep original aspect ratio\" under the resize options. Once you've enabled it, three more settings become available.</p>\n<p>Choose the width or height (radio button) option, and the program disables the other option because it will automatically compute the value with respect to the one you have entered to ensure the aspect ratio isn't modified. Enter a custom value, for e.g. 1920 width or 1080 height. You can choose the bounds option to customize the height and the width based on your requirements like Full HD or 720p, and the program will use the closest possible resolution with the original aspect ratio.</p>\n<p>Select the output folder that the program should save the pictures in. There is no option to customize the renaming pattern in Free Batch Photo Resizer. The filename will be retained when the destination directory differs from the original folder. If you use the source folder as the output directory, the files will be renamed using Windows' new file rules.</p>\n<p>When you have configured the resizing options, click on the Resize button on the sidebar. A new window opens to indicate the progress of the task, and lists each file that has been resized. Click on the done button when the window says \"Task completed\". Exit the program and open the output folder that you chose, and the resized photos will be ready.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-164055\" src=\"https://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Free-Batch-Photo-Resizer-task-completed.jpg\" alt=\"Free Batch Photo Resizer task completed\" width=\"677\" height=\"472\" /></p>\n<p>Free Batch Photo Resizer is not a portable program. It is made by Sunlit Green Software, the developer of the <a href=\"https://www.ghacks.net/2010/03/12/photo-resizer-batchblitz/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">BatchBlitz</a>.</p>\n<p>Free Batch Photo Resizer is a simple application, but in many ways it is too simple. It lacks essential options such as setting the output format (for e.g. convert PNG to JPG), output quality (for JPEGs). But it can suffice for basic editing purposes and help reduce the file size of images, making them ready for sharing online.</p>\n<p>Thank you for being a Ghacks reader.

Run the program's executable and an icon appears on the system tray. Ignore it for now. Instead, mouse over the taskbar. Move the scroll wheel up or down, and a volume bar pops-up at the cursor location. It indicates the current audio level in percentage.</p>\n<p>Since this is a taskbar program, naturally it will not work in full-screen mode (for e.g. games, video players, etc). The length of TbVolScroll's bar varies depending on the current volume level. If you have the sound maxed out at 100%, the bar will be long. The length reduces as you lower the volume. The color of the bar will change as the volume reaches certain thresholds.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-164369\" src=\"https://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/TbVolScroll-color-changed.jpg\" alt=\"TbVolScroll color changed\" width=\"514\" height=\"254\" /></p>\n<p>The application modifies the system volume by 5% per scroll. For e.g. If the sound is at 50% and you scroll up once, it will be set to 55%. If you want better control over this, hold the alt key while adjusting the sound. This makes TbVolScroll shift the volume by 1% instead.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-164368\" src=\"https://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/TbVolScroll-system-tray-context-menu.jpg\" alt=\"TbVolScroll system tray context menu\" width=\"544\" height=\"294\" /></p>\n<p>Right-click on the TbVolScroll tray icon to access the program's options. Use the Reset Volume option to mute the audio (sets it to 0). The Restart sub-menu has two options, restart will close and reopen the program while the 2nd option restarts it with administrator privileges. The application does not require administrator privileges to run, but using the option may help fix any issues that can prevent it from working. I didn't face a problem with using it normally.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-164367\" src=\"https://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/TbVolScroll-set-volume-step.jpg\" alt=\"TbVolScroll set volume step\" width=\"236\" height=\"103\" /></p>\n<p>The \"Set volume scroll step\" option allows you to edit the scroll behavior of TbVolScroll. As I mentioned earlier, it is set to 5% by default, but you can set it to something higher or lower. Customize the toolbar's visuals with the \"Set volume bar appearance\" option. This opens a new window where you can configure the width and height of the bar. In addition to this, you may choose a different color for the bar from the color palette. Prefer a transparent volume bar? Drag the slider at the bottom of the window to modify the volume bar's opacity. Don't forget to hit the save button after you have edited the settings.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-164366\" src=\"https://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/TbVolScroll-set-volume-bar-appearance.jpg\" alt=\"TbVolScroll set volume bar appearance\" width=\"336\" height=\"338\" /></p>\n<p>TbVolScroll will automatically switch to the precise volume control (reduces volume by 1% per scroll), when the volume level is lower than 10%. If you would rather have it all the time, use the \"Set precise scroll threshold\" to 100 and you don't have to use the Alt key while adjusting the volume step, or pick a custom level.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-164365\" src=\"https://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/TbVolScroll-set-precise-threshold.jpg\" alt=\"TbVolScroll set precise threshold\" width=\"261\" height=\"103\" /></p>\n<p>Exit the program from the tray menu when you don't need it.</p>\n<p>I almost gave up on the program because it wasn't responding. But then I noticed that the project's page mentioned that the application does not recognize the scrolling behavior when the Windows Task Manager is in focus. I had the window opened (in the background), and though it was not in focus it was causing the issue. TbVolScroll began to work normally when I closed the Task Manager.</p>\n<p>TbVolScroll is an open source program. Until Microsoft decides to implement the system tray to be accessed from all monitors, I don't think we aren't going to find a better on-screen option to control the volume.</p>\n<p>Thank you for being a Ghacks reader.

The collected data resembles the data that third-parties may collect through various tracking mechanisms on the Internet.</p>\n<p>About 52,000 Firefox users agreed to participate in the study which ran over the course of two weeks. Users would share the browsing history in the first week and in the second, and Mozilla would analyze the data to find out if the first week data could be used to identify users based on the second week data.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-164354\" src=\"https://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mozilla-study-browsing-history-privacy.png\" alt=\"mozilla study browsing history privacy\" width=\"1237\" height=\"644\" /></p>\n<p>The researchers managed to identify nearly 49,000 \"distinct browsing profiles\" and discovered that 99% were unique.</p>\n<p>50% of users could be identified using the top 10,000 websites if the users visited at least 50 distinct websites in the period. If users visited 150 or more sites, the probability of identification increased to 80% using the top 10,000 websites as the data pool.</p>\n<p>The data confirms a study from 2012 which used a different way of gathering the data. Back then, researchers set up a test site and used CSS code to identify sites from a 6000 domains list to find out which of these sites users had visited. The 2012 study concluded that 97% of visitors had a unique list of sites based on the 6000 domains list, and that the data alone could be used to track users across the web.</p>\n<p>Mozilla's data was more accurate because it received the entire browsing history of users who participate in the studies.</p>\n<p>The study confirms that third-parties may use the browsing history to create user profiles and track users across the Internet provided that they manage to gain access to a large portion of a user's browsing history. Facebook and Alphabet, Google's parent company, observe large portions of the web based on the analysis of third-party scripts in the browsing data. Alphabet access (Google) was found on 9823 of the top 10,000 websites, Facebook access on 7348 sites. \"Numerous companies\" with access in the 2000-5000 range of the top 10,000 sites were also detected.</p>\n<p>The researchers recommend that users enable privacy protections in their browser of choice to reduce the tracking capabilities of these companies.  Disabling or limiting third-party cookies, using Containers ( a unique Firefox feature), modifying default privacy settings, deleting data regularly, and installing privacy extensions may limit a company's ability to identify a user based on the browsing profile but these methods may not eliminate the thread entirely.</p>\n<p><strong>Now You</strong>: Do you protect your privacy online?</p>\n<p>Thank you for being a Ghacks reader.

According to the announcement, the company plans to bring a first development preview of DirectX Storage \"into the hands of game developers\" in the next year. It is likely that the technology will be integrated into Windows 10 Insider builds first before it becomes available to the general Windows population.</p>\n<p>Modern computer games have evolved a lot over the past decade. The rise of faster computer hardware, processors and video cards, high resolution displays and new display technologies, have forced developers to find new ways to load the data quickly from storage devices. One of the methods divides textures and other data into smaller chunks to improve loading times at the expense of an increase in IO operations.</p>\n<p>Current storage APIs were not optimized for high numbers of IO requests according to Microsoft. Even modern PCs are not able to \"fully saturate the IO pipeline\", and Microsoft DirectStorage technology addresses the issue.</p>\n<p>The company notes that DirectStorage will improve the PC gaming experience in two primary ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve loading times of games.</li>\n<li>Allow games to be \"more detailed and expansive than ever\".</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Closing Words</h3>\n<p>Real-world usage will show how much of a performance boost DirectStorage provides once it lands in stable versions of Windows. The technology needs fast storage devices, specific NVMe devices according to Microsoft's announcement; this limits the reach of the new feature. Games will play just fine on PCs without the new technology according to Microsoft.</p>\n<p><strong>Now You:</strong> Do you play games on PCs?

If you don't want to use it, toggle it to off. Chrome continues to use the default DNS provider but without use of DNS-over-HTTPS even if supported by the provider.</li>\n<li>Chrome offers options to continue using the default service provider, or a manual provider.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The first option is the default and it can mean that DNS-over-HTTPS is not used even if the setting is enabled; this is the case if the DNS provider does not support the feature.</p>\n<p>Chrome lists five different Secure DNS providers that you may select by switching to \"choose another provider\". The five providers are Google (Public DNS), Cloudflare, Quad9, CleanBrowsing, and DNS.SB.

Many note taking programs tend to be convoluted or too complicated to use, especially when time is important.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-164261\" src=\"https://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NotesMan-is-a-simple-and-open-source-note-taking-program-that-supports-autosave.jpg\" alt=\"NotesMan is a simple and open source note taking program that supports autosave\" width=\"986\" height=\"693\" /></p>\n<p>Some applications allow you to attach notes to images, add hyperlinks, format the text, etc. The problem is, these options can prove to be a hindrance while you just want to get things done.</p>\n<p>If you prefer a deeper experience with more options, check out note taking applications such as <a href=\"https://www.ghacks.net/2020/07/23/qtext-is-a-note-taking-program-that-supports-tabs-txt-html-and-autosave/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">QText</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ghacks.net/2019/11/22/qownnotes-is-an-open-source-note-taking-tool-that-supports-markdown/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">QOwnNotes</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ghacks.net/2020/03/13/elephant-is-an-open-source-cross-platform-note-taking-application/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Elephant</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.ghacks.net/2019/06/24/joplin-open-source-note-taking-app/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Joplin</a> (the last two are cross-platform).</p>\n<p>After all, note taking doesn't always require advanced options. If you need a distraction free writing experience, NotesMan can be sufficient for the task. The program has a simple interface with a toolbar, search bar, and a menu bar. You can't start writing by clicking in the blank space of the GUI.</p>\n<p>Instead, you have to click on the \"Add\" button. This opens a new window which is the text editor available NotesMan. Assign a title to your note by clicking the text field at the top. Click in the blank area of this window and you can type your notes. NotesMan supports multi-level, so you can go back a few steps and correct your mistakes easily.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-164259\" src=\"https://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NotesMan-interface.jpg\" alt=\"NotesMan interface\" width=\"1041\" height=\"677\" /></p>\n<p>The search bar at the top can be used for finding a string in the current note. The right-click menu in the text editor is fairly standard, except it has a \"Clear\" option that deletes all content in the note with a single-click. Hit the save button in the bottom left corner to save your note. This is very important, I'll explain why in the next section.</p>\n<p>NotesMan saves the notes in separate files in nested folders per group. These files don't seem to have an extension, but when I tried to open them in Windows Notepad, I could read/edit the content. So it appears that NotesMan saves the data in plain text format.</p>\n<h4>No warning about unsaved content</h4>\n<p>NotesMan does not warn you when you close a note without saving. So, if you typed a lot of data and click on the X button accidentally, you are not going to like it. This is a huge deal breaker for a note taking application.</p>\n<h4>Autosave</h4>\n<p>There is a way around this. Head to the Settings &#62; Preferences and enable the option that says \"auto save notes on exit\". This is not a perfect solution, an option to warn the user about unsaved data is something every text editor should have.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-164258\" src=\"https://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NotesMan-settings.jpg\" alt=\"NotesMan settings\" width=\"371\" height=\"317\" /></p>\n<p>Let's go back to the main screen of the program. You should see your note's title appear below the toolbar. Right-click on a note to view or delete it. Groups are used to organize your notes in NotesMan. Think of them as folders. Manage groups from the toolbar on the main screen. Use the +Group and -Group buttons to create or delete a group. The main screen's context menu can be used to move notes from one group to another.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-164260\" src=\"https://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NotesMan-move-to-group.jpg\" alt=\"NotesMan move to group\" width=\"986\" height=\"693\" /></p>\n<p>NotesMan has very few settings that you can customize. Change the font size from the drop-down menu. The program can be told to remember its window position and size.</p>\n<p>The most useful option here is the one that lets the application minimize to tray when you exit it. Right-click on the tray icon to add a new note. The second option \"add from clipboard\" creates a new note with the contents of the clipboard pasted in it.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-164262\" src=\"https://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NotesMan-tray-menu.jpg\" alt=\"NotesMan tray menu\" width=\"231\" height=\"143\" /></p>\n<h3>Closing Words</h3>\n<p>NotesMan is a portable application. It is an open source tool written in Pascal. Aside from the lack of a warning about unsaved content, NotesMan is pretty good. The clutter-free GUI is nice, though it does come at the cost of the program being too simple.</p>\n<p>While you may find using Notepad or similar text editors sufficient, dedicated note taking programs have the advantage that you can manage all your notes in a single interface easily.</p>\n<p>Thank you for being a Ghacks reader.

One of the <a href=\"https://www.ghacks.net/2020/08/07/three-reasons-not-to-upgrade-to-the-new-firefox-for-android-browser-right-now/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">main issues</a> that some users experienced after the upgrade was that add-ons support was limited.</p>\n<p><strong>Tip</strong>: check out our <a href=\"https://www.ghacks.net/2020/07/29/firefox-79-for-android-tweaks-and-tips/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">tips for the new Firefox for Android</a>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-164420\" src=\"https://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/firefox-nightly-android-addons-support.png\" alt=\"firefox-nightly android addons support\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1644\" srcset=\"https://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/firefox-nightly-android-addons-support.png 1600w, https://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/firefox-nightly-android-addons-support-1495x1536.png 1495w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" /></p>\n<p>The new Firefox supported nine extensions, and not the thousands of extensions that were supported by the previous versions. While these were the most popular based on user installs, it meant that Firefox users noticed that all other extensions were disabled and could not be used anymore.</p>\n<p>Mozilla did promise to bring full add-ons support to Firefox, and it appears that a first step is being made soon in that regard.</p>\n<p>Neiman reveals that Firefox Nightly for Android will soon get full add-ons support. Full support means that users of the particular version may install any add-on that is available on the organization's official Mozilla AMO website. Not all extensions may work in Firefox for Android as some may rely on functionality only available in the desktop client.</p>\n<p>Firefox Nightly is the cutting edge development version of the Firefox browser both on desktop and mobile. The first step is designed specifically for add-on developers who may use the Nightly version to test their extensions for compatibility and functionality. According to Neiman, Mozilla expects to integrate support in September 2020.</p>\n<p>Mozilla unlocked two extensions in the current Nightly version that users may install from within the mobile browser directly. <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/video-background-play-fix/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\">Video Background Play Fix</a> and <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/google-search-fixer/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\">Google Search Fixer</a> are useful extensions. The first fixes background play functionality on Android on some sites that prevent background play, the second overrides the user-agent string that the browser presents to Google Search to get the same search experience on Google Search that Chrome users get.</p>\n<p>Neiman does not mention when (if) full add-ons support will reach the stable version of Firefox for Android. She states that Mozilla's \"plans for add-ons support on release have not been solidified beyond\" what has been mentioned in the post. In other words: Nightly will get full add-ons support, stable will get some recommended extensions added.

The most recent version, currently available as an experimental release <a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/releases\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\">directly</a> from the GitHub repository, introduces global shortcuts to toggle the microphone and/or video camera of the device on or off.</p>\n<p>Microsoft notes that the feature was not really intended to be integrated into the tools collection at this time. The global pandemic and the shift to working from home convinced the developers that integrating video conferencing mute options would be a useful addition to PowerToys.</p>\n<p>The main idea behind the feature is to allow anyone with PowerToys installed to mute the microphone, disable the video camera feed, or both, with keyboard shortcuts.</p>\n<p>Installation of the new PowerToys is straightforward but requires that a virtual driver for the webcam is installed to gain control over the video stream on the device. The audio toggle uses the global microphone mute API.</p>\n<p>Both toggles disable and enable the functionality. For video, it was necessary to route the feed through the driver which, when mute is enabled, pushes a black stream to the application instead of the actual video feed. The workaround is necessary to ensure that the real feed can be pushed again without any issues.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-164441\" src=\"https://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/powertoys-videoconference-mute-microphone-camera.png\" alt=\"powertoys videoconference mute microphone camera\" width=\"1630\" height=\"1089\" srcset=\"https://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/powertoys-videoconference-mute-microphone-camera.png 1630w, https://www.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/powertoys-videoconference-mute-microphone-camera-1536x1026.png 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1630px) 100vw, 1630px\" /></p>\n<p>The following default shortcuts are available after installation of PowerToys 0.22 (or later):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mute microphone and camera: Windows-N</li>\n<li>Mute microphone: Windows-Shift-N</li>\n<li>Mute camera: Windows-Shift-O</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can change these shortcuts in the Video Conference settings of the application. There you also find an option to change the camera and define where on the screen the small toolbar of the Video Conference tool is displayed when shortcuts are activated.</p>\n<p>An option to specify a camera overlay image is present already but it seems inactive in the release.</p>\n<p>The release has been marked as experimental because of outstanding issues that Microsoft lists <a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/issues/6246\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\">here</a>. One of the main issues that needs to be fixed is that the virtual driver that is used fails to work properly with certain camera or microphone setups.</p>\n<p>It is therefore not recommended to install the new version in productive environments, but only on test systems; consider this a beta release.</p>\n<h3>Closing Words</h3>\n<p>The introduction of global microphone and video camera mute toggles to disable the devices and their feed with just a shortcut is helpful for a lot of users. While some video conferencing tools may support such functionality, there are others out there that don't.</p>\n<p>Muting is useful in a number of situations, e.g. when receiving a call, when someone enters the room, or when you need to leave the room for a short period.</p>\n<p><strong>Now You</strong>: do you use video conferencing tools?</p>\n<p>Thank you for being a Ghacks reader.
