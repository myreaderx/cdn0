In the time since Microsoft has been building out the feature set while also testing the game streaming service, and at the same time their Game Pass subscription service has been growing in both popularity and quality. Just this week they finally <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2020/08/04/project-xcloud-release-date-launch-country-list-games-android-xbox-game-pass-ultimate/\">announced</a> a September 15th launch date for xCloud as well as a number of new controller peripherals that are designed for using the service with your mobile device. One of the big negatives surrounding these announcements was that on launch xCloud would only be supported on Android devices, with iOS device support still up in the air. Well according to statements Microsoft <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21356274/microsoft-xcloud-ios-apple-iphone-ipad-testing-ends-apple-app-store-policies\">has made to The Verge</a>, it looks like they’re giving up on iOS altogether in the face of Apple’s strict App Store restrictions and instead will focus on providing their service to Android users only.</p> \n<p> </p>\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div> \n<div class=\"video-responsive\"> \n <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2KCtXJUekyo\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</div> \n<p></p> \n<p>It’s no secret that Apple has some very strict, and sometimes nonsensical, guidelines for what is approved on their App Store. Back in February Microsoft was able to begin an iOS beta test of xCloud using Apple’s Testflight program but were only able to get that beta approved by offering just one game through xCloud, the <em>Master Chief Collection</em> of <em>Halo</em> games. Apple is strict about not letting other gaming storefronts exist in the App Store, and you probably remember the year-plus of hoops Valve had to jump through in order to get their Steam Link app approved. Ultimately it gained that approval by totally stripping access to the Steam Storefront from within the app, and allowing users to simply play the games already in their Steam library through Steam Link. I don’t know if some sort of compromise like this will be possible to get xCloud approved on the App Store down the road, but it appears Microsoft is giving up the battle for the moment to focus on next month’s xCloud rollout. The iOS and Android beta tests of xCloud were originally set to run through September 11th, and while that remains true for Android Microsoft has gone ahead and shut down the iOS Testflight early.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270576\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270500\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/08330B0F-1884-4A74-B93E-8E0D1D5FFBD9.jpeg 1920w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/08330B0F-1884-4A74-B93E-8E0D1D5FFBD9-300x169.jpeg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/08330B0F-1884-4A74-B93E-8E0D1D5FFBD9-768x432.jpeg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/08330B0F-1884-4A74-B93E-8E0D1D5FFBD9-1024x576.jpeg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>As someone who loves his Xbox and is a big believer in things like Game Pass being the future for gaming, this is incredibly disappointing news. I’ve accepted Apple’s strict and often strange restrictions in a number of situations over the years, whether I agreed with them or not, but this decision is really hitting too close to home. Game Pass is going to be a service I subscribe to for a long time, and being able to play all those Game Pass games via xCloud on my iPhone was a huge selling point to me. It’s even harder to swallow in light of the very enticing partnership Microsoft has <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21354079/microsoft-samsung-xbox-game-pass-partnership-android-galaxy-note-20\">announced</a> with Samsung during Samsung’s Unpacked event today which sees the new Galaxy Note 20 devices get a special version of the Game Pass app and a bunch of cool additional features. I can only imagine how excited iPhone-owning gamers would be to see Microsoft announce something similar with Apple, but… welp. Microsoft says that “It’s our ambition to scale cloud gaming through Xbox Game Pass available on all devices\" so perhaps they’ll try again once the commotion of launching the service has died down, and perhaps if iOS users are vocal enough about it to Apple, but I’m not holding my breath. There’s no possible way I could have imagined myself saying this a decade ago, but, maybe it’s time to switch to Android.</p> \n<p>[via <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21356274/microsoft-xcloud-ios-apple-iphone-ipad-testing-ends-apple-app-store-policies\">The Verge</a>]</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 06 Aug 2020 01:52:26 +0000","feedId":84,"bgimg":"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/08330B0F-1884-4A74-B93E-8E0D1D5FFBD9.jpeg","linkMd5":"960e222cd2455aa6d34f1c3cf9367662","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn58@2020_2/2020-08-06/1596686071417_921ede12da674817.webp","author":"Jared Nelson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270576":null}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-06 11:53:34","updatedTime":"2020-08-06 11:53:34","title":"‘Levelhead’ Receives New MEGA Update Called “The Void” with TONS of New Content","link":"https://toucharcade.com/?p=270543","description":"<p>Following two years of hard work including over a year of extremely fruitful early access availability, those rascals at Butterscotch Shenanigans finally launched their creation-focused platformer <em>Levelhead</em> back on April 30th. Not just on iOS and Android, but also on Xbox One and the Epic Games Store and Steam on PC. Launching simultaneously on multiple platforms is never easy, but Bscotch has been holding it down well in the three-ish months since then, and now today they’ve gone and launched the first big <em>Levelhead</em> update since the game came out. Not just a big update, but a MEGA update according to the developers, which they’ve dubbed The Void. So what’s in this MEGA The Void update? Son, I can’t even begin to go there, as there’s so darn much new stuff crammed in here. Your best bet is to <a href=\"https://www.bscotch.net/post/levelhead-patch-118-the-void\">read all about it over on the game’s website</a> where you’ll find full on humorous explanations of all the big new stuff as well as meticulously detailed patch notes.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270543\" alt=\"\" width=\"1383\" height=\"1002\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270545\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/iM55NxP.png 1383w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/iM55NxP-300x217.png 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/iM55NxP-768x556.png 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/iM55NxP-1024x742.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>If you haven’t tried Levelhead yet, why the heck not? The game features a full-blown single-player campaign that by itself would be regarded as a “meaty\" platforming experience, but in addition to that you get a full blown creator suite of tools to craft whatever the heck your imagination can come up with. Much like games like <em>Minecraft</em>, the community has learned how to do some pretty awesome and unintended things with the creator tools in <em>Levelhead</em>. And if creating ain’t your thing? Just consume levels created by others! For free! And don’t contribute anything back! It’s basically like all societal structures have fallen in the world of <em>Levelhead</em>. We chose the mobile version as our <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2020/05/01/toucharcade-game-of-the-week-levelhead/\">Game of the Week</a> when it launched, but due to Bscotch’s excellent backend system, your progress syncs seamlessly across all platforms <em>Levelhead</em> is on. So if you skipped out on it before, let today’s MEGA The Void update be your reason to rectify that.</p> \n<p></p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 05 Aug 2020 22:01:22 +0000","feedId":84,"bgimg":"https://cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/iM55NxP.png","linkMd5":"48eb691c8d0ea56dc63791e4cf1e455e","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn70@2020_5/2020-08-06/1596686071158_6081c94677f1b42a.webp","author":"Jared Nelson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270543":null}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-06 11:53:34","updatedTime":"2020-08-06 11:53:34","title":"‘Forever Lost’ Developers Glitch Games Tease New Adventure ‘Another Tomorrow’","link":"https://toucharcade.com/?p=270557","description":"<p>Developer Glitch Games made a name for themselves in the early part of the last decade with their episodic adventure series <em>Forever Lost</em>, which launched its initial episode in 2012 and its final episode in 2015.

Well, it shouldn’t be a surprise that they’ve got another aventure game in the works, and this past week they began teasing this new title which is called <em>Another Tomorrow</em>.

Ultimate’ Update, ‘Steam Tactics’ and Today’s Other New Releases and Sales","link":"https://toucharcade.com/?p=270524","description":"<p>Hello gentle readers, and welcome to the SwitchArcade Round-Up for August 5th, 2020. In today’s article, we’ve got a couple of news items related to <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em> to go over before we get into the summaries of today’s new releases. There are four new games on the eShop today, serving as a nice appetizer for the usual jam-packed Thursday and Friday drops. The list of new sales today isn’t big, but it’s got a lot of goodies in it thanks to Bethesda running a sale in connection with QuakeCon. Let’s get to it!</p> \n<h3><strong>News</strong></h3> \n<p><strong>‘Super Smash Bros. Ultimate’ Updates with New Stage and More</strong></p> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270525\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270524\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/supersmashbrossmallbattlefield.jpg 1920w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/supersmashbrossmallbattlefield-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/supersmashbrossmallbattlefield-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/supersmashbrossmallbattlefield-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>A new version of <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em> dropped today, making a number of adjustments to the game but most notably adding a new smaller version of the Battlefield stage. Perfect for up close and personal fights between two players, it seems. You can set Small Battlefield as a Preferred Rule for online battles if that’s the juice you’re craving. All of the Battlefield stages have seen their music selection expanded, so you can now listen to any of the tunes from the game while battling on them. There were also some under-the-hood improvements to the online mode in this update, including changing the threshold for Elite Smash eligibility to allow more players in.</p> \n<p><strong>Fake It ‘Til You Make It in This Week’s ‘Super Smash Bros.’ Event</strong></p> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270526\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270524\" alt=\"\" width=\"810\" height=\"455\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/smasheventfakeout.jpeg 810w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/smasheventfakeout-300x169.jpeg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/smasheventfakeout-768x431.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>Along with the surprise update came the usual announcement of the weekend <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em> event. Titled <em>Smash Ball Fake Out</em>, the event is a tournament that will run for the usual three-day period from Friday to Monday. There are no restrictions on characters this time around, so choose your best and see how far you can get. The better you do, the better spirits you’ll earn. So what’s the catch? Items are on, but consist only of Smash Balls and Fake Smash Balls. Can you tell the difference at a glance? Good luck!</p> \n<h3><strong>New Releases</strong></h3> \n<h3><strong>Mystery Mine ($9.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270527\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270524\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mysterymine.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mysterymine-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mysterymine-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mysterymine-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>Hmm, I always caution against taking the eShop genre listings too seriously, and this game is a nice example of why. According to the eShop, this is action, adventure, platformer, and role-playing. In reality, it’s a platformer with some light adventure elements. You have to find your way to the underworld, battling monsters and bosses along the way. You’ll find new items and some puzzles to solve, breaking up the standard action a little. It’s not very good if you ask me, but one person’s trash is another person’s treasure. Statistically speaking, <em>someone</em> will love this. Will that be <em>you</em>? Probably not!</p> \n<h3><strong>Steam Tactics ($9.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270528\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270524\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/steamtactics.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/steamtactics-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/steamtactics-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/steamtactics-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>This game has a lot of things going on with it. It’s a world where anthropomorphic animals pilot aircraft on behalf of the kingdom in order to keep the peace. You play as a doggo mercenary who has been hired by the queen to help keep the realm safe while the king is ill. Combat is turn-based and there are plenty of upgrades, customization options, new ships, and battles to keep you busy for a while. It’s a bit on the lighter side as this genre goes, so it’s a nice choice for those new to the genre who want to get their sea legs. Not the most thrilling of rides for veterans, however. But you know, how many games can you play that have a frog pilot with a petite handlebar mustache?</p> \n<h3><strong>Wizards: Wand of Epicosity ($19.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270529\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270524\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/wizardswandofepicosity.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/wizardswandofepicosity-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/wizardswandofepicosity-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/wizardswandofepicosity-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>This is a humorous tower defense game starring YouTuber Tobuscus. When he accidentally kills the hero that was supposed to save the world, Tobuscus has to take his place. He’s not much of a wizard, but he’ll give it his best. This is apparently a port of a mobile game that released several years back under the title<em> Tobuscus Adventures: Wizards</em>. It costs four times more here than it did there, but that’s how it goes. It was delisted a long time ago on the App Store so it’s not like you could get it there even if you wanted to. At any rate, this doesn’t look particularly special beyond the YouTuber connection, so I suppose it depends on how much you want another tower defense game.</p> \n<h3><strong>Spitlings ($14.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270530\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270524\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/spitlings.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/spitlings-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/spitlings-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/spitlings-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>A multiplayer game about horking your nasty spit-gobs all over the place may not be the most 2020-appropriate experience, but worry not: <em>Spitlings</em> has support for both local <em>and</em> online multiplayer, ensuring you can have wild fun with your friends without covering them with your fatal spittle. Uh, anyway. Up to four people can join in on the fun here, and the idea is that you control a weird little creature than can attack and jump by spitting. You have to use those abilities to clear out hundreds of stages filled with goo and glop. Seems like it might be good for a laugh if you’ve got the right mix of people to play with.</p> \n<h3><strong>Sales</strong></h3> \n<p><em><strong>(North American eShop, US Prices)</strong></em></p> \n<p>As I said up in the intro paragraph, the list of incoming discounts today isn’t all that big. There are two things worthy of note here. First, Bethesda’s QuakeCon sale sees pretty much its entire line-up on sale for some great prices. You really can’t go wrong with any of them. Well, maybe <em>Youngblood</em>. The second thing worth looking at is the DLC/upgrade for<em> Mortal Kombat 11</em>. For thirty bucks you can get all of the add-ons for your <em>Mortal Kombat 11</em>, or if you don’t own it you can buy the base game and the DLC for a combined fifty bucks. That’s not bad at all! And hey, don’t forget to check the outbox on your way out. Some fun indies in there, along with the <em>Dragon Ball</em> games.</p> \n<p><strong>Select New Games on Sale</strong></p> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-224495\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270524\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Skyrim.jpg 1920w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Skyrim-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Skyrim-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Skyrim-620x349.jpg 620w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Skyrim-624x351.jpg 624w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p><em><strong>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</strong> </em>($29.99 from $59.99 until 8/11)<br> <em><strong>DOOM</strong> </em>($29.99 from $59.99 until 8/11)<br> <em><strong>DOOM 1993</strong></em> ($2.49 from $4.99 until 8/11)<br> <em><strong>DOOM II Classic</strong></em> ($2.49 from $4.99 until 8/11)<br> <em><strong>DOOM 3</strong></em> ($4.99 from $9.99 until 8/11)<br> <em><strong>DOOM 64</strong> </em>($2.49 from $4.99 until 8/11)<br> <em><strong>Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus</strong></em> ($29.99 from $59.99 until 8/11)<br> <em><strong>Wolfenstein: Youngblood Deluxe</strong></em> ($19.99 from $39.99 until 8/11)<br> <em><strong>Space Ribbon</strong></em> ($0.49 from $4.99 until 8/24)<br> <em><strong>Santa Tracker</strong></em> ($0.29 from $2.99 until 8/24)<br> <em><strong>Box Align</strong></em> ($0.99 from $1.99 until 8/24)<br> <em><strong>Crazy Zen Mini Golf</strong></em> ($1.64 from $4.99 until 8/24)<br> <em><strong>Unlock the King</strong></em> ($0.49 from $0.99 until 8/24)<br> <em><strong>Anti-Gravity: Tiny’s Adventure</strong></em> ($0.49 from $0.99 until 8/24)<br> <em><strong>Pinball Lockdown</strong> </em>($1.97 from $5.99 until 8/24)</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-269059\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270524\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/hexon.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/hexon-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/hexon-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/hexon-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"><br> <em><strong>HexON</strong> </em>($0.49 from $0.99 until 8/24)<br> <em><strong>Lumini</strong> </em>($4.99 from $9.99 until 8/17)<br> <em><strong>Back to Bed</strong></em> ($1.99 from $4.99 until 8/17)<br> <em><strong>Mortal Kombat 11</strong> </em>($19.99 from $49.99 until 8/17)<br> <em><strong>MK11 Aftermath + Kombat Pack Bundle</strong></em> ($29.99 from $49.99 until 8/17)<br> <em><strong>Let’s Go Nuts</strong></em> ($1.49 from $9.99 until 8/23)</p> \n<p><strong>Sales Ending Tomorrow, Thursday, August 6th</strong></p> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-248395\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270524\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/99moves-1.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/99moves-1-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/99moves-1-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/99moves-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p><em><strong>99Moves</strong> </em>($0.98 from $2.99 until 8/6)<br> <em><strong>99Seconds</strong> </em>($0.98 from $2.99 until 8/6)<br> <em><strong>Abyss</strong> </em>($0.98 from $2.99 until 8/6)<br> <em><strong>Animal Hunter Z</strong></em> ($4.99 from $9.99 until 8/6)<br> <em><strong>Battle &amp;

Since the reveal and eventual release in Japan, there was no news on an international release. A Western release has <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/IdolaEN/posts/122538082871372\">finally been confirmed</a> through Boltrend Games.

Back in the day the App Store would showcase the same games for a week, and then refresh those features each Thursday. Because of that developers got into the habit of releasing their games throughout Wednesday or very early Thursday in order to hopefully get one of those coveted features spots. Nowadays the App Store refreshes constantly, so the need for everyone to release all on the same day has diminished. Still, we’ve kept our weekly Wednesday night format as for years that’s the time people knew to check TouchArcade for the list of new games. And so without further ado please check out the full list of this week’s new games below, and let us know in the comments section which games you’ll be picking up!</p> \n<hr> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p><b><font size=\"+2\">Blocki! <a href=\"http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1208686212?mt=8\">(Free)</a></font></b></p> \n<p></p>\n<center>\n <img src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270549\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270567\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/626x0w-7.png 626w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/626x0w-7-225x300.png 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px\">\n</center>\n<p></p> \n<p><strong>iTunes Description</strong></p> \n<blockquote>\n <p>Blocki! is a unique game you haven’t seen before.

With iOS 14, lots of new features are coming to Apple Arcade and the App Store. If you have a device running iOS 14, the “See All Games\" tab reveals the next four releases for the service including some big surprises. What’s more interesting is that the release dates have also been indirectly revealed through the App Store for all four of the newly revealed games. <em>Samurai Jack: Battle Through Time</em> is coming to consoles and PC on August 21st and features the original voice actors in an action platform game. It arrives on Apple Arcade on the same day going by the iTunes release date. This is a game releasing for $39.99 on other platforms. Check it out on Apple Arcade here.
