But this one uses air to blow up into a full sized design! Everglow Light Tube by Klymit stands out from the rest for a design that’s both functional and highly useful in a number of situations. Klymit being an outdoor gear company very obviously has tailored this inflatable light for camping and adventure enthusiasts, but I can think of dozen other uses as well!</p>\n<p>The inflatable function, you can literally expand the light like a balloon, solves two inherent purposes – diffusing the light so that it doesn’t hurt the eyes and spread easily, and the other is of course the portability aspect. A pocketable design that is ideal for any adventure, or even at home for emergency  use. The flexibility of the form factor permits it to be used as a hanging LED light &#8211; stick it to your base camp ceiling to use as a lantern, or attach like a hanging light to the awning. Everglow Light Tube is powered by a USB input – so you can attach it to a power bank or any other USB outlet. There’s a light dimming function to easily go from low light for reading to a blazing light for cooking with a click!</p>\n<p>This portable light brings so much to the table – be it your camping adventures, off-road escapades, or the odd hiking trip up the mountains. It’s been designed in a way to add convenience and versatility to how we are accustomed to using portable lights. Simply stuff it in the corner of your backpack, and when the need arises, inflate it to a full-sized tube light to light up your dark nights under the starry skies.</p>\n<p>Designer: Klymit</p>\n<p><a

data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> presents an all-new dimension in health tracking and fitness monitoring. Its health and wellness functionalities are perhaps its unique selling proposition, and the readings are accurate when it&#8217;s placed on the wrist. However, fitness bands relocate the Apple Watch from its ideal wrist position, further up in the arm. It looks fancy and all that, but these often compromise the effectiveness of the watch. Coming up with a reworked design of the ActionSleeve, </span><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/apple/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Apple</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> accessory designer </span><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/twelve-south/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Twelve South</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> has released ActionSleeve 2. </span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The ActionSleeve 2&#8217;s unique design ensures the Apple Watch Series 4 (and later) always remains in constant contact with the body, so there is no discrepancy in tracking parameters on the Fitness app. Most of us would prefer wearing the Apple Watch in its default position and deem the band worthless. In fact, that would be the case until you want to put on a pair of boxing gloves! The ActionSleeve 2 armband is meticulously designed to give people more flexibility to keep using the Apple Watch when an activity or sporting gear may restrict wearing it on the wrist or lead to discomfort. &#8220;If you&#8217;ve ever changed your Apple Watch band, you already know how ActionSleeve 2 works: 1. remove your current Apple Watch band, 2. push the Apple Watch &#8220;body&#8221; into the back of ActionSleeve 2 and 3. strap ActionSleeve 2 on, tighten and go. Your screen, crown, and button remain fully accessible and functional.&#8221; Twelve South explains.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Made from rugged stitched polyurethane fabric and featuring a reliable Velcro enclosure, the Apple Watch armband snaps just like the typical wristband. Simply remove the usual Apple Watch band and slip the device into the ActionSleeve 2, which with its open-face layout, keeps the watch case projected and leaves the digital crown accessible for you to toggle between apps on the go. The Apple Watch armband is available through Twelve South and Amazon and can be picked up right away for $ $39.99!</span></p>\n<p>Designer: Twelve South</p>\n<p><a

not pay attention to our bathrooms very often, but the truth is they’re the little alcoves we spend a substantial amount of our time in, carrying out our personal activities. It’s probably the only time we’re ever truly alone, and bathrooms are like our own personal zones. Hence amping up our bathroom with essential accessories and handy product designs is quite important. These little products can make a huge difference in our everyday bathroom experience. They not only help us carry out our personal and grooming activities even more easily, but they also help us take care of ourselves a little better! From an electric flosser that flawlessly cleans your teeth in 30 seconds to a mold-proof and water-tight rolling shower screen &#8211; we&#8217;ve curated a whole collection of innovative and functional bathroom accessories for you!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/03/auto-draft/everloop_toothbrush_2.gif\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/03/auto-draft/everloop_toothbrush_3.jpg\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\"><a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/03/10/the-everloop-toothbrushs-creative-design-lets-you-replace-its-bamboo-bristles/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Everloop Toothbrush</a> from NOS uses a recycled plastic handle and disposable bamboo bristles. Taking on a unique cradle-to-cradle approach, the brush comes with a plastic handle that is, in fact, made from recycled toothbrushes. At the very end is a clamping mechanism that allows you to attach 100% natural bamboo bristles to the toothbrush’s head. The idea is to retain the plastic handle and periodically replace the bamboo bristles every few months. The bamboo bristles have absolutely no plastic in them, allowing them to easily be disposed of, or composted in a way that doesn’t harm the environment.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/05/retractable_rolling_shower_screen.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0022/8029/2454/files/3_025c5597-90c6-47f0-a8da-803e92343389.gif?v=1620649157\" width=\"1050&#34;/\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\"><a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2021/05/10/meet-the-worlds-most-compact-mold-proof-and-water-tight-rolling-shower-screen/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">JoyFous</a> takes the existing shower curtain and gives it a much-needed design upgrade. Made for 3-walled bathtubs (where the 4th wall is usually occupied by a curtain), JoyFous is a nifty, slim, retractable screen that’s easy to pull out and retract before and after your bath. It’s a much more convenient alternative to the shower curtain that’s clumsy and doesn’t stop water from leaking out onto the bathroom floor… and it’s a whole lot cheaper than those frosted glass partitions, and it isn’t breakable or fragile too! Working much like retractable blinds that you pull downward, JoyFous operates sideways, creating a neat privacy-partition while you bathe or just laze in your bath-salts solution with some candles and bubbly… and its unique water-dam feature keeps the water inside your bathtub, so you don’t step out onto a soaking wet and slippery bathroom floor.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/04/Flaus_eco_friendly_electric_flosser.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/04/hate-flossing-the-worlds-first-electric-flosser-makes-dental-hygiene-quick-and-easy/Flaus_eco_friendly_electric_flosser_01-1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Designed to be the world’s first eco-friendly electric flosser, <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2021/05/11/hate-flossing-this-innovative-electric-flosser-flawlessly-cleans-your-teeth-in-30-seconds/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Flaüs</a> is a hand-held toothbrush-shaped device with a replaceable flossing head. When powered on, Flaüs gently vibrates at 12,000 sonic vibrations per minute – it’s enough to safely remove all the food and plaque stuck between your teeth without hurting the most sensitive gums. Given that it’s about as easy to use as an electric toothbrush, Flaüs makes flossing your teeth quick, easy, and effective. Moreover, each replaceable floss-head is designed out of biodegradable materials and can even be composted after use… leaving your teeth and the planet as clean as they can be!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/01/kohlers-new-alexa-enabled-bath-fitting-showers-you-with-water-as-well-as-music/kohler_moxie_alexa_1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/01/kohlers-new-alexa-enabled-bath-fitting-showers-you-with-water-as-well-as-music/kohler_moxie_alexa_2.jpg\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\">Kohler seems to have taken a massive liking to bathroom singers with its new showerhead. With a halo-shaped design, <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/01/03/kohlers-new-alexa-enabled-bath-fitting-showers-you-with-water-as-well-as-music/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the Kohler Moxie Showerhead</a> allows you to fit a wireless speaker into its negative cavity, giving you a luxurious Kohler-worthy shower with handpicked (or rather voice-picked) tunes to accompany you as you bathe. Now the Moxie isn’t a new product. Kohler released the quirky showerhead+speaker combination in as early as 2012, but the new update (to be showcased at CES2020 next week) allows Moxie to communicate with Amazon’s Alexa voice AI, allowing you to ask it to play songs (or karaokes), brief you on the news, or order you some more shampoo. The Moxie speaker is detachable and docks right into the torus-shaped showerhead using magnetic action.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/04/Lucere_Hollywood_style_lighting_anywhere.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/04/tired-of-shaving-in-bad-bathroom-lighting-these-snap-on-mirror-lights-give-you-perfect-visibility/Lucere_Hollywood_style_lighting_anywhere_01.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/04/12/tired-of-shaving-in-bad-bathroom-lighting-these-snap-on-mirror-lights-give-you-perfect-visibility/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lucere</a> mimics that perfect vanity-lighting experience without racking up an electricity bill. It features a pair of portable lights that attach directly to your bathroom mirror to give you bright, bi-directional light without casting sharp shadows. The Lucere comes with a mount that adheres to your mirror, allowing you to magnetically snap the lights on or off whenever you need them. Both the lights come with touch-sensitive on-off switches and the ability to set them at your desired brightness using simple +/- controls. The lights charge via a standard MicroUSB cable and last for 3 hours on medium brightness.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/06/toothbrush/11-base_yankodesign.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/06/toothbrush/02-base_yankodesign.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/06/20/this-uv-light-sterilizer-gives-you-a-99-bacteria-free-toothbrush/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BASE</a> is a conceptual sterilizer that is aimed at providing the maximum level of oral hygiene and safety to you. Toothbrushes hold more than 10 million bacteria which is more than a toilet seat so it needs more than a plastic cap to stay clean and protected. UV rays at 253.7 nm wavelength are used as a bactericidal and within 5 seconds BASE kills 100% of the commonly found germs. In a complete 40 second cycle, it also kills 90% of spore-forming bacteria and it is recommended to sterilize the toothbrush for a full 2 minutes for the highest level of hygiene. The device encloses the toothbrush just enough to contain the UVC radiation to the area required (bristles, head, and neck of the toothbrush) while also allowing the right amount of convective airflow to help dry the toothbrush.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/04/toilet-brush/03-brushpro_yankodesign.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/04/toilet-brush/05-brushpro_yankodesign.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Designer Geraldine Tong wanted to change our perception of toilet cleaning tools while also solving related issues like its environmental impact and the clutter it creates in our bathrooms. Her goal was to create a brush that didn’t cause more landfill waste, took minimal space, reached the narrow areas, and of course, look visually appealing – so she designed <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/04/08/this-swiffer-inspired-bathroom-cleaning-brush-even-holds-your-detergent-bottle/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BrushPro</a> in collaboration with Lam Soon Singapore, and the mission was accomplished. This redesigned toilet brush lets you switch out brushes while reusing the main body which reduces a lot of toxic waste. BrushPro is extremely convenient to use compared to its forerunners. The extendable handle allows you to reach narrow spaces without having to perform advanced yoga poses on the floor and minimizes your direct contact with the dirty brush.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2019/12/the-stuul-is-a-toilet-stool-that-makes-your-morning-business-easy-breezy/stuul8.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2019/12/the-stuul-is-a-toilet-stool-that-makes-your-morning-business-easy-breezy/stuul_reinvents_the_toilet_stool_01.jpg\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\">Designed as a two-part stool, <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2019/12/09/the-stuul-is-a-toilet-stool-that-makes-your-morning-business-easy-breezy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the stuul</a> occupies a fraction of its intended space when not in use, and transforms into two foot-stools when you’re on the John. Using stuul helps elevate your legs in a way that resembles the squatting posture that’s clinically proven to make the job easier. stuul’s design helps position the legs at the desired angle to help promote a healthy bathroom routine and prevent diseases like IBS. With a design-conscious approach, the stuul is styled less like a clinical product and more as something fitting of being in your well-decorated bathroom. The two tripod-stools fit together into each other, becoming a single form that’s easy to stash somewhere for later, while its faceted design gives it a decidedly premium feel.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2018/08/the-bathroom-scale-just-got-better/pebble_scale_layout.jpg\" alt=\"pebble_scale_layout\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2018/08/pebble/pebble_02.jpg\" alt=\"pebble_02\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\">Why shouldn’t your bathroom scale do more than just tell you your weight? <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2018/08/08/the-bathroom-scale-just-got-better/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The PEBBLE</a> was designed with this question in mind and provides an innovative solution that might just make you wonder why this doesn’t already exist! After showering, you can step on the scale and it will air-dry your feet and sanitize with infrared light. The upward-facing fans help you dry off faster and ensure you don’t carry excess moisture which can result in a number of unwanted health scenarios. Synced with the PEBBLE app on your smartphone, it will automatically upload and track your weight stats and give you daily, weekly, and monthly status updates to maintain a healthy BMI.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2018/09/up-your-bathroom-game-in-a-jiffy/chrome_bath_suite_layout.jpg\" alt=\"chrome_bath_suite_layout\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2018/09/chrome/chrome_07.jpg\" alt=\"chrome_07\" /></p>\n<p>Imagined for the OXO brand, <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2018/09/25/up-your-bathroom-game-in-a-jiffy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the Chrome Bath Suite</a> aims to elevate the average person’s washroom with an easy-to-use, seamlessly integrated collection of bath items. Consisting of a soap holder, wall mirror, shower shelf, and towel hook, the set has everything one needs to keep things tidy and organized. Better yet, none of the units require any tools to install. Instead, a thoughtfully designed suction cup mechanism grips onto vertical surfaces before the various elements are attached. An elegant chrome finish rounds out the look and brings each unit together in one cohesive collection.</p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a

Smartphones, as incredible as they are, just aren&#8217;t good for long-distance shots like the moon&#8230; which is why TikTok users have apparently taken to using Moon Lamps instead. A Moon Lamp is much easier to photograph since it&#8217;s closer to you, and with a little visual trickery, it can look exactly like the real deal! Besides, when you&#8217;re not photographing away at it, it serves as a neat ambient room light too!</p>\n<p>Dim the lights and switch the Gingko Smart Moon Lamp on and it quite literally looks like you&#8217;ve got a supermoon inside your home! Its gravity-defying levitating design completes the illusion, creating a pretty remarkable-looking prop that&#8217;s great for decor as well as photography! The floating moon comes 3D printed from translucent PLA, complete with craters and undulating surface details to make it look like the real thing, and it floats on its base too, gently rotating as a planetary object would. 140mm (5.5 inches) in diameter, the moon floats on a wooden base made of dark walnut or light ash wood, suspended in place by a strong rare-earth magnet. It comes with built-in LEDs that give the moon its signature glow, with 3 light temperatures to choose from &#8211; warm white (3500k) and white (5000k), and a special yellow warm (2700k) for that rare blood moon effect!</p>\n<p>Each Smart Moon Lamp comes with its base and a 12V- 1A AD adapter to power the entire experience. Plus, Gingko offers a cool 2-year warranty that should quite literally send you &#8216;over the moon!&#8217;</p>\n<p>Designer: Gingko Design</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gingkodesign.co.uk/product/smart-moon-lamp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Click Here to Buy Now: $175.5</strong></a> <del datetime=\"2021-05-28T08:00:45+00:00\">$195</del> (10% off with coupon code &#8220;GINGKO-YD&#8221;).

to rival, then Zaiser Motors has got you hard-pressed. The Colorado-based startup is working on an electric motorcycle that can churn 300 miles on a single full charge. They call it Electrocycle – a 2WD cruiser bike with a traditional retro charm. The spiky-ish fins on the rear evoke a sense of gangsta influence, along with the large rear fender. </span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The rear gives this electric cruiser a fat appeal. Only one question though, why the thin rear wheel? It looks absolutely out of place in terms of aesthetics, even though it might help with efficiency. That irk is ever so evident since all of the other bodywork carries a lot of mass.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">That said, the bike has a long wheelbase and a comfortable bench seat. On the inside, the ride is powered by two hub motors – translating power to both wheels. The result can go from 0-60 mph in around 3.6 seconds and achieve a top speed of 120 mph. Dual hub motors have a downside as well, they tend to overload the suspension system due to the unsprung weight. Zaiser aims to achieve the 300-mile range with a 17.5 kWh battery, which will be tough even if they shed weight. Yes, it is achievable in city driving, where regenerative braking is also going to assist. But on a long highway at high speeds and wind resistance in the play, you can achieve 200 miles at best with that battery capacity. For reference, the Zero SR/F has a realistic figure of 161 miles with its 14.4 kWh battery.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Zaiser says the bike will have removable batteries so that you can charge them easily if you live in a high-rise apartment. Bear in mind, though, batteries are quite heavy, and you need to be in top shape. So, best of luck with carrying the load now and then. The bike&#8217;s dashboard looks relatively modern, with all the telemetry and the navigation system right on point. For safety, the Electrocycle gets advanced LiDAR sensors and haptic feedback in the handlebars. According to Zaiser, the bike will have&#8221; other accident avoidance technologies, never before been present on one singular vehicle in this way.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The Electrocycle electric cruiser bike will debut in 2023, once the initial testing and production design are finalized. The estimated price of the cruiser is going to be somewhere between $20,000 – $25,000. The question is, would bike enthusiasts be able to ignore that slim rear wheel? I hope the production model has more giant wheels, and Zaiser reduces weight and increases the battery capacity to offset the effect!</span></p>\n<p>Designer: <a href=\"https://zaisermotors.com/\"

shark","link":"https://www.yankodesign.com/?p=318577","description":"<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/05/in-an-unusual-case-of-bio-mimicry-this-drone-is-inspired-by-the-shape-of-a-hammerhead-shark/hammerhead_drone_1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-318579\" /></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not entirely common for a water-borne animal to be a strong source of inspiration for an air-borne product. Sure, the penguin or the kingfisher have provided design cues that have helped understand fluid and aerodynamics, but Anton Weaver&#8217;s Hammerhead Drone takes inspiration from the popular shark almost as a visual tribute, as opposed to nature-inspired design mimicry. The Hammerhead Drone comes with a quad-propeller design and a frame that creates protective rings around each propeller. Its silhouette resembles that of the hammerhead shark rather well, with the propellers looking like the familiar offset eyes of the large carnivorous fish.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/05/in-an-unusual-case-of-bio-mimicry-this-drone-is-inspired-by-the-shape-of-a-hammerhead-shark/hammerhead_drone_2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-318580\" /></p>\n<p>For over a century, scientists have speculated why hammerheads evolved such an odd shape and whether having eyes so far apart would enhance their vision. It was speculated (and eventually even tested) that the sharks, which first made their appearance 450 million years ago, had much better binocular vision thanks to their massively offset eyes. It would help them zero down on the location of prey with much more accuracy than other sharks, and the highly offset nostrils helped them even identify the direction of enticing odors. That history lesson aside, the Hammerhead Drone recreates that same visual appearance of the shark with the way its body projects outwards to form protective rings around each propeller. This makes the drone much more resilient during flight, allowing it to easily recover after bumping into an object.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/05/in-an-unusual-case-of-bio-mimicry-this-drone-is-inspired-by-the-shape-of-a-hammerhead-shark/hammerhead_drone_3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-318581\" /></p>\n<p>Aside from providing a physical system to prevent hardware damage to the drone&#8217;s propellers, the Hammerhead Drone comes with a bunch of other fail-safes that help it avoid collisions. The drone comes equipped with multiple cameras and sensors on every side that help it autonomously avoid obstacles. Red LED strips on the front and back help illuminate the areas too, and allow you to easily spot the drone from a distance. For video recording, the drone comes equipped with a primary action-camera mounted on a 3-axis stabilizer &#8211; a common detail with most drones. The rear houses a removable battery pack that powers the entire unit, and the drone even comes with unique landing gears that help cushion impact as the drone makes a descent towards the ground. A handheld remote control lets you operate the Hammerhead from a distance, and you can view what the drone&#8217;s main camera sees using a companion viewfinder app or program on your smartphone.</p>\n<p>Designer: <a href=\"http://yankodesign.com/tag/anton-weaver\">Anton Weaver</a></p>\n<p><img

/></p>\n<p>Disposable razors are made of plastic and contribute heavily to waste and pollution. In fact, as per the report Award Catalogue 2020 of BEYOND PLASTIC, about 5,000 billion disposable <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/razor/\">razors</a> are used per year globally &#8211; can you imagine that many razors in front of you for a second? That is an island-worth of waste and we are constantly looking for designs that remake <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/sustainable-design/\">sustainable</a> versions of daily objects so that we are a step closer to solving this problem. Oquari is a biodegradable razor with comes with interchangeable heads that aim to provide a sustainable alternative that can help reduce the burden on the environment.</p>\n<p>The razor is made with PBS Bionelle as well as stainless steel blades as part of a regenerative approach and it degrades in aquatic environments. Its design is specifically geared at reducing manufacturing processes and facilitate the separation of its elements at the end of its life so that it becomes an accessible, attractive, and economical product without being recognized as &#8220;disposable&#8221; which the team refers to as  &#8216;monstrous hybrid&#8217; &#8211; a term coined by Michael Braungart and William McDonough for a product, component, or material that combines both technical and organic nutrients in a way that cannot be easily separated, thereby rendering it unable to be recycled or reused be either system. Most monstrous hybrids can only be thrown out and contribute to the waste stream and cannot be reused and therefore it is important to not view Oquari as a &#8216;disposable&#8217; razor but rather as a sustainable alternative to the disposable razors.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is why we wanted to focus on a product that most people use while creating a dramatic environmental impact on our planet. Disposable razors, this kind of product has specifically a combination of plastics and elastomers. Which is rarely restore or recycled because of how difficult and expensive is. As part of our brief, we establish sustainable objectives that follow 7 of the 11 Rs of the R-Ladder: refuse the combination of monstrous hybrids, redesign better detachable pieces, rethink the concept of a disposable razor, reduce the use of plastic, reuse the razor for a long time, remanufacture materials for its use in other industries and recycle the package when disposed,&#8221; says the team,</p>\n<p>Oquari creates a positive social-environmental impact because of the reusable handle that spreads awareness about the plastic waste problem. It encourages you to apply waste recollection strategies while generating more active learning and participation. Fairtrade is also ensured for users from socioeconomic sectors C and D because Oquari is made to be affordable. In addition, the constant consumption of blades ensures fixed income to the company. &#8220;Because our handle is reusable, raw material production and manufacturing costs are reduced. Likewise, waste decreases and benefits other industries by recycling discarded blades,&#8221; the trio elaborates. A sustainable lifestyle shouldn&#8217;t e a status symbol but rather an accessible choice so we can create a larger impact much faster.</p>\n<p>Designer: Karla Valencia, Guillermo Miranda, and Erik

However, as we grew older, camping began to hold a different meaning. It was an opportunity to simply get away, relax, and re-connect with nature! A chance to leave behind our urban woes, and enjoy the simplicity of the outdoors. Although, camping has now received a massive makeover and a new ferocious nickname – Glamping! Glamping is the new, improved and dazzling version of camping.  Luxurious tents, glamping cabins, glamping trailers, and innovative campsites are all a result of the Glamping movement. So, we’ve curated a collection of super comfy, cozy, and advanced camping options that’ll have you itching to make your next getaway a Glamping one!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/03/auto-draft/glamping_ds_yanko_design-01.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/272197/07-tranendreef_yankodesign.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>You can find these unique tents in the Borgloon forest in Belgium if you are looking for a safer alternative to the usual touristy destinations post the pandemic. In fact, it has gained attention only now when people are looking to camp outdoors because it is safer, won’t require you to fly, budget-friendly and avoids crowds. Designed by the Dutch artist Dre Wapenaar, these <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/08/04/this-avocado-shaped-tent-was-made-for-the-camping-life-of-millennials/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">‘Tranendreef’ tree tents</a> blend architecture and sculpture into one functional structure. The tent is suspended above the ground and basically hangs on the tree like fruit. The guests use a ladder to get inside/outside. It can host two adults and two small children. Originally installed as part of a public art project called ‘Pit’ (hence the avocado shape we assume) organized by Z33, it brought art into the public space of Borgloon. The designer also created ‘field furniture’ – seating, washing, toilet, and BBQ units to complete the camping site with the tents.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/01/jeep-compatible-off-roading-trailer-build-for-adventure-junkies-who-stop-at-nothing/Off-Grid-Trailers-Switchback-off-roading-trailer-3.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/01/jeep-compatible-off-roading-trailer-build-for-adventure-junkies-who-stop-at-nothing/Off-Grid-Trailers-Switchback-off-roading-trailer-17.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>If you always wanted to hook a hardcore off-roading trailer to match your Jeep’s capability to conquer tough terrain, then <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2021/01/16/this-jeep-compatible-off-roading-trailer-was-built-for-every-adventure-junkies-ultimate-camping-exploit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the Switchback trailer</a> by Off Grid Trailers is a god-sent blessing.

If your Jeep can conquer that stretch of a rocky patch (not meant for your average vehicle), then this trailer will have you covered. The lightweight, compact-sized construction of the Switchback makes it one of the best options for blokes who only get the adrenaline rush when their 4×4’s independent suspension is stretched to the limit.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/05/this-hammock-tent-lets-you-take-your-comfortable-camping-experience-to-a-higher-level/AerialA1_tent_and_hammock_layout.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/05/this-hammock-tent-lets-you-take-your-comfortable-camping-experience-to-a-higher-level/tent19.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/05/14/the-aerial-hammock-tent-lets-you-take-your-comfortable-camping-experience-to-a-higher-level/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The AERIAL A1</a> is a fusion of the best aspects of three separate products. It combines the safety and sheltering of a tent, with the comfort and carefree nature of a hammock and the tautness/springy-ness of slacklines. Designed by industrial designers with a true passion for the outdoors, the AERIAL A1 quite literally elevates the idea of camping. Rather than pitching tents in the ground, this one straps itself to trees (or even cars), taking your camping experience up a notch. Climb into the AERIAL A1 and you literally feel like you’re sleeping on clouds. The tent’s slackline structure requires you to stretch the base out so it’s virtually flat (unlike a hammock, which naturally takes a curve)… this effectively gives the AERIAL A1’s tent-bed its ‘spring’, making it feel like a cross between a hammock and a waterbed. The AERIAL A1 can easily be mounted over rocks, roots, or even a river.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/06/camping-product-designs-that-convert-your-camping-life-to-glamping-part-2/01_Camping-Designs_Romotov_trailer.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/06/camping-product-designs-that-convert-your-camping-life-to-glamping-part-2/01_Camping-Designs_Romotov_trailer2.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>Camping and caravanning have always been about getting down to the bare necessities of life, living life on the road and at the mercy of the elements. However, New Zealand-based design and architecture firm W2 has decided to help amp up the experience! Their revolutionary trailer design, <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2019/11/04/this-futuristic-trailer-rotates-at-90-degrees-giving-you-70-extra-living-space/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">‘Romotow’</a>, the name an amalgamation of ‘room to move’ contains all the usual RV features but with an innovative 90-degree twist. With the press of a simple electric button, it swivels open, rotating at 90 degrees, to reveal an open synthetic teak deck. With this, it increases the living space by 70 percent, and the area can also be used as a party deck! Measuring 30 feet by 8.5 feet and offering 290 square feet of living space (the same as a lot of tiny apartments these days), the caravan comes along with a living area, bedroom, kitchenette, and bathroom, all with stylish fixtures and spacious interiors.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/03/306866/03_bivvi_bivvicamp_aframecabin.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/03/306866/01_bivvi_bivvicamp_aframecabin.jpg\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\">Designed especially to bring people closer to the great outdoors, <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2021/03/24/this-tiny-a-frame-cabin-can-be-transported-anywhere-for-a-spontaneous-escape-to-nature/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bivvi</a> is a modular and transportable A-frame cabin that can either be attached to your car for road trips or to a chosen foundation for permanent placement. The creators at Bivvi make up a team of travelers and adventure-seekers– they built Bivvi so that we can be too. They set out to build Bivvi after noticing the inherently immobile and expensive nature of cabins and other modes of residence for travelers already on the market. Taking on mobility as their main source of inspiration, each Bivvi Cabin can be attached to a trailer hitch and tow so that they can be transported anywhere. The team behind Bivvi even outfit their A-frame cabins with off-grid capabilities including three 600W AC outlets and a 100W solar panel, so they really do mean anywhere.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/05/auto-draft/Bailey-Discovery-D4-2-Camper-Trailer-with-inflatable-awning.jpg\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/05/this-compact-camper-has-inflatable-awning-that-doubles-the-usable-private-space/Bailey-Discovery-D4-2-Camper-Trailer-with-inflatable-awning_1.jpg\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The advent of recreational vehicles has brought a new dimension to the old-school camping setup.

One thing that can really propel its image as an ultimate off-roader is the ability to take it camping without having to haul anything behind. Felix Collier thinks that’s a brilliant idea – he has therefore gone forward and built his <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/12/31/this-land-rover-defender-campers-pop-up-roof-unveils-a-lavish-wooden-cabin/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Land Rover Defender as a camper</a> for where the road may take him – highlight being a pop-up canvas roof that creates more headroom in the cabin. Felix loves exploring and driving into the wilderness away from the crowds and mainstream routes, which is ideally why he has ventured out to build this Defender camper with plush interiors and basic amenities. Speaking of which, the rear cabin is neatly done in wood including the worktop made with the expensive sequoia wood.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2017/04/draft-tentsile/tentsile_flite_1.jpg\" alt=\"tentsile_flite_1\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2017/04/draft-tentsile/tentsile_flite_2.jpg\" alt=\"tentsile_flite_2\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\"><a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2017/04/06/taking-camping-to-another-level/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Flite+</a> by Tentsile straps to trees, giving you airborne accommodation in the outdoors! While most tents become really messy ordeals when the floor is wet, cold, hard, or infested, the Tentsile Flite+ has no problem, because it straps to three trees, creating a hammock + home that suspends above the ground. The Flite+ has a triangular schematic covering an area of 40sq.ft., allowing it to form two living spaces with enough storage for some gear as well. It takes all of 10 minutes to set up and comes equipped with an insect mesh top that gives you a view of your surroundings without letting the critters get to you. It also comes with an additional tarp sleeve you can slide on top for when it gets too sunny, or begins raining.</p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\"><img src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2021/04/portable-canopy-automatically-inflates-in-just-3-minutes-to-give-you-instant-shelter-anywhere/Aeri_ultra_light_portable_shade_that_inflates_in_3_minutes.jpg\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\"><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/o8gI5AiRKgCESXWnoy/giphy.gif\" width=\"1050&#34;\" /></p>\n<p class=\"post-without-image\"> Meet <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2021/04/24/this-ultra-light-portable-canopy-automatically-inflates-in-just-3-minutes-to-give-you-instant-shelter-anywhere/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Aeri</a>, an inflatable canopy that you can carry anywhere inside a backpack, and inflate in 3 minutes with the press of just one single button.

coffee tables with <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/garden/\">plants and potted greenery</a> does help to liven up our rooms and offices, taking care of them can sometimes get messy. Water spills and loose soil have a habit of muddying the spaces where potted plants reside, creating more trouble than the plants might be worth. Creating a means for people to adorn shelves and counters with greenery, without the stress that comes with the upkeep of potted <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/tag/plants/\">plants</a>, TerraLiving designed Vertex Zero, a geometric preserved moss terrarium that requires no sunlight, water, or upkeep for that matter.</p>\n<p>Requiring no water for maintenance, Vertex Zero is a terrarium that encases real, biologically inactive moss, cultivated in TerraLiving’s own greenhouse and preserved in labs, inside museum-grade geometric glass containers. Live mosses are grown and cultivated in TerraLiving’s greenhouse dubbed the “Moss Lab,” before reaching the peak of their health and preserved for encasement. Using proprietary advanced preservation technology, each patch of live moss is stripped of any water content in low-pressure zones and subzero temperatures to freeze their proteins and biological components, rendering them inactive, but frozen in time.</p>\n<p>Before reaching the gilded gates of their terrariums, each moss cell is first pumped with chlorophyll dye, plant fluid, nutrients, food, and cosmetic grade preservatives to help make the contained moss look more alive. As varying mosses populate the inside corners of their terrariums, the makers at TerraLiving curate each glass container to appear almost as a miniature moss-ridden forest. Requiring no light or water for nourishment, the creators behind Vertex Zero advise against storing the terrarium in direct sunlight and warn users to not water their terrariums as this could lead to mold or condensation within the terrarium.</p>\n<p>Designer: <a href=\"https://www.theterraliving.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TerraLiving</a></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full
