A new look, called Material You (yes), focuses on users, apps, and things like time of day or weather to change the UI&#8217;s colors and other aspects dynamically. Some security features like new camera and microphone use indicators are coming, as well as some &#8220;private compute core&#8221; features that use AI processes on your phone to customize replies and notifications. There&#8217;s a beta out today for the adventurous!</p>\n<h2>Wow, Android powers 3 billion devices now</h2>\n<p>Subhed says it all (but read more <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/android-now-powers-3b-devices/\">here</a>).

Looks complicated, but potentially convenient.</p>\n<h2>AI conversations get more conversational with LaMDA</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s a little too easy to stump AIs if you go off script, asking something in a way that to you seems normal but to the language model is totally incomprehensible. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/googles-lamda-makes-conversations-with-ais-more-conversational/\">Google&#8217;s LaMDA is a new natural language processing technique</a> that makes conversations with AI models more resilient to unusual or unexpected queries, making it more like a real person and less like a voice interface for a search function. They demonstrated it by showing conversations with anthropomorphized versions of Pluto and a paper airplane. And yes, it was exactly as weird as it sounds.</p>\n<h2>Google built a futuristic 3D video calling booth</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/starline-hed.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2154178\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/starline-hed.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"575\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/starline-hed.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/starline-hed.jpg?resize=150,86 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/starline-hed.jpg?resize=300,173 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/starline-hed.jpg?resize=768,442 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/starline-hed.jpg?resize=680,391 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/starline-hed.jpg?resize=50,29 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></a></p>\n<p>One of the most surprising things at the keynote had to be <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-is-making-a-3d-life-size-video-calling-booth/\">Project Starline, a high-tech 3D video call setup</a> that uses Google&#8217;s previous research and Lytro DNA to show realistic 3D avatars of people on both sides of the system.

In the face of Apple&#8217;s utter dominance in the smartwatch space, however, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-and-samsung-are-teaming-up-to-take-on-apples-watchos/\">the two have put aside their differences</a> and announced they&#8217;ll work on a &#8220;unified platform&#8221; so developers can make apps that work on both Tizen and Wear OS.</p>\n<h2>And they&#8217;re working together on foldables too</h2>\n<p>Apparently Google and Samsung realized that no one is going to buy foldable devices unless they do some really cool things, and that collaboration is the best way forward there. So the two companies <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-adds-foldable-focused-android-developer-updates/\">will also be working together</a> to improve how folding screens interact with Android.</p>\n<h2>Android TV hits 80 million devices and adds phone remote</h2>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2153285\" style=\"width: 1010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Android-TV-Remote.gif\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2153285\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2153285\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Android-TV-Remote.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2153285\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>\n<p>The smart TV space is a competitive one, and after a few starts Google has really made it happen with Android TV, which the company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/android-tv-os-reaches-80m-monthly-active-devices-adds-new-features/\">announced had reached 80 million monthly active devices</a> — putting it, Roku, and Amazon (the latter two with around 50 million monthly active <em>accounts</em>) all in the same league. The company also showed off a powerful new phone-based remote app that will (among other things) make putting in passwords way better than using the d-pad on the clicker. Developers will be glad to hear there&#8217;s a new Google TV emulator and Firebase Test Lab will have Android TV support.</p>\n<h2>Your Android phone is now (also) your car key</h2>\n<p>Well, assuming you have a really new Android device with a UWB chip in it. Google is working with BMW first, and other automakers soon most likely, to make <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/with-android-12-google-will-turn-your-smartphone-into-a-car-key/\">a new method for unlocking the car when you get near it</a>, or exchanging basic commands without the use of a fob or Bluetooth. Why not Bluetooth you ask? Well, Bluetooth is old. UWB is new.</p>\n<h2>Vertex collects machine learning development tools in one place</h2>\n<p>Google and its sibling companies are both leaders in AI research and popular platforms for others to do their own AI work. But its machine learning development tools have been a bit scattershot — useful but disconnected. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-cloud-launches-vertex-a-new-managed-machine-learning-platform/\">Vertex is a new development platform for enterprise AI</a> that puts many of these tools in one place and integrates closely with optional services and standards.</p>\n<h2>There&#8217;s a new generation of Google&#8217;s custom AI chips</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tpuv4-google.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2154252\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tpuv4-google.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"656\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tpuv4-google.jpg 1666w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tpuv4-google.jpg?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tpuv4-google.jpg?resize=300,192 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tpuv4-google.jpg?resize=768,492 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tpuv4-google.jpg?resize=680,436 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tpuv4-google.jpg?resize=1536,985 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/tpuv4-google.jpg?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Google does a lot of machine learning stuff. Like, a LOT a lot. So they are constantly working to make better, more efficient computing hardware to handle the massive processing load these AI systems create. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-launches-the-next-generation-of-its-custom-ai-chips/\">TPUv4 is the latest</a>, twice as fast as the old ones, and will soon be packaged into 4,096-strong pods. Why 4,096 and not an even 4,000? The same reason any other number exists in computing: powers of 2.</p>\n<h2>And they&#8217;re powering some new Photos features including one that&#8217;s horrifying</h2>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2154063\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/google-two-photos-io-2021.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2154063\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2154063\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/google-two-photos-io-2021.jpg\" alt=\"cinematic google photo\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/google-two-photos-io-2021.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/google-two-photos-io-2021.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/google-two-photos-io-2021.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/google-two-photos-io-2021.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/google-two-photos-io-2021.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/google-two-photos-io-2021.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/google-two-photos-io-2021.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/google-two-photos-io-2021.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2154063\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">NO THANK YOU</p></div></p>\n<p>Google Photos is a great service, and the company is trying to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-photos-update-adds-new-memories-and-a-locked-folder-previews-cinematic-moments/\">leverage the huge library of shots most users have</a> to find patterns like &#8220;selfies with the family on the couch&#8221; and &#8220;traveling with my lucky hat&#8221; as fun ways to dive back into the archives.
