The arrests started protests that became a rare moment of national unity.</p>\n<p>The country created a National Pact.

He writes:</p>\n<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>\n<p>I would like to know the exact meaning of beyond and its uses and the difference between it and behind. Thanks in advance.</p>\n<p><em>-- <strong>Ahmed, Egypt.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>\n<p>Dear Ahmed,</p>\n<p>Thank you for writing. While the words \"beyond\" and \"behind\" are similar, there are important differences between them.</p>\n<p><strong>Beyond</strong></p>\n<p>\"Beyond\" can be an adverb – a word that changes the meaning of a verb, or a preposition, a word that shows location. As an adverb, it means at a further distance, as in this example:</p>\n<p><em>From my window, I can see the city lights and the mountains beyond.</em></p>\n<p>It can also mean to or until a later time, or in the future, as in this sentence:</p>\n<p><em>People need to know math through their school years and beyond.</em></p>\n<p>In the \"<em>Toy Story</em>\" movies, the astronaut Buzz Lightyear has a favorite saying,</p>\n<p><em>To infinity and beyond!</em></p>\n<p>That expression means he is willing to go very far in exploring space.</p>\n<p>As a preposition, you can use \"beyond\" to talk about a place or location at a greater distance than when using the word \"behind.\"</p>\n<p><em>There was a dog <strong>barking</strong> behind the fence, and beyond him two children were playing.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Behind</strong></p>\n<p>\"Behind\" can be used an adverb, preposition, or noun. As an adverb, it means in or toward the back of something. For example, you may have seen a family of ducks walking in a line:</p>\n<p><em>The mother duck came first, with the baby ducks following behind.</em></p><table class=\"imageframe-left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" width=\"268px\"><tr><td><img src=\"http://www.unsv.com/voanews/specialenglish/scripts/2020/08/29/5089/CE55F3B5-7CC5-4715-9D0C-B8840CD238EB_w250_r1_s.jpg\" width=\"268px\" alt=\"Duck & Ducklings out for a Morning Walk, Hervey Bay Australia\"/></td></tr><tr><td class=\"imageframe-description\">Duck & Ducklings out for a Morning Walk, Hervey Bay Australia</td></tr></table>\n<p>But note that you could not use \"beyond\" in that sentence. Another use of \"behind\" is when describing something that is not happening on time.</p>\n<p><em>During the pandemic, many people got behind on their <strong>rent</strong>.</em></p>\n<p>That is, the rent payments were arriving late. You probably are familiar with the use of \"behind\" as a preposition, meaning at the back or rear of something. But it can also mean in the past, as in these examples:</p>\n<p><em>After winning the <strong>lottery</strong>, her financial problems were all behind her.</em></p>\n<p><em>Your old clothes are just behind the times.</em></p>\n<p>Now, let me test your understanding of \"behind\" and \"beyond\" in a <strong>quiz</strong>. Choose the right words to complete this sentence:</p>\n<p><em>Mail <strong>deliveries</strong> usually fall ______ around the winter holidays, but they improve ______ the new year.</em></p>\n<p>Are you ready? If you chose \"behind\" for the first blank and \"beyond\" for the second blank, you know the difference.</p>\n<p><strong>Your questions</strong></p>\n<p>I hope that helps to answer your question, Ahmed.</p>\n<p>What question do <em>you</em> have about American English?

That is in addition to, and helps support, <em>asynchronous</em> learning – where the student goes online to get the teacher's lesson at a later time.</p>\n<p>\"…And in order to come up with a solution to the problem of that high cost of data, we usually use WhatsApp <strong>platform</strong> by recording our <strong>lectures</strong> and sending the lecture to them.\"</p>\n<p>Haruna said that after teachers record two lectures and publish the recordings online, they often use video conferencing to talk with students.</p>\n<p>\"For example, we use both synchronous and asynchronous online learning. We use Zoom as part of the synchronous one where we schedule meetings with the students just for 30 minutes to serve as a discussion meeting. … And the purpose of organizing, of scheduling this meeting is just for the students and the teacher to interact by asking questions. … They can use the 30 minutes to ask the question to the teacher and the teacher can easily respond.\"</p>\n<p>Haruna reports that both students and their parents have reacted well to this method of teaching.</p>\n<p>\"So, by so doing we were able to achieve quite a lot and the students are really following the classes. And they are really <strong>appreciating</strong> the classes because it serves as something which is new to them. And they really accept it. And even the parents also <strong>contribute</strong> immensely by cooperating. Some parents even used to give their children their phone for them to use for the sake of the classroom.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Making CDs for students</strong></p>\n<p>Another teacher who took part in the E-Teacher program is Egypt's Shereen Mohamed. She records her classes by using an interactive device at school. Then, students have two ways to get the teaching materials. They can watch them on YouTube, or for those lacking an internet connection, the school provides a compact disc (CD) or a data storage device with the recordings.</p><table class=\"imageframe-left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" width=\"268px\"><tr><td><img src=\"http://www.unsv.com/voanews/specialenglish/scripts/2020/08/30/3876/9A827E46-AB2D-45C9-9426-2A8DB540FB65_w250_r1_s.png\" width=\"268px\" alt=\"Shereen Mohamed, Primary school teacher in Egypt\"/></td></tr><tr><td class=\"imageframe-description\">Shereen Mohamed, Primary school teacher in Egypt</td></tr></table>\n<p>To make sure her students are learning, Mohamed says they have to take tests that she creates on the <a class=\"wsw__a\" href=\"http://www.unsv.com/voanews/specialenglish/scripts/2020/08/30/3876/https://www.quia.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Quia</a> website or on <a class=\"wsw__a\" href=\"http://www.unsv.com/voanews/specialenglish/scripts/2020/08/30/3876/https://quizlet.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Quizlet</a>.

In addition to leading the Neuralink startup, Musk also heads electric carmaker Tesla and U.S. space company SpaceX.</p>\n<p>Musk says he hopes the technology can be used to treat neural disorders and help spinal injury victims regain body movement. Musk also believes the system could be used in the future to improve intelligence to help humans keep up with supercomputers and <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> (AI) technology.</p>\n<p>During the demonstration, Musk showed off a model of the Neuralink device. It is about 23 millimeters wide. It is designed to be <strong>implanted</strong> into a person's skull. Small wires would connect the device directly to the brain.</p>\n<p>The Neuralink system is currently being tested in pigs, with plans to seek government approval for human testing sometime in the future.</p>\n<p>Neuralink's head <strong>surgeon</strong>, Dr. Matthew MacDougall, said the company's first human tests would involve a small number of people. The tests would be aimed at treating individuals suffering from paralysis<strong> – </strong>a condition that makes someone unable to move or feel all or part of their body.</p>\n<p>During the demonstration, Musk showed off a pig named Gertrude. He explained that Gertrude had a Neuralink implant inside its head. The device is meant to record nerve activity in the pig's nose and mouth.</p>\n<p>Musk said the company had three pigs, each with two implants. He described the animals as \"healthy, happy and <strong>indistinguishable</strong> from a normal pig.\" Musk said the company was able to predict with \"high <strong>accuracy</strong>\" a pig's leg movement on a running machine using data from the implant.</p>\n<p>Musk used the event to invite engineers and other experts to join the company in developing the technology. He also urged people to develop their own devices and bring them to Neuralink. \"You don't need to have brain experience,\" Musk noted. Those skills can be learned on the job, he said.</p>\n<p>Linking a brain directly to electronics is not new. Doctors implant electrodes in brains to deliver signals to treat conditions such as Parkinson's disease, epilepsy and pain. In experiments, implanted sensors have let paralyzed people use brain signals to operate computers and move robotic arms. In 2016, researchers reported that a man regained some movement in his own hand with a brain implant.</p>\n<p>Musk's Neuralink hopes to one day offer operations to improve brain performance, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> <a class=\"wsw__a\" href=\"http://www.unsv.com/voanews/specialenglish/scripts/2020/09/03/4220/https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-launches-neuralink-to-connect-brains-with-computers-1490642652\">reported</a> when the company launched.</p><table class=\"imageframe-left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" width=\"268px\"><tr><td><img src=\"http://www.unsv.com/voanews/specialenglish/scripts/2020/09/03/4220/AB625018-2BF0-41A8-8EA4-78EAF6E3DCC8_w250_r1_s.jpg\" width=\"268px\" alt=\"During a video presentation on August 28, Neuralink chief Elon Musk provided an update on the company's brain-computer interface currently being developed to someday be implanted in humans.

The other two companies are California's SpaceX and Dynetics of Alabama.</p>\n<p>SpaceX made history in May by launching two astronauts into space aboard a spacecraft the company built and operated for NASA. It was the first time astronauts had launched from American soil since the last space shuttle flight in 2011.</p>\n<p>Altogether, NASA has agreed to pay the three companies $967 million to design and develop human landing systems for its <a class=\"wsw__a\" href=\"http://www.unsv.com/voanews/specialenglish/scripts/2020/08/31/4935/https://www.nasa.gov/specials/artemis/\">Artemis program</a>. The goal of Artemis is to return astronauts to the moon in 2024, NASA officials have said.</p>\n<p>The space agency's next goal is to establish a long-term base on the moon by 2028. From there, NASA says it hopes to launch a series of space operations, including missions to Mars.</p>\n<p>Blue Origin's model is not a working version of the lander. But it does include full elements designed to give NASA engineers an up-close look at the landing system.</p>\n<p>One of the main goals of the mock-up operation will be to test how effectively the lunar lander can get crew, equipment and supplies on and off of the vehicle, Blue Origin <a class=\"wsw__a\" href=\"http://www.unsv.com/voanews/specialenglish/scripts/2020/08/31/4935/https://www.blueorigin.com/news/national-team-delivers-lunar-lander-engineering-mockup-to-nasa\" target=\"_blank\">said in a statement</a>.

The team includes Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Draper.</p>\n<p>The system is based on three main parts: the Ascent Element, the Descent Element and the Transfer Element.</p>\n<p>Lockheed Martin is designing the Ascent Element, where the crew would be housed during moon missions. The Descent Element, developed by Blue Origin, would carry the astronauts to the surface of the moon. The Transfer Element, designed by Northrop Grumman, links up with the lander and would guide the crew through low lunar orbit in preparation for landing.</p>\n<p>Leaders of the National Team say they decided to create the three lander <strong>components</strong> to speed up the design and development process. This method permits the team to carry out independent development and testing of individual elements, without affecting the full system, Blue Origin said.</p>\n<p>Both the Ascent Element and the Descent Element were sent to NASA for examination and testing.</p>\n<p>Brent Sherwood is vice president of Advanced Development Programs for Blue Origin. \"Testing this engineering mock-up for crew interaction is a step toward making this historic mission real,\" he said in a statement.</p>\n<p>He noted the importance of receiving NASA's expertise and feedback on Blue Origin's design as early as possible to help improve the overall development progress. \"The learning we get from <strong>full-scale</strong> mock-ups can't be done any other way,\" Sherwood added.</p>\n<p>I'm Bryan Lynn.</p>\n<p><em>Bryan Lynn wrote this story for VOA Learning English, based on reports from Blue Origin and NASA.

We will talk about two terms from science class. Both are tests. But don't worry. <em>You</em> will not be tested at the end of the program.</p>\n<p>The first term is \"litmus test.\" The second is \"acid test.\"</p>\n<p>In science, we use both to <strong>determine</strong> the chemical make-up of something. In <strong>conversation</strong>, we use them to determine other things. One identifies where something belongs or whether it is acceptable. The other determines if something is real or good.</p>\n<p>But before we tell you which is which, let's talk about their meanings.</p>\n<p>First, litmus test.</p>\n<p>Now, you may remember doing experiments with litmus paper in a high school science class. Litmus paper is used to identify whether a <strong>solution</strong> is an <strong>acid</strong> or a <strong>base</strong>.</p>\n<p>The Merriam-Webster website says scientists have long known that litmus paper turns red in acidic solutions and blue in alkaline, or base, solutions. In fact, scientists have been performing tests with litmus paper since the 14<sup>th</sup> century.</p>\n<p>Litmus itself comes from lichen, a small plant that grows on rocks and trees.</p>\n<p>Today many English speakers use the term \"litmus test\" in conversations. To them, it means something you use to judge whether someone or something is acceptable.</p>\n<p>So, a litmus test is a kind of sign or <strong>indicator</strong>. It helps you identify in which <strong>category</strong> something belongs or in which direction something will go. It helps you group things together.</p>\n<p>Here's an example.</p>\n<p>A friend of mine has a single litmus test for <strong>dating</strong> -- her dog. Her dog must like the man and he must like the dog. After several failed relationships, she found this litmus test to be the one sure indicator of a good <strong>fit</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Acid test</strong></p>\n<p>Our second scientific expression is \"acid test.\" Such a test proves the value, quality, or truth of something.</p>\n<p>An acid test can take many forms. It can be an important job or a difficult situation. It shows if someone or something is good enough to succeed.</p>\n<p>For example, beating the national champions was the acid test for the basketball team. It showed the team's players they were better than the champs, even for only one game.</p>\n<p>An acid test can also find out whether something is as good as people say it is, whether it works, or whether it is true. For example, a restaurant may look nice. But will people eat the food? Good question! That is the acid test.</p>\n<p>An acid test also can test the value of something. For example, I wanted to take an online writing program, but I wasn't sure if it was the worth the money. Then I found out that 80 percent of the people who took the class got a book deal. That was enough of an acid test for me!</p>\n<p>The term acid test also comes from an experiment – one involving gold. Some people say it dates back to the use of nitric acid to determine the gold <strong>content </strong>of jewelry.</p>\n<p>So, those are the two tests – litmus and acid. But don't mix them up. They are different.</p>\n<p>A litmus test determines how to categorize something; in other words, where does it fit? An acid test determines if something is real, <strong>valid</strong>, or high quality.</p>\n<p>Let's go back to our dog example. When choosing a partner, the woman's litmus test is her dog. That puts the man in one of two groups: the 'she-will-date-him' category or the 'she-will-not-date-him' category.</p>\n<p>But this does not really prove if he is a good choice. So, it is not an acid test. The man never said he would be the perfect partner for her. So, his validity is not being tested. And he might be a perfectly good partner for someone else -- someone who doesn't like dogs.</p>\n<p>And that's <em>Words and Their Stories</em>. Until next time, I'm Anna Matteo.</p>\n<em>I kept my eyes open and tried to see</em>\n<em>The point of what went on in front of me</em>\n<em>I kept what moved me, forgot about the rest</em>\n<em>And took my young imagination to the acid test</em>\n<p><em>Anna Matteo wrote this story for VOA Learning English.

Most people usually do not.</p>\n<p>When we are healthy, breathing happens naturally and easily. Without much effect on our part, the human <strong>respiratory</strong> system works hard. Experts say we take about 20,000 breaths every day.</p>\n<p>One such expert is James Hoyt, a doctor at the University of Colorado's Health Pulmonology Clinic, also called UCHealth. Hoyt is a pulmonologist -- a specialist on respiratory disorders.</p>\n<p><a class=\"wsw__a\" href=\"http://www.unsv.com/voanews/specialenglish/scripts/2020/09/01/3338/https://www.uchealth.org/today/understanding-breathing-and-the-importance-of-taking-a-deep-breath/#:~:text=Deep%20breaths%20are%20more%20efficient,to%20sit%20or%20lie%20down.\">On the UCHealth website</a>, he notes that our \"respiratory muscles are working every minute of the day, every day of our lives.\"</p>\n<p>A muscle called the diaphragm separates the chest and abdominal <strong>cavities</strong>. As we breathe in, the diaphragm tightens. The chest cavity opens, and the lungs expand. When we breathe out, the diaphragm <strong>relaxes </strong>and moves upward, pushing air out.</p>\n<p><strong>Deep breathing</strong></p>\n<p>When you breathe deeply, the air coming in through your nose fully fills your lungs, and the lower belly rises. On its website, Harvard Medical School notes that deep breathing may slow the heartbeat, lower blood pressure and lower <strong>stress</strong>. Deep breaths help your body fully exchange incoming oxygen with outgoing carbon dioxide.</p>\n<p>However, many people do the opposite of deep breathing. They take short breaths and have <strong>shallow breathing</strong>. Experts call this \"chest breathing.\"</p>\n<p>Shallow breathing limits the expansion of the diaphragm and its movement. The lowest part of the lungs does not get a full share of oxygenated air. This can make you feel short of breath and worried, or anxious.</p>\n<p>The <a class=\"wsw__a\" href=\"http://www.unsv.com/voanews/specialenglish/scripts/2020/09/01/3338/https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/wellness/breathing-exercises\">American Lung Association</a> notes that shallow breathing, over time, leaves old, <strong>stale</strong> air in the lungs. This leaves less room for the diaphragm to bring in fresh oxygen. And that means lower oxygen levels and less oxygen for exercise and activity.</p>\n<p><strong>Easy deep breathing exercise</strong></p>\n<p>Several health websites explain an easy deep breathing exercise.</p>\n<p>Find a place to sit or lie down. Place one hand just below your ribs. Take a slow, deep breath -- or <strong>inhale </strong>-- through your nose. Feel your hand go up. Your stomach should rise and expand. Now breathe out slowly through your mouth. Make sure to breathe out -- or <strong>exhale</strong> -- all the way. Feel your hand and stomach go down.</p>\n<p>The <a class=\"wsw__a\" href=\"http://www.unsv.com/voanews/specialenglish/scripts/2020/09/01/3338/https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/wellness/breathing-exercises\">American Lung Association</a> website states that if done repeatedly, breathing exercises can help remove stale air from the lungs. This will increase oxygen levels and get the diaphragm to return to its job of helping you breathe.</p>\n<p>Pulmonologist James Hoyt adds that \"deep breathing is a good way to reduce stress and relax.\"</p>\n<p>Hoyt tells patients to avoid smoking, to eat a good diet and to get a good night's rest. He also urges them to seek help for respiratory conditions as soon as they are observed.</p>\n<p>Shortness of breath happens when you are worried, frightened, or are in poor physical shape. But it can also be a sign of health problems.</p>\n<p>And that's the <em>Health & Lifestyle</em> report.

Everest, high in the Himalayans, is the tallest mountain above sea level on Earth. It reaches 8,848 meters into the sky.</p>\n<p>Between 2006 and 2019, around two thirds of climbers were successful in their attempt to reach the top. In the 15 years before that, only about one-third went all the way to the top.</p>\n<p>The study was a project of researchers at the University of Washington and the University of California, Davis. They found that the risk of dying on the mountain was 0.5 percent for women and 1.1 percent for men in recent years. That is down from 1.9 percent and 1.7 percent in the period from 1990 to 2005, the researchers said.</p>\n<p>The number of attempts to reach the top of Everest has risen sharply over the years, leading to a 300 percent increase in overcrowding. In 2019, 955 climbers tried to reach the mountaintop. Only 222 people did so in 2000.</p>\n<p>The study noted that on a single day in May of last year, 396 climbers had gathered at the narrow path just below the top. The area, known as the \"death <strong>zone,</strong>\" is so narrow that only a small number of climbers can pass through, one directly behind another.</p>\n<p>Nine climbers died on Everest in May 2019. It was the deadliest Everest climbing season since 2015 when an earthquake killed at least 18 people on the mountain.</p>\n<p>A picture of climbers waiting their turn to go up and down through the death zone became famous as it was shared online.

Huey, lead writer of the report.</p>\n<p>An unexpected storm, earthquake, or landslide could be disastrous, he told Reuters by email.</p>\n<p>Climbers have expressed concern that Nepal was giving anyone willing to pay the government $11,000 permission to climb Everest.
