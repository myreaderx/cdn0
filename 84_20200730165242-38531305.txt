Chucklefish publishes excellent games on all platforms and I was glad to see them be a part of Apple Arcade with <em>INMOST</em> Which is a story driven platformer with great visuals and music. Hidden Layer Games was supposed to bring it to Nintendo Switch and PC soon after the Apple Arcade release. This year has been difficult for almost everyone in some way and it has delayed <em>INMOST</em> on other platforms and the development in general. Chucklefish and Hidden Layer Games <a href=\"https://chucklefish.org/blog/inmost-publisher-update/\">announced a new update</a> for Apple Arcade that will include all the enhancements and content additions for <em>INMOST</em>‘s Nintendo Switch and PC release.

No, they’re not for everyone, but at the same time they’re a perfect type of game for mobile devices. Sometimes you want to get geared up for a major gaming session, focusing your mind and spirit entirely on whatever game is at hand. But sometimes you just want to hop into a game and watch progress bars go up without having to think about it too hard. This is where idle games shine. Not to say that there isn’t any thought or strategy involved in playing an idle game, but in general it’s a much less taxing experience that can easily fit into just those few moments of free time throughout your day and still bring a sense of joy and accomplishment. Personally I love the occasional idle game, and if you feel the same way then you may be interested in an upcoming game called <em>Quest 4 Fuel</em> from developer Rocking Innovation. It’s been in development for a while now, and while this trailer is from 2018 it should still give you a good idea of what the game is like.</p> \n<p> </p>\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div> \n<div class=\"video-responsive\"> \n <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lbvdkABMYg8\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</div> \n<p></p> \n<p><em>Quest 4 Fuel</em> isn’t just a mindless clicker, as your goal will be to engage in 5v5 battles across the single player campaign while unlocking and upgrading new characters as you go. An Arena Mode will also be included for asynchronous PvP battling against other players. While this doesn’t seem like it strays too far from the formula of the many free top lay hero collector games out there, <em>Quest 4 Fuel</em> does set itself apart with a sweet Mad Max-inspired dystopian setting and lots of cool character designs. If you’re curious to try it out for yourself, you can find links to an iOS Testflight version as well as an Android Early Access version <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/community/threads/beta-pre-quest-4-fuel-post-apocalyptic-idle-rpg-by-evil-zeppelin.410095/\">in the thread in our forums</a>, and you can actually <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1521224851\">pre-order the iOS version on the App Store right now</a> if you really want to make things official. Its expected release date is September 1st, but definitely check out these early versions of <em>Quest 4 Fuel</em> and drop your feedback about it in the forum thread ahead of its launch.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 21:39:14 +0000","feedId":84,"bgimg":"https://toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Splashart2_B21024.png","linkMd5":"ae18c722cdf6c2e865334b99ad144421","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn49@2020_1/2020-07-30/1596127958270_36a5321beb5f6523.webp","metaImg":"https://toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Splashart2_B21024.png","author":"Jared Nelson"},{"createdTime":"2020-07-31 00:51:45","updatedTime":"2020-07-30 16:51:45","title":"SwitchArcade Round-Up: ‘Animal Crossing: New Horizons’ Update Incoming, ‘Genki Covert Dock’ Review, Plus Today’s New Releases and Sales","link":"https://toucharcade.com/?p=270247","description":"<p>Hello gentle readers, and welcome to the SwitchArcade Round-Up for July 29th, 2020. In today’s article, we’ve got news on the incoming update for <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em>, details on the latest <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em> event, a review of the Genki Covert Dock from Human Things, summaries of three cool new releases, and the usual lists of new and outgoing sales. Not too bad for a Wednesday! Let’s get marching!</p> \n<h3><strong>News</strong></h3> \n<p><strong>‘Animal Crossing: New Horizons’ Summer Update Wave 2 Hits Tomorrow</strong></p> \n<p> </p>\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div> \n<div class=\"video-responsive\"> \n <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/InDJvcWtTCw\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</div> \n<p></p> \n<p>The next big update for <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> is about to arrive, and it brings the promised second wave of summer content to the game. There’s plenty in here, starting off with fireworks shows every Sunday in the month of August. It’s going to have to serve as a replacement for the real thing for folks in Japan, as the pandemic has resulted in the cancellation of all such events this year. You can even make your own custom fireworks! Neato. Luna makes her return in this update as well, offering you the ability to visit Dream Islands, where you can mess around to your heart’s content because nothing in the Dream World affects the real world. Finally, and this is a big one, Nintendo Switch Online subscribers will now be able to backup and restore their islands in case something goes wrong with your Switch. Another update later this year will grant the ability to move data to another system, so don’t go too wild just yet. Summer Update Wave 2 hits tomorrow.</p> \n<p><strong>Feeling Blue?

Like any other Wednesday, really. Tomorrow is a special Thursday, but this Wednesday? Plain-old, plain-old. And that means we’ve got the details of this weekend’s<em> Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em> event. This time around we’ve got another Spirit Board event, and the theme is “Blue\". Like the ocean, I suppose. Or the skies? Not here, lately. Gray every day. Anyway, you’ll be facing off against blue Spirits, and you’ll earn more Gold than usual for doing so.</p> \n<h3><strong>Reviews</strong></h3> \n<h3><strong>Genki Covert Dock ($74.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270250\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270247\" alt=\"\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1440\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/genkicovertdock1.jpg 2048w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/genkicovertdock1-300x211.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/genkicovertdock1-768x540.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/genkicovertdock1-1024x720.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>As regular readers may know, I tend to play my Switch in handheld mode almost exclusively. It fits my lifestyle better, but the other reason I do that is because the dock that came with my system was defective. I wasn’t able to get it replaced under warranty for various reasons, and in times where I really needed a dock I was able to borrow my son’s. Still, I’ve kept an eye open all this time for a suitable replacement. Preferably one that fit my on-the-go routine, because that original dock was a bit cumbersome to carry around.</p> \n<p>Well, I think I’ve got what I was looking for: the <a href=\"https://www.genkithings.com/products/covert-dock-preorder\">Genki Covert Dock</a>. After a successful Kickstarter campaign a while ago, the Covert Dock has been available in limited markets for several months but will finally be ready for its global debut on July 31st. The nice folks at Human Things sent one over for review purposes and I’ve been putting it through its paces with some rigorous testing. I’m happy to report that it does exactly what it purports to, and that’s great news for anyone looking for a more portable replacement for their Switch dock.</p> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270251\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270247\" alt=\"\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1156\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/genkicovertdock2.jpg 2048w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/genkicovertdock2-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/genkicovertdock2-768x434.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/genkicovertdock2-1024x578.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p>Inside the rather compact cube of a box, you get the Covert Dock, a set of global adapters in case you’re traveling, a USB Type-C 3.1 cable (6 feet long), a multi-language manual, and a weird sticker. The Covert Dock is very small, easily pocketable and impressively light. You can fold the prongs in, making it into a little rectangular cube smaller than the Switch’s own power brick. When plugged into an outlet, it leaves plenty of space for neighboring outlets to be used. There are three ports on it: an HDMI port to connect it to your display, a USB-A port that you can use for a controller or whatever, and a USB-C port to connect it to your Switch.</p> \n<p>So yeah, plug it into an outlet, connect an HDMI cable from your display, plug the included USB-C cable into the Covert Dock and your Switch, and boom, you’re all set. Your Switch will behave like it’s docked and you can enjoy all the benefits of such. It works just like the real thing, and I’ve had zero problems with any flickering images, weird audio, or anything like that. One concern I had was with regards to heat, so I played a lot of games that make the Switch cry over lengthy periods of time. I wouldn’t wrap the Switch in a blanket or anything, but while it got hot on games like <em>The Witcher 3</em>, it never became distressingly so.</p> \n<p> </p>\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div> \n<div class=\"video-responsive\"> \n <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/U6mFOR8_utc\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</div> \n<p></p> \n<p>There’s not much more I can say about the Genki Covert Dock, and I think when it comes to this kind of accessory that’s a good thing. It works just the way you would hope, and provides exactly the functionality you would expect it to. It’s a dock you can throw in your bag or pocket, making it perfect for those who travel between multiple locations on a regular basis. Even something as simple as wanting to play your Switch in different rooms in the same house is a lot easier with this little fellow. It’s also a great replacement for Nintendo’s own dock if you need one for whatever reason.</p> \n<p><strong>SwitchArcade Score: 5/5</strong></p> \n<h3><strong>New Releases</strong></h3> \n<h3><strong>Samurai Shodown NEOGEO Collection ($39.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270253\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270247\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/samuraishodownneogeocollection.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/samuraishodownneogeocollection-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/samuraishodownneogeocollection-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/samuraishodownneogeocollection-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p><strong>SwitchArcade Highlight!</strong></p> \n<p>The latest collection handled by the folks at Digital Eclipse is <em>Samurai Shodown NEOGEO Collection</em>, which is pretty much what it says on the tin. You get all of the NEOGEO <em>Samurai Shodown</em> fighting games: <em>Samurai Shodown, Samurai Shodown II, Samurai Shodown III, Samurai Shodown IV Amakusa’s Revenge, Samurai Shodown V</em>, and<em> Samurai Shodown V Special</em>. It also includes a heretofore unreleased extra edition of<em> Samurai Shodown V, Samurai Shodown V Perfect</em>. All of the included games feature both the English and Japanese MVS versions, and the English versions can be played online. All of the usual Digital Eclipse options and extras are here, including an extensive Museum Mode filled with a ridiculous amount of historical content and a Sound Player with more than 200 tracks. All that for less than the price of buying the <em>ACA NEOGEO</em> versions of the games. Very nice.</p> \n<h3><strong>They Breathe ($3.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270255\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270247\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/theybreathe.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/theybreathe-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/theybreathe-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/theybreathe-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p><strong>SwitchArcade Highlight!</strong></p> \n<p>Making its way over from mobile and a PC port, <em>They Breathe</em> is a half-hour long game about a frog descending into the depths and facing the horrors within. You’ll need to manage your air supply by grabbing air bubbles and deal with a variety of creatures with their own behaviors and patterns. Naturally, there’s a story to be told here. I don’t think this Switch version offers anything particularly important over the mobile version, but you get buttons and the ability to put it on your big screen for only a couple of bucks more. Wherever you opt to play it, this brief experience is one worth taking.</p> \n<h3><strong>Heroes of Hammerwatch – Ultimate Edition ($19.99)</strong></h3> \n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270256\" src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270247\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/heroesofhammerwatchultimate.jpg 1280w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/heroesofhammerwatchultimate-300x169.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/heroesofhammerwatchultimate-768x432.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/heroesofhammerwatchultimate-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p><strong>SwitchArcade Highlight!</strong></p> \n<p>Gosh, what a day for releases. Yes, I’m giving this one a SwitchArcade Highlight! as well. It’s a fun hack and slash roguelite with plenty of loot and secrets to seek out, and this Switch version includes all of the DLC for the PC version making it a slightly better deal. Now that’s rare. Up to four players can get in on this one via online play. A nice thing about this game is that your heroes retain all of their experience from each run, so even the unluckiest of players should eventually be able to make progress. Quite a bit of fun when you play it solo, and an absolute blast if you can get some friends to play with you.</p> \n<h3><strong>Sales</strong></h3> \n<p><em><strong>(North American eShop, US Prices)</strong></em></p> \n<p>Like most Wednesdays, there isn’t too much to worry about in today’s list. <em>Megadimension Neptunia VII</em> has a nice launch sale going on, <em>Legends of Amberland</em> remains enjoyable at any price, and <em>Vasara Collection</em> is easily worth the buck it’s going for. Make sure you check the outbox carefully, however, as there are a lot of good games in there that don’t go on sale often. Games like<em> SUPERHOT, Oddworld: Stranger’s Wrath</em>, and <em>Celeste</em> are all fine additions to any growing backlog.

But did you also know that Joycity has brought the series over to mobile in a different genre?</p> \n<p>That’s right, the latest entry into the popular franchise, <em>CrossFire: Warzone</em> is a real-time strategy game with base-building and a few MMO elements thrown in for good measure.

Danny Noss, Director of Relations at Joycity said this has been important in the development process.</p> \n<p>He said: “Years of Joycity’s experience from our previous strategy games such as <em>Pirates of the Caribbean: Tides of War</em> and knowhow have been crucial in getting <em>CrossFire: Warzone</em> ready for launch. We’ll do our best to provide players with a smooth gameplay experience.”</p> \n<p><strong>It’s been developed based on player feedback</strong></p> \n<p>Prior to its recent release on iOS and Android, <em>CrossFire: Warzone</em> had been available for seven months in Early Access. The players that were involved in this were all fans of the IP and provided feedback that the developers have taken into account whilst adding the finishing touches to the game.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270347\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"720\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270350\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/CFWZ_20200723E.jpg 1200w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/CFWZ_20200723E-300x180.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/CFWZ_20200723E-768x461.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/CFWZ_20200723E-1024x614.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p><strong>Base-building and real-time strategy</strong></p> \n<p>In <em>CrossFire: Warzone</em> you’ll have to create a base of operations by collecting resources.

This includes ground troops, attack vehicles and helicopters, among others.</p> \n<p>Once you’ve done that, you’ll be able to lead them into battle against the international terrorist organisation. These fights play out in real-time and you’ll need to manage your units locations to ensure you can reclaim the cities from the enemies grasps and put a stop to their Massive Organic Weapons.</p> \n<p><img src=\"https:https://toucharcade.com/?p=270347\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"720\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-270351\" srcset=\"//cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/CFWZ_20200723A.jpg 1200w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/CFWZ_20200723A-300x180.jpg 300w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/CFWZ_20200723A-768x461.jpg 768w, //cdn.toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/CFWZ_20200723A-1024x614.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\"></p> \n<p><strong>Collect 25 heroes and get involved on the front lines</strong></p> \n<p>If sitting back and hoping your troops can secure the victory is a little too passive for your liking, then you’ll be pleased to know there’s a first-person sniper mode.

The original launched way back in the summer of 2009, with a sequel following about 3 years later. Both titles offered sprawling adventures to enjoy and a unique twist on the tower defense genre, which was overly saturated in those years, and <em>Defender Chronicles</em> built up quite a following in the mobile gaming community. It was due to that pedigree that we were excited when one of the developers of that series, Menara Games, <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2016/04/26/demonrift-td-the-mountain-of-doom-is-coming-to-mobile-from-the-creators-of-defender-chronicles/\">announced</a> that they were working on a new tower defense RPG called <em>Demonrift TD: Mountain of Doom</em>, which would actually be an enhanced version of their <a href=\"https://www.kongregate.com/games/menaragames/demonrift-td\">popular Flash game</a> of the same name. Phew! You still following along? Anyway, we never heard anything more about <em>Demonrift TD</em> after that initial announcement in 2016. That is until this past weekend when Menara Games <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/community/threads/beta-demonrift-td-a-free-core-rpg-towerdefense-mix-is-now-in-beta.410291/\">resurfaced on our forums</a> to say that the game was finally nearing the finish line. Here is a recent trailer.</p> \n<p> </p>\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div> \n<div class=\"video-responsive\"> \n <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WECCt-vVrP4\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</div> \n<p></p> \n<p>Menara’s Youtube channel has a few other pretty recent videos of <em>Demonrift TD</em> if you want to scope out some more, and they reveal in our forums that the game has actually been in development since 2013(!) and due to all sorts of circumstances they haven’t been able to finish it up until now. <strong>Seven</strong> years later. I love stories like this though, where a game that many had probably long figured was cancelled and never coming out actually lives to see the light of day. The game is also at the point where Menara is looking for some folks to take this nearly complete version for a spin to kick the tires and hopefully suss out any bugs or problems. If this sort of thing interests you, you can find a link to the Testflight version <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/community/threads/beta-demonrift-td-a-free-core-rpg-towerdefense-mix-is-now-in-beta.410291/\">in the game’s forum thread</a>, as well as a link to the game’s Discord channel. While no release date has been settled on just yet, it appears as if <em>Demonrift TD</em> is very close to completion, so if you enjoy tower defense titles with RPG-style depth then keep your eyes peeled for this one soon or take the beta version for an early spin.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 23:39:46 +0000","feedId":84,"bgimg":"https://toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2019-05-12-at-3.18.19-PM.png","linkMd5":"f879b1cf4d7005f10c851b09e09a7e3d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn33@2020_6/2020-07-30/1596127958357_aefa6f5a658fe37f.webp","metaImg":"https://toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2019-05-12-at-3.18.19-PM.png","author":"Jared Nelson"},{"createdTime":"2020-07-31 00:51:48","updatedTime":"2020-07-30 16:51:48","title":"Out Now: ‘Interloper’, ‘Merge Dungeon’, ‘Gloom: Digital Edition’, ‘Aggretsuko: The Short Timer Strikes Back’, ‘The Everlasting Regret’, ‘Narcos: Idle Cartel’, ‘Beat Legend: AVICII’ and More","link":"https://toucharcade.com/?p=270273","description":"<p>Each and every day new mobile games are hitting the App Store, and so each week we put together a big old list of all the best new releases of the past seven days.

Because of that developers got into the habit of releasing their games throughout Wednesday or very early Thursday in order to hopefully get one of those coveted features spots. Nowadays the App Store refreshes constantly, so the need for everyone to release all on the same day has diminished.

However, many of the main traits of <em>Downwell</em> were inspirations for <em>Gun Rounds</em>, like how there are multiple different worlds with different enemies in each, or how you can come across a shopkeeper offering 3 different upgrades for you to buy. Also, the visual style and music are homages to <em>Downwell’s</em> cool pixel art and limited color palette. The actual meat of the game though is the turn-based shootouts, and not falling down a well and blasting everything in sight as in <em>Downwell</em>. You can get a pretty good idea of what <em>Gun Rounds</em> is “shooting\" for (heh) in this brand new mobile trailer.</p> \n<p> </p>\n<div style=\"clear:both;\"></div> \n<div class=\"video-responsive\"> \n <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XmqWXMS0qqc\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</div> \n<p></p> \n<p><em>Gun Rounds</em> actually launched on desktop a few months ago <a href=\"https://blabberf.itch.io/gunrounds\">over on Itch.io</a> and the comments from players over there have been extremely positive so far. All seem to agree that this is a really clever concept executed really well. But Blabberf has said that <em>Gun Rounds</em> was always envisioned as a mobile game first and foremost, much like <em>Downwell</em>, and I think a mobile screen is where the game will shine the brightest. Anyway, as of today <em>Gun Rounds</em> is now <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1517958901\">available for pre-order on the iOS App Store</a> at a price of $2.99. The release date isn’t far off, it’s coming out this Sunday August 2nd, but since that’s kind of an odd day for a mobile game release then pre-ordering means you won’t accidentally forget about grabbing it while you’re off doing Sunday things. If you’re on the Android side of the fence, well, old Blabberf made a goof and <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blabberf.gunroundsandroid\">released the game on the Google Play Store</a> early on accident, so it’s actually available right this minute. It’s not that often Android gets games ahead of iOS so gloat about it while you can, and the rest of us should look forward to <em>Gun Rounds</em> arriving this weekend.</p>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 00:10:54 +0000","feedId":84,"bgimg":"https://toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gunroundsfeat.png","linkMd5":"68c8bd0d35c618dd578da4fdb581a5b6","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn37@2020_2/2020-07-30/1596127958278_222f5165ce23493d.webp","metaImg":"https://toucharcade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gunroundsfeat.png","author":"Jared Nelson"},{"createdTime":"2020-07-31 00:51:45","updatedTime":"2020-07-30 16:51:45","title":"Pascal’s Wager’s The Tides of Oblivion DLC Releases on August 20th for iOS and Android and Here’s a Gameplay Trailer","link":"https://toucharcade.com/?p=270340","description":"<p><a class=\"app-icon\" href=\"/games/pascals-wager\" style=\"float:left; margin-top:4px; margin-right:10px;\"><img style=\"border-radius:20px;\" src=\"https://toucharcade.com/wp-content/images/app/1476649036/100x100bb.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a> <em>Pascal’s Wager</em> <a href=\"http://toucharcade.com/link/http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1476649036?mt=8\">($3.99)</a> from Tipsworks <a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2020/07/17/pascals-wager-new-boss-fight-deep-into-the-dark-mist-dlc-update-ios-android-tipsworks/\">recently got</a> a pretty big update bringing in a new boss fight for the DLC and some changes to skills.
