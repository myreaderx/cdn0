I&#8217;m fairly laid back and there&#8217;s not a whole lot that really bothers me. It takes a lot to truly upset me. While some people (especially many of the women I have dated) would, when questioned, insist that I am a &#8220;grade A&#8221; asshole, I don&#8217;t really think I am.</p>\n<p>There are some things, though, that really just annoy the shit outta me.</p>\n<p>This block of text, which appeared at the bottom of an e-mail from a &#8220;System Operations Specialist&#8221; at <a href=\"http://www.aclaratech.com/Pages/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Aclara</a>, a company that provides technologies like <a href=\"http://www.aclaratech.com/Info/English/Pages/twacs.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">TWACS</a>,  is one of &#8216;em:</p>\n<blockquote><p>This e-mail is intended for the addressee shown. Should you have<br />\nreceived it in error, please delete this message and contact the sender.<br />\nThis e-mail and any attachments thereto may contain information that is<br />\nprivileged, confidential or proprietary. Any review, dissemination or<br />\nuse of this transmission or its contents by persons other than the<br />\naddressee or authorized employees of the intended organizations is<br />\nstrictly prohibited.</p></blockquote>\n<p>You might have heard me rant about this bullshit that I&#8217;m certain some overpriced air thief of a lawyer came up with. Later, some suit at another company saw it and from there it spread faster than the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_worm\" target=\"_blank\">Morris worm</a>. The morons who insist that similar messages be automatically slapped on to every piece of e-mail that leaves their company servers obviously spent less time consciously thinking the repercussions through than I spent trying to find Aclara&#8217;s CEO&#8217;s e-mail address on their web site (hint: about 30 seconds).</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I didn&#8217;t find it. I was hoping that I would because I wanted to point out just what those idiotic &#8220;disclaimers&#8221; actually accomplish.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s rewind to yesterday.</p>\n<p><em>Note: I&#8217;ve changed the name of the &#8220;System Operations Specialist&#8221; who almost certainly is an innocent bystander and didn&#8217;t choose to have these unenforceable &#8220;legal disclaimers&#8221; tagged on to every message he sends out.</em></p>\n<p>So yesterday afternoon, &#8220;Bob&#8221; sends an e-mail to &#8220;Sally&#8221; (also not her real name). Sally is employed by one of my customers, an electric utility who is also a customer of Aclara (to be clear, my company handles all I.T. for the utility). The e-mail contains some information about an ongoing issue that they&#8217;ve been experiencing. Sally, who is not a technical person, passes the e-mail along to my boss and, along with a question from the bossman, it ends up in my mailbox shortly afterward.</p>\n<p>What is one to do?</p>\n<p>Obviously, I <em>should</em> respond to the e-mail from my boss along with the answer to his question, right? My answer will provide insight into the issue and I&#8217;ll probably even offer up a solution since I know exactly what is causing the anomaly that is being seen. At this point, no one else does. Clearly, I <em>should</em> respond with this useful information.</p>\n<p><em>&#8220;&#8230; delete this message &#8230; contact the sender &#8230; use of this transmission &#8230; by persons other than &#8230; authorized employees of the intended organizations is strictly prohibited.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Yes, I <em>should</em> respond with this useful information. Because I am not &#8220;the addressee shown&#8221; or even an employee of the intended organization (not to mention an authorized one!), I am &#8220;strictly prohibited&#8221; from doing so.</p>\n<p>Thanks to some asshat lawyer, I am &#8220;prohibited&#8221; from providing assistance and, quite possibly, resolving this issue.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure that you can see the major malfunction here so, please, if your company is ever considering slapping these meaningless, completely unenforceable contracts onto the bottom of every employee&#8217;s e-mail messages, please point them here so that they might understand why doing so is a bad idea.</p>\n<p>Now, if you&#8217;ll excuse me, I must try to find contact information for Aclara&#8217;s general counsel so that I can request, in writing and notarized, an exception to this policy they have implemented.</p>\n<p>Maybe I really am an asshole.</p>\n<div class='yarpp-related-rss'>\n<p>Related posts:</p><ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://evilrouters.net/2008/12/23/my-holiday-out-of-office-autoreply/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"My Holiday Out of Office AutoReply\">My Holiday Out of Office AutoReply </a></li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/evilrouters?a=QON0lWpYFQQ:WzURdwZBrUc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/evilrouters?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/evilrouters?a=QON0lWpYFQQ:WzURdwZBrUc:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/evilrouters?i=QON0lWpYFQQ:WzURdwZBrUc:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/evilrouters?a=QON0lWpYFQQ:WzURdwZBrUc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/evilrouters?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/evilrouters?a=QON0lWpYFQQ:WzURdwZBrUc:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/evilrouters?i=QON0lWpYFQQ:WzURdwZBrUc:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/evilrouters?a=QON0lWpYFQQ:WzURdwZBrUc:D7DqB2pKExk\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/evilrouters?i=QON0lWpYFQQ:WzURdwZBrUc:D7DqB2pKExk\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/evilrouters/~4/QON0lWpYFQQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 24 Jul 2013 12:29:50 +0000","feedId":43294,"bgimg":"http://evilrouters.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/inbox.jpg","linkMd5":"014e3152774e173e21ea4b2ea6abcdd2","sourceBytes":0,"destBytes":0,"author":"Jeremy L.
