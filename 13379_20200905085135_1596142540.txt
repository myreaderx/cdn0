There will not be a replacement of the Citigo and we have no intention to have a car of this size in the future.”</p> \n <p>The combustion-engined Citigo went <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/new-skoda-citigo-e-iv-cost-%C2%A316955-uk\">off sale in late 2019 in the UK</a>, but the model continued with the <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/skoda/citigo-e-iv\">electric Citigo-e iV</a>. The zero-emissions model went on sale in early spring, and the <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/skoda-citigo-e-iv-withdrawn-sale-due-high-demand\">UK’s 400-unit allocation quickly sold out</a>. Customer deliveries will be complete by the end of this year, said a Skoda UK spokesman.</p> \n <p>A new, small electric car, which could potentially succeed&nbsp;the Citigo, is not currently on the table, said Favey. “If one day there is a version of the <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/industry/audi-lead-volkswagen-group-rd-efforts\">Volkswagen Group’s</a> [electric] MEB platform which allows smaller cars to be produced [than now], we would have a Skoda version, but I don’t know about such plans. But as far as the Citigo is concerned, the game is over.”</p> \n <p>Skoda this week revealed its <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/skoda-enyaq-iv-revealed-first-bespoke-ev-316-mile-range\">first stand-alone EV, the Enyaq</a>, built on VW’s MEB platform. Favey said that this model, alongside the existing Superb plug-in hybrid and <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/next-skoda-octavia-vrs-go-hybrid\">upcoming Octavia plug-in hybrid</a>, would allow the brand to capitalise on the growing demand for electrified models.</p> \n <p>However, smaller Skoda models&nbsp;will not receive electrified versions for the foreseeable future, as the costly technology would make such cars unattainable for customers, Favey said.</p> \n <p>Talking about the possibility of plug-in hybrid options, he commented: “It’s disputable if it’s a good idea to have a <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/skoda/scala\">Scala</a> PHEV. It’s a technology which is still extremely expensive - you need to find a customer base which has the buying power to afford that technology, or we have to lose money which is not an option for us.”</p> \n <p>Favey also said&nbsp;that there were no solid plans for Skoda’s next EV following the Enyaq, and&nbsp;that Skoda was closely watching EV demand. He added that the flexibility of VW’s MEB platform meant that development times of future EVs&nbsp;could be much quicker than traditional combustion-engined cars.</p> \n <p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p> \n <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/skoda-citigo-e-iv-withdrawn-sale-due-high-demand\">Skoda Citigo-e iV withdrawn from sale due to high demand</a></strong></p> \n <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/skoda-enyaq-iv-revealed-first-bespoke-ev-316-mile-range\">Skoda Enyaq iV revealed as first bespoke EV with 316-mile range</a>&nbsp;</strong></p> \n <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/used-cars/nearly-new-buying-guide-skoda-karoq\">Nearly new buying guide: Skoda Karoq</a>&nbsp;</strong></p> \n <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/skoda-axes-karoq-scout-kodiaq-scout-and-kamiq-diesels\">Skoda axes Karoq Scout, Kodiaq Scout and Kamiq diesels</a></strong></p> \n <p><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vzx9uFsztlo\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p> \n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Sep 2020 17:15:03 +0000","feedId":13379,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"2f9cb468126d158797217fd134aa16f2","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/1-skoda-citigo-e-iv-2020-uk-fd-hero-front_1_0.jpg?itok=6YT-E9a3":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn6@2020_2/2020/09/05/08-50-47-305_20738251c301ced3.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295843550},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","title":"Racing lines: Alonso down but not done with Indianapolis","link":"https://www.autocar.co.uk/opinion/motorsport/racing-lines-alonso-down-not-done-indianapolis","description":"<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/opinion/motorsport/racing-lines-alonso-down-not-done-indianapolis\"><img src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/20-alonso-indy-500.jpg?itok=LMeuLJTS\" width=\"190\" height=\"125\" alt=\"Alonso Indy 500\" title=\"Alonso Indy 500\" /></a>\n<blockquote class=\"image-field-caption\">\n  Alonso qualified on the ninth row and limped home 21st\n</blockquote> F1 legend again fell flat at the Indy 500 – but he’s far from ready to call it a day \n<div class=\"iframe-container-www-youtube-com\"> \n <p>The Indianapolis 500 is like a Beach Boys surfing song: so infectious and exuberant that you can’t help tapping along and more American than Tom Hanks eating apple pie on the 4th of July.</p> \n <p>Like just about everything in this screwed-up year, the 2020 edition carried a misfire, running to empty grandstands in August rather than before a quarter of a million people on its usual Memorial Day slot at the end of May. But even so, it’s the Indy 500, baby! Takuma Sato still poured the traditional quart of milk over his head with abandon, as the only Japanese driver to have won the famous race added a second victory to his historic first from 2017.</p> \n <p>Fernando Alonso rolled in a lowly and clutchless 21st, having qualified only 26th of 33. The two-time Formula 1 champion’s quest to complete motorsport’s unofficial triple crown of glory – the Monaco Grand Prix, the 24 Hours of Le Mans and the Indy 500 – remains unfulfilled. It was better than last year, when he didn’t even qualify, but it was no great surprise, given that his Arrow <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/how-mclaren-making-comeback-f1\">McLaren SP </a>had a <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-reviews/chevrolet\">Chevrolet</a> engine when a <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-reviews/honda\">Honda</a> was the thing to have.</p> \n <p>That’s what powered him on his unforgettable debut in 2017, when he was among the leading pack in the closing stages only for it to blow. Since then, Honda has vetoed Alonso due to the uncharitable things he had to say about its hybrid engines when they were powering his uncompetitive F1 <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-reviews/mclaren\">McLarens</a> a few years ago. It’s another bridge burned in a career that has been great but could have been much more so.</p> \n <p><strong>Old-school star power</strong></p> \n <p>Alonso will return to F1 in 2021 – in the year that he turns 40 – for a third spell with <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-reviews/renault\">Renault</a>. This was the best seat that he could land when <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-reviews/mercedes-benz\">Mercedes</a>, <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/industry/aston-martin-and-red-bull-plan-more-incredible-products-under-new-deal\">Red Bull</a> and <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-reviews/ferrari\">Ferrari</a> (for whom he drove between 2010 and 2014) remained resolute in keeping the door shut to him. How he fares will likely revolve around what Renault can give him, rather than his age, but we will see.</p> \n <p>What he will certainly bring is that old star power, the kind that has made him loved at Indy. Alonso is old-school in that respect, as is his attitude to racing. Frozen out of competitive F1 drives with no one to blame but himself, he has chosen a refreshing path to light up the World Endurance Championship and Le Mans (which he has won twice), the Daytona 24 Hours (conquered in 2019) and even the Dakar Rally this year, on which he belied his lack of off-road experience to earn respect, if not stage wins.</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/19-alonso-indy-500.jpg?itok=guvwQuYe\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>Will he return to Indy for another crack at the quest? Not in the next two years, if all goes to plan at Renault. But AJ Foyt and Mario Andretti raced at the 500 well into their 50s, and while modern aerodynamics make racing more demanding now than it used to be, Alonso is made from the same stuff. He will go back. One day.</p> \n <p><strong>Bittersweet for Williams</strong></p> \n <p>I can’t help having mixed feelings about <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/motorsport/exclusive-williams-f1-team-outlines-bold-recovery-plan\">Williams</a> succeeding in its quest to find a new owner. The priority was to save the beleaguered F1 team, and the deal with American private investment firm Dorilton Capital certainly hits that spot. But for Frank Williams not to own an F1 team, as he has since 1969, just feels off. As with Tyrrell in the late 1990s, such a move was inevitable; Williams hasn’t been a good F1 team for a long time. And, unlike with Tyrrell, this deal at least guarantees the Williams name will stay on the grid. But for how long?</p> \n <p>Changing an F1 team’s name isn’t easy, due to the binding financial contracts they all sign to be a part of grand prix racing. Williams, like the rest of the grid, has just signed up to a new so-called Concorde Agreement to ensure its continued presence in F1, and it’s no coincidence that the Dorilton deal followed quickly in its wake. It also means the Williams family will have been able to negotiate top price.</p> \n <p>But now the team is out of their hands, all bets are off about its future shape and guise. How long will these investors want to own an F1 team? Could it be sold again, to a Lawrence Stroll type or even a car manufacturer? Do they really give a damn about motor racing? All we know for sure is that from now on, even if the name above the garage doors remains familiar, it’s not Williams as we’ve known it.</p> \n <p><strong>Colin Turkington shows his class</strong></p> \n <p>Three meetings in four weeks, nine races and six winners for five makes of car. The breathless <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/motorsport/btcc-announces-new-27-race-calendar-begin-august\">British Touring Car Championship (BTCC)</a> is as frenetic as ever – and by the time you read this, another weekend of action will have passed at Knockhill. But after Oulton Park, who sat atop the points standings? <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/motorsport/autocar-awards-2020-colin-turkington-wins-motorsport-hero\">Colin Turkington,</a> of course. Who else?</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/18-colin-turkington.jpg?itok=AHUZE8pO\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>The Northern Irishman is chasing a record fifth title in his Team <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/bmw/3-series\">BMW 3 Series</a> and has already won twice this season. But as much as he enjoys winning races, he knows that victories aren’t always the priority. In a series that throws in reverse grids and weight penalties for success, the only way to become champion is to pick your way through a season and keep your points tally consistently ticking over. Turkington didn’t win any races at Oulton, but he still left with an increased lead.</p> \n <p>That’s why he’s a four-time champion. Turkington knows better than anyone that nothing is guaranteed, that luck might play a part, just as it did in his favour last year. But he’s still the BTCC’s most rounded contender. If anyone is going to beat him to the 2020 crown, they’ll need to be at their very best.</p> \n <p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p> \n <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/motorsport/official-fernando-alonso-return-f1-renault-2021\">Official: Fernando Alonso to return to F1 with Renault in 2021</a>&nbsp;</strong></p> \n <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/opinion/motorsport-formula-1/should-fernando-alonso-be-considered-f1-great\">Should Fernando Alonso be considered an F1 great?</a></strong></p> \n <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/opinion/motorsport/racing-lines-line-between-innovating-and-cheating-slim-f1\">Racing lines: The line between innovating and cheating is slim in F1</a>&nbsp;</strong></p> \n <p><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oavyKN479Qw\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p> \n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 23:01:23 +0000","feedId":13379,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"a5ad8c5ed8cbf4ca1e426698e425dc75","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/20-alonso-indy-500.jpg?itok=LMeuLJTS":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn14@2020_4/2020/09/05/08-50-44-918_fd9b7ed2f63a225b.webp","https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/19-alonso-indy-500.jpg?itok=guvwQuYe":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn38@2020_2/2020/09/05/08-50-44-908_a802f913fab3f2da.webp","https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/18-colin-turkington.jpg?itok=AHUZE8pO":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn21@2020_6/2020/09/05/08-50-44-820_1df8d01d292ef7b9.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295843550},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","title":"Iconic Volvo P1800 reborn as 414bhp continuation special","link":"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/iconic-volvo-p1800-reborn-414bhp-continuation-special","description":"<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/iconic-volvo-p1800-reborn-414bhp-continuation-special\"><img src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/p1800cyan_5.jpg?itok=zy_reumF\" width=\"190\" height=\"125\" alt=\"Volvo P1800 Cyan\" title=\"Volvo P1800 Cyan\" /></a> Cyan Racing gives 1960s coupé race-bred turbo engine, lightweight chassis and hardcore suspension \n<div class=\"iframe-container-www-youtube-com\"> \n <p>Geely’s motorsport arm,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/industry/lynkco-03-cyan-concept-fastest-four-door-nurburgring\">Cyan Racing,&nbsp;</a>has unveiled the <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/fine-balance-meeting-car-technicians-blending-old-skills-new\">Volvo P1800</a> Cyan as a modernised, uprated take on its sibling brand's iconic 1960s sports coupé.</p> \n <p>The continuation car was designed as a road-legal version of an imagined Cyan Racing track car from the 1960s, and as such goes without modern driving aids such as stability control, anti-lock brakes or brake boosting.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>It has, however, been comprehensively re-engineered to offer significantly enhanced performance, dynamics and drivability. The original car’s naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine, for example, has been swapped out for the turbocharged 2.0-litre unit used in Cyan Racing’s 2017 <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/volvo/s60\">Volvo S60</a> TC1 racer, which revs to 7700rpm and gives the P1800 a substantially increased 414bhp&nbsp;and 336lb ft.</p> \n <p>To preserve some of the original car’s driving experience, the engine has been tuned to offer linear power and torque delivery, which Cyan claims are “the characteristics of a normally aspirated engine”, while still giving increased performance and precision.&nbsp;</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"596\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/p1800cyan_12.jpg?itok=dYicKeMA\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>A range of engines were considered for use in the P1800 Cyan, including Volvo’s revered Red Block&nbsp;and five-cylinder turbo motors, but Cyan chose the newer VEA&nbsp;motor because it's familiar from the team's motorsport efforts.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>The engine&nbsp;is mated to a bespoke five-speed gearbox from race engineering firm Holinger, which is said to give the same “mechanical feeling” as the original unit while offering more precise changes and durability. Power is still sent to the rear wheels, but the P1800’s live axle has made way for a bespoke independent rear suspension set-up that, like the front end, is fully adjustable.</p> \n <p>A limited-slip differential with torque-biasing functionality has also been fitted, with a gearing set-up that combines capable circuit performance with \"civilised\"&nbsp;on-road behaviour.</p> \n <p>To accommodate the enhancements, the P1800’s greenhouse has been repositioned, its track widened and its body reinforced with high-strength steel.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>Its underpinnings have also been overhauled with a focus on engagement and lightness. The hydraulic suspension at each end comprises aluminium uprights, double wishbones and two-way adjustable dampers, while carbonfibre chassis reinforcements add stiffness with minimal weight penalty.</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"596\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/p1800cyan_10.jpg?itok=f9awRkAe\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>Overall, the continuation car tips the scales at just 990kg –&nbsp;around 150kg less than the&nbsp;original P1800.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>The P1800 Cyan sits atop a set of 18in forged rims wrapped in Pirelli P Zero performance tyres, which cover a set of sizeable steel brake discs and four-piston callipers.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>Cyan benchmarked its new creation against the 2010&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/volvo/c30/first-drives/volvo-c30-polestar-concept\">Volvo C30 Polestar Performance Protoype</a>, its first road-going car. Head of engineering Mattias Evensson said Cyan wanted to “reconnect” with its first road car, as well as “carry over some of the driving feeling and performance availability”.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>Cyan CEO Christian Dahl said: “Our company was founded in 1996 to race Volvo cars in Sweden, and the Volvo P1800 Cyan is closing the circle for us.&nbsp;“We claimed our first world title with Volvo in 2017 and have since then won two further world titles with two other manufacturers. The first world title was a milestone for us, and we felt it was a good time to reconnect with the past and to those before us racing Volvos. The first Volvo P1800 Cyan carries our blue and yellow racing colours to mark our heritage.”</p> \n <p>The P1800 Cyan will be marketed independently by Cyan, with production set to be extremely limited. Prices start at $500,000 (£379,000).&nbsp;</p> \n <p>Cyan Racing, which previously operated as Volvo’s Polestar performance division, has won the World Touring Car Championship for the past&nbsp;three years in a row, most recently in 2019 with the <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/industry/lynkco-03-cyan-concept-fastest-four-door-nurburgring\">Lynk&amp;Co 03</a>.&nbsp;</p> \n <p><strong>Read more</strong></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/industry/lynkco-03-cyan-concept-fastest-four-door-nurburgring\"><strong>Lynk&amp;Co 03 Cyan Concept is fastest four-door at Nurburgring​</strong></a></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/volvo/c30/first-drives/volvo-c30-polestar-concept\"><strong>Volvo C30 Polestar concept review</strong></a></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/first-aston-martin-db5-goldfinger-continuation-built\"><strong>First Aston Martin DB5 Goldfinger Continuation built​</strong></a></p> \n <p><span class=\"wysiwyg-embed\"></span></p> \n <iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3rA-HK501OQ\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n <p></p> \n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 13:01:23 +0000","feedId":13379,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"b43cdae4f47d3adacf4bf6a0eca46d96","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/p1800cyan_5.jpg?itok=zy_reumF":null,"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/p1800cyan_12.jpg?itok=dYicKeMA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn54@2020_2/2020/09/05/08-50-45-672_9a7d86e7c8afcd31.webp","https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/p1800cyan_10.jpg?itok=f9awRkAe":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn61@2020_1/2020/09/05/08-50-43-676_570b6268393a89c1.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295843550},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","title":"Steve Cropley: If this is 'post-opulence', I'll take it","link":"https://www.autocar.co.uk/opinion/new-cars/steve-cropley-if-post-opulence-ill-take-it","description":"<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/opinion/new-cars/steve-cropley-if-post-opulence-ill-take-it\"><img src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/rolls_royce_ghost.jpg?itok=o4qtbpOS\" width=\"190\" height=\"125\" alt=\"Rolls Royce Ghost camo\" title=\"Rolls Royce Ghost camo\" /></a> Our man enjoys a socially distanced visit to Rolls Royce HQ this week, and says hello to a new long-term test car \n<div class=\"iframe-container-www-youtube-com\"> \n <p>One of the few upsides of the pandemic is that when you visit a car firm’s headquarters, you’re now usually part of a small group.</p> \n <p>At <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-reviews/rolls-royce\">Rolls-Royce</a> in Goodwood for the unveiling of <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/new-rolls-royce-ghost-acoustic-tuning-boost-luxury-feel\">the new Ghost</a>, the group comprised one person – me – which made the walk-around, the assembly plant visit and the prototype ride especially enjoyable. My hosts were designer Henry Cloke and project chief Jon Simms, who added evidence to my previous recent impressions that Rolls-Royce is nowadays populated by young people, not the venerable set you might once have expected.</p> \n <p>There’s plenty to tell about this all-encompassing Ghost project, but I was especially fascinated by the way the acoustics team has “tuned” every important Ghost component so that all of the natural resonances add up to a sound the occupants hear as an unobtrusive, unified whisper. We proved the matter on the move, too. The<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/rolls-royce/phantom\"> latest Phantom</a> is still a shade quieter than the Ghost, they say, but there’s now very little in it. If this is ‘post-opulence’, I’ll take it.</p> \n <p><strong>Saturday</strong></p> \n <p>On the way home from Rolls-Royce, I collected my new long-termer, a <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/bmw/2-series-gran-coupe/first-drives/bmw-2-series-gran-coupe-m235i-2020-uk-review\">BMW M235i Gran Coupé xDrive</a>, complete with a 302bhp 2.0-litre turbo engine, an eight-speed paddle-shift gearbox, a slippery diff and front drive most of the time.</p> \n <p>In our initial review, this car wasn’t given an excessively good time for its styling (I don’t mind it), its somewhat aggressive ride quality (true, but I like strong body control) and especially its lack of six in-line cylinders and rear drive. It has a British-built transverse four that drives the rear wheels only in times of extreme slippage.</p> \n <p>On the evidence of 100 miles, I completely agree with our bottom-line description of this hot four-door 2 Series: effective. And although I’m not a naturally quick driver, I’m enjoying having a car with 4.9sec 0-62mph potential that naturally does its best when pressing on a bit. Everyone needs a bit of this in their lives.</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"596\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/bmw_2_series_gran_coupe_m235i.jpg?itok=U4v-hXzY\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p><strong>Sunday</strong></p> \n <p>I was messing about at my local airfield when a bloke I hadn’t seen for years pitched up in <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/slideshow/mg-celebrating-birthday-british-legend\">a fit-looking, rubber-bumpered MG B</a>. We had a cheery, socially distanced chat, during which he explained that the car had been bought via eBay by his wife. He had spent so long dithering on the laptop that, in exasperation, she reached over his shoulder and clicked ‘buy’.</p> \n <p>We borrowed some disinfectant from the aero club to spruce the car and I had a little drive on one of the taxiways, confirming what we both already knew: that a 1970s B feels somewhat baggy next to <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/mazda/mx-5\">my Mazda MX-5</a> but is still a surprisingly worthy machine.</p> \n <p>I was really surprised how good the bumpers looked; they’re proper period pieces now. So many have been converted to chrome front ends that a bounce-back B now looks special. Who’d have thought it, back when we all despaired over the antics of British Leyland’s tin-eared bosses?</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/mg_b_gt.jpg?itok=I7epWVIh\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p><strong>Monday</strong></p> \n <p>Thinking of buying a <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-reviews/porsche\">Porsche</a> or a <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-reviews/mclaren\">McLaren</a>? Friends in the trade suggest that you watch the market for three-year-old cars closely from now on, as PCP deals end on cars that might normally have been bought by their owners post-lease and they come onto the market. The choice is already pretty good, they say, and it will only get better.</p> \n <p><strong>Tuesday</strong></p> \n <p>I’m off work this week, which means it’s time for a busman’s holiday. The Steering Committee and I have so missed the Festival of Speed and Revival events that have come to play such a large parts in all our lives that we’ve booked a short stay at the Goodwood Hotel, just to wander about and reminisce. It’s our first trip since the last Revival, almost exactly 12 months ago. It seems longer.</p> \n <p><strong>And another thing...</strong></p> \n <p>I’m amused to hear that new <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-reviews/aston-martin\">Aston Martin</a> chief Tobias Moers, to whom I wrote an open letter suggesting a number of earlyaction priorities, has been sent a published copy by colleagues he left behind at Daimler.

Then the brand image recovers.”</span></p> \n <p>When it was launched in 2014, the current 308 kick-started the transformation of the entire Peugeot range with a more confident design approach. The successful, <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/peugeot/3008\">more daringly styled 3008</a> followed, along with the <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/peugeot/5008\">5008</a>, <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/peugeot/208\">208</a> and <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/peugeot/2008\">2008</a>.</p> \n <p>The next 308 is set to play that role again by laying the groundwork for a new era of Peugeots when it goes on sale in 2022, most likely after a public debut towards the end of 2021.</p> \n <p>It will be built on an updated version of the EMP2 platform that underpins more than a dozen<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/industry/psa-group-and-fiat-chrysler-confirm-merger-plans\"> PSA Group</a> models and was originally introduced on today’s 308.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>PSA’s strategy so far has been for EMP2 models to be offered with plug-in hybrid technology and for smaller CMP models to come with dedicated electric versions, both offered alongside existing petrol and diesel variants.</p> \n <p>The 308 is set to get a plug-in hybrid drivetrain, mixing a 1.6-litre petrol engine with an electric motor to drive the front wheels in a mainstream variant. However, it’s a proposed second plug-in hybrid model that will interest enthusiasts.</p> \n <p>This model,&nbsp;developed by the brand’s new PSE performance arm, would gain an additional electric motor on the rear axle – a set-up already used on the 3008 PHEV – to give the 308 four-wheel drive and create a new 300bhp-plus hot hatch version that would also receive a host of sporty chassis and styling upgrades to challenge the likes of <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/volkswagen/golf-r\">the Volkswagen Golf R</a>.</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/3-peugeot-308_pse-render-2020-static-side.jpg?itok=sANfzNAt\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>The PSE&nbsp;badge is set to appear first on a <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/motor-shows-geneva-motor-show/new-peugeot-508-pse-make-production-ready-debut\">range-topping performance version of the 508</a>. Should the 508 PSE be a success, Imparato told Autocar the PSE formula could be applied “on the 3008 and other cars”, a comment that alludes to the desire to extend it to the 308.</p> \n <p>Success won't be judged on sales, either, but instead on the reputation and acclaim the PSE models receive. To that end, the PSE project is as much about “transforming electric cars” and the perception of them, because Imparato sees “a big opportunity for a line-up of sporty cars” in this mould.</p> \n <p>The GTi badge won't&nbsp;be used on the 308 or any other Peugeots apart from the 208. Even then, it might be limited to the UK only and be based on the electric version as part of the company’s plans to switch PSE's involvement in its models to electrified powertrains only.</p> \n <p>The next 308 range will again include five-door hatchback and estate versions, with still no return for the likes of the 308 CC coupé-convertible seen in previous generations, due to the lack of profitability with such cars. “I love these cars but today there are three other topics first,” said Imparato, naming 5G connectivity and autonomous vehicle development alongside electrified models.</p> \n <p>However, a crossover version of the 308 is a strong possibility for Peugeot. It has noted the success of the <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/mercedes-benz/gla-2014-2020\">Mercedes-Benz GLA</a>, effectively a raised version of the <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/mercedes-benz/a-class\">A-Class hatchback</a>. In addition, fellow PSA brand <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-reviews/ds\">DS</a> is planning both hatchback and crossover versions of its own new A-Class/GLA rival, which is due later this year with a shared body-in-white. There’s enough of a gap between the 308 and larger 3008 SUV to make such a car a reality.</p> \n <p>Updated petrol and diesel engines will continue to be offered alongside the plug-in hybrids. Peugeot is still committed to diesel and is even offering it in its new 208 and 2008 models at a time when many rivals are abandoning the fuel at this end of the market.</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"642\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/2-peugeot-2008-static-side.jpg?itok=2BXfCXZK\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>An electric version of the 308 may be on the cards too, as Imparato hinted late last year in an interview with Automotive News Europe: “It [the 308] will be a plug-in hybrid first but could perhaps later have a full-electric drivetrain. Our compact and mid-size cars will have plug-in hybrid drivetrains, because it’s a smoother way to switch from internal combustion to electric.”</p> \n <p>Inside, the style-led formula will continue with an updated version of Peugeot’s i-Cockpit design, adapted from that of the newer 3008 and 508.</p> \n <p>Peugeot will be hoping for much greater sales success for the 308 in the UK, though, where it has struggled. “This car was Car of the Year in 2014 and has been a huge sales success in Europe,” said Imparato. “It’s not as strong in the UK, where it deserves more than a 2.5% market share.”</p> \n <p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/motor-shows-geneva-motor-show/new-peugeot-508-pse-make-production-ready-debut\"><strong>New Peugeot 508 PSE makes production-ready debut</strong></a></p> \n <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/peugeot-gti-sub-brand-will-live-hot-208-likely\">Peugeot GTi sub-brand will live on, hot 208 likely</a>&nbsp;</strong></p> \n <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/peugeot/2008/first-drives/peugeot-2008-12-puretech-130-gt-line-2020-uk-review\">Peugeot 2008 1.2 Puretech 130 GT Line 2020 UK review</a></strong></p> \n <p><span class=\"wysiwyg-embed\"></span></p> \n <iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/018dCAnGvV0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n <p></p> \n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Sep 2020 23:01:23 +0000","feedId":13379,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"78dbf847737af8f1e58848ba14ea27db","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/40-peugeot-308-spy-shot.jpg?itok=wKwuP3uc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn94@2020_6/2020/09/05/08-50-43-676_e6821391efc40a76.webp","https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/3-peugeot-308_pse-render-2020-static-side.jpg?itok=sANfzNAt":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn32@2020_2/2020/09/05/08-50-48-730_b49fa5e302c4d7af.webp","https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/2-peugeot-2008-static-side.jpg?itok=2BXfCXZK":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn94@2020_2/2020/09/05/08-50-46-648_c4507a62b262acf4.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295843550},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","title":"Matt Prior: Why it's time for Aston's James Bond spin-offs to die","link":"https://www.autocar.co.uk/opinion/tester%E2%80%99s-notes/matt-prior-why-its-time-astons-james-bond-spin-offs-die","description":"<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/opinion/tester%E2%80%99s-notes/matt-prior-why-its-time-astons-james-bond-spin-offs-die\"><img src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/1-aston-martin-james-bond-editions_0.jpg?itok=JGkVx1Yv\" width=\"190\" height=\"125\" alt=\"Aston Martin James Bond editions\" title=\"Aston Martin James Bond editions\" /></a>\n<blockquote class=\"image-field-caption\">\n  007 Edition Aston duo celebrate new film No Time To Die\n</blockquote> No normal adult can order a vodka martini without feeling like an impossible wazzock \n<div class=\"iframe-container-www-youtube-com\"> \n <p>We meet again, Mr Bond. And this time… I’m sorry, are those your initials embroidered onto the headrests?</p> \n <p>And so we welcome another <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-reviews/aston-martin\">Aston Martin</a> special edition, a product of the <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/motor-shows-geneva-motor-show/aston-martin-launch-q-commission-service-bespoke-models\">company’s bespoke Q division </a>– a wryly amusing department name. Yet strangely, I find myself similarly untickled by the arrival of a limited number of <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/aston-martin-007-edition-models-celebrate-new-james-bond-film\">007 Edition Vantages and DBS Superleggeras</a>.</p> \n <p>These 100 <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/aston-martin/vantage\">Vantages</a> and 25 <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/aston-martin/dbs-superleggera\">DBS Superleggeras</a> will have 007 embroidery, hazard stripes to mimic rocket booster warning labels and missile-launch-button-themed shift paddles. Owners can even have a 007 badge on the boot lip – overt signals to suggest they’re sufficiently deceptive and intriguing that they would claim they’re in an off-site meeting while secretly playing golf.</p> \n <p>I’m not sure the whole ‘Bond thing’ needs to be shouted about quite this loudly. We all know the world’s least secret secret agent drives an Aston Martin, like we know he drinks vodka martinis. And in the same way that, outside of a fancy dress party, no normal grown adult can order a vodka martini without feeling like an impossible wazzock, I’m not convinced any ordinary person can order a 007-specified Aston without at least some nagging similar pangs.</p> \n <p>But my worry isn’t for those who do buy a 007 Edition Vantage or DBS. Aston only has to find 125 of them, and doubtless they will get the gentle, affectionate ribbing that they deserve from their spouses and friends for choosing the man-child equivalent of an Action Man lunchbox.</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/2-aston-martin-james-bond-editions_0.jpg?itok=lAQfyFM9\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>No, I worry instead for those who would like to buy a sports car in an arena where it’s already hard enough to pick one that doesn’t make the owner look insufferable by association and think this is one association they would rather avoid.</p> \n <p>There are many reasons why people spend more than a hundred grand on a Range Rover or a Porsche 911, and they’re not all related to those cars’ tangible qualities. Sometimes it’s because they say not too much about their owners.</p> \n <p>It’s nice to buy a car that suggests you’re quite cool with who you are, rather than a car that says you would rather be someone else. Particularly if the message you’re sending is that, yes, you’re a quite normal company managing director, but should your spouse be brutally murdered by mobsters, you will, before the day is over, be getting your leg over with one of your account managers in an adequately prestigious hotel from which you collect reward points. Jane, hold my calls.</p> \n <p>It’s not like Aston doesn’t do progressive things elsewhere. It’s more committed to an expansive racing programme than most of its peers, and <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/motor-shows-geneva-motor-show/aston-martin-valkyrie-specs-details-pricing\">the Valkyrie hypercar </a>is a brilliantly bold project. A back-of-mind link with a dysfunctional film character alongside those is no bad thing in itself. But when that becomes the fixation it seems to be, I wonder if the sentence “Darling, I’ve been thinking I might buy an Aston Martin” raises an eyebrow that says “Really?” more often than we realise.</p> \n <p>My understanding is that MI6 actually prefers its agents to be rather forgettable. I wonder if it wouldn’t do this association any harm in trying to be more of the same.</p> \n <p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p> \n <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/aston-martin-007-edition-models-celebrate-new-james-bond-film\">Aston Martin 007 Edition models celebrate new James Bond film</a>&nbsp;</strong></p> \n <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/dear-tobias-how-new-ceo-can-fix-aston-martin\">Dear Tobias: How the new CEO can fix Aston Martin</a>&nbsp;</strong></p> \n <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/aston-martin/dbx/first-drives/aston-martin-dbx-2020-uk-review\">Aston Martin DBX 2020 UK review</a></strong></p> \n <p><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2hcJKNDiUPU\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p> \n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Sep 2020 23:01:25 +0000","feedId":13379,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"67b3bfca8575df76d173b1964434285c","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/1-aston-martin-james-bond-editions_0.jpg?itok=JGkVx1Yv":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn1@2020_6/2020/09/05/08-50-45-113_cca1108622d8b10c.webp","https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/2-aston-martin-james-bond-editions_0.jpg?itok=lAQfyFM9":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn91@2020_2/2020/09/05/08-50-48-177_4f64cf42bcb89760.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295843550},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","title":"High-end hatches: Audi A3 vs BMW 1 Series vs Mercedes A-Class","link":"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/high-end-hatches-audi-a3-vs-bmw-1-series-vs-mercedes-class","description":"<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/high-end-hatches-audi-a3-vs-bmw-1-series-vs-mercedes-class\"><img src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/30-audi-a3.jpg?itok=WQ6gS77U\" width=\"190\" height=\"125\" alt=\"Audi A3\" title=\"Audi A3\" /></a>\n<blockquote class=\"image-field-caption\">\n  Which of these three premium hatches will come out on top?\n</blockquote> Does the original posh hatchback remain ahead of its rivals for the new generation? \n<div class=\"iframe-container-www-youtube-com\"> \n <p>Jimi Hendrix.

These are figureheads with whom all promising newcomers will inevitably be compared in some capacity as they rise through the ranks of their chosen profession.</p> \n <p>Now, I reckon that if you do a small amount of mental contortionism, you could probably add <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/audi/a3-sportback\">the Audi A3</a> to that list. You see, in the car world, it’s the model that arguably kick-started an entire genre: that of the premium family hatchback.</p> \n <p>Over its first three generations, the little A3 went on to do pretty great things for the brand from Ingolstadt. Not only did it tally up some 600,000 sales in the UK alone but also, over the course of its 24-year existence, it established itself as the benchmark that all contenders needed to reach if they were to be taken at all seriously.</p> \n <p>Solid refinement and a dynamic character that was stereotypically <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-reviews/audi\">Audi</a> in its stability and security were crucial contributors to the A3’s success over those years. But arguably more than anything else, it was the hugely successful way it showcased how a relatively small, reasonably affordable family hatchback could offer the sorts of outstanding levels of material and design appeal that had previously only appeared in cars of a larger footprint sold at a higher price point.</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"616\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/29-audi-a3.jpg?itok=N9ny0Gt8\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>Indeed, the shadow cast by its success was a long one. Now, with all of the apparent slickness of a Usain Bolt baton handover, a new, fourth-generation model has arrived to maintain its predecessor’s place at the top of the table. At least, that’s the plan. It sits on an updated version of the <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/industry/volkswagen-group-invest-further-electrification-expansion\">Volkswagen Group’s </a>ubiquitous MQB platform, sporting a handsome but conservatively evolved new look, multi-link rear suspension and a heavily revised interior.</p> \n <p>A mild hybrid, a couple of plug-in hybrids and decidedly more raucous <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/audi/s3\">S3</a> and <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/audi/rs3\">RS3</a> performance models are due to pitch up at some point in the near future, but for now, Audi offers the A3 with a choice of a 148bhp 2.0-litre four-cylinder diesel engine or the 148bhp 1.5-litre turbocharged four-pot petrol tested here. On the surface, at least, it seems the A3 is in a prime position to continue the success of its predecessors.</p> \n <p>Only it’s never that simple, is it? Not when the <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/mercedes-benz/a-class\">Mercedes-Benz A-Class</a> is arguably at its most accomplished level yet, in its sleek fourth generation, or when <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-reviews/bmw\">BMW’s</a> new front-driven <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/bmw/1-series\">1 Series</a> has solved so many of the packaging problems that the old rear-driven architecture historically created yet retained a healthy level of dynamic prowess in the process.</p> \n <p>With this in mind, we’ve collected together a 161bhp A200 AMG Line Premium (£32,905) and a 138bhp 118i M Sport (£27,805) to see just how well they stack up against our 148bhp A3 35 TFSI S Line (£28,205).</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"599\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/24-audi-a3.jpg?itok=vrDAtAMF\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>Rather unfortunately for Audi, it doesn’t take very long at all for you to realise that, in terms of the interior design appeal and apparent build quality for which the A3 has always been so highly regarded, this new model has dropped the ball a bit.</p> \n <p>The view from its admittedly comfortable and appreciatively adjustable driving position just isn’t as impressive as it once was. Sure, the Virtual Cockpit and 10.1in touchscreen infotainment system (standard even on entry-level A3s) inject a healthy dose of technical appeal into the cabin, but from a materials point of view, it seems that a fairly conspicuous level of cheapening has occurred as well.</p> \n <p>Whereas the A3’s dashboard was once an example of clean, effective minimalism and solidity, there are now vast swathes of shiny plastics that sound hollow to the touch and, along with some more hard and scratchy plastics on the doors, contribute to an overall look that comes across as a step backwards – which is a real shame, even if it might not be a deal-breaker in the mind of Joe Public.</p> \n <p>Nevertheless, of the three cars here, it’s the A3 that feels the most spacious, offering up more comfortable amounts of second-row head and leg room than either the BMW or the <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-reviews/mercedes-benz\">Mercedes</a>.</p> \n <p>Speaking of which, the 1 Series and the A-Class seem to take opposing approaches to the field of interior design and, superficially at least, it’s the A-Class that packs the biggest punch in terms of wow factor. Its stepped dashboard, turbine-style air vents, choice materials and crisp twin digital displays all inject a healthy amount of perceived quality into its cabin. But dig a little deeper and it too begins to slide; a few pokes and prods are all it takes to reveal the odd creak or groan as surfaces flex beneath your fingers. And despite its comparatively large footprint (it’s the longest car here), its second row feels notably tighter than the other cars’.</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/16-audi-a3.jpg?itok=30qPm7JU\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>Conversely, the 1 Series looks relatively plain from behind its typically thick-rimmed M Sport steering wheel, yet it promotes a level of sturdiness and tactile appeal that’s lacking in the Audi and the Mercedes. By shifting onto Munich’s UKL2 architecture, the 1 Series now has far more space to offer as well – no bad thing when you remember how cramped the old rear-driven models felt. The pay-off is that while the 1 Series comes up a bit short on visual pizazz, it’s also the car that’s the nicest to spend time in.</p> \n <p>Round one goes to BMW, then, but an attractive and practical interior is only one discipline in which a successful premium hatchback needs to succeed. On-road performance and refinement are of even greater importance, and it’s here where the three cars most noticeably begin to differ in approach.</p> \n <p>For outright comfort and bump isolation, it’s the A-Class that gets the nod. Its comfort-orientated suspension lends itself very well indeed to motorway driving, but its notably pliant, softly sprung set-up does act as a double-edged sword. On fast B-roads and with heightened levels of vertical and lateral forces working against it, the car begins to feel loose and comparatively lacking in outright composure, even if it nonetheless grips well and has a likeably weighted and accurate steering rack.</p> \n <p>It’s easily the quickest of our trio, with strong mid-range acceleration, but a comparative lack of refinement under load (particularly at higher engine speeds) and an automatic gearbox that can be a bit twitchy and overly willing to kick down under partial throttle inputs are downers.</p> \n <p>By comparison, the 1 Series, on its stiffened and lowered M Sport suspension, feels far more tied down and controlled than the A-Class yet doesn’t give up huge ground when it comes to outright comfort. Sure, it doesn’t yield quite as readily as the A200, and there’s more road roar generated by its 225-section front tyres, but there’s an appealing sophistication to the way its springs and dampers iron out compressions and control weight transfer laterally through quick corners.</p> \n <p>The only trouble is that while its steering feels appealingly sporty in its gearing and it turns in to corners with a heightened level of initial keenness, it suffers from a bit of a shortage of front-end bite. That said, slip is manageable enough and might have been a product of the 35deg C heat on the day of our test. I certainly don’t remember the 1 Series behaving like that when we tested it last year.</p> \n <p>Even so, it served to sap a degree of confidence and left an impression that the BMW isn’t quite the standout driver’s choice the propeller roundel on its nose suggests it should be. Its three-pot motor is also a touch rough at idle and very low crank speeds, although spin it up and it showcases impressive refinement, if not outstanding punch or exceptionally slick gearbox dexterity. It’s fine in both regards but nothing more.</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"599\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/25-mercedes-a-class.jpg?itok=B9pclTVg\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>And the A3? Well, Audi may have pulled money away from interior development, but it doesn’t seem like it has cut many corners as far as the A3’s on-road manners are concerned. Tauter than the A-Class in its vertical and lateral body control yet with a level of pliancy that makes it comfortable enough on poorer surfaces and around town, the A3 strikes an appealing dynamic middle ground between its two compatriots.</p> \n <p>Front grip is strong and it takes a pleasingly neutral stance through fast corners, serving to bolster a level of confidence that’s already heightened by its intuitive steering set-up. Add lock and the rack weights up superbly, and while its responses aren’t as quick or as eager just off centre as those of the BMW, it’s accurate nonetheless.</p> \n <p>Add a commendable level of poke, a slick (if slightly relaxed) manual ’box and a level of engine refinement that stands clear of the others’ and the A3 paints itself as an eminently likeable, if slightly bland, premium hatchback.</p> \n <p>Depending on your priorities, you really could argue why any of these cars should stand atop the podium. But for the way in which it blends practicality, dynamic sophistication and superior refinement, victory has to go to the A3. It’s a narrow victory, though, and the temptation to knock it off its perch because of its downgraded interior was very real. Had the 1 Series generated a bit more grip, it would have snatched the win.</p> \n <p>So, the A3 remains on top. But the shadow it casts is shorter than ever.</p> \n <p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p> \n <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/audi-r8-and-tt-face-axe-maker-reviews-line\">Audi R8 and TT face axe as maker reviews line-up</a>&nbsp;</strong></p> \n <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/facelifted-audi-q5-gains-mild-hybrid-tech-and-new-infotainment\">Facelifted Audi Q5 gains mild-hybrid tech and new infotainment</a></strong></p> \n <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/2020-audi-sq7-and-sq8-gain-new-500bhp-petrol-v8\">2020 Audi SQ7 and SQ8 gain new 500bhp petrol V8</a></strong></p> \n <p><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2hcJKNDiUPU\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p> \n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Sat, 05 Sep 2020 05:01:24 +0000","feedId":13379,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"74f48be731824d2bd066699aff0e89e4","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/30-audi-a3.jpg?itok=WQ6gS77U":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn93@2020_1/2020/09/05/08-51-18-378_552566c1ce8f12ed.webp","https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/29-audi-a3.jpg?itok=N9ny0Gt8":null,"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/24-audi-a3.jpg?itok=vrDAtAMF":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn77@2020_4/2020/09/05/08-50-47-312_69b27b2f5a95cc9d.webp","https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/16-audi-a3.jpg?itok=30qPm7JU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn46@2020_2/2020/09/05/08-50-47-834_978382afae441e80.webp","https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/25-mercedes-a-class.jpg?itok=B9pclTVg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn61@2020_6/2020/09/05/08-50-45-703_c159735c2c9b1bff.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295843549},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","title":"New Toyota GR Yaris: 257bhp hot hatch enters production","link":"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/toyota-gr-yaris-hot-hatch-2020","description":"<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/toyota-gr-yaris-hot-hatch-2020\"><img src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/gr_yaris_2020_uk_018.jpg?itok=0Ve22EMc\" width=\"190\" height=\"125\" alt=\"2020 Toyota GR Yaris - hero front\" title=\"2020 Toyota GR Yaris - hero front\" /></a> UK deliveries of rally-derived, four-wheel-drive performance car are set to begin in autumn \n<div class=\"iframe-container-www-youtube-com\"> \n <p>The 257bhp&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/first-drive-2020-toyota-gr-yaris-prototype\">Toyota GR Yaris</a>, the second model in the GR sports car range, has entered production at a new, bespoke facility in Japan ahead of its October launch.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>The first production example left the new GR&nbsp;line last week, following the implementation of a new vehicle assembly&nbsp;system that comprises a series of individual cells connected by driverless vehicles. Toyota says this method is more suitable than the conventional conveyor belt system used elsewhere&nbsp;because it allows for greater accuracy in constructing&nbsp;rigid sports car shells and chassis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n <p>The GR Yaris was recently made available to pre-order from £29,995 ahead of its market launch.</p> \n <p>Interested buyers are invited to choose between the standard variant - which comes equipped with 18in alloy wheels wrapped in Dunlop Sport Maxx tyres, as well as&nbsp;dual-exit exhaust pipes, a leather steering wheel, keyless entry and active noise control as standard - or the hardcore Circuit Pack variant. This latter&nbsp;bumps the price up to £33,495 and adds a pair of limited-slip differentials, red brake calipers, sticky Michelin Pilot sports tyres and tuned suspension in the name of enhanced dynamics.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>Both models are painted white as standard, but&nbsp;red, black and silver finishes are available as optional extras. Deliveries are set to get underway in November.&nbsp;</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"596\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/toyotagryaris1_0.jpg?itok=yJ5JYNJK\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>The new hot hatch,&nbsp;<span>which&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/first-drive-2020-toyota-gr-yaris-prototype\">Autocar has driven&nbsp;in camouflagued prototype form</a><span>,&nbsp;</span>has been developed by Gazoo Racing in Japan as a homologation special&nbsp;to aid development of the next-generation Yaris WRC. Tommi Mäkinen Racing, which runs Toyota’s World Rally Championship&nbsp;programme, had significant input into the model.</p> \n <p>The GR Yaris&nbsp;joins the <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/toyota/supra\">GR Supra</a> in Toyota's growing performance line-up. At the car's launch, Gazoo Racing boss&nbsp;Shigeki Tomoyama said: “While the new GR Supra is a sports car developed through track racing, the GR Yaris has been devised through our participation in rallies – something that many of our fans have been waiting for.”</p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/first-drive-2020-toyota-gr-yaris-prototype\"><strong>First drive: Toyota GR Yaris hot hatch prototype tested</strong></a></p> \n <p>The GR Yaris is built&nbsp;on a special four-wheel-drive version of Toyota’s TNGA architecture, with the front end of the GA-B small car platform – as used on the <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/new-2020-toyota-yaris-revealed-ground-redesign\">new Yaris</a> – and the rear from the GA-C of the larger Corolla.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>Compared with the regular Yaris, the new machine has an entirely different body, with a lower roof, three doors instead of five&nbsp;and significantly reworked bodywork to aid aerodynamics.</p> \n <p>The GR Yaris is 3995mm long and 1805mm wide, with a wheelbase of 2558mm. The front track is 1530mm and&nbsp;the rear track is 1560mm.</p> \n <p>The bodywork makes extensive use of carbonfibre polymer and aluminium to reduce weight. It also includes a substantially wider rear track than the regular Yaris, along with new double-wishbone rear suspension. Kerb weight is 1280kg.</p> \n <p>Only limited technical information was available when <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/first-drive-2020-toyota-gr-yaris-prototype\">Autocar drove the GR Yaris</a>, but Toyota later confirmed that the&nbsp;<span>turbocharged&nbsp;</span>1.6-litre three-cylinder engine will produce a maximum of 257bhp and 265lb ft.</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"596\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/toyotagryaris6.jpg?itok=CejAumfd\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>The engine is mated to a six-speed Intelligent Manual Transmission (IMT) gearbox, with permanent four-wheel drive delivered by&nbsp;Toyota’s new GR-Four system. This uses a multi-plate clutch and can vary power to all four wheels, with three preset levels of torque distribution, including a wholly rear-biased one. The GR Yaris features 356mm grooved front disc brakes that&nbsp;utilise four-pot calipers.</p> \n <p>Pre-orders have already opened for the hot hatch in Japan, where it's being being offered&nbsp;<span>initially</span>&nbsp;in limited-run RZ First Edition and RZ High Performance First Edition&nbsp;guises. Both models feature bodywork styling tweaks and elements, along with other design features.</p> \n <p>The GR Yaris will be produced on a dedicated Gazoo Racing line at Toyota’s production facility in Motomachi, Japan, that uses a large number of manual processes.</p> \n <p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/first-drive-2020-toyota-gr-yaris-prototype\"><strong>First drive: Toyota GR-Yaris hot hatch prototype tested</strong></a></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/toyota/supra\"><strong>Toyota GR Supra review</strong></a></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/toyota/yaris/first-drives/toyota-yaris-2020-uk-review\"><strong>Toyota Yaris 2020 UK review</strong></a></p> \n <p><span class=\"wysiwyg-embed\"></span></p> \n <iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/70WJRTmbW6w\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n <p></p> \n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 08:19:02 +0000","feedId":13379,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"eedcfc2b26ae4486707ffe23f7db485c","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/gr_yaris_2020_uk_018.jpg?itok=0Ve22EMc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn25@2020_1/2020/09/05/08-50-45-151_e8d9b1d1300c02db.webp","https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/toyotagryaris1_0.jpg?itok=yJ5JYNJK":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn66@2020_4/2020/09/05/08-50-43-892_a82c303bbd1773a9.webp","https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/toyotagryaris6.jpg?itok=CejAumfd":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn9@2020_2/2020/09/05/08-50-43-873_a2f96b10d35417b4.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295843551},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","title":"Lotus Evija: 2000bhp hypercar stars at Concours of Elegance","link":"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/lotus-evija-2000bhp-hypercar-stars-concours-elegance","description":"<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/lotus-evija-2000bhp-hypercar-stars-concours-elegance\"><img src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/40-lotus-evija.jpg?itok=y7OiAu8k\" width=\"190\" height=\"125\" alt=\"2020 Lotus Evija at Concours of Elegance - side\" title=\"2020 Lotus Evija at Concours of Elegance - side\" /></a>\n<blockquote class=\"image-field-caption\">\n  Evija will kickstart a new era of design and performance at Hethel\n</blockquote> World's most powerful production car is sold out for 2020, but deliveries have been pushed back to next year \n<div class=\"iframe-container-www-youtube-com iframe-container-www-youtube-com\"> \n <p>The new <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-reviews/lotus\">Lotus</a> Evija has been shown&nbsp;at London's Concours of Elegance, as the company gears up to begin customer deliveries in 2021.</p> \n <p>The hypercar's second public appearance - following a debut at last week's London Concours - comes following the company's announcement that <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/exclusive-lotus-evija-launch-pushed-back-until-mid-2021\">deliveries have been pushed back five month</a>s as a result of the pandemic. As exclusively reported by Autocar, lockdowns, travel restrictions and quarantine rules hampered the firm's ability to continue the model's testing programme, which will&nbsp;recommence as restrictions ease.</p> \n <p>More recently, Lotus <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/industry/lotus-ends-evija-development-contract-williams-advanced-engineering\">ended its technical development partnership with Williams Advanced Engineering</a>, which had seen the two forms collaborate on the Evija, citing \"delivery problems\".

Work on the facility, which is a former Lotus Engineering building that was once home to the <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/opinion/anything-goes/dont-read-just-another-journo-glorious-vauxhall-lotus-carlton\">Vauxhall Lotus Carlton</a>,&nbsp;is now near completion.&nbsp;Each of the 130 Evijas will be hand-built there.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>Lotus has told Autocar that all of the Evijas due to be built this year have already been sold, although it hasn't given an exact figure.</p> \n <p>“With our new factory ready, we are ahead of the pack in the emerging EV hypercar segment and 100% ready for some healthy competition,\" said Lotus boss Phil Popham, an indirect reference to the likes of the Pininfarina Battista that have so far remained quiet on sales.</p> \n <p>Dynamic testing of the car got underway earlier this year at Lotus's&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/lotus-reveals-plans-overhauled-hethel-hq\">Hethel </a>test track, which sits adjacent to the Evija production facility.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>Gavan Kershaw, director of vehicle attributes at Lotus, said: “Physical prototype testing at speed is a landmark moment for the Evija and hugely exciting for everyone involved. Our aim is to make sure it’s a true Lotus in every sense, with exceptional performance that’s going to set new standards in the hypercar sector.”&nbsp;</p> \n <p>While most track testing will be done at Hethel, Lotus claims it will use other demanding European circuits, too. \"Over the coming months several prototypes will cover many thousands of miles and hundreds of hours of driving assessment, including on public roads\" the maker said in a release.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>An output of 1973bhp is promised for the Evija, which is more than the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/pininfarina-battista-1900bhp-ev-shows-restyled-front-end\">1888bhp Battista</a> and <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/motor-shows-geneva-motor-show/£15m-rimac-ctwo-hypercar-almost-sold-out-three-weeks\">Rimac C_Two</a>&nbsp;and the 1479bhp petrol-powered&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/bugatti/chiron\">Bugatti Chiron</a> currently in production.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>Each of the 130 due to be built will be priced at £2.04 million. “Target specifications” include four-wheel drive, 1254lb ft and torque vectoring, giving it a 0-62mph time of less than three seconds, a 0-186mph time of less than nine seconds and a top speed of 200mph-plus. A production slot can be reserved with a refundable £250,000 deposit.&nbsp;</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"506\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/evija_configurator_7.jpg?itok=JAiLS3PN\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>The Evija, pronounced ‘E-vi-ya’, will be Lotus’s first new-model launch <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/lotus-suv-use-volvo-underpinnings-and-have-class-leading-handling\">under Geely ownership</a>, and is the maker’s first all-new model for more than a decade. It will&nbsp;act “as a ‘halo’ for the rest of the Lotus range” both now and for “new Lotus performance cars to come”.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>The car pictured here in a studio is for show, but Lotus’s design director, Russell Carr, told Autocar that “this is how it’ll be on the road. This is very much the production car. All the surfaces are made to production level.”&nbsp;</p> \n <p>The Evija, which is codenamed Type 130, is low and broad, at 4.59m long, 2.0m wide and 1.12m high. According to Lotus, it “marks the beginning of a contemporary new Lotus design language”.&nbsp;</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"596\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/dsc_5468.jpg?itok=lGL8GAeO\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>“We wanted from the start to do something that was pure, simple, but have a sense of luxury and elegance about it,” said Carr. “On the outside, we started by thinking ‘what are the existing factors from the Lotus DNA that we want to keep?’, and really important for us were the strong haunches you see on the car. It’s very important when you’re sitting inside that you can see the corners of the vehicle – it helps you place the car on the track. It’s also just a very emotional thing to see the bodywork; rearwards as well.”&nbsp;</p> \n <p>“We have the cabin sat low within those fenders, which are really important to us because the car’s all about dynamics,” said Carr, “and if the cabin sits low and the fenders are pronounced, you have the impression that the car’s got a low centre of gravity.”&nbsp;</p> \n <p>Around the overall design simplicity come some advanced aerodynamics (see Carr Q&amp;A, below), which direct air flow over, under and through the car, creating a complex body shape with vast scoops running through the rear three-quarters, and exiting at the back.&nbsp;</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"596\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/dsc_5451-edit.jpg?itok=BaBb094f\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>The design is permitted by the adoption of electric drive. “That certainly gives us a lot more freedom, yes,” said Carr. “You’ve obviously got battery packs that can be placed in certain places, and it’s certainly different from a traditional combustion engine, and we’ve tried to exploit that as much as possible.”&nbsp;</p> \n <p>Lotus hasn’t yet revealed how many electric motors the car will have or where they’ll be positioned, but its partnership with Williams Advanced Engineering – which is, among other things, the supplier of batteries to the Formula E grid – will be key to the Evija’s performance.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>Lotus said the Evija will have a 70kWh battery, capable of being charged at up to 350kW, enabling an 18-minute charge with a WLTP range of around 250 miles. The charge port is at the rear of the car.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>Construction is from carbonfibre, both for the chassis and the body. Light weight is core to all Lotus models and the Evija weighs several hundred kilos less than the Battista and C_Two are reported to be, although they have more battery capacity. Even so, at 1680kg, the Evija is likely to become the heaviest Lotus ever. Despite this, Lotus boldly claims it will “set a new standard for Lotus driving performance” and be “the most dynamically accomplished road car in the history of Lotus”.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>Inside, the carbonfibre construction remains visible in what’s a relatively spacious cockpit. “The start point is a floating beam, this open instrument panel you can place your hand right through,” said Carr. “The inspiration for that came from classic racing cars, from the 1950s and ’60s, in which you can see the structure. In those days it would have been tubular, but on this it’s carbonfibre.&nbsp;</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"596\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/dsc_5469-edit.jpg?itok=6CG5Jiok\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>“We wanted to use carbonfibre, and once we got into that we started looking at wishbones on racing cars. We looked at modern racing bicycles as well, and that informed some of the sections and forms that go in there. And that’s really become a very distinctive part of this interior. If you love modern racing bikes or componentry on racing cars, you’ll recognise that.”&nbsp;</p> \n <p>“It’s a nice shape to use as well, with the wing profile, and adds a strong aeronautical flavour on the whole car. It’s very distinctive,” Carr added. “There’s a certain luxury to space and in such cars you can feel very claustrophobic. This feels open.”&nbsp;</p> \n <p>That’s in stark contrast to another upcoming hypercar, the <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/motor-shows-geneva-motor-show/aston-martin-valkyrie-specs-details-pricing\">Aston Martin Valkyrie</a>, with the implication that the two British hypercars will be quite different, in ethos as well as propulsion.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>“We wanted, if this doesn’t sound ridiculous, a really usable hypercar,” said Carr. “The Evija is very much a road car. But obviously the performance credentials of this car mean that it can be driven on the track.&nbsp;</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"596\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/dsc_5165-edit.jpg?itok=ATMLUl2i\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>“Certainly from our side the work we’ve done on the aerodynamics means that it’s going to be an extremely quick car, generating a huge amount of downforce, which means it can be driven at high speeds. It’s going to be a stable car wherever it’s driven.”</p> \n <p><strong>Q&amp;A with Russell Carr, design director, Lotus Cars</strong></p> \n <p><strong>Tell us about the way air moves around this car.&nbsp;</strong></p> \n <p>“Something very Lotus which we’ve taken to another level is the aerodynamics. <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/lotus-70-highs-and-lows\">It’s always been part of our history and motorsport</a>: in the ’60s we were among the first teams putting wings on cars, we had ground effects in the ’70s and streamlining way back in the ’50s. With this car, the philosophy was that we wanted to harness the airflow over the body of the car, but also through the body of the car. We’re not the first people to do it, but we wanted to do it in a very sculptural manner that would give a different aesthetic to the car.”&nbsp;</p> \n <p><strong>What does that mean for aesthetics?&nbsp;</strong></p> \n <p>“When you look at the car from the outside you see familiar volume, we hope a very beautiful-looking car. It’s important that it’s beautiful in the first place. But as you walk around it you start to see openings that go through the car, which allow the air to pass through. As I say, that gives it a different aesthetic, draws the eye through the car and over the car, and gives it a great sense of movement.”</p> \n <p><strong>Read more</strong></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/used-cars/james-ruppert-nows-time-buy-lotus\"><strong>James Ruppert: Now's the time to buy a Lotus</strong></a></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/lotus-elan-frame-boxster-rival-revival-plan\"><strong>Lotus Elan in frame as Boxster rival in revival plan</strong></a></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/lotus-70-highs-and-lows\"><strong>Lotus at 70: the highs and lows​</strong></a></p> \n <p><span class=\"wysiwyg-embed\"></span></p> \n <iframe allow=\"accelerometer;

The E-tron S duo use three electric motors, becoming one of the first production cars to do so, producing 496bhp.</p> \n <h3><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/new-mg-5-electric-estate-headed-uk-214-mile-range\">MG 5</a></h3> \n <p>The UK's first affordable electric estate car will make its official debut shortly, sitting alongside the ZS EV crossover in MG's growing range of zero-emissions models. The MG 5 is understood to be a reengineered version of the China-only&nbsp;Roewe Ei5, and should deliver 214 miles of range from a&nbsp;52.5kWh battery pack.</p> \n <p>Cost will be the 5's strongest selling point, with the estate expected to arrive at a similar price to the ZS EV - undercutting many smaller electric models from European and Japanese rivals.</p> \n <h3><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/volkswagen/id-3/first-drives/volkswagen-id-3-2020-review\">Volkswagen ID 3</a></h3> \n <p>Designed and built as a pure electric car, the ID hatchback is a crucial launch for VW. It closely matches the Golf hatchback in size, with limited-run First Edition models retailing from £38,880. Eventually more entry-level models will be sold at a price closer to that of a Golf diesel, roughly £27,000.</p> \n <p>Built on the modular MEB platform, the ID 3&nbsp;offers a variety of battery options for a range of between 249 and 373 miles between charges. The final design largely remains true to the original concept, which was first revealed in 2016 and went on to inspire several other ID models, which are all due to launch over the next five years.</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"596\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/1vwid3_0.jpg?itok=-7XAjkft\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <h2>October 2020</h2> \n <h3><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/2019-ssangyong-korando-lead-brands-electrification-plans\">Ssangyong Korando EV</a></h3> \n <p>Conventional petrol and diesel versions of the South Korean firm's new Nissan Qashqai rival appeared on UK forecourts back in 2019, but an electric variant inspired by Ssangyong's recent e-SIV concept is expected to arrive very shortly.</p> \n <p>It will likely carry only minor visual changes from the standard car, but will be a proper 4x4, with all-wheel drive and strong towing ability - a key feature for many UK Ssangyong customers.</p> \n <h3>December 2020</h3> \n <h3><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/new-citroen-c4-and-e-c4-make-uk-debut-ahead-autumn-launch\">Citroen e-C4</a></h3> \n <p>The latest generation C4 will arrive with radically different coupe-crossover styling, and will be offered as an electric variant for the first time. The e-C4 sits on the PSA Group's CMP modular EV platform, currently used by the Vauxhall Corsa-e, and will use the same powertrain.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>Customers can expect 134bhp and 192lb ft from the motor driving the front wheels, and 217 miles of range from the 50kWh battery. Top speed should be 93mph and the e-C4 should manage 0-62mph in 9.7sec.</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"415\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/_max0195-edit-edit.jpg?itok=ueLfDLl1\" width=\"622\" /></p> \n <h3><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/mercedes-eqa-electric-crossover-drops-disguise-new-images\">Mercedes-Benz EQA</a></h3> \n <p>The entry-level EQ model is set to borrow its body shape&nbsp;from the GLA compact crossover rather than the A-Class hatchback, leaving more room beneath the seats for batteries without compromising on interior space.</p> \n <p>Mercedes has yet to reveal much about the car, including which electric powertrain it will use, although the EQA is predicted to deliver 249 miles of range between charges, and will likely be priced to compete with the BMW i3. Styling should closely follow that of the EQC.</p> \n <h3><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/mercedes-benz-eqv-electric-mpv-priced-%C2%A370665\">Mercedes-Benz EQV</a></h3> \n <p>The luxury van-based MPV has already made its debut, but won't be reaching UK forecourts until later this year. It will be one of the first in its class to go on sale, and borrows much of its styling from the conventional&nbsp;V-Class model.</p> \n <p>252 miles of electric range is promised, along with a choice of seating configurations, and prices starting from £70,000.</p> \n <h3><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/tesla-%E2%80%98plaid%E2%80%99-3-motor-system-coming-model-s-2020%E2%80%99\">Tesla Model S Plaid</a></h3> \n <p>Long promised by Tesla boss Elon Musk, the Model S Plaid should soon arrive to challenge Porsche's Taycan Turbo S for the electric performance saloon crown. A Model S Performance can already manage 0-60mph in 2.4sec, but the Plaid (named as a nod to Mel Brooks comedy classic Spaceballs) will gain an extra motor that allows for torque vectoring. Battery capacity should also be increased to cope with the extra performance without compromising on range.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>Prototypes have been spotted testing at the Nurburgring with sizeable rear wings, larger wheels, lowered suspension and a wider rear track, but it is unclear whether any of those will make it onto the production car.</p> \n <h3>Tesla Model X Plaid</h3> \n <p>Improvements made for the Model S Plaid will almost certainly make their way into Tesla's family SUV, already the fastest-accelerating seven-seater on sale in the UK. Adding an extra motor to the Model X could see it manage 0-60mph in an even quicker time than its current 2.7sec.</p> \n <h3><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/volvo-xc40-recharge-p8-orders-open-electric-suv\">Volvo XC40 Recharge&nbsp;P8</a></h3> \n <p>The company’s very first electric vehicle, the XC40 Recharge is the first of what will quickly become an entire range of EV-adapted versions, rather than brand new ones built around batteries and electric motors. That means an electric XC90 will follow.</p> \n <p>Hardware will be shared with Polestar 2, has already arrived on UK shores, with customers having to wait until the tail-end of 2020 to see XC40 Recharge models on the roads. When it does, it will deliver 402bhp from twin electric motors, and promises 248 miles of range. Pricing was revealed at £53,000 - nudging the Recharge over the government's updated plug-in car grant maximum cost.</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"596\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/volvo_xc40_bev_front.jpg?itok=XyrTWwmH\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <h3>Spring 2021</h3> \n <h3><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/motor-shows-geneva-motor-show/audi-reveals-q4-e-tron-electric-suv-ahead-2020-sale\">Audi Q4 e-tron </a></h3> \n <p>The concept version of Audi's upcoming mainstream electric SUV was revealed at 2019's Geneva motor show, but a production version isn't set to arrive until 2020 as the firm's fifth electric model. It borrows styling from the e-tron, and will slot in beneath the Q5 in terms of size.</p> \n <p>It will use the VW Group's MEB platform, rather than the adapted MQ platform used by the larger e-tron. Twin motors will provide Quattro all-wheel drive and up to 302bhp - around 100bhp less than the full-size e-tron but 100 more than MEB-based hatchbacks like the VW ID.</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"596\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/audi_q4_etron_2626j.jpg?itok=iNEq18vv\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <h3><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/new-audi-e-tron-gt-porsche-taycan-sibling-seen-ahead-la-debut\">Audi E-tron GT</a></h3> \n <p>The electric grand tourer, which will share a platform with the Porsche Taycan, is expected to make its production debut towards the end of the year. Audi will likely time its reveal with the 2020 LA motor show, if it goes ahead post-pandemic, with the final car expected to go on sale in early 2021.</p> \n <p>It is predicted to use a 96kWh battery good for 248 miles of range, with 350kW rapid charging and twin electric motors producing 582bhp. The E-tron GT should be capable of&nbsp;0-62mph in 3.5sec and a 149mph top speed.</p> \n <h3><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/motor-shows-geneva-motor-show/1900bhp-pininfarina-battista-ev-make-uk-appearance\">Pininfarina Battista</a></h3> \n <p>Only 150 Battista hypercars are set to be produced, but with individual motors for each wheel producing a total&nbsp;1900bhp, it promises to be powerful in the extreme. Lucky customers will see deliveries towards the end of 2020 from the design house-turned-manufacturer, which has partnered with Rimac for the underlying powertrain.&nbsp;</p> \n <h3><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/2020-tesla-model-y-prices-specs-details\">Tesla Model Y</a></h3> \n <p>Originally revealed in March 2019, Tesla's compact SUV saw North American deliveries begin earlier this year. The sister car to the Model 3 isn't expected to arrive in the UK until next year at the earliest. The much-in-demand SUV will arrive with the option to add a third row - which could make it the go-to EV for large families. It shares a platform and powertrain with the Model 3 saloon, which will hopefully speed up Tesla's ability to deliver cars on time.</p> \n <p>A more advanced version of the company’s ‘supercomputer’ semi-autonomous driving system is also predicted, as is a more potent Performance variant.</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"596\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/model_y_front_34_blue_1.jpg?itok=XJuJ_qzH\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <h3>Tesla Roadster</h3> \n <p>A flagship sports car to replace the original, Lotus-based Roadster that announced Tesla to the world, the next-generation Roadster has been previewed extensively ahead of an official debut. Tesla claims a top speed in excess of 250mph, a 0-60mph time of 1.9 seconds, and a range of 620 miles thanks to a 200kWh battery pack - the biggest in a production EV. Prices are expected to start at around £189,000 for the first 1000 cars, which will be badged as Founders Edition models. Following that, prices should be around £151,000 when general sales begin in mid-2020.</p> \n <h3><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/motor-shows-la-motor-show/amazon-leads-£544-million-investment-ev-start-rivian\">Rivian R1T</a></h3> \n <p>A surprise announcement at 2018's Los Angeles motor show, despite the company behind it having been first formed in 2009, the Rivian R1T is a pick-up truck reimagined for an EV generation. It has clever packaging that makes the most of available space, while the underlying powertrain promises to deliver as much as 754bhp and a 0-60mph time of under three seconds.</p> \n <p>It is set to go into production in late 2020, which might be enough time to beat Tesla's upcoming pick-up to the punch.</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"596\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/94-rivian-r1t-reveal-static-front_0.jpg?itok=fSJrEFHN\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <h3><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/new-bmw-ix3-munichs-second-ev-offers-285-mile-range\">BMW IX 3</a></h3> \n <p>An electric version of BMW’s X3 SUV, the iX3, made its debut in mid-2020 with a new rear-wheel drive powertrain comprising a single electric motor. It closely resembles the petrol-powered X3, rather than taking any design inspiration from the more radical i3 and i8, and is only the company’s second pure electric car. The motor develops 282bhp from a 80kWh battery, and is capable of delivering 285 miles of WLTP-certified range. UK deliveries will begin in March 2021.</p> \n <h3><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/new-2021-cupra-el-born-vw-group%E2%80%99s-first-ev-hot-hatch\">Cupra el-Born</a></h3> \n <p>The second non-VW model to launch on the MEB platform, the el-Born has a very similar powertrain and engineering to the ID hatchback, but opts for sportier styling and a more engaging driving experience. Set to arrive early next year, it will be powered by a 77kWh (82kWh gross) battery pack and promises&nbsp;310 miles of range per charge, though the brand has yet to confirm exact performance figures.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>With the VW ID 3 only reaching the UK in September 2020, it will be at least six months before the sporty EV arrives in showrooms. When it does, it is&nbsp;expected to pack around 201bhp for a 0-31mph time of 2.9 seconds.&nbsp;</p> \n <h3><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/fiat-500-reinvented-all-electric-city-car-2020\">Fiat 500</a></h3> \n <p>The new electric Fiat 500 shares much of its styling with the current petrol-powered model, but underneath it is entirely new, with a bespoke&nbsp;architecture, 117bhp electric motor and 42kWh lithium iojn battery pack. Range is quoted at 199 miles on the WLTP test cycle, giving it an edge over the Mini Electric and Honda E.</p> \n <p>Revealed online following the cancellation of the Geneva motor show in March, the electric Fiat 500 will go on sale in the first quarter of 2021. Prices will start from £29,500 at launch for a top-spec La Prima edition convertible, with hard-top models set to follow later.</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"596\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/new_500_5.jpg?itok=azgZbG1I\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <h3><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/motor-shows-la-motor-show/first-ride-2020-ford-mustang-mach-e-prototype\">Ford Mustang Mach-E</a></h3> \n <p>Ford's upcoming pony car caused controversy for several reasons. It will be the first electric car to wear the Mustang badge, and it has a crossover bodystyle. At launch, the range-topping version promises 332bhp and a 0-60 time in the mid 5-seconds, but a full GT model is expected at a later date with 459bhp and a sprint time in the threes.</p> \n <p>UK deliveries were originally&nbsp;scheduled for the third quarter of 2020, but Ford pushed that back to Spring 2021 in order to meet expected demand in its home territory. While prices have yet to be made official, it is expected to cost from around £42,000 for an entry-level model, rising to over £60,000 for the top-end version.</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"625\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/86-ford-mustang-mach-e-2020-fd-otr-front_0.jpg?itok=gsx2xAKN\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <h3><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/lotus-evija-new-configurator-video-released-ev-hypercar\">Lotus Evija</a></h3> \n <p>Provided lockdown restrictions are lifted in time, Lotus is expecting to begin production of its first electric car later this year, with customer deliveries due by the end of 2020. The Evija has already sold out its first year allocation, despite costing £2.04 million each and built slots requiring a £250,000 deposit.</p> \n <p>While Lotus has yet to confirm performance details, it is reportedly targeting a 0-62mph time of under three seconds, a top speed of over 200mph, and a 0-186mph sprint of less than nine seconds. Multiple electric motors will deliver all-wheel drive and a peak 1973bhp output, making it more powerful than both the 1479bhp Bugatti Chiron and 1888bhp Pininfarina Battista.</p> \n <h3><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/skoda-enyaq-iv-revealed-first-bespoke-ev-316-mile-range\">Skoda Enyaq iV</a></h3> \n <p>The Czech company's first bespoke EV, the Enyaq iV is set to begin UK deliveries in early 2021. It will be the first time Skoda has used the VW Group's MEB platform, and will arrive in a selection of different power and battery combinations, including a flagship vRS performance model.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>Physically as long as an Octavia, but with almost as much interior space as the seven-seat Kodiaq, it promises up to 316 miles of range in rear-driven 80 iV guise, or 285 miles with the all-wheel drive 80x variant. The top-spec vRS version promises 302bhp and a 0-62mph time of 6.2sec. Prices will start from £30,000 after government incentives.</p> \n <p><strong>READ MORE </strong></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/new-car-release-dates\"><strong>Complete list of new cars in 2020</strong></a></p> \n <p><a href=\"http://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/best-cars/top-10-best-electric-cars\"><strong>Top 10 best electric cars 2020</strong></a></p> \n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Sep 2020 09:22:46 +0000","feedId":13379,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"0d1eb3290fc486a8fb94baa5f633c959","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/new_electric_cars_2019_0.jpg?itok=F7zdjITp":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn13@2020_4/2020/09/05/08-50-44-993_e20493c050467467.webp","https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/1vwid3_0.jpg?itok=-7XAjkft":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn30@2020_2/2020/09/05/08-50-47-432_67f580783fac4491.webp","https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/_max0195-edit-edit.jpg?itok=ueLfDLl1":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn93@2020_1/2020/09/05/08-50-47-366_cdfb7e1cde6cf8a2.webp","https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/volvo_xc40_bev_front.jpg?itok=XyrTWwmH":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn34@2020_2/2020/09/05/08-50-47-775_cf077bc27160f533.webp","https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/audi_q4_etron_2626j.jpg?itok=iNEq18vv":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn1@2020_6/2020/09/05/08-50-46-785_d5708eb67400c0b9.webp","https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/model_y_front_34_blue_1.jpg?itok=XJuJ_qzH":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn44@2020_4/2020/09/05/08-50-46-242_521185a1768d4e46.webp","https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/94-rivian-r1t-reveal-static-front_0.jpg?itok=fSJrEFHN":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn66@2020_2/2020/09/05/08-50-47-129_e25c7a6c5bf930c0.webp","https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/new_500_5.jpg?itok=azgZbG1I":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn64@2020_4/2020/09/05/08-50-48-069_da6db242474340cc.webp","https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/86-ford-mustang-mach-e-2020-fd-otr-front_0.jpg?itok=gsx2xAKN":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn100@2020_2/2020/09/05/08-50-46-164_a79879075a3b459c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295843550},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","title":"New-look Hyundai Kona gains N Line trim, mild-hybrid options","link":"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/new-look-hyundai-kona-gains-n-line-trim-mild-hybrid-options","description":"<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/new-look-hyundai-kona-gains-n-line-trim-mild-hybrid-options\"><img src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/all-new_kona_n_line_4.jpg?itok=YiVwMJlt\" width=\"190\" height=\"125\" alt=\"\" /></a> Crossover's facelift brings overhauled front end, eco-boosting tech and performance-inspired range-topper \n<div class=\"iframe-container-www-youtube-com\"> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-reviews/hyundai\">Hyundai</a> has revamped its <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/hyundai/kona\">Kona</a> line-up for 2021, ushering in a new look inside and out, mild-hybrid technology and a performance-inspired N Line range-topper.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>The updated car is told apart primarily by its heavily redesigned front end, which incorporates wider LED daytime-running lights, an extended bonnet, a new grille design and a contrasting silver skid plate.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>The side profile is more familiar, but the rear end has been updated with new brake light designs and a contrasting lower bumper to match the front. Overall, the new Kona is 40mm longer than the outgoing car, which Hyundai claims gives it “a more sleek and dynamic look”.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>Inside, the Kona gains an electronic handbrake, ambient lighting, coloured speaker and vent surrounds, and a raft of new colour and material options.</p> \n <p>Alongside the visual tweaks comes a new N Line trim level inspired by the brand’s<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/hyundai/i30-n\"> N performance offshoot</a>. It does away with the standard car’s contrasting cladding in favour of an aerodynamically enhancing bodykit, and gains a distinctive mesh air intake design above the front grille.</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"596\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/all-new_kona_n_line_1.jpg?itok=nCa7f49Y\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>As well as bespoke wheel designs, the N Line receives a contrasting rear diffuser and a dual-exit sports exhaust, while the predominantly black interior features contrasting red stitching, metal pedals and N logos throughout.</p> \n <p>The Kona retains its range-topping 1.6-litre petrol engine, uprated from 175bhp to 195bhp&nbsp;and available with two- or four-wheel drive, but the same-sized diesel option is now equipped with 48V mild-hybrid functionality as standard for enhanced efficiency. It can be paired with a seven-speed automatic or Hyundai’s new Intelligent Manual Transmission.</p> \n <p>The entry-level 1.0-litre petrol engine can also be optionally equipped with mild-hybrid technology, while the Kona Hybrid continues to combine a 1.6-litre petrol engine with a front-mounted electric motor to produce 139bhp.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>The model also promises improved ride quality and refinement over its predecessor, gaining a retuned suspension set-up, improved tyres and a recalibrated steering system.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>Prices will be announced before the new Kona arrives in showrooms later this year, with the plug-in hybrid option following in 2021.

It led Aston’s change to modern construction methods and it’s a timeless shape that has matured beautifully over its 20-year life.</p> \n <p>However, there were always things the designer simply didn’t like: the old-tech lights, the lower lamps he inherited from <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/used-car-buying-guides/aston-martin-db7-used-car-buying-guide\">the DB7 V12</a>, the mirrors, the chromework, the “timid” wheels, the too-narrow tracks that didn’t quite fill the arches, and the nose and tail designs that he felt needed “more teeth”. Most of all, he was disappointed with the interior; the design theme was decent but the execution was less about craftsmanship than using existing facilities to get cars out of the door.</p> \n <p>All of which is why Callum last year revealed, after he <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/industry/ian-callum-leaves-jaguar-after-20-years-design-director\">moved on from a distinguished 20-year career as the head of Jaguar design</a>, that the first project for the new design business he promptly launched would be a batch of 25 revised Vanquishes. They would be produced at a new studio in Warwick and be backed by the Swiss R-Reforged group that makes a speciality of high-quality, bespoke products of all kinds – not just cars.</p> \n <p>Now the building of Callum Vanquishes has begun. The details of the interior revisions, trim options and the definitive chassis and engine specifications have now all been decided by Callum and Adam Donfrancesco, the project’s head of engineering. At the Warwick headquarters a couple of weeks ago, the pair of them offered us a socially distanced meeting, a car viewing and an exclusive drive.</p> \n <p>“We’ve made a grand total of 350 changes,” Callum says, “introducing a level of craftsmanship you simply can’t get in normal production cars – even supercars. The idea is to chase even the smallest details. Only the panelwork remains the same. Our idea is to build a show car for every customer.”</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/98-callum-aston-martin-vanquish-25-fd-hero-side.jpg?itok=dfhkbq3k\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>When you approach the 2020 Vanquish, its quality hits you immediately. The lustre of the paint, the richness of the black chrome window surrounds, the new stance on more prominent wheels… they all modernise it. “I’m 20 years older than when I did this first,” says Callum, “and quite a lot has happened in the meantime. Life and fashion are different now. When the chance came to reconsider the car, I could see immediately what it needed.”</p> \n <p>The 5.9-litre Aston V12 engine gets light modifications (as well as a superb set of specially machined air intake stacks for beauty reasons) so that it now produces 580bhp – an extra 60bhp. Buyers can opt for a six-speed manual or conventional eight-speed automatic gearbox, or stick with the original car’s six-speed automated manual. Despite the bad publicity, some prefer that.</p> \n <p>Underneath, as a result of 20,000 miles of extensive testing, the car’s suspension has been rebushed and retuned with new springs, anti-roll bars and Bilstein dampers so that it rides 10mm lower and gets the best performance from Donfrancesco’s preferred Michelin Pilot Sport tyres. Even the steering wheel is stripped and machined to give a rim shape that Callum feels is more appropriate, and to reduce the diameter slightly, before being retrimmed.</p> \n <p>Such painstaking work isn’t cheap: buyers will pay around £450,000 if they bring their own car, preferably a Vanquish S (worth around £100,000). Alternatively, the team will find a suitable car on the market. The 25-strong batch is already half sold, even before most prospects have even seen a complete car, boding well for a successful completion.</p> \n <p>We spent two hours in Callum’s test car, a six-speed manual. The interior’s architecture is easily recognisable, but every surface gets a quality boost and a large range of textures and colours is now available. The seats are completely redesigned and mounted lower – something the original car badly needed. One fascinating feature is the tasteful use of what’s dubbed ‘Callum abstract tartan’ – a theme likely to be used in future creations. There’s a removable Bremont pocket watch mounted on the dashboard, too, and a custom Mulberry luggage set for the boot.</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/95-callum-aston-martin-vanquish-25-fd-steering-wheel.jpg?itok=CaRaUIXH\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>As soon as you start to drive, it’s apparent the car has near-bottomless reserves of torque and power. Its V12 sounds quite different from that of the original Vanquish, courtesy of a re-engineered exhaust system that emits four distinct but harmonising sounds at once: treble and bass lines, a classic rustle from the valve gear and a faint, refined whine from the camshaft drive system. Also, a new exhaust box forms part of the large and effective underbody diffuser.</p> \n <p>Callum and Donfrancesco say the idea is to enhance the grand touring capabilities and driving quality of the Vanquish, and that’s most definitely what they’ve achieved. The engine isn’t obtrusive until it’s really pulling (which it can rarely do on a public road) and always sounds wonderful.</p> \n <p>The car rides flat and firm and has much better turn-in and grip than before, thanks to its modern hardware. It stops beautifully, too, using Aston’s latest-specification – and large – carbon-ceramic brakes.</p> \n <p>However, two things really stand out for me from the dynamic package. One is the new excellence of the steering, whose impressive precision and deliberate effort levels are now far more appropriate and deliver a whole new level of sophistication. The upshot is a much more directionally stable car.</p> \n <p>The other is the ride quality: flat, controlled and beautifully damped, accompanied by a refreshing lack of tyre noise, because so much work has been done to suppress the original obtrusive road roar. In all, the twin aims of enhancing driver reward and grand touring ability have both been impressively achieved.</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/90-callum-aston-martin-vanquish-25-fd-otr-front.jpg?itok=xzEooA1_\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>Callum and his friends are distinctly coy about what they might do next. After all, at their level of detail, this run of modified Vanquishes will take many months to complete.

Like the 3008’s, it comprises a frameless grille that expands across the front, is connected to the bumper by fins and is flanked by the brand’s new fang-shaped daytime running lights.</p> \n <p>The model number has also been applied to the leading edge of the bonnet for the first time, with gloss black side scoops, painted tread plates and redesigned headlights rounding off the styling tweaks.</p> \n <p>LED headlights and brake lights&nbsp;are now fitted as standard across the range, with the rear ones now covered by a smoked panel that extends across the bootlid.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>Inside, the 5008 gains Peugeot’s new i-Cockpit interior layout, comprising a 10.0in infotainment touchscreen, ‘piano key’ physical controls for essential functions and a customisable 12.3in digital gauge cluster that uses ‘normally black’ technology to offer higher-quality readouts than in the current car.&nbsp;</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"596\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/peugeot_5008_2009styp_033.jpg?itok=Dv2FoX8N\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>Wireless phone charging, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are fitted at all trim levels and the facelift&nbsp;brings three new USB sockets.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>A drive mode selector is now standard on 5008 models equipped with an automatic gearbox, allowing drivers to choose between Normal, Sport and Eco. Driver aids – including night vision, adaptive cruise control, lane position assist, automatic emergency braking and an upgraded traffic sign recognition function – are also now standard fitments.</p> \n <p>As before, the 5008 can be specified with a choice of two petrol and two diesel engines, with power outputs ranging from 128bhp to 178bhp. The entry-level 1.2-litre three-cylinder petrol engine and 1.5-litre four-cylinder diesel can be specified with a six-speed manual gearbox or eight-speed automatic. The 1.6-litre four-cylinder petrol and 2.0-litre diesel are&nbsp;automatic only.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>Three trim levels are available: Active, Allure and GT. Each can be upgraded with a bespoke ‘pack’ that brings additional equipment and styling changes. Entry-level Active trim, for example, features 17in aluminium wheels, hands-free start and dual-zone air conditioning, with the Allure Pack adding electrically folding mirrors, a front parking aid and a 180deg reversing camera.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>Prices will be confirmed nearer to the model's launch&nbsp;towards the end of 2020 but can be expected to mark a slight increase on the 5008's current £28,980 starting price.&nbsp;</p> \n <p><strong>Read more</strong></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/peugeot-3008-receives-restyle-and-new-phev-option-2021\"><strong>Peugeot 3008 receives restyle and new PHEV option for 2021​</strong></a></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/peugeot/208\"><strong>Peugeot 208 review</strong></a></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/peugeot/5008/first-drives/peugeot-5008-long-term-review\"><strong>Peugeot 5008 long-term review</strong></a></p> \n <p><span class=\"wysiwyg-embed\"></span></p> \n <iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vzx9uFsztlo\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n <p></p> \n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Sep 2020 02:01:24 +0000","feedId":13379,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"ee2245d106594d1d920835a1db4356db","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/peugeot_5008_2009rc_008.jpg?itok=BPDA2SmK":null,"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/peugeot_5008_2009styp_033.jpg?itok=Dv2FoX8N":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn5@2020_5/2020/09/05/08-50-46-903_8c7a1c1d4cf5ff06.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295843550},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","title":"Driving the secret cars of Toyota's heritage collection","link":"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/driving-secret-cars-toyotas-heritage-collection","description":"<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/driving-secret-cars-toyotas-heritage-collection\"><img src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/30-toyota-and-lexus-heritage-fleet.jpg?itok=JWc8ppwp\" width=\"190\" height=\"125\" alt=\"Toyota and Lexus heritage fleet\" title=\"Toyota and Lexus heritage fleet\" /></a>\n<blockquote class=\"image-field-caption\">\n  The heritage fleet contains plenty of interesting and rare metal, including Toyota's first UK car\n</blockquote> Toyota and Lexus's UK heritage fleet is quite awesome and includes a 1994 RAV4 and original Lexus LFA \n<div class=\"iframe-container-www-youtube-com\"> \n <p>Cast your mind back, if you’re able, to the year 1994. May, to be precise. Manchester United have smashed Chelsea 4-0 in the FA Cup final, the Channel Tunnel has opened to great international fanfare and, of importance to car fans worldwide, <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-reviews/toyota\">Toyota</a> has launched one of its boldest models in living memory: the <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/toyota/rav4\">RAV4</a>.</p> \n <p>A curvy, quirky 4x4 designed more with surfers than soldiers in mind? Sacrilege to fans of the straight-edged, utilitarian <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/jeep/wrangler\">Jeep Wrangler</a>, <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/new-land-rover-defender-2019\">Land Rover Defender</a> and even <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/used-cars/used-car-buying-guide-toyota-land-cruiser\">Toyota’s own Land Cruiser</a>. But the RAV4 wasn’t designed for them; it was made for young people who liked surfing, hiking and climbing, and it laid the foundations for the modern crossover – a vehicle class that’s at once the most popular and most polarising on the market.</p> \n <p>All of which goes some way to explaining why a blue short-wheelbase example, specified in lowly GS trim, currently takes pride of place in Toyota UK’s heritage fleet, when prices for even the most immaculate, top-rung RAV4s are some way south of the £6000 barrier. Fresh from a thorough and by all accounts arduous restoration, this example’s pristine exterior belies its 135,000-mile odometer reading.</p> \n <p>The first time Autocar drove the RAV4 on UK soil was in a 1994 twin test alongside a <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/history-ford-rs-pictures\">Ford Escort RS2000</a> hot hatchback. A curious choice of contender, it seems, but here were two compact family runarounds, each with four-wheel drive and sporting aspirations. And where the Escort had the edge in outright power, the RAV4 pipped it in the lightweight stakes by around 65kg. And crucially, let’s not forget, when the RAV4 arrived, there was no<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/nissan/juke-2010-2019\"> Nissan Juke</a>, <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/ford/puma\">Ford Puma</a> or <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/skoda/karoq\">Skoda Karoq</a> to benchmark it against.</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/29-toyota-rav-4.jpg?itok=lAYfl8j5\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>Despite the odd pairing, this was a highly anticipated face-off; hot hatchbacks in the vein of the RS2000 had become almost impossible to insure for the average driver, while conventional off-roaders such as the <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/jeep/wrangler\">Wrangler</a> and <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/land-rover/discovery\">Land Rover Discovery</a> were simply too cumbersome and thirsty for everyday road usage.</p> \n <p>A new niche had to be explored, and so came the RAV4, essentially sitting between the two segments, providing a happy medium between usability, fun and affordability. It wasn’t particularly quick, granted, but a proven 0-62mph time of 8.8sec in our test was enough to embarrass the rally-honed <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/ford/escort\">Escort</a>, and allowing its driver to see over hedges and tackle the steepest of speed bumps without inviting costly bodywork repairs was a welcome bonus.</p> \n <p>Get behind the wheel now and you soon find that this curvy little 4x4’s connotations of pace and poise are faint at best. Compared with today’s crop of genuinely sporty compact SUVs, powered as they are by buzzy turbo triples or torquey diesel lumps, the RAV4’s naturally aspirated 2.0-litre engine feels a bit gutless, and the thrumming noise it makes at idle is rather more reminiscent of barns than beaches.</p> \n <p>Climb up through the gears, however, and it’s plain to see where the RAV4’s enduring appeal lies. Even on empty, flat and generally untroubling suburban streets, it inspires a confidence that’s often missing from today’s diminutive runarounds, which aren’t so disparate in terms of footprint.</p> \n <p>Potholes, kerbs and cobbles are hardly a challenging test for any 4x4, but the sense of solidity in the RAV4 is pervasive and hints at the all-terrain ability that set this car aside from its contemporary competitors and arguably even its spiritual descendants. No wonder around 90% of all RAV4s ever built are still roadworthy.</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"599\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/26-toyota-mr2.jpg?itok=JXOnMEt1\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>The cabin isn’t exactly inspiring by today’s standards, dominated as it is by grey plastic, black vinyl and hefty manual controls, but there’s a certain charm to be found in its honesty and, without sliding into nostalgic cliché, it’s far more intuitively laid out than the majority of newer examples.</p> \n <p>That lack of pretention, coupled with the RAV4’s enduring popularity, means that, despite the novelty of driving what is essentially a museum exhibit on public roads, no one stops and stares, bombards us with questions when we stop or rushes to snap a picture for Instagram. This is the ideal quasi-classic car for introverts: simple, affordable and subtle.</p> \n <p>Back in the flattering light of <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-reviews/toyota\">Toyota’s</a> workshop and with its fresh paint polished to within an inch of its life, it’s clear just how much time and effort has been devoted to saving N897 VHN. Once the previous owner’s self-applied plastic wheel arch trims were removed to uncover near-fatal amounts of corrosion, it became obvious this was to be more than a spit-and-polish clean-up job.</p> \n <p>In a saga more befitting a priceless 1960s <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-reviews/lamborghini\">Lamborghini</a>, this RAV4’s recommissioning turned into a full-bore restoration, with the team even going so far as to buy a donor car for the sole purpose of removing its entire roof, their own car having been fitted with a leaky, non-factory-specification aftermarket sunroof.</p> \n <p>But the RAV4 isn’t the only artefact in Toyota’s workshop-cum-museum that’s worth gawping at, and it’s certainly not the car that gets the most attention. Nestled at the back of a nondescript warehouse in Sussex are some of Toyota’s and Lexus’s most important, acclaimed and popular models, kept so that they can be rolled out for big events and magazine features such as this.</p> \n <p>Behind a row of 2020 <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/toyota-tweaks-corollas-looks\">Corollas</a>, <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/first-drives/toyota-c-hr-long-term-review\">C-HRs</a> and <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/toyota/camry\">Camrys</a>, we discover proper bedroom-wall-worthy classics, including an original MR2 sports car and a legendary rear-wheel-drive <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/industry/toyota-launches-new-heritage-division-reproduced-supra-parts\">Corolla AE86 </a>– the thinking man’s drift weapon. Full-time press fleet technician Mike Croft doesn’t hesitate in choosing the latter as his pick of the bunch. “There aren’t many of these about, especially in this sort of condition,” he says. “There are a lot of imports, rather than genuine UK cars like this one.”</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/22-lexus-lfa.jpg?itok=cP4C58n8\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>This comes from a man who was once one of just five technicians in Europe trained to work on <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/lexus/lfa/first-drives/lexus-lfa\">Lexus’s ultra-exclusive LFA hypercar</a> – an example of which sits just metres away, well out of range of door dings and dropped spanners.</p> \n <p>The 11-year-old LFA has firmly established itself as one of the most spine-tingling supercars of all time. Its 4.8-litre V10 engine revs up to its 9400rpm limit so quickly that an analogue tachometer wouldn’t be able to keep up. Its bodywork is made of carbonfibre composite and it took nearly a decade to develop.</p> \n <p>But Croft isn’t too fazed by its reputation. “Bits of it are different,” he says. “It’s got a torque tube rather than a propshaft, so the engine and clutch are at the front and the gearbox at the back. But generally, it just needs servicing and it holds up really well, even on the track.”</p> \n <p>We dare not move the LFA from its clearly designated parking spot to see for ourselves, but a quick blip of the throttle is evidence enough that this is something pretty special even by supercar standards.</p> \n <p>Croft says the oldest car in the collection, an immaculate 1966 <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/advice/coronavirus-what-motorists-need-know\">Corona</a>, is equally trouble-free. Pleasingly unmodified, save for the addition of a modern stereo (a boon on longer trips, which it still undertakes from time to time), it sits between a <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/toyota/yaris-grmn\">Yaris GRMN</a>, kept on following the hot supermini’s relatively recent media launch, and a wackily restyled <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/toyota/aygo\">Aygo</a> city car, aptly called <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/toyota/aygo/first-drives/toyota-aygo-crazy\">Crazy</a> – as the ‘graffiti’ adorned across its widened flanks suggests.</p> \n <p>Crazy is what happens when you remove the rear seats from your boggo runabout, replace them with a 200bhp turbocharged motor, bolt on a rear wing from a genuine Champ Car and install a limited-slip differential… at the rear. Forget the regular Aygo’s future classic potential; this is nothing less than a rare display of lunacy from one of the industry’s more reputedly ‘sane’ companies. It thoroughly deserves a spot in the history books.</p> \n <p>As does, you could argue, the rally-ready first-generation <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/toyota/prius\">Prius</a> that’s halfway through a thorough refresh on the other side of the workshop. Created in 2002 to demonstrate the reliability of what was then a completely newfangled powertrain, this stripped-out eco warrior took part in the arduous Midnight Sun to Red Sea rally from Sweden to Jordan in 2002, and it didn’t do too badly, in spite of its electrified innards’ heft.</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"599\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/24-mike-croft-and-felix-page.jpg?itok=DNOM867N\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>Stickered up and with a spartan interior, it’s a far cry from the Prius that took you home from your last night out, and it played a pivotal role in the model’s early success. Hybrid technology has come a long way since, but this is yet another example of how even some of seemingly the most mundane and mainstream cars will enjoy a long-lasting legacy.</p> \n <p>Even more unexpected is the newest addition to Toyota’s treasure trove: a 2001 <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/toyota/yaris\">Yaris</a> that’s unassuming in the extreme – until you take a closer look at its odometer. Yes, it really has covered just 149 miles since it left the showroom almost two decades ago. The story goes that it was bought in Ireland, clipped the garage door when it arrived at the new owner’s home, was then repaired and has been dry-stored ever since.</p> \n <p>To all intents and purposes, it’s a brand new car – even the original tyres are present and correct – and it has now been given a permanent home here among the Toyota and <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-reviews/lexus\">Lexus</a> greats.</p> \n <p>Should we have to justify the ‘classic’ status of some of these cars? Certainly there will be dissenters who argue that budget runarounds are disposable, and let’s not pretend a base-spec city car could hold its own at a concours d’élégance. But these cars have done far more for mass mobility than the <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/electrified-aston-martin-db6-driving-future-proof-classic\">Aston Martin DB6</a>,<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/%C2%A352m-ferrari-250-gto-becomes-most-expensive-car-ever-sold\"> Ferrari 250 GTO</a> or <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/mclaren/f1-1992-1998\">McLaren F1</a> ever did and are therefore surely deserving of some sort of commemoration.</p> \n <p>Croft sums it up pretty concisely in describing how new members of the fleet are selected. “The criteria are: very good condition, low mileage or something that’s a bit rare,” he says. “If you can get all of that, perfect.”</p> \n <p>With hypercars, track toys and even the hilarious one-off <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-video/video-toyota-hilux-bruiser-vs-110-tamiya-bruiser-rc-road-showdown\">Hilux Bruiser pick-up</a> truck on its roster, this heritage fleet is living proof that automotive history is worth not only preserving but driving as well.</p> \n <p><strong>Meeting a hero: the original MR2</strong></p> \n <p>Squat, compact, angular and resplendent as this example is in Super Red, it’s easy to see why the <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/used-car-buying-guides/investment-cars-less-%C2%A310000-used-car-buying-guide\">Mk1 Toyota MR2</a> is nicknamed the baby <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-reviews/ferrari\">Ferrari</a>. Back away and squint and it could almost be an <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/ferrari/f40-1987-1992\">F40</a>.</p> \n <p>Mounted amidships is a naturally aspirated 1.6-litre four-cylinder engine borrowed from the <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/toyota/corolla-touring-sports/interior\">contemporary Corolla</a>, which calls upon 127bhp and 97lb ft to send this 1030kg two-seat coupé from 0-62mph in 8.5sec – competitive for its time (1984 to 1989).</p> \n <p>Crashes and corrosion have diminished the MR2’s number over the past three decades, so it cuts a somewhat unfamiliar figure out on public roads. That’s fortunate, because if it weren’t for other road users staring, there’s every chance it could vanish under the wheels of a passing lorry. Vulnerability somewhat overrides the sense of fun around town, so sweeping B-roads provide the best opportunity for seeing if this car has stood the test of time.</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/18-toyota-mr2_0.jpg?itok=5DRbt6__\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>Affordable sports cars have come a long way since 1987, so a factory-spec MR2 is unlikely to be your track-day weapon of choice. Nor will it show many of today’s normal cars a clean pair of heels out on the road.</p> \n <p>But, that being said, its low ride height, point-and-shoot handling and the throaty growl of its twin-cam motor, not to mention its near-7000rpm redline, offer enjoyment on a different level. This is no longer a competitive sports car, so it doesn’t need to be driven like one. On most roads in the UK, at least, you’re guaranteed to have more fun than in any <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-reviews/lamborghini\">Lamborghini</a> or <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-reviews/pagani\">Pagani</a>, and without attracting quite so much unwanted attention from the authorities. Or crashing.</p> \n <p>However, the non-assisted steering is shockingly heavy for a car with such a light front end, your rearward visibility is sub-par at best and the luggage capacity is poor.

I’d like to find the engine ahead of me and the driven wheels behind. That engine should have more than four cylinders and power the rear wheels through a manual gearbox. And the car should be slender, so it has more of its own side of the road on which to play. Fully independent suspension and disc brakes are, of course, a must, too.What I’ve just described to you is a 1960s Jaguar E-Type. But were you to find such a car, even if its condition reflected that in which it left the factory all those years ago, it would likely be charming on such a road, but not very good. It would be quite slow to gain speed and even slower, relatively, to lose it. It would wobble about over the humps and crests, and if you really gave it the beans, there’s a decent chance it would break.But imagine an E-Type designed today to that outline specification, but with modern tolerances, metallurgy and an attention to detail many hundreds of times greater than that enjoyed by a normal production car like a standard E-Type. If you did, and your mind was unusually fertile, you might just come up with this, the Eagle Lightweight GT.You may know Eagle and some of its more extraordinary E-Type-themed creations of the past few years. Well, this is the most extraordinary of all: a car costing over £800,000, with a waiting list of at least 18 months, during which 8500 man hours will be lovingly devoted to its creation. And all that only after Eagle has sourced you a suitable donor vehicle.&nbsp;You can't supply your own,&nbsp;because too many have turned out to be in even worse condition than was thought.","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 23:01:23 +0000","feedId":13379,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"9d0551e3f673164aa275f73ab1c2c9a7","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/1-eagle-lightweight-gt-2020-uk-fd-hero-front.jpg?itok=JmS2_Szr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn57@2020_1/2020/09/05/08-50-47-237_ebdcbe808718ad2e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295843550},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","title":"New Jeep Wrangler 4xe plug-in hybrid packs 370bhp ","link":"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/new-jeep-wrangler-4xe-plug-hybrid-packs-370bhp","description":"<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/new-jeep-wrangler-4xe-plug-hybrid-packs-370bhp\"><img src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/jp021_011wr.jpg?itok=MYZQ-MdL\" width=\"190\" height=\"125\" alt=\"2020 Jeep Wrangler 4xe - front\" title=\"2020 Jeep Wrangler 4xe - front\" /></a> Electrified Wrangler will be the UK's most powerful version and is capable of a 25-mile electric range \n<div class=\"iframe-container-www-youtube-com\"> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-reviews/jeep\">Jeep</a> has introduced a new plug-in hybrid version of its <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/jeep/wrangler\">Wrangler off-roader</a>, launching globally in early 2021 with 370bhp and up to 25 miles of electric-only range.</p> \n <p>The new Wrangler 4xe joins <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/jeep-renegade-4xe-phev-full-production-details-released\">hybrid versions of the Renegade </a>and <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/jeep/compass\">Compass</a> SUVs, revealed earlier this year and set for a UK launch in the coming months, as <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/hybrids-lead-jeeps-green-future-first-evs-follow\">Jeep gears up to electrify its entire model line-up</a> in the coming years.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>The electrified Wrangler is described as the most “technically advanced and eco-friendly” iteration of the iconic 4x4 yet produced and is said to offer enhanced usability, both on&nbsp;and off road, over the standard car.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>The new model’s electrified powertrain combines a 2.0-litre turbocharged four-cylinder petrol engine with a 400V, 17kWh battery pack that recuperates energy from a belt-integrated starter/generator under deceleration and can power a pair of electric motors, one mounted in front of the engine and the other just forward of the gearbox. The battery can also be replenished&nbsp;via a conventional charging port located on the front left wing.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>Like the non-electrified Wrangler, four-wheel drive features, with power sent from the combustion motor to both axles through an eight-speed automatic gearbox.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>The Wrangler 4xe’s combined 370bhp output represents a 102bhp increase over the most potent model currently available in the UK and its 470lb ft torque output is a 59% increase.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>The battery pack is mounted underneath the rear seat for optimal protection from the elements, while preserving the standard car’s interior dimensions, and is cooled using the Wrangler’s air conditioning refrigerant. With comprehensive weatherproofing around all new electrical components, the Wrangler 4xe can match the non-electrified car’s 30in wading depth.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>Three drive modes are available: Hybrid, which uses the combustion and electric motors in conjunction; Electric, which shuts out the combustion motor until the battery’s charge is depleted; and eSave, which uses the petrol engine exclusively. A new ‘Eco Coaching’ display allows drivers to monitor power flow and optimise use of regenerative braking, schedule charge times and view driving history.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>A ‘Max Regen’ function can be used to optimise electrical energy generation, using ‘more assertive’ regenerative braking.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>Jeep claims that the “seamless integration of electric power into the 4x4 drivetrain elevates the Wrangler 4xe to new levels of off-road performance”. Instant torque in electric mode allows for a “more precise and controlled driving experience for climbing and crawling”, while conserving fuel and minimising noise.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>Three trim levels are available. Entry-level 4xe and mid-range Sahara trims are equipped with full-time four-wheel drive, a two-speed transfer case and heavy-duty Dana 44 axles. The top-range Rubicon model brings an upgraded Rock-Track 4x4 system, axle lockers, improved articulation and a front sway bar disconnect for improved suspension travel.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>Styling across the Wrangler 4xe line-up is nearly identical to that of the standard car, but blue tow hooks, badging and interior elements mark it out as the hybrid car.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>Jeep boss Christian Meunier said: “We are committed to make Jeep the greenest SUV brand. The electrification of the Jeep line-up will allow commuters to travel solely on electric power, delivering an efficient and fun on-road experience and offering an ability to enjoy even more Jeep capability off road in nearly complete silence.”</p> \n <p>Prices for the new Wrangler 4xe hybrid are yet to be confirmed, but it is expected to be priced in line with the current Rubicon range-topper, available from around £51,000.&nbsp;</p> \n <p><strong>Read more</strong></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/new-jeep-grand-wagoneer-concept-previews-premium-suv-2021\"><strong>New Jeep Grand Wagoneer concept previews premium SUV for 2021</strong></a></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/jeep-renegade-4xe-phev-full-production-details-released\"><strong>Jeep Renegade 4xe PHEV: full production details released​</strong></a></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/best-cars/top-10-best-hybrid-suvs\"><strong>Top 10 best hybrid SUVs 2020​</strong></a></p> \n <p><span class=\"wysiwyg-embed\"></span></p> \n <iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vzx9uFsztlo\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n <p></p> \n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Sep 2020 14:01:24 +0000","feedId":13379,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"cc0ece585e41644737a52a2057278035","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/jp021_011wr.jpg?itok=MYZQ-MdL":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn51@2020_5/2020/09/05/08-50-46-146_098fdc875d61d99f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295843550},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","title":"New Jeep Grand Wagoneer concept previews 2021 luxury SUV","link":"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/new-jeep-grand-wagoneer-concept-previews-2021-luxury-suv","description":"<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/new-jeep-grand-wagoneer-concept-previews-2021-luxury-suv\"><img src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/2022-jeep-grand-wagoneer-concept-16.jpg?itok=YoEXVdGx\" width=\"190\" height=\"125\" alt=\"2020 Jeep Grand Wagoneer concept - front\" title=\"2020 Jeep Grand Wagoneer concept - front\" /></a> Wagoneer nameplate revived for family of premium SUVs, topped by tech-heavy Range Rover rival \n<div class=\"iframe-container-www-youtube-com\"> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-reviews/jeep\">Jeep</a> is reviving the storied Wagoneer nameplate for a new family of premium SUVs and has previewed the range-topping Grand Wagoneer with a bold new concept that blends modern styling cues with nods to the iconic original car.</p> \n <p>The first Wagoneer – launched in 1962 - is <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/slideshow/how-jeeps-wagoneer-became-original-luxury-suv\">widely recognised as an early pioneer of the premium SUV segment</a>&nbsp;and Jeep said “its return allows us to expand to a much more premium arena with new levels of design detail and advanced safety and technology features”.</p> \n <p>The firm claims the Grand Wagoneer concept was designed with a dual focus on modernity and authenticity and “encapsulates the future of the ultimate premium SUV”. When it is&nbsp;launched in 2021, the Grand Wagoneer will supersede the <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/jeep/grand-cherokee\">Grand Cherokee </a>as Jeep’s flagship model and compete with more upmarket models, including the <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/land-rover/range-rover\">Range Rover</a> and <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/bmw/x5\">BMW X5</a>. It's not currently destined for the UK or Europe, however.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>The production car will be available with a choice of three four-wheel drive systems, independent front and rear suspension and Jeep’s Quadra-Lift air suspension, hinting that off-road capability remains a priority despite the luxury shift.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>Technical details remain unconfirmed, but the Grand Wagoneer concept features a plug-in hybrid powertrain, likely closely matched to that of the new <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/jeep-renegade-4xe-phev-full-production-details-released\">Renegade and Wrangler 4xe PHEVs</a>.&nbsp;</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"597\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/2022-jeep-grand-wagoneer-concept-15.jpg?itok=nEuTY4QS\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>Although the production design is tipped to&nbsp;be toned down slightly, the concept gives a good idea of what to expect from the Grand Wagoneer.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>Elements such as the modernised interpretation of Jeep’s trademark seven-vent front grille, for example, will probably&nbsp;be carried over wholesale. Although familiar from models such as the Wrangler, Renegade and Gladiator, the intake has been updated with black trim accents and latticework inserts and is framed by a new LED signature light design, which is said to emphasise the car’s width.</p> \n <p>The concept also features LED projector headlights surrounded by genuine teak wood - a detail unlikely to make its way to production - in reference to the original Wagoneer’s wooden side panelling. Prevalent front tow hooks and a chunky black aluminium skid plate hint at its off-road capability.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>The Grand Wagoneer concept features trapezoidal wheel arches like Jeep’s production cars but has 24in aluminium wheels, which - as is often the way with concept cars - will be downsized for showrooms. The copper-finished badges on the doors, bearing a new font&nbsp;designed specifically for the concept, will likely make production, though.&nbsp;</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"596\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/2022-jeep-grand-wagoneer-concept-rear-motion.jpg?itok=KoaUnPq4\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>Also likely to feature on the production car are the concept’s wraparound LED rear light clusters, subtle rear diffuser, roof rails and panoramic sunroof.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>The Grand Wagoneer’s interior will offer a seven-seat layout for the first time in the model’s history&nbsp;and marks a radical shift away from the firm’s customarily utilitarian cabin design language.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>Large windows, together with the full-length glass roof, offer comprehensive all-round visibility. Glass has also been used throughout the cabin itself as it’s a “sustainable, fully recyclable material that provides environmental benefits and is made of an abundant natural raw material”, according to Jeep.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>A black glass trim element runs the width of the concept’s dashboard and aluminium has been used for the dashboard support, speaker surrounds and gearstick. In a further nod to the model’s heritage, wood inlays feature on the instrument display and door panels.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>Additional sustainable materials used on the concept include Dinamica microfibre suede for the headliner, recycled ‘Thrive’ carpets and ‘PUR’ synthetic upholstery on the seats, doors, console and instrument panel.</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"596\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/2022-jeep-grand-wagoneer-concept-front-row-broad.jpg?itok=-M96r4bL\" width=\"900\" />&nbsp;</p> \n <p>The instrument panel itself is dominated by four large digital displays spanning a total of 45in: a 12.3in digital instrument display, a 12.1in central infotainment touchscreen, a 10.25in climate control touchscreen panel and a 10.25in touchscreen mounted directly in front of the passenger seat.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>The second-row passengers also each get their own 10.1in infotainment touchscreen, with access to another 10.25in climate control touchscreen. The car’s infotainment system runs on Fiat Chrysler Automobiles’ latest-generation, Android-based Uconnect 5 software, which is claimed to run five times faster than that used by current production cars.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>The concept’s 23-speaker, 24-channel audio system was developed by home audio brand McIntosh - making its automotive debut here - and is finished in the same aluminium and gloss black design as its existing products.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>Christian Meunier, global president of the Jeep brand, said: \"With the electrification of each Jeep nameplate coming in the next few years, and the reintroduction of Wagoneer, we are quickly expanding into new segments and more premium space.&nbsp;“Wagoneer is unquestionably rooted in the legendary Jeep brand and its unmatched heritage of leading capability, authenticity and freedom, and its return allows us to expand to a much more premium arena with new levels of design detail, and advanced safety and technology features.\"</p> \n <p>He added: “The new Grand Wagoneer Concept is our vision of what a modern expression of this timeless icon can be, and hints at how we will redefine and recreate the benchmark premium SUV.”</p> \n <p><strong>Read more</strong></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/slideshow/how-jeeps-wagoneer-became-original-luxury-suv\"><strong>How Jeep's Wagoneer became the original luxury SUV​</strong></a></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/jeep-renegade-4xe-phev-full-production-details-released\"><strong>Jeep Renegade 4xe PHEV: full production details released​</strong></a></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/hybrids-lead-jeeps-green-future-first-evs-follow\"><strong>Hybrids lead Jeep's green future, with first EVs to follow​</strong></a></p> \n <p><span class=\"wysiwyg-embed\"></span></p> \n <iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vzx9uFsztlo\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n <p></p> \n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Sep 2020 13:43:47 +0000","feedId":13379,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"0a868badea5eb7688da28be1b4b634e6","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/2022-jeep-grand-wagoneer-concept-16.jpg?itok=YoEXVdGx":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn75@2020_6/2020/09/05/08-50-46-468_7e896c1112444b1a.webp","https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/2022-jeep-grand-wagoneer-concept-15.jpg?itok=nEuTY4QS":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn68@2020_1/2020/09/05/08-50-46-287_98d0d556931e0165.webp","https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/2022-jeep-grand-wagoneer-concept-rear-motion.jpg?itok=KoaUnPq4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn71@2020_3/2020/09/05/08-50-46-328_bb43a97e04b5c662.webp","https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/2022-jeep-grand-wagoneer-concept-front-row-broad.jpg?itok=-M96r4bL":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn77@2020_3/2020/09/05/08-50-45-063_92261022c326dd17.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295843550},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","title":"Toyota Aygo JBL Edition packs upgraded sound system","link":"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/toyota-aygo-jbl-edition-packs-upgraded-sound-system","description":"<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/toyota-aygo-jbl-edition-packs-upgraded-sound-system\"><img src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/10-toyota-aygo-jbl-edition.jpg?itok=L5SqKQAC\" width=\"190\" height=\"125\" alt=\"Toyota Aygo JBL Edition\" title=\"Toyota Aygo JBL Edition\" /></a> Special-edition city car gets 600W audio set-up claimed to create a “live gig feel” \n<div class=\"iframe-container-www-youtube-com\"> \n <p>Toyota has released a special edition of its <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/toyota/aygo\">Aygo</a> city car that sports upgraded cabin speakers and a grey and orange exterior.</p> \n <p>Called JBL Edition, this latest iteration of the Aygo focuses on \"audio excellence\", according to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-reviews/toyota\">Toyota</a>, and features&nbsp;the most powerful and sophisticated sound system yet in an Aygo.</p> \n <p>The new set-up comprises two 225mm high-frequency tweeters installed on top of the Aygo’s instrument panel, two 150mm full-range speakers at the bottom of the doors and a 160mm subwoofer located in the car’s spare wheel well.</p> \n <p>Channelled through a bus-less amplifier, the system offers a total of 600W of sound power.

While other car makers, such as <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-reviews/skoda\">Skoda</a>, have <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/skoda-axes-citigo-city-car\">pulled away from the segment</a>, Toyota recently confirmed that <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/new-toyota-aygo-be-designed-developed-and-built-europe\">the next-generation Aygo will be designed, developed and built in Europe</a>.</p> \n <p>Executive vice-president of Toyota Europe Matt Harrison said the current Aygo is a “profitable business equation for us\".</p> \n <p>He added: “I understand other manufacturers have not been able to make a successful business out of [the] A-segment and, with increased technologies, they only see it getting worse.

They have come a long way over the years, too, so any lingering visions you may have of crushed Coke cans can pretty much be dismissed.</p> \n <p>The best, if your budget can stretch to it, is<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/volkswagen/up\"> the Volkswagen Up</a>. It can be fairly nippy, especially if you find one like we did with the 89bhp 1.0-litre turbo engine. This turns the Up into a decent performer, meaning you don’t have to fork out £11,000 or more for the GTI version if your commute includes some out-of-town stretches.</p> \n <p>The Up is a relatively practical proposition, too, with plenty of room both front and rear. It can seat only four, but that’s okay, since you would be getting very intimate with those either side of you if you tried sitting in the middle of most city cars.</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/9-volkswagen-up.jpg?itok=_o2c5QRk\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>There’s also a deep boot (with even room for a spare wheel), so you could park up, pull out a Brompton bike and ride that last bit to the office.</p> \n <p>Splashing out for the more powerful engine means you’ll be getting into a better-specified car, since it was only available in top-spec High Up (such as our lurid yellow 2017 example with 63,200 miles) or Beats Up. Both will have air-con, alloy wheels and electrically adjustable door mirrors as standard, but the High Up comes with heated seats for those cold winter mornings, while a Beats Up model has an upgraded sound system in the form of a 300W Beats stereo. That will allow you to proudly sing along to your favourite tunes. Try doing that on the train…</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/8-skoda-citigo.jpg?itok=72hqF8iY\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/skoda/citigo-2012-2019\">Skoda Citigo</a>, £3695:</strong> As you would expect, the Citigo is the sensible choice, lacking the classy touches that lift the Up’s interior and the Mii’s sportier suspension.

True, it shared its 2.0-litre turbo engine with other Volkswagen Group cars, but the four-wheel drive system needed to handle 228bhp necessitated an entirely different multi-link rear suspension set-up and a new rear floorpan. This meant some versions pushed £30,000, which is no doubt why the S1 is far rarer than <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/volkswagen/golf-gti\">the Volkswagen Golf GTI.</a> However, this should count in this diminutive rocket’s favour in future.</p> \n <p><strong>Clash of the classifieds</strong></p> \n <p><strong>Brief:</strong> I would like a sporty, BTCC-style toy for £5000, please.</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/2-alfa-romeo-33.jpg?itok=kbUOzkI5\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/slideshow/treasures-alfa-romeo-museum-firm-turns-110\">Alfa Romeo 33</a>, £2995</strong></p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/1-vauxhall-insignia.jpg?itok=8V1xNBLg\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/vauxhall/insignia-grand-sport\">Vauxhall Insignia 2.0 Turbo SRi</a>, £3499</strong></p> \n <p><strong>Felix Page: </strong>Prices for the <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/used-car-buying-guides/btcc-heroes-family-hatchback-money-used-car-buying-guide\">Alfa Romeo 155</a>, which actually took part in the British Touring Car Championship, have climbed out of your reach, so how about this similarly styled but smaller and rarer 33? Okay, its 1.5-litre boxer engine won’t set your world alight, but this is a solid and well-kept candidate for conversion into a track toy. Swap in the later 1.7-litre 16-valve lump, strip out the interior and invest in some trick chassis hardware. Max, you appear to have accidentally chosen a minicab.</p> \n <p><strong>Max Adams:</strong> That’s the whole point of the BTCC, Felix. You’re supposed to race a boring family car, which describes my 2009 Vauxhall Insignia perfectly. It also meets the 2.0-litre engine size restriction and has two turbos for a creditable 217bhp. Plus, at £3499, you have £1500 left for the brake and suspension upgrades necessary for repeated weekend track action.</p> \n <p><strong>FP: </strong>Hmm, and then I suppose you can do some airport runs afterwards to pay for new tyres? My 1993 car has a cloverleaf on its side, and that signals performance pedigree that you can’t just buy. I can’t imagine Nicola Larini at the helm of a <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-reviews/vauxhall\">Vauxhall</a>.</p> \n <p><strong>MA: </strong>A cloverleaf, you say? Perhaps they should have washed it before taking the photos. Oh, wait, I think I’ve misunderstood: I doubt the factory stuck on that badge, sir.

Remarkable, isn’t it? I’m humble enough to admit it’s unlikely to be for any Hemingway-aping qualities of the author, but rather an example of just how much interest there is in the wider car-searching internet world in all things electrified, and company car tax-friendly motors such as this 330e.</p> \n <p>The 330e’s arrival couldn’t have been better timed. The company car tax bands were completely rewritten in April in favour of electric cars and plug-in hybrids. As a result, the 330e’s CO2 rating of 32g/km and electric-only range of 35 miles attract a benefit-in-kind (BIK) rate of just 10%, a saving of £958 per year for a 40% taxpayer over the previous tax year. Meanwhile, the old company car stalwart, the 320d, attracts a 27% BIK rate. Not much of a decision to make, then, for the company car buyers who hoover up the majority of 3 Series sales. (About 35,000 3 Series are sold a year in the UK, around six in 10 to fleet buyers, and almost all 330es go to fleets.) And nothing we’ve found in living with one for the past few months should deter a company car driver from making this their 3 of choice.</p> \n <p>At this point, it’s worth clarifying that for a private buyer, the higher initial cost of the 330e over petrol and diesel 3 Series makes it a questionable purchase over the likes of the 320i and 320d. Intriguingly, though, <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-reviews/bmw\">BMW</a> says the more potent petrol versions like <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/bmw/3-series/first-drives/bmw-3-series-m340i-xdrive-2019-review\">the M340i</a> do particularly well with private 3 Series buyers, which is always nice to hear.</p> \n <p>But for those company car drivers, we found the disadvantages over the 320d are tiny and far outweighed by the gains. Fitting the 330e’s 12kWh battery behind the rear seats does rob some boot space and shrinks the fuel tank from 59 to 40 litres. This means you’ll fill up more frequently when the combined range (just under 30 electric miles in the real world and then about 350-400 miles from the petrol tank) is used. And the extra weight of the hybrid system takes a touch off the 3 Series’ outstanding dynamic prowess, but it remains class leading in this regard.</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/3-bmw-330e-2020-lt-nose.jpg?itok=1aN4h_Va\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>Those gains, then – of which the chief one is the multifaceted hybrid drivetrain. You could, of course, just get the 330e purely for tax reasons and leave the charging cable in the cellophane wrap in the boot, but that’s not cool. Besides, there’s real pleasure to be had from the quiet, refined brilliance of driving around solely on electric power.</p> \n <p>And we did a lot of that. Of the 6203 miles we travelled in the 330e, 2892 were solely on electric power. That’s higher than I thought I’d do and I can recall many journeys when just five more miles of range would have returned me to the charger without having turned the engine on.</p> \n <p>Before you know what happened in March, I was commuting to the office for 28 miles each way most days, and I could charge at either end. Cold weather could push the range closer to 20 than 30 miles, but commutes were mostly engine free. On resumption of driving after the car was furloughed on the driveway for a couple of months, most of my miles became solely electric while working from home. In fact, I’ve put petrol in it only three times since March, and one of those was a splash and dash.</p> \n <p>When the charge runs out, the switch to petrol power is seamless. You can cruise along as happily as in any other 3 Series, and you’ll get about 42mpg on a long, electric-free run like this. Combined economy over its time with us between the two power sources has been an indicated 76mpg.</p> \n <p>Numbers-wise, a full charge of the battery cost me £1.30. So ignoring the fact that I was charging at work for free at the start of the year, let’s say I paid for all those charges and got an average of 25 miles from a full charge. That means those 2892 electric miles cost me just £150.38. The petrol cost me £474.74. Let’s say you did the same miles in a 320d and got 50mpg: those same miles would cost you £704.99. So you’re not just saving on tax, but on running costs, too, if – and it’s a big if – you have the ability to charge at home and work, and not all your journeys run into triple-digit mileages pounding up and down the country every day.</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/13-bmw-330e-2020-lt-otr-side.jpg?itok=Ldzvy_jj\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>As mentioned, the extra weight over a non-hybrid 3 Series takes a percentage point or two off the handling, and more off the secondary ride, particularly at the rear over speed bumps, although the large, 19in alloys and low-profile run-flat tyres of our fully loaded M Sport test car also contribute to that. This is a case of less is more when speccing your 330e and it’s also worth knowing that, unlike the 330i and 330d, the 330e in this range-topping M Sport trim will only come on run-flats from the factory and you have to have SE Pro to get non-run-flat 17s. Yet dynamically, as our recent 4.5- star road test confirmed, it beats all plug-in hybrid saloon rivals and most other executive saloons besides.</p> \n <p>I’d consider myself a good target market for a plug-in hybrid: I drive for work, do frequent small trips to make full use of the electric power, can charge at home and work, and do weekly-or-so longer trips to dip into the fuel tank. And in the 330e, we’ve found the best of the lot.</p> \n <p><strong>Second Opinion</strong> </p> \n <p>I drove the 330e only a few times, but we always seemed to encounter conditions where it could show it strengths: lovely steering, perfect handling balance and excellent body control when you press on. I’d not been so familiar with recent smaller BMWs when it arrived, so it was great to discover the marque’s reputation for special driving machines was well and truly intact. </p> \n <p><strong>Steve Cropley</strong></p> \n <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/bmw/3-series/long-term-reviews/bmw-3-series-330e-2020-long-term-review#Back\">Back to the top</a></strong></p> \n <p><strong>Love it:</strong></p> \n <p><strong>Refinement </strong>This is one quiet, calm and relaxing car to drive, yet still with a serious dynamic edge, too.</p> \n <p><strong>Performance </strong>Select the XtraBoost driving mode for the full 289bhp and fairly devastating real-world pace.</p> \n <p><strong>Infotainment </strong>Retaining physical buttons and controllers over a touchscreen is welcome: the 3 Series has no peers.</p> \n <p><strong>Loathe it:</strong></p> \n <p><strong>Small boot </strong>Battery robs about 25% of usable space over a non-hybrid 3.

Easing lockdown restrictions by allowing us to drive places for exercise has opened up a life of greater excitement for our dog in particular. She had run out of lamp posts to sniff around the block and can now be transported by BMW to sniff other lamp posts a bit further away.</p> \n <p>The 330e started first time (not sure why I was surprised; why wouldn’t it?) and, after some checks, all seemed safe, drivable and exactly as I’d left it, right down to the amount of battery left in the hybrid system, which impressively had not dropped at all in that time.</p> \n <p>Driving again was a quite remarkable experience. You’re suddenly so much more aware of everything. All the senses are stirred in a way they’d come nowhere close to in two months of nothing more than walking pace. It was almost spiritual, as strange as that sounds, in rediscovering just how joyful and liberating the simple act of driving can be. Every steering input, touch of the pedals, even flick of the indicator brought a refreshing return to normality. Funny the things you miss. What’s that saying? You don’t know what you’ve got till it’s gone?</p> \n <p>In the 330e, it was like making first impressions all over again. In the default mode of electric-only driving when there’s charge in the battery, I’d forgotten just how much torque there is. I’d forgotten how big and squidgy the steering wheel is and how good the steering feels. I don’t remember sitting as low (too many SUVs ingrained in the subconscious, probably) but loved the fact that my bum was close to the ground.</p> \n <p>I also loved how empty the roads were. The lockdown, along with an enforced period of home working, has put many driving-related things into perspective: chiefly, just what is the point of the rush hour, that twice-daily nuisance that blights our roads? Driving traffic-free on roads out of town that are normally so congested was about as much fun as I’ve had in 30mph suburbia, simply because I was able to make unobstructed progress.</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/img_4779.jpg?itok=6gCR6FhX\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>After a few local trips, we ventured further afield, dog in tow, to a quiet part of the south coast. (Don’t worry, Daily Mail: not all of us sit on Bournemouth beach.) I thought a greyhound and a saloon wouldn’t be the best match, but stuff the rear footwells with cushions, lay a mat over the top and there’s plenty of space. She seemed happy enough.</p> \n <p>The longer drive showed even more of the 330e’s all-round appeal: when the battery runs out, the petrol engine takes over. The range of the car is a real boon and, as detailed previously, if you do enough short journeys and can charge it often, you can get close to four figures out of a tank, as I have. You can also do stints of two hours or more behind the wheel and not be in the slightest bit of discomfort, even not having done a long drive for so long.</p> \n <p>Driving, then. Quite fun, isn’t it? Oh, how we’ve missed you. And speaking of things to miss, if you’ll excuse the indulgence, a former resident of these pages in 2014-2015 has remained on my driveway ever since, after I took on the ownership: a Mini Cooper. Even now, it still feels like a baby BMW in its usability yet with those fun, famed Mini dynamics. But now it’s time to say goodbye to it once and for all because, by the time you read this, it will have been replaced by <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/ford/fiesta\">a Ford Fiesta</a> to park next to the 330e each night. Just as the Mini has given many years of happy motoring, the 330e feels like the car to do just the same.</p> \n <p><strong>Love it:</strong></p> \n <p><strong>Driving </strong>Yep, that’s it: just driving. And to have the pleasure of doing so in a 3 Series makes it all the better.</p> \n <p><strong>Loathe it:</strong></p> \n <p><strong>small boot </strong>I’ve grumbled about this before, but I’d forgotten just what a weird shape (long and thin) and how limiting the 330e’s boot is.</p> \n <p> <img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/img_4783.jpg?itok=DIq6nuFG\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p><strong>Mileage: 5397</strong></p> \n <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/bmw/3-series/long-term-reviews/bmw-3-series-330e-2020-long-term-review#Back\">Back to the top</a></strong></p> \n <p><a id=\"Month 3\" name=\"Month 3\"></a></p> \n <h3>Live with a BMW 330e: Month 3</h3> \n <p><strong>Our colourful car is the exception - 20 May 2020</strong></p> \n <p>Funny what you notice when you’ve got more time on your hands to look at cars rather than drive them. The latest news from 330e lockdown land concerns colour. Stick with me… Some 60% of new cars sold in this country last year were grey, white or black. How dreary. Our 330e, with its Sunset Orange hue, wasn’t one of them. Just when and why did Brits get so unadventurous with car colours? But then I started noticing other 3 Series, and monochrome seems an exception rather than a rule. Blue, red and, yes, orange like mine: brightly coloured 3 Series seem to be more common than the dull ones. Or maybe they just blended in with all the others on the road. Just me?</p> \n <p><strong>Mileage: 5104</strong></p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/_dsc5520.jpg?itok=QmbwpGvl\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/bmw/3-series/long-term-reviews/bmw-3-series-330e-2020-long-term-review#Back\">Back to the top</a></strong></p> \n <p><strong>Even when it’s not going anywhere, our plug-in hybrid has a fascinating story to tell - 6 May 2020</strong></p> \n <p>The keenest-eyed readers will have noticed that the mileage reading hasn’t nudged at all since the last update, because not even a short drive to Tesco is in order for your correspondent when living opposite a very well-stocked small shop, its excellent range of products including this very magazine…</p> \n <p>Yet the 330e’s current dormancy has allowed for plenty of number crunching and reflections on what we’ve learned about this most fascinating of 3 Series now the 5000-mile milestone on the odometer has come up. Chiefly, the 330e’s continued kindness to your wallet and why it can make a lot of financial sense in running costs as well as in saving tax for company car buyers.</p> \n <p>As we said right at the very start of these reports, plug-in hybrids should not be seen as the right choice for everyone. Those who do big miles will still want a diesel and private buyers who do fewer miles a petrol, but fleet buyers who don’t travel the length and breadth of the country and can charge either at home or work – or ideally both – will see a big benefit not only in tax bills but in fuel costs, too.</p> \n <p>So that latter way has proven for us. Of those 5103 miles, the first 792 were done before BMW handed us the keys. But of the 4311 miles in our ownership, 2254 have been done solely on electric power, so just over half in total. That’s because I can charge at home and work, and my commute of about 28 miles each way is almost exactly in line with the 330e’s real-world battery range.</p> \n <p>I’m doing (or rather was doing) longer journeys that rely mainly on petrol power on average about once every five to seven days, which has meant infrequent trips to the fuel station. Even with the smaller petrol tank (40 litres in the 330e, compared with 60 litres in non-plug-in hybrid 3 Series), I’m getting about 400 miles from that tank on pure petrol power.</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/img_3169.jpg?itok=lNhiihTg\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>So you’re looking at about 800 miles between fills with my combined petrol and electric usage (the record being as high as 1100 miles when I didn’t venture too far off the commute one fortnight), compared with the 627 miles between fills we got from the previous-generation 320d that was in our ownership from 2016 to 2017.</p> \n <p>That 320d averaged just under 50mpg in its time with us, which compares with the combined 76.5mpg being shown on the 330e’s trip computer in its time with us so far. Many company car drivers would be happy with the two-thirds cost saving in tax of a 330e over a 320d but, again with the caveat of being able to charge for as long as you can as frequently as you can, we’re finding that there is even greater overall efficiency to be had, as well as fewer visits to the fuel station needed, saving more time and money.</p> \n <p>And if all that charging sounds a chore, surprisingly it isn’t: it simply becomes a habit and takes no more than 30 seconds at the beginning or end of a journey. Admittedly, dragging big awkward cables off the ground on a cold wet morning isn’t the most premium thing in the world, but get into the pre-conditioned cabin (toasty warm in the winter, nice cool air-con in the summer) and pull away in silence while enjoying that instant torque under your right foot and you’ll not even be bothered by that after a short while, either.</p> \n <p><strong>Love it:</strong></p> \n <p><strong>The 3 Series’ looks </strong>It’s not the greatest 3 Series yet seen, but it’s got plenty on BMW’s other recent range additions.</p> \n <p><strong>Loathe it:</strong></p> \n <p><strong>Static presence </strong>I miss driving it.

Which is familiar, of course, from the 330e. One bit in particular struck a chord: the approval of the rotary controller and shortcut buttons that make “the system that much easier to operate while on the move”. The more miles I do in the 330e (not too many right now, admittedly), the more that praise rings true. It’s so much faster, more intuitive and safer to use the controller than any touchscreen. The tide is turning somewhat against touchscreens and how much of a distraction they can be by taking your eyes off the road. BMW already has the answer.</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/bmw_330e.jpg?itok=ExpULNVY\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p><strong>Mileage: 5103</strong></p> \n <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/bmw/3-series/long-term-reviews/bmw-3-series-330e-2020-long-term-review#Back\">Back to the top</a></strong></p> \n <p><a id=\"Month 2\" name=\"Month 2\"></a></p> \n <h3>Life with a BMW 330e: Month 2</h3> \n <p><strong>Our 3 Series is proving both environmentally and driver friendly - 8 April 2020</strong></p> \n <p>While SUVs may seem to be taking over the world, when you look at the sales charts and the traffic on our roads, the BMW 3 Series is still showing just how important and relevant saloon cars are.</p> \n <p>As I’m discovering after recent extended stints in many an SUV, driving a saloon makes you feel so much more involved in the drive. There’s something about sitting low with your bum on the floor and having your legs near-horizontal that allows you to become really immersed in the experience. Things just come easily and with an air of familiarity. And no saloon does it better than the 3 Series, whether it’s this plug-in hybrid 330e or any other version.</p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-reviews/bmw\">BMW now offers far more SUVs</a> than it does saloons, but the relevance and significance of the 3 Series is as strong as ever. “A typical 3 Series year in the UK is 35,000 units, and volumes have stayed stable even as <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/bmw/x3\">the X3</a> and <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/bmw/x4\">X4</a> have risen,” says BMW UK’s James Thompson, the product manager for all models with a 3 or 4 in their name. “The 3 Series is as important as ever, and buyers have stayed with it.”</p> \n <p>For many buyers, it’s not just the quality of the car that attracts. The dominance of SUVs is felt mainly in the private retail sector (which makes up 43% of new car sales in the UK) but, in the fleet market (55% of sales), it’s saloons and other ‘low’ cars that continue to appeal, due to their lower CO2 rating.</p> \n <p>“The corporate world is still dominated by saloons and estates, not SUVs,” says Thompson. “The CO2 is lower and most fleets won’t put you on the list if you’re over 130g/km.”</p> \n <p>The 3 Series sales are split 40% to retail, 60% to the corporate sector. While CO2 rules are changing so much of the car world as we know it, they’re also ensuring that such a well-loved bodystyle as the saloon can continue to survive and thrive.</p> \n <p><strong>Mileage: 5102</strong></p> \n <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/bmw/3-series/long-term-reviews/bmw-3-series-330e-2020-long-term-review#Back\">Back to the top</a></strong></p> \n <p><strong>Boot takes a hit - 1 April 2020</strong></p>  \n <p>Having both an electric-only range and a fuel tank of substance means that something has to give in terms of packaging. It’s easy enough in an SUV, with extra room in the floor, but not so in a saloon like the 3 Series. So it’s boot space that suffers, fitting only a couple of weekend bags for two humans and a dog and all the wires for charging the battery.</p> \n <p><strong>Mileage: 4612</strong></p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/bmw_330e_boot_space.jpg?itok=6KXdGIQG\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/bmw/3-series/long-term-reviews/bmw-3-series-330e-2020-long-term-review#Back\">Back to the top</a></strong></p> \n <p><strong>Our plug-in hybrid saloon is great to drive but tricky to operate - 25 March 2020</strong></p> \n <p>So what is it actually like to drive? You’ll forgive me for only getting to answer this question now, in the third meaty report on the 330e. So rarely has a car needed so much scene-setting and prep, first to find out if it can actually be used as its maker intended, and second to learn how to use it yourself. Clearly this is nothing like the simple-to-use familiarity of having a 320d…</p> \n <p>Charging points installed, hybrid tech learned and company car tax bill calculated, and it’s onto living with the car. And for the most part, it won’t surprise you to learn that the 330e is proving much like any other 3 Series.</p> \n <p>It steers with an accuracy some bona fide sports cars can only dream of, and it is one of those cars that has the ability to make the most mundane and routine of journeys an enjoyable experience – and that’s simply down to everything the driver interacts with being engineered with the pleasure of driving in mind. That was true the last time we had a 3 Series at Autocar, <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/our-cars/bmw-320d-long-term-test-review-all-car-youd-ever-need\">a previous-generation 320d xDrive M Sport version back in 2016</a>. That car also became a firm favourite for the way it could make every drive so pleasurable. An evolutionary approach has been adopted, then – and why wouldn’t BMW, when it has such a formula licked?</p> \n <p>The one major dynamic difference you do notice is the extra weight. The 330e weighs in excess of 200kg more than an equivalent current-generation 320i, due to that electric motor plus the lithium ion battery pack under the rear seats. As such, the 330e doesn’t quite have the fleetfootedness of a 320d in its ability to change direction, yet it still feels more agile than <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/audi/a4\">an Audi A4</a>.</p> \n <p>The ride also suffers a bit on occasion, with a tendency for the impact of potholes to crash through the cabin, yet I’m not sure how much of that is down to the 19in M Sport alloys of our car. That was true also of the 2016 320d we had on similar-sized wheels, and the two cars also share the optional adaptive M Sport dampers. I’d be keen to try a 330e on smaller wheels and with the standard dampers for comparison, and find out whether the weight or the chassis set-up is to blame.</p> \n <p>So the hybrid system doesn’t do anything major to mess with the dynamics of <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/bmw/3-series\">the excellent G20-generation 3 Series</a>, which is, remember, an Autocar five-star road test car in its 320d guise. The changes are, predictably enough, found when you press your right foot to the floor.</p> \n <p>This is where it gets a bit complicated. There are so many different ways of driving the 330e and so many modes to put it in, depending on how long your journey is and how you want to drive. These are as extreme as using electric-only mode and having the power reduced to try to preserve as much battery range as possible, or as extreme as Xtraboost mode, which liberates the full 111bhp of the electric motor and the 181bhp of the 2.0-litre petrol.</p> \n <p>The point is this: everything needs a button pressed, and there’s no easy way to let the car choose. The normal mode, Hybrid, runs the battery down in the first instance to keep driving on electric power as much as possible, unless you want to save the battery for later or you have a route plumbed into the navigation system, in which case it’ll save the battery for you.

Who, I kept wondering, can be enjoying a better steering system? My answer: nobody, even at treble the money</p> \n <p><strong>Steve Cropley</strong></p> \n <p><strong>Mileage: 4093</strong></p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/7-bmw-330e-2020-lt-steering-wheel.jpg?itok=1Zd13Yo9\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/bmw/3-series/long-term-reviews/bmw-3-series-330e-2020-long-term-review#Back\">Back to the top</a></strong></p> \n <p><strong>Petrol power can still impress - 4 March 2020</strong></p> \n <p>My commutes are mostly electrically powered only, but longer trips bring the 2.0-litre petrol engine into play. At motorway speeds, it feels like any other 3 Series. It’s quiet and refined, and with a mid-range boosted by the electric motor’s torque. Oddly, the faster you go, the more economical the petrol engine becomes – up to a point. You’ll see 50mpg at 70mph running on petrol power alone.</p> \n <p><strong>Mileage: 3446</strong></p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/bmw_330e_long_term_dashboard_mpg.jpg?itok=qQRsVQCH\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/bmw/3-series/long-term-reviews/bmw-3-series-330e-2020-long-term-review#Back\">Back to the top</a></strong></p> \n <p><a id=\"Month 1\" name=\"Month 1\"></a></p> \n <p><span>Life with a BMW 330e: Month 1</span></p> \n <p><strong>Electric-only commuting is now possible in both directions – conditions permitting - 26 February 2020</strong></p> \n <p>The company car tax benefits of plug-in hybrids like the BMW 330e are such that instances of them being returned with the charging cables in the boot still in the Cellophane wrapper still occur, admits <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-reviews/bmw\">BMW</a>.</p> \n <p>But that is becoming a rarer occurrence, and in my entry for understatement of the year, you need to be charging your plug-in hybrid to get the most out of it. You could just drive it and never charge it, but then you’d be struggling to get 35mpg from a 2.0-litre petrol 3 Series with a load of extra weight you’re making no use of, plus a much smaller fuel tank that means you’ll be stopping to fill up with fuel more often anyway.</p> \n <p>With an electric-only range that sits between about 20 and 25 miles with the cold weather at this time of year (the official range is 35 miles), the 330e needs to be charged quite frequently and driven on electric power for as long as you can to really get the most out of it to save money on fuel as well as in tax.</p> \n <p>My commute is between 25 and 30 miles in each direction, depending how bad the traffic is on any given route, so I can tackle it almost entirely on electric power and feel a bit of a poster child for the effective use of a plug-in hybrid, given that the longer journeys I undertake at the weekend mean I’m also making use of the petrol engine. I’m able to be said poster child because we have the luxury of charging at work and, as I have a driveway, I can charge the car at home, too. For someone like me, plug-in hybrids are a very sensible and pragmatic solution.</p> \n <p>Getting a charging point installed at home was much more straightforward than I thought it would be and was explained to me by the BP Chargemaster fitter in electricity terminology that even my limited DIY ability allowed me to understand. I’d had my fuse box upgraded last summer, leaving a spare connection for a charging point to be hooked up to and given its own switch on the consumer unit.</p> \n <p>The BP Chargemaster Homecharge unit I went for typically costs £449, assuming there are no special requests or circumstances that deviate from what should be quite a straightforward installation.</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/bmw_330e_long_term_wall_box_install.jpg?itok=P4BmitXC\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>That figure is after a £500 grant from the government’s Office for Low Emissions Vehicles’ Electric Vehicle Homecharge Scheme. Put simply, anyone getting an electric or plug-in hybrid car can get that grant, and up to two per household are allowed should there be two qualifying cars per household. The BP Chargemaster unit is a 7kW charger (which I went for), but it can fit a 3.6kW if your property’s power isn’t sufficient.</p> \n <p>You can choose where the Homecharge unit is fitted – I went for down the side of the house – so long as an earthing rod can be fitted in the vicinity (and your car’s charging cable can reach, which in the case of the 4.5m-long cable offered in the 330e and the charging point being located on the front wing, requires reversing as close to the house as I can get).</p> \n <p>All in, installation took about two hours, and the 330e can now have its 12kWh battery fully recharged on my drive in about two and a half hours, at a cost of about £1.30 on my current electricity tariff. On that point, you can get tariffs now that give you cheaper power overnight specifically with charging your electric or plug-in hybrid car in mind.</p> \n <p>BP Chargemaster offers an app that lets you track how much you’re spending. BMW also has one that allows you to precondition the car ahead of your chosen departure time so long as it’s connected to the charger – ideal for making the cabin toasty warm and the glass frost-free on the cold winter mornings we’ve had so far.</p> \n <p>That’s now two chunky reports on the 330e and I’ve hardly said anything about actually living life with the car itself. That’s not posturing: it simply goes to show just how much there is to get used to with the car, and how much preparation is needed in advance to make sure it’s a sensible choice for you in the first place, and then know what you need to do to get the most from it as soon as it arrives. Seeds now sown.</p> \n <p><strong>Love it:</strong></p> \n <p><strong>BMW connected app </strong>Great for checking battery and fuel tank range – and turning on the climate control to defrost the car.</p> \n <p><strong>Loathe it:</strong></p> \n <p><strong>Engine cutting in </strong>Driving on electric power is so quiet and soothing that it’s a shame to be interrupted by the petrol engine.</p> \n <p><strong>Mileage: 3289</strong></p> \n <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/bmw/3-series/long-term-reviews/bmw-3-series-330e-2020-long-term-review#Back\">Back to the top</a></strong></p> \n <p><strong>Maximising range the right way - 12 February 2020</strong></p> \n <p>Early journeys show how similar the 330e is <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/bmw/3-series\">to other 3 Series</a>, yet also such a new experience. Be aware of your journey length and battery range to truly maximise efficiency. Never charge it and drive it like any other 3, and you’ll only get about 40mpg. Charge it often and you’ll cover many miles on electric power alone and average nearly 70mpg.</p> \n <p><strong>Mileage: 2999</strong></p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/17-bmw-330e-2020-lt-village.jpg?itok=jX3gpURf\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/bmw/3-series/long-term-reviews/bmw-3-series-330e-2020-long-term-review#Back\">Back to the top</a></strong></p> \n <p><strong>Welcoming the 330e to the fleet - 5th February 2020</strong></p> \n <p>The BMW 330e comes with a lot of interesting numbers. There are the impressive performance figures (288bhp, 0-62mph in 5.9sec). Plus there are the official economy and CO2 figures (176.6mpg, 36g/km). Those then feed into the 330e’s real trump card – and its imminent crowning as the best-selling <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/bmw/3-series\">3 Series</a> in the range: its impending benefit-in-kind (BIK) tax rate of just 10%.</p> \n <p>Put another way, come April it will cost a company car driver in tax around one third that of the <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/bmw/3-series/first-drives/bmw-3-series-320d-m-sport-2019-uk-review\">currently best-selling 3 Series, the 320d</a>, which, says BMW UK, the 330e will quickly usurp in sales. And all that for a car that’s significantly more powerful and which can travel on electric power alone for around 35 miles.</p> \n <p>While talk of tax bands and BIK rates is not typical Autocar fare, from April it’s about to become increasingly significant as the government launches new company car tax rules unashamedly designed to increase the sales of electric cars and plug-in hybrids.</p> \n <p>Car makers also need to sell ever-increasing numbers of these models to lower their fleet CO2 averages and avoid fines for being over the industry-wide 95g/km fleet average target. Electric cars and sub-50g/ km plug-in hybrids bring a double-whammy benefit of lowering fleet CO2 figures and qualifying for ‘super credits’ that in effect count as two sales in one, in turn allowing <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-reviews/bmw\">BMW</a> to continue making higher-polluting cars such as <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/bmw/m3\">the M3</a> without penalty.</p> \n <p>Last year some 60% of new cars sold in the UK were to fleets, compared with 48% in 2010, with private car sales dropping from 47% market share to 37% in the same period. Those numbers were mirrored across the 3 Series range, according to BMW UK’s 3 Series product manager James Thompson, further highlighting the 330e’s importance to the German brand. Some 35,000 3 Series will find homes this year, around 10,000 of which will be 330es, and 95% of those 10,000 will go to company car buyers.</p> \n <p>If your 330e arrives before the new tax year, you’ll pay either 8% or 12% BIK, depending on with which emissions standard the Treasury wants to correlate the CO2 figure. (You expected the motoring taxation policy to be clearly laid out by now?) Anyway, from 6 April it will be 10% for the plug-in BMW and 0% for pure EVs. Order one now and it won’t be with you before July anyway, so that 10% figure is the most relevant.</p> \n <p>This whole topic is one we’ll look at in our news analysis pages in detail in the coming weeks before the tax changes kick in, but take away this for now: company car buyers will be able to save serious money by switching to EVs and plug-in hybrids. And perhaps the best of the plug-in hybrid breed right now is this 330e. It aims to be the 3 Series without compromise, keeping the sporting appeal for which the saloon has always been known but with some attractive cost and economy benefits.</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/16-bmw-330e-2020-lt-charging.jpg?itok=HLCwEbAS\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>The 330e uses a 181bhp 2.0-litre petrol engine familiar from elsewhere in the 3 Series range. Mounted within its eight-speed automatic gearbox is a 67bhp electric motor (its output increases to 111bhp with an ‘Xtraboost’ function in Sport mode) that powers a 12kWh lithium ion battery. That battery lives under the rear seats, with the fuel tank moving to the boot. The 40-litre fuel tank is 20 litres smaller than that of the non-hybrid 3 Series but results in the 330e’s one key compromise: a 105-litre cut in boot capacity.</p> \n <p>The 330e is rear-wheel drive for now; <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/bmw-launches-new-330e-touring-four-wheel-drive-option\">xDrive four-wheel drive comes later this year</a>, when a Touring version will also be introduced. Being rear-wheel drive with a fully integrated electric drive unit means the BMW system is claimed to be seamless in its operation in shifting between electric and petrol power, or a combination of both, as the electric motor sits on the flywheel and isn’t powering an entirely different axle, as is the case with some hybrid systems.</p> \n <p>While driving this plug-in BMW is a straightforward process – it can be left in a simple Hybrid setting to leave the car to best decide from which source it should draw power – there are several other driving modes and many more functions to explore, all of which we’ll look at in the months ahead.</p> \n <p>While the powertrain may not be as familiar, the specification of our 330e is. M Sport remains a popular trim level for the 3 Series, and it is offered on the 330e alongside entry-level SE and Sport. On top of the M Sport trim, which brings with it the usual array of visual and dynamic sporting upgrades, we have an optional M Sport Plus package that brings bigger 19in alloys, beefier brakes, variable sport steering and, intriguingly, adaptive dampers. This is the first time adaptive dampers have been included in a package – despite typically receiving rave reviews in the media, uptake from buyers had been less than 10%.</p> \n <p>It’s rare for long-term reports like this to offer conclusions so early on, but it’s worth pointing out now that the 330e will not be suitable for all 3 Series buyers, specifically private buyers who won’t enjoy the tax benefits of company car buyers.</p> \n <p>For them, offsetting the 330e’s list price against the potential money saved in fuel will be negligible, unless nearly all journeys are within the 35-mile electric-only range, at which point you may as well just buy a <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/tesla/model-3\">Tesla Model 3</a> for very similar money – or <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/bmw/3-series/first-drives/bmw-3-series-m340i-xdrive-2019-review\">a BMW M340i</a>, as Thompson says many private buyers are doing.</p> \n <p>Not only is this our first long-term test of a hybrid 3 Series but it is also our first extended taste of a 3 Series in this G20 generation, which has already earned a five-star road test rating in 320d form. Finding out how much of that magic remains in this 330e will make for a fascinating few months to come.</p> \n <p><strong>Second Opinion</strong></p> \n <p>The 330e has been a favourite of mine since I drove a skinny-tyred Sporttrim version of the last generation. The G20 is quicker and does 20 urban miles on its battery without trying too hard. But, as with so many more modestly powered cars, smaller wheels and less grip makes for more driver appeal.</p> \n <p><strong>Matt Saunders</strong></p> \n <p><strong><a

The SMMT's new car registrations data reveals all, and we've been studying the most recent figures to find out Britain's best-selling new cars.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>The figures shown for each model&nbsp;are the most recent year-to-date sales numbers available, but it's important to note that, with just 4321 new cars sold overall in April 2020 as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, individual model sales figures have risen only modestly over the past month.&nbsp;</p> \n <h2>Best selling cars 2020</h2> \n <h3><strong>1. <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/ford/fiesta\">Ford Fiesta</a>&nbsp;- 29,891</strong></h3> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"596\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/fordfiesta.jpg?itok=Wj3X1rB0\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>It's hardly a surprise to see Ford's <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/best-cars/top-10-best-superminis\">supermini</a>&nbsp;hold on to&nbsp;the top spot, because it has been the UK's best-selling new car every year since 2009. What is surprising is that demand for it hasn't slipped following a radical line-up reshuffle last year that brought its entry-level price up by nearly £2000. Clearly, the Fiesta's ability to blend efficiency with dynamism and charm is still a winning formula for&nbsp;a large portion of UK buyers.&nbsp;</p> \n <h3><strong>2. <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/ford/focus\">Ford Focus</a>&nbsp;- 25,517</strong></h3> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"596\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/fordfocus.jpg?itok=dmkhv69x\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>There's success for the Blue Oval in the hotly contested family hatchback segment, too. When we <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/ford/focus/first-drives/ford-focus-2018-review\">tested the Focus in 2018</a>, we liked its playful chassis set-up, engaging driveline and improved ergonomics – plus points that continue to tempt buyers away from German, Spanish and Czech equivalents. Strong demand for the Focus in June helped it to overtake its VW Golf rival in the sales charts, claiming the number two spot under its Fiesta sibling.&nbsp;</p> \n <h3><strong>3.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/vauxhall/corsa\">Vauxhall Corsa&nbsp;</a>- 25,182</strong></h3> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"596\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/20-vauxhall-corsa-2020-rt-cornering-front_0.jpg?itok=Y-4t9gBz\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>The perennial runner-up to the Ford Fiesta in the supermini class finds itself in third&nbsp;place, and remains Vauxhall's best-selling model in Britain – still technically its home market.&nbsp;The arrival of the all-new PSA-developed car is sure to keep the nameplate in the top 10 best-sellers list, with a new pure-electric version bolstering its popularity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n <h3><strong>4.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/volkswagen/golf-2017-2019\">Volkswagen Golf</a>&nbsp;- 24,395</strong></h3> \n <h3><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"596\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/vw-golf-2020-0011.jpg?itok=FBy1ykdH\" width=\"900\" /></h3> \n <p>The new Golf has landed in the UK, and has a lot to live up to if it's to maintain the strong sales of its Mk7 predecessor. It's now been through the full Autocar road test, and&nbsp;showed&nbsp;that Volkswagen's uncanny ability to combine people-pleasing styling, efficient yet potent powertrains and overwhelming practicality in one affordable package is alive and well.&nbsp;</p> \n <h3><strong>5.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/mercedes-benz/a-class\">Mercedes-Benz A-Class</a>&nbsp;- 19,370</strong></h3> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"596\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/mercedesaclass_0.jpg?itok=auvby5Uu\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p><span>A surprisingly premium entry here from Mercedes, but one that makes a lot of sense when you consider the sheer variety of drivers the A-Class would suit. With petrol, diesel and now plug-in hybrid options on the roster – as well as an overwhelming array of specifications and trim levels to choose from – the A-Class has become a real people pleaser. The new plug-in hybrid A250e variant - with its 42-mile electric range and super-low tax rates for fleet buyers - is sure to be a strong-seller, too.&nbsp;</span></p> \n <h3><strong>6.&nbsp;</strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/nissan/qashqai\">Nissan Qashqai</a>&nbsp;- 18,736</strong></h3> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"596\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/nissanqashqai.jpg?itok=CU3qKyo1\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p><span>When the Qashqai arrived back in 2006, it heralded the birth of the crossover class, which&nbsp;is now the most crowded and in-demand segment in the UK. Even now, 14 years later, and with nearly 30 well-rounded opponents to fend off, Nissan's mid-sized SUV remains the king.&nbsp;</span></p> \n <h3><strong>7. <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/mini/3-door-hatch\">Mini </a>- 16,528</strong></h3> \n <h3><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"596\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/mini-cooper-s-rt-015_0.jpeg?itok=CJ408gZO\" width=\"900\" /></h3> \n <p>Strong sales in early 2020 nudged the Brit-built Mini hatch into the top ten, and straight past best-selling stalwarts like the BMW 3 Series and VW Polo. And why not? There's plenty to like about the retro-styled runabout, including a spacious, well-put-together interior and a range of engines that offer pep and frugality.&nbsp;</p> \n <h3><strong>8.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/volkswagen/polo\">Volkswagen Polo&nbsp;</a>- 14,512</strong></h3> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"596\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/vwpolo.jpg?itok=I8Q4Jz08\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>The Polo has lost some ground in the past couple of years. It was the sixth best-selling car in 2018 and in December of that year was second only to the Fiesta. The fact remains, however, that it's our favourite supermini on the market today. According to our reviewers, the Polo is&nbsp;\"at once roomier, plusher, more technology rich, more pleasant to use and more polished to drive than almost any supermini on the road\".</p> \n <h3><strong>8.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/volkswagen/tiguan\">Volkswagen Tiguan&nbsp;</a>- 14,467</strong></h3> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"596\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/vw-tiguan-road-test-2016-382_0.jpg?itok=Apmda8Jf\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>Europe's best-selling SUV holds its place in the&nbsp;UK top 10 for the second month running, showing that the firm's uncanny ability to balance build quality with affordability and good looks is not limited to the hatchback class. The facelifted model is inbound, bringing fleet-friendly&nbsp;plug-in hybrid and&nbsp;316bhp R versions, so chances are the crossover will continue to be a strong seller.</p> \n <h3><strong>10. <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/toyota/yaris\">Toyota Yaris</a> - 13,546</strong></h3> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"596\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/1-toyota-yaris-hybrid-2020-uk-fd-hero-front.jpg?itok=305t6Kq2\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>The all-new fourth-generation Yaris, revealed in October 2019, has just gone on sale in the UK. Chances are, if it offers the same value-for-money, spaciousness and build quality as&nbsp;the outgoing model, we'll continue to see Toyota's answer to the Fiesta in this list for a long while yet.&nbsp;</p> \n <p><strong>Read more</strong></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/new-car-release-dates\"><strong>New Cars 2020: what's coming this year and when?​</strong></a></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/new-electric-cars-2020-2021\"><strong>New electric cars 2020: What’s coming and when?​</strong></a></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/20-best-used-car-bargains-2020\"><strong>The 20 best used car bargains for 2020</strong></a></p> \n <p><span class=\"wysiwyg-embed\"></span></p> \n <iframe allow=\"accelerometer;

Insurance can be added as an option, with Volvo offering new customers a 30-day trial.</p> \n <p>Customers can sign up to the Care by Volvo scheme online or at one of the Swedish firm’s dealerships, and cars can also be delivered. Customers can give three months<span>’</span> notice to either switch cars or withdraw from the scheme.</p> \n <p>Conor Horne, Care by Volvo’s UK boss, said the package was designed to be “transparent, convenient and flexible”.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>He added: “It is a great way for people to access the car they want, avoiding the complexities and the long-term commitments associated with traditional car ownership.”</p> \n <p>The trial version of the scheme included the ability for subscribers to swap cars for a short period,&nbsp;for example&nbsp;enabling them to borrow a bigger car for a family holiday. That option has been dropped from the full version, because Volvo said there was limited demand for it.</p> \n <p>Horne said that he expected most of the take-up to come from new customers&nbsp;and that he didn't believe the&nbsp;subscription scheme would end traditional finance offerings. He compared it to the growth of ebooks, saying: \"The Amazon Kindle didn't kill the book, it just complemented that market.\"</p> \n <p><span>Horne added that the initial plan was for Care by Volvo to account for around 5% of its UK deliveries next year, although there's a belief that it could exceed that. T</span><span>ake-up in other countries has exceeded expectations following pandemic-induced lockdowns.</span></p> \n <p>Earlier this year, Volvo UK boss Kristian Elvefors told Autocar that the coronavirus crisis&nbsp;had accelerated a shift to digital car sales platforms&nbsp;and would be likely to have a lasting impact.</p> \n <p>“What we’ve done in terms of actions to tackle the coronavirus has essentially been two years’ worth of digital development in just eight weeks,” he said. “Despite the lockdown, we decided not to furlough many of our staff to make sure that we could keep a lot of people working on new developments that would help us keep customers interested and really help when it was time to restart.</p> \n <p>“These are trends that we’ll see going forward. We’ll definitely see more of our operations move online in the future. We’ve learned so much working digitally which is going to be game-changing.”</p> \n <p>In July, Volvo reported&nbsp;a 14.2% year-on-year sales increase globally, recording growth in the European, US and Chinese markets. Its XC40, XC60 and XC90 SUVs were by far its best-selling models, claiming a combined 72.8% of the brand's sales for the month.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>The Care by Volvo name was previously used on a more conventional leasing scheme.</p> \n <p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/industry/polestar-confirms-first-uk-showroom-will-be-west-london\"><strong>Polestar confirms first UK showroom will be in West London</strong></a></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/industry/volvo-lockdown-has-changed-car-sales-forever\"><strong>Volvo: Lockdown has changed car sales forever​</strong></a></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/industry/volvo-records-142-year-year-sales-increase-july\"><strong>Volvo records 14.2% year-on-year sales increase in July​</strong></a></p> \n <p><span class=\"wysiwyg-embed\"></span></p> \n <iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/D5SqyKOp8So\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n <p></p> \n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 09:31:24 +0000","feedId":13379,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"282067a3046895fd8df9ba3f09b6825f","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/care_by_volvo_4.jpg?itok=prtf_qXf":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn30@2020_6/2020/09/05/08-50-47-360_8f721eba3d6df81f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295843551},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","title":"UK new car registrations down 5.8% in August 2020","link":"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/industry/uk-new-car-registrations-down-58-august-2020","description":"<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/industry/uk-new-car-registrations-down-58-august-2020\"><img src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/dealership-jaguar-forcourt-sales2220w.jpg?itok=eAl-3kQc\" width=\"190\" height=\"125\" alt=\"Jaguar dealership\" title=\"Jaguar dealership\" /></a> New SMMT figures show drops in demand across all model segments but a sharp uptick in EV adoption \n<div class=\"iframe-container-www-youtube-com\"> \n <p>New figures released by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) show that new car registrations fell 5.8% year on year in August, which is&nbsp;traditionally the quietest month for sales.</p> \n <p>A total of 87,226 new cars were registered last month – more than&nbsp;5000 less than the 92,573 recorded in August 2019 –&nbsp;in the run-up to the new 70-plate being introduced at the beginning of September.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>Private car sales were down by just 699 units, at 39,833, but fleet sales recorded a more substantial decline, with a 2650-unit shortfall bringing the total to 48,593 for August.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>The SMMT also recorded declines across all model segments except superminis, with demand for specialist sports cars falling 41.9%&nbsp;and for city cars falling 64.2%.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>On the other hand, it was a bumper month for electrified vehicle sales, with plug-in hybrid demand soaring by 221.1% and registrations of battery-electric vehicles increasing by 77.6%. The SMMT adds, however, that PHEVs still accounted for only one in 30 sales, and EVs made up just 6.4% of the market in August.</p> \n <p>However, battery-electric vehicles now account for 4.9% of new car registrations year-to-date, compared with 3.8% at the end of August 2019.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>There were no significant changes to the top 10 best-selling models year-to-date list, with the <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/ford/fiesta\">Ford Fiesta</a> and <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/ford/focus\">Ford Focus</a> retaining the first and second positions respectively, followed by the <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/vauxhall/corsa\">Vauxhall Corsa</a> at number three and the<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/volkswagen/golf\"> Volkswagen Golf </a>in the fourth spot.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>The SMMT said: “In the past five years, the range of zero-emission-capable car models available in the UK has trebled to more than 80, with some 200 more in the pipeline over the coming years.</p> \n <p>“For customer demand to keep pace, at least 1.7 million new on-street charging points will need to be built by 2030, along with a long-term commitment from government to provide incentives for EV purchases.”</p> \n <p>SMMT boss Mike Hawes called the decline “disappointing” in light of<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/industry/uk-new-car-registrations-rise-first-time-2020\"> July’s promising uptick</a>&nbsp;but added that “August is typically one the new car market’s quietest months,” so “it’s important not to draw too many conclusions from these figures alone”.&nbsp;</p> \n <p><strong>Read more</strong></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/industry/uk-new-car-registrations-rise-first-time-2020\"><strong>July:&nbsp;UK new car registrations rise for the first time in 2020</strong></a></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/new-car-release-dates\"><strong>New Cars 2020: what's coming this year and when?​</strong></a></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/industry/best-selling-cars-uk\"><strong>New car registrations: Best-selling cars in the UK​</strong></a></p> \n <p><span class=\"wysiwyg-embed\"></span></p> \n <iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vzx9uFsztlo\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n <p></p> \n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 04 Sep 2020 09:21:59 +0000","feedId":13379,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"f15b07d0bcc72e4aecb217d99ffff3a8","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/dealership-jaguar-forcourt-sales2220w.jpg?itok=eAl-3kQc":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn58@2020_5/2020/09/05/08-50-44-382_e405c3dcfa441d12.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295843550},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","title":"Honda e","link":"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/honda/e","description":"<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/honda/e\"><img src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/1-honda-e-2020-rt-hero-front.jpg?itok=DJ0i9sxh\" width=\"190\" height=\"125\" alt=\"Honda e 2020 road test review - hero front\" title=\"Honda e 2020 road test review - hero front\" /></a> Honda has waited while the electric car segment has grown. Has it delayed too long? It seems a slightly strange notion, given how different the design philosophies of these two great companies have appeared to be over the years but, in launching its first really serious battery-electric vehicle, Honda has supposedly followed the example set by the world’s best-known smartphone manufacturer.According to Honda, the similarities between the new E city car and Apple’s iPhone should be readily apparent. You can be the judge of the veracity of that statement but, says Honda, both products put eye-catching design and seamless functionality in pride of place, and both do so in return for a healthy price premium.With a ground-up new design and an all-new platform, the E will spearhead Honda’s electrification strategy. And yet it’s leading that particular charge from what looks to be, in one key respect at least, a questionable position. Where many affordable mainstream EVs are now appearing with more than 200 miles of WLTP-certified range, the dinky E arrives with a comparatively meagre 136 miles of range at most.However, Honda is confident it has taken the right approach with this car, even if it has to justify its strategy by strictly defining both who the E is aimed at and how it should be used. According to the messaging, then, the E will be bought by individuals who appreciate its design and compactness to such an extent that they’re happy to pay a little more for a car they won’t be able to travel quite as far in.Has such a specialised brief ultimately made Honda’s maiden electric effort a better next-generation city car, or a worse one? Stand by to find out.The Honda E range at a glanceHonda’s two-derivative E line-up keeps it simple. Those after the most rangy and manoeuvrable E should stick with the cheaper, slightly less powerful base model (with its skinnier, economy-biased tyres).But those wanting to maximise the car’s design and tech appeal can simply opt for an Advance-spec car with a choice of 16in or 17in wheels, and with a digital rear-view mirror, premium audio, heated windscreen and automatic parking all standard.","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 04 Sep 2020 07:01:24 +0000","feedId":13379,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"352ad1c8cd4188c4a5ccafee00391fa4","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/1-honda-e-2020-rt-hero-front.jpg?itok=DJ0i9sxh":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn12@2020_1/2020/09/05/08-50-46-220_f63b2bbcf424e937.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295843550},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","title":"All-new 2021 Vauxhall Mokka: petrol and diesel options detailed","link":"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/all-new-2021-vauxhall-mokka-petrol-and-diesel-options-detailed","description":"<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/all-new-2021-vauxhall-mokka-petrol-and-diesel-options-detailed\"><img src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/vauxhall-mokka-512764.jpg?itok=WEhAIZA-\" width=\"190\" height=\"125\" alt=\"2020 Vauxhall Mokka - front\" title=\"2020 Vauxhall Mokka - front\" /></a> Pair of 1.2-litre petrol engines and a 1.5-litre diesel for Vauxhall's bold new compact crossover \n<div class=\"iframe-container-www-youtube-com\"> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-reviews/vauxhall\">Vauxhall</a> has detailed the petrol and diesel-powered variants of its radically restyled Mokka crossover, following the recent unveiling of the <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/vauxhall-mokka-overhauled-new-generation-gains-ev-model\">all-electric Mokka-e</a>.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>Sitting atop the PSA Group’s Common Modular Platform (CMP), which can accommodate both combustion and electric powertrains, the Mokka will be available with the same choice of three engines - two petrol and one diesel - as its <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/motor-shows-frankfurt-motor-show/new-peugeot-2008-and-e-2008-prices-and-specs-revealed\">Peugeot 2008 sibling</a>.</p> \n <p>The entry-level option, a 1.2-litre turbocharged three-cylinder petrol, produces 99bhp and 151lb ft. Paired exclusively with a six-speed manual gearbox, it can manage between 49.6 and 51.4mpg on the WLTP cycle, while emitting 124-128g/km of CO2, according to preliminary figures.</p> \n <p>The more potent petrol option, using the same 1.2-litre block, pushes out 134bhp&nbsp;and 170lb ft&nbsp;for a 0-62mph time of 9.2 seconds, 1.8 seconds faster than the base motor. It can be optionally specified with an eight-speed automatic gearbox, and achieves between 50.4 and 51.4mpg, emitting 123-126g/km.&nbsp;</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"596\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/vauxhall-mokka-512768.jpg?itok=o_n-1294\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>Both petrol engines are said to offer “high efficiency and lively performance”, courtesy of their low-friction design and quick-reacting turbocharger, which boosts torque from low RPMs.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>The Mokka also receives a 1.5-litre diesel option with 109bhp&nbsp;and 184lb ft. It’s available with the six-speed manual gearbox and manages 62.8-65.7mpg while emitting 114-117g/km.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>Visually identical to the electric version, the new Mokka features Vauxhall’s new ‘Vizor’ front end and is characterised by its short overhangs and widened stance compared to the outgoing Mokka X. Although its wheelbase is slightly longer than that of its predecessor, it is 12.5cm shorter overall, weighs 120kg less and - in the case of the electric version - is up to 30% stiffer.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>Inside, the compact SUV features a pair of widescreen digital displays - a 12.0in gauge cluster and 7.0in or 10.0in infotainment touchscreen - but retains separate controls for essential functions, “avoiding hazardous exploration into sub-menus”. Leather, Alcantara and standard cloth upholsteries are available, while the front seats are six-way adjustable as standard.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>Like the Mokka-e, the combustion-powered car is equipped with an array of driver assist programmes as standard, including forward collision alert, automatic emergency braking and pedestrian detection. Adaptive cruise control, intelligent LED headlights and wireless phone charging are also equipped as standard.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>For the first time, the Mokka will be available in performance-inspired SRi range-topping trim, marked out from the standard car by its gloss black front grille, chrome exterior trim, 18in two-tone alloy wheels and red side window frame.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>Pricing has yet to be confirmed, but the new Mokka can be expected to closely match its 2008 sibling. Expect a starting price of around £20,150 for the combustion car and £28,000 for the electric variant when the pair hit showrooms early next year.&nbsp;</p> \n <p><strong>Read more</strong></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/motor-shows-frankfurt-motor-show/new-peugeot-2008-and-e-2008-prices-and-specs-revealed\"><strong>New Peugeot 2008 and e-2008: prices and specs revealed​</strong></a></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/vauxhall-mokka-overhauled-new-generation-gains-ev-model\"><strong>Vauxhall Mokka overhauled for new generation, gains EV model​</strong></a></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/long-term-reviews/vauxhall-corsa-2020-long-term-review\"><strong>Vauxhall Corsa 2020 long-term review​</strong></a></p> \n <p><span class=\"wysiwyg-embed\"></span></p> \n <iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vzx9uFsztlo\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n <p></p> \n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 09:44:27 +0000","feedId":13379,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"41be59db45513010f649a25c7ab0c555","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/vauxhall-mokka-512764.jpg?itok=WEhAIZA-":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn22@2020_5/2020/09/05/08-50-44-911_f3480e66721b0ba5.jpg","https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/vauxhall-mokka-512768.jpg?itok=o_n-1294":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn18@2020_1/2020/09/05/08-50-45-302_26bc0f29957f147f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295843551},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","title":"Renault Captur E-Tech plug-in hybrid 2020 UK review","link":"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/renault/captur/first-drives/renault-captur-e-tech-plug-hybrid-2020-uk-review","description":"<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/renault/captur/first-drives/renault-captur-e-tech-plug-hybrid-2020-uk-review\"><img src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/1-renault-captur-e-tech-2020-uk-fd-hero-front.jpg?itok=ClOPA_cI\" width=\"190\" height=\"125\" alt=\"Renault Captur E-Tech PHEV 2020 UK first drive review - hero front\" title=\"Renault Captur E-Tech PHEV 2020 UK first drive review - hero front\" /></a> Electrified, plug-in hybrid version of the successful Captur could be just what Renault needs to elevate its popularity even further Renault’s electrification programme is gathering a head of steam. On the passenger car front, the all-electric Zoe supermini has been the competent and really quite pretty face of this campaign for the past decade or so; while the Kangoo ZE went on to become the best-selling commercial EV in Europe by the end of 2019. The dinky Twizy made for a fascinating support act, too.Now, though, Renault has broadened its portfolio of electrified vehicles to include powertrains that the man on the street might deem to be more accessible. So there’s a hybrid version of the Clio supermini; a new plug-in hybrid Mégane Sport Tourer estate; and this, the new Captur E-Tech PHEV.Based on the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance’s CMF-B platform, it makes use of a normally aspirated 1.6-litre four-cylinder petrol engine, which is paired with a 49kW electric motor and a smaller integrated starter-generator. These draw their energy from a smallish battery that’s housed beneath the rear passenger bench, and which has a usable capacity of 7.5kWh for a WLTP-certified electric-only range of 30 miles.Plugged into a dedicated home wallbox (which Renault currently provides free of charge via BP Chargemaster), its battery can be topped up from 0-100% capacity in around three hours. Drive is directed to the front wheels via a specially developed multi-mode dog-clutch gearbox that has six forward speeds.The system has a fairly modest combined output of 158bhp. Renault doesn’t specify a system output for torque, but individually the petrol engine develops 103lb ft at 3200rpm, while the electric motor produces 184lb ft. On paper, performance isn’t particularly electric, then; the Captur&nbsp;PHEV can accelerate from 0-62mph in 10.1sec, which is three-tenths of a second slower than the plug-in Mégane with which it shares its powertrain.","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 05:01:24 +0000","feedId":13379,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"02ca8c72c9248681623228cae47157ef","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/1-renault-captur-e-tech-2020-uk-fd-hero-front.jpg?itok=ClOPA_cI":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx24/cdn42@2020_2/2020/09/05/08-50-43-663_fd307c1b3d9db084.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295843551},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","title":"2021 Mercedes S-Class: luxury saloon reinvented with tech focus","link":"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/2021-mercedes-s-class-luxury-saloon-reinvented-tech-focus","description":"<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/2021-mercedes-s-class-luxury-saloon-reinvented-tech-focus\"><img src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/99-mercedes-benz-s-class-official-reveal-tracking-front.jpg?itok=ZJAixM-p\" width=\"190\" height=\"125\" alt=\"2021 Mercedes-Benz S-Class official reveal images - tracking front\" title=\"2021 Mercedes-Benz S-Class official reveal images - tracking front\" /></a> Luxury four-door sheds weight and gains refinement, host of new interior features and extra PHEV range \n<div class=\"iframe-container-www-youtube-com\"> \n <p>The newly revealed <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/mercedes-benz/s-class\">S-Class saloon</a> is described as the most technically advanced car that Mercedes-Benz has ever placed into series production.</p> \n <p>Set for UK delivery in early 2021, the luxurious four-door has been comprehensively re-engineered around a new body structure that’s claimed to be 60kg lighter than the old S-Class’s despite added levels of rigidity and, it’s claimed, even greater refinement.</p> \n <p>Key among the revisions to the <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/audi/a8\">Audi A8 </a>and <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/bmw/7-series\">BMW 7 Series</a> rival is a newly developed plug-in petrol-electric hybrid drivetrain. The new S580e model promises an electric range of up to 62 miles on the WLTP test cycle. That’s more than double the zero-emission range of its predecessor, the S560e.</p> \n <p>Despite a renewed focus on electrification, though, Mercedes has confirmed to Autocar that it will hold true to a tradition started in 1992 by continuing to offer the S-Class with a twin-turbocharged 6.0-litre V12 petrol engine. It will be used by a new, yet to be revealed replacement for <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/mercedes-maybach-gls-600-arrives-rival-bentley-bentayga\">the Maybach S650 flagship</a>.</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/97-mercedes-benz-s-class-official-reveal-tracking-tracking-rear.jpg?itok=B8X5TZhV\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>Bringing it in line with its key rivals, the <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-reviews/mercedes-benz\">Mercedes</a> flagship also offers buyers the choice of two optional rear-wheel steering systems, the most extreme of which provides the rear wheels with up to 10deg of steering angle and a turning circle that’s 1.9m tighter than the old car’s, at 10.9m, less than the <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/mercedes-benz/a-class\">A-Class hatchback’s</a>. The system also boosts high-speed stability as well as low-speed manoeuvrability.</p> \n <p>In a significant move, the new S-Class, codenamed W223, will be the first Mercedes model to offer level three autonomous driving capability at speeds of up to 37mph. Although not planned from the beginning of deliveries, the new Drive Pilot system, which uses lidar among a range of different sensors, will be introduced during the second half of 2021. It allows the driver to go hands-off for extended periods in high traffic density and “suitable sections of motorway”, Mercedes says, although LED lights integrated into the steering wheel prompt the driver to take control when necessary.</p> \n <p>The Drive Pilot system can be bundled with a new function called Intelligent Park Pilot. Offered in countries where legislation permits its use, it employs level four autonomous tech to allow the driver to remotely park the new S-Class from outside the car in garages with the necessary infrastructure via a smartphone app. The system can seek out usable spaces by itself and park of its own accord.</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"506\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/88-mercedes-benz-s-class-official-reveal-studio-dashboard.jpg?itok=h5i2vtW8\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>The S-Class’s reputation for cutting-edge headlight technology is boosted by an optional Digital Light function. Made up of three main LEDs that, through refraction, achieve a resolution of more than 1.3 million pixels per headlight, it allows the projection of warning symbols on to the road for added safety.</p> \n <p>A further first for the S-Class is over-the-air update capability to reduce dealer visits. Many of the developments in the new S-Class will also appear on <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/industry/mercedes-eq-s-be-flagship-%C2%A39bn-electric-model-blitz\">Mercedes’ new pure-electric EQ S</a>, aimed at competing with<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/tesla/model-s\"> the Tesla Model S</a> and forthcoming <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/motor-shows-frankfurt-motor-show/bmw-i-vision-dynamics-concept-inspired-i5-spark-new-era-i\">BMW i7</a>.</p> \n <p>The existing S-Class Coupé and Cabriolet are not due to be replaced, leaving the saloon, in both short and long-wheelbase guises, as the only S-Class bodystyle. As with the outgoing model, it will sire various <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/vehicles/mercedes-amg\">AMG</a>, Maybach and Pullman derivatives.</p> \n <p>The S-Class has undergone a thorough redesign for 2021. While the smooth surfacing, understated sculpting and flowing C-pillar treatment remain familiar from its predecessor, the new model sports a bolder-looking grille, slimmer headlights and new horizontally mounted tail-lights that extend into a bootlid that is not so different from the current CLS’s.</p> \n <p>For the first time on the S-Class, Mercedes is giving buyers a choice of door handles: conventional grip handles come as standard and new flush-fitting electric pop-out handles are among a long list of optional equipment.</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"602\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/86-mercedes-benz-s-class-official-reveal-studio-infotainment.jpg?itok=5Romnk42\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>The new S-Class is bigger than the car it replaces but not significantly so. The long-wheelbase version is 34mm longer than before, at 5255mm, with a 51mm increase in the wheelbase, at 3216mm. Width is also up by 55mm, at 1954mm, and the new car is 12mm taller, at 1503mm.</p> \n <p>Rear leg room is claimed to have risen by 24mm in the long-wheelbase model, although rear shoulder room has actually decreased by 32mm. Boot capacity is up by 20 litres to 550 litres.</p> \n <p>Despite a larger frontal area, Mercedes says, the drag co-efficient has been reduced from a previous 0.24 to a class-leading 0.22, making it one of the most aerodynamically efficient cars to enter series production.</p> \n <p>In contrast to the evolved exterior, the interior has been comprehensively redesigned with developments that will be mirrored on future Mercedes models, including the upcoming <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/2021-mercedes-benz-c-class-mule-reveals-production-design\">fifth-generation C-Class </a>due in December.</p> \n <p>Up front, there’s a new-look dashboard with substantial trim elements, including open-pore wood veneer with aluminium inlays, and four centrally mounted rectangular air vents in the upper fascia. Key features include a 12.3in digital instrument display with an optional 3D function as well as an 11.9in portrait-format central touchscreen dominating the centre console. Climate functions are incorporated into this screen.</p> \n <p>There are 27 fewer analogue controls than before, with the emphasis shifted to swipe, voice and gesture controls via a further developed MBUX operating system. An advanced new head-up display featuring augmented reality and a display area claimed to be equivalent to a 77in monitor comes as an option, as does a new 30-speaker, 1750W Burmester 4D sound system that has subwoofers in the backrests of the front seats.</p> \n <p>The rear, meanwhile, receives two optional 11.6in touchscreen displays sited in the back of the front seats, also using MBUX software, in combination with a control tablet that can be used both in and outside the car. Other key developments include a rear-seat airbag that deploys from the back of the front seats.</p> \n <p>At launch, the new S-class will be offered with two in-line six-cylinder engines – both carried over from the outgoing sixth-generation car – in an initial four-model line-up.</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/94-mercedes-benz-s-class-official-reveal-studio-side.jpg?itok=v9m7hNEb\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>A turbocharged 3.0-litre mild-hybrid petrol unit develops 362bhp in the S450 and 429bhp in the S500. There is also a turbocharged 2.9-litre diesel with 282bhp in the S350d and 325bhp (10bhp less than the model it replaces) in the S400d.</p> \n <p>The six-cylinder petrol engine benefits from electric boosting, with an extra 21bhp provided under acceleration by an integrated starter motor, together with brake energy recuperation and off-throttle coasting. The launch engines are mated to a nine-speed automatic gearbox.</p> \n <p>The S350d offers the choice of either rear-wheel drive or optional 4Matic four-wheel drive. All of the other launch models are four-wheel drive as standard. Further drivetrains will follow, including a 48V mild-hybrid version of Mercedes’ turbocharged 4.0-litre V8 500bhp in the S580. That model will be joined in 2021 by the S580e, which uses a turbocharged 3.0-litre in-line six-cylinder petrol engine and gearbox-mounted electric motor with a combined output of 510bhp and its electric range of more than 62 miles is made possible by a 28kWh lithium ion battery.</p> \n <p>The V12-powered Maybach flagship will be unveiled at the Guangzhou motor show in November, although it is rumoured to develop a similar 621bhp to the model it replaces.</p> \n <p>Two new AMG-badged models – the S63e 4Matic+ and S73e 4Matic+ – are also under final development but not scheduled for UK delivery before mid-2021. Official details are still under wraps, but Autocar can confirm both are set to run Mercedes-AMG’s twin-turbocharged 4.0-litre V8 petrol engine in combination with an electric motor mounted within the rear axle operating on a 400V system and a lithium ion battery with a capacity around 20kWh.</p> \n <p>In the S63e, the electric motor is said to develop 134bhp, giving the car a combined system output that AMG insiders put at “close to 700bhp”.</p> \n <p>The S73e, meanwhile, is set to get a 201bhp electric motor for a combined 805bhp, making it the most powerful S-Class model yet.</p> \n <p>The new S-Class is underpinned by the second-generation MRA (modular rear architecture) platform and a chassis with tracks that are lengthened by 36mm at the front and 51mm at the rear.</p> \n <p>An Air Matic air suspension with adjustable damping control comes as standard, with an E-Active Body Control suspension featuring a new Impulse Side function. It raises the vehicle body by up to 80mm when radar sensors detect an impending side impact for improved crash energy absorption in the floorpan.</p> \n <p>The new S-Class will be produced on a new line at Mercedes’ Factory 56 facility in Sindelfingen, Germany.</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"506\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/83-mercedes-benz-s-class-official-reveal-studio-rear-seats.jpg?itok=FnkeQtj3\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p><strong>Q&amp;A with Markus Schäfer, board member for Group Research and Development, Procurement and Supplier Quality</strong></p> \n <p><strong>You describe the S-Class as the most advanced car you’ve yet created. But there is loads of technology even in small cars these days. How do you differentiate and keep the S-Class relevant even with the luxury saloon market shrinking?&nbsp;</strong></p> \n <p>“The outgoing S-Class was extraordinarily strong even right up to the end of its life - remember it had no MBUX, stuff we have on our smaller cars. But we have a very loyal customer base for S-Class - extremely loyal base&nbsp;</p> \n <p>“We are extremely confident - it’s an abundance of innovation there. If you talk about S-Class it defines for me the benchmark in intelligent luxury cars.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>“We work at every angle to make it intuitive to use. We want to make it so the car really recognises you and adjusts to you so you don’t have to adjust to the car. You walk to the car, the door handles pop out - it knows its you because you’ve logged in before - it has a three-step authentication that even enables you to do payment with your car. The gesture sensors and cameras in the car can anticipate what you intend to do before the action. The car is also OTA capable, not only for the UI and the screens but also car functions. There’s plenty of computing capacity in the car so it is ready for further updates.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>“It’s cutting-edge, to be fairly honest we are working hand in hand with regulators. We are so advanced here that in some instances there is no regulation to certify the car in certain countries.&nbsp;Take the digital lights - so the lights can perform 2.6m pixels. You can play a movie in your garage with the resolution the you have.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>“So we are still working with authorities in a couple of countries to get it working and on the road. Germany has a really progressive approach so we have it legal there, but it’s different in other countries. Same with Level 3 autonomous driving, second half of next year it will be live in Germany. There are so many features - some manufacturers have some in one car but this is has everything in one place, that’s what makes it unique. “</p> \n <p><strong>We know that your petrol plug-in S-Class will offer a class-leading range. Is there a diesel plug-in planned?&nbsp;</strong></p> \n <p>“There is no diesel plug-in planned for the S-class. It’s available for example for the GLE, E-Class. Key markets for the S-Class is China, Korea and the US, it’s not predominantly a European car. Diesel is not the first choice for these countries.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>“As we have already announced there is an S-Class coming [EQS]- that’s the next drivetrain we are going to see, on the same production line [as S-Class]&nbsp; So I have to keep complexity somewhat in control, and we have to make choices. “</p> \n <p><strong>We know the S-Class Coupe and Cabriolet will not return with this model. Can you detail what the reason is for this?&nbsp;</strong></p> \n <p>“If you go back in our history maybe 15 years back and look at the number of variants we were creating, we had an expansion strategy, we wanted to make three million units annually, we wanted to conquer different markets such as China.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>“Then we came face-to-face with transformation - in our powertrains - so we were adding plug-ins, now we are adding EV powertrains, so at some point we have to cut back on our complexity. So we are going to ‘weed out’ a little bit. They are great cars, the coupe and cabriolet, but I can tell you there is in one or the other fashion something coming that will replace it. If you look at the new SL coming, I think we will have many customers of the S-Class cabriolet looking at this car...</p> \n <p>“Cabriolets are not something for China, they are not that strong anymore in the US, so we have to make some choices. So we will have S-Class: short, long [wheelbase], Maybach, which will be very differentiated from the long versions, but we have other icons that we have not paid attention to for a while such as SL. “</p> \n <p><strong>READ MORE&nbsp;</strong></p> \n <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/first-ride-2020-mercedes-benz-s-class-prototype\">First ride: 2020 Mercedes-Benz S-Class prototype</a></strong></p> \n <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/used-cars/nearly-new-buying-guide-mercedes-benz-s-class\">Nearly-new buying guide: Mercedes-Benz S-Class</a></strong></p> \n <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/2021-mercedes-benz-eqs-drops-disguise-best-look-yet\">2021 Mercedes-Benz EQS drops disguise for best look yet</a></strong></p> \n <p><span class=\"wysiwyg-embed\"></span></p> \n <iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vzx9uFsztlo\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n <p></p> \n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 17:00:46 +0000","feedId":13379,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"be22597de38003ea3268089a7a26a61d","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/99-mercedes-benz-s-class-official-reveal-tracking-front.jpg?itok=ZJAixM-p":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn57@2020_5/2020/09/05/08-50-43-669_b971953ca264bf36.webp","https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/97-mercedes-benz-s-class-official-reveal-tracking-tracking-rear.jpg?itok=B8X5TZhV":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn42@2020_2/2020/09/05/08-50-47-777_e4497b4ad9992198.webp","https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/88-mercedes-benz-s-class-official-reveal-studio-dashboard.jpg?itok=h5i2vtW8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn81@2020_6/2020/09/05/08-50-43-889_86d8d043174ee134.webp","https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/86-mercedes-benz-s-class-official-reveal-studio-infotainment.jpg?itok=5Romnk42":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn89@2020_1/2020/09/05/08-50-47-414_0612d65611dd0275.webp","https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/94-mercedes-benz-s-class-official-reveal-studio-side.jpg?itok=v9m7hNEb":null,"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/83-mercedes-benz-s-class-official-reveal-studio-rear-seats.jpg?itok=FnkeQtj3":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn36@2020_3/2020/09/05/08-50-46-196_cea9387635bed077.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295843550},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","title":"2021 Dacia Sandero officially previewed ahead of unveiling","link":"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/2021-dacia-sandero-officially-previewed-ahead-unveiling","description":"<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/2021-dacia-sandero-officially-previewed-ahead-unveiling\"><img src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/1-dacia-sandero-2021-video-clip.jpg?itok=2a0_kwi8\" width=\"190\" height=\"125\" alt=\"Dacia Sandero 2021\" title=\"Dacia Sandero 2021\" /></a> Next-generation budget supermini will have design that builds on today's model \n<div class=\"iframe-container-www-youtube-com\"> \n <p>Dacia is ramping up preparations for the unveiling of the 2021 <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/2021-dacia-sandero-value-supermini-spotted-winter-testing\">Sandero supermini</a>, beginning with an official preview video.</p> \n <p>Although it offers only a fleeting glimpse of the Sandero, the clip, combined with <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/2021-dacia-sandero-value-supermini-spotted-winter-testing\">previous spy shots</a>, gives us a good idea of what to expect when it's revealed later this month.</p> \n <p>Compared with the outgoing model, the next-generation Sandero sports an evolutionary rather than&nbsp;revolutionary appearance, with a curvier front end and a wider stance. It also appears to gain a clamshell bonnet and a higher beltline.</p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-reviews/dacia\">Dacia</a> has yet to confirm details of the new car’s powertrain, although given the Sandero will arrive after the <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/industry/analysis-how-will-car-makers-meet-new-co2-laws\">EU introduces strict new CO2 regulations in 2021</a>, there is the potential for some kind of hybrid system.</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"596\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/2021-dacia-sandero-camo-winter-3.jpg?itok=OMuGi1aI\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>Dacia's first fully electric&nbsp;car will arrive in 2021&nbsp;as a production version of<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/motor-shows-geneva-motor-show/new-dacia-suv-will-be-europes-most-affordable-ev\">the recent Spring Electric concept</a>, complementing the new Sandero.</p> \n <p>The 2021 Sandero is expected to be based on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-reviews/renault\">Renault</a>'s&nbsp;new modular CMF&nbsp;platform.&nbsp;The <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/industry/groupe-renault-sales-fall-349-first-half-2020\">Renault Group</a>,&nbsp;which owns Dacia,&nbsp;plans to have 80% of its models using this by 2022.

Its 7.3-litre V12 powerplant was stripped and rebuilt by Cosworth, with power raised from 750bhp to 836bhp and mated to a six-speed manual transmission.</p> \n <p>It uses the same inboard springs and dampers as the Vulcan&nbsp;and is fitted with Brembo carbon-ceramic brakes that Aston claims can deliver braking capability on par with a GT3 race car.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n <p>An aerodynamically optimised front splitter and rear diffuser produce 621lb ft&nbsp;of downforce at 100mph, which is more than a race-prepared <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/aston-martin/vantage\">Vantage</a> GT4.</p> \n <p>The car began life as a One-77 prototype that has been significantly overhauled over an 18-month period. It features extensive use of carbonfibre, with the entire chassis weighing less than an original One-77.</p> \n <p>The team used Aston’s muscle car era for inspiration, specifically the 1980s Vantage, and worked closely with the customer to develop the fully bespoke body. It borrowed elements from current Aston Martin models, including the rear rail light seen on the upcoming Valkyrie and vents found in the <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/aston-martin/dbx/first-drives/aston-martin-dbx-2020-uk-review\">DBX SUV</a>.</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/3000-aston-martin-victor.jpg?itok=f5Cbk4oA\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>Inside, cashmere, polished titanium and walnut materials contrast with the leather-finished racing bucket seats and four-point harnesses, exposed carbonfibre and motorsport-derived steering wheel based the Vulcan’s.</p> \n <p>According to an Aston Martin representative, the Pentland Green paint dried mere hours before the car made its public debut at the Concours of Elegance at Hampton Court Palace.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>It was unveiled to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Vantage name&nbsp;and named Victor after Victor Gauntlett, the man widely credited for reviving Aston's&nbsp;fortunes in the early 1980s.

Initial signs suggest its mainstream ambitions are well warranted \n<div class=\"iframe-container-www-youtube-com\"> \n <p>“Never before has an electric vehicle been conceived with such a global outlook.” That’s how Ralf Brandstätter, <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-reviews/volkswagen\">Volkswagen’s</a> new CEO, introduced <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/volkswagen-id-4-2021-electric-crossover\">the ID 4</a> before our first drive of a near-to-production-ready prototype – and he is nothing but bullish about its mainstream market ambitions.</p> \n <p>The second model from VW’s electric-only ID sub-brand sits in the world’s fastest-growing segment and will be built in five factories on three continents, starting at its Zwickau plant in Germany, from which right-hand-drive UK versions will begin rolling later this year. “The ID 4 will have a big impact in each of our three most important markets – Europe, China and North America,” said Brandstätter. “We see the potential for significant volumes.”</p> \n <p>As well as being key to VW’s aim to sell up to 1.5 million EVs annually by 2025, the ID 4 also forms the basis for upcoming siblings such as <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/audi-q4-sportback-e-tron-maker%E2%80%99s-seventh-ev-2021\">the Audi Q4</a>, <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/motor-shows-frankfurt-motor-show/cupra-tavascan-emotive-ev-concept-shown-frankfurt\">Cupra Tavascan</a> and <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/skoda-enyaq-iv-revealed-first-bespoke-ev-316-mile-range\">Skoda Enyaq</a>.</p> \n <p>Like <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/volkswagen/id-3\">the smaller ID 3</a>, it’s based the MEB electric car platform and will be sold with a range of power outputs in rear- and four-wheel-drive guises and two battery sizes. There are four initial rear-wheel-drive models, with a 146bhp, 168bhp, 173bhp or 201bhp motor. The lower-powered two have a 52kWh battery, the other two a 77kWh battery.</p> \n <p>A pair of four-wheel drive models will arrive in 2021. They’ll use the 77kWh battery and two electric motors – a smaller one up front and a main unit at the rear, developing a combined 262bhp or, in <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/volkswagen-id-4-suv-gains-hot-gtx-badge\">a yet to be confirmed GTX-badged range-topper</a>, 302bhp.</p> \n <p>Volkswagen says the 77kWh battery gives a WLTP range of up to 323 miles in mid-range 173bhp rear-wheel-drive guise. This compares with 301 miles for the 64kWh Hyundai Kona Electric and 336 miles for the 62kWh Telsa Model Y.</p> \n <p>Although our prototype carries light disguise, the ID 4 holds true to the look of the 2017 ID Crozz concept. It’s contemporary looking, with heavy crossover tones and unmistakable electric vehicle proportions. With a 0.26 drag co-efficient, it’s also among the most aerodynamic SUVs.</p> \n <p>VW offers two charging options. The 52kWh battery can be charged at up to 100kW, the 77kWh battery at up to 125kW. As a guide, VW says 30min of charging provides up to 199 miles on the more powerful system. In most cases, you’ll have to pay for the privilege, though. The base model supports 50kW charging as standard.</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/98-vw-id-4-prototype-drive-2020-hero-side.jpg?itok=buNn7Un_\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <h3>What's it like?</h3> \n <p>Enough figures. Time to drive. The driver’s door opens wide and you step up into the ID 4 over a high body-coloured sill. The front seats are elevated but not excessively so and the floor is completely flat up front, without any defined footwells, because the battery is within the floorpan.</p> \n <p>The multi-layer dashboard houses two displays: a 5.3in digital instrument panel and a 10.0in central infotainment screen as standard, although our prototype has an optional 12.0in unit and augmented reality head-up display.</p> \n <p>The cabin is roomy, with the greater rear leg room than in a standard-wheelbase Tiguan and excellent versatility, thanks to typical features such as a 40:20:40-split folding rear seat. The boot, despite a high-ish loading lip, is also quite commodious.</p> \n <p>Hit the starter button and twist the gear selector. One notch forward gets you the standard drive mode and two notches Battery mode, which triggers the brake energy regeneration. It’s the same controller used by the ID 3, proving straightforward from the outset. Further drive modes – Eco, Comfort, Sport and Individual – alter steering, throttle, powertrain and adaptive damping responses.</p> \n <p>We’re driving the most powerful rear-wheel-drive ID 4. With 229lb ft on tap from the moment you nudge the throttle, it is brilliantly responsive. It has instant performance and excellent traction.</p> \n <p>Once rolling along, it gathers speed in quite a determined fashion on an open throttle. To be honest, it’s probably more spirited than it needs to be up to. At a cruise, it’s quiet and relaxed, although performance begins to fade at motorway cruising speeds. VW is yet to reveal performance figures, although initial rear-wheel-drive models will be limited to 100mph.</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/92-vw-id-4-prototype-drive-2020-gk-driving.jpg?itok=_ttbrWmt\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>In standard drive mode, it coasts with a very faint hint of brake regeneration when you lift off the throttle. Battery mode’s regen means you rarely need to touch the brake pedal.</p> \n <p>Beyond the acoustic pedestrian warning, which switches off above 12mph, the powertrain is virtually silent. More noticeable is some tyre roar from the optional 235/45 R21 and 255/40 R21 Bridgestone Turanzas and wind buffeting around the door mirrors at speed.</p> \n <p>Dynamically, there’s quite a lot to like. The well-geared steering is nicely weighted and delivers a surprising amount of road feel. There’s also a 10.2m turning circle, so manoeuvrability and agility are outstanding.</p> \n <p>The chassis features MacPherson struts up front and a multi-link arrangement at the rear and it comes with optional adaptive damping control. There’s a measured rear-wheel-drive fluency to the handling, characterised by excellent lateral body control, strong grip and excellent traction in Sport mode.

The new R-Line variant tops&nbsp;the range&nbsp;at £38,255 in four-door form and £39,055 as a shooting brake.</p> \n <p>Prices for the new plug-in eHybrid variant will be revealed at a later date. That car and a&nbsp;hardcore&nbsp;R version&nbsp;are expected to arrive in early 2021.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>The <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/volkswagen/arteon\">Arteon</a> was launched in 2017 but has so far been offered in only a fastback bodystyle. The new Arteon Shooting Brake variant features a separate design from the B-pillars back, with an extended roofline, a tapered glasshouse, prominent haunches over the rear wheels and an angled tailgate.</p> \n <p>Official figures show the Shooting Brake offers 565 litres of boot space (versus 563 litres in the fastback) and 1632 litres with the seats folded (1557 litres), but <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-reviews/volkswagen\">Volkswagen</a> says that because the space above the beltline isn't included in these measurements, the Shooting Brake's load space is actually significantly larger.</p> \n <p>Both models will be launched early next year, with the R versions arriving as part of the continued range expansion of <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/industry/volkwagen-pushing-r-division-due-recent-success\">Volkswagen's R performance division</a>. They will use the fourth evolution of the company's venerable EA288 2.0-litre four-cylinder turbo petrol engine, producing 316bhp and 310lb ft, a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox and an updated version of the 4Motion four-wheel drive system.</p> \n <p>A new R Performance torque vectoring system is said to have been inspired by similar systems on racing cars. It can bias up to 100% of the motor's power output \"within miliseconds\" to either axle or any of the four wheels, making the Arteon \"perceptively more agile\",&nbsp;Volkswagen claims. Torque distribution is determined by a combination of steering angle, accelerator input, lateral acceleration, yaw rate and speed.</p> \n <p>The new Arteon eHybrid, available in both bodystyles, uses the plug-in hybrid powertrain from<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/volkswagen/passat-gte\"> the Passat GTE</a>: a 154bhp 1.4-litre four-cylinder turbo petrol engine with a 113bhp electric motor. The two units have a combined output of 215bhp, which is sent to the front wheels through a six-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox. The eHybrid offers an electric-only range of 33 miles and can operate in zero-emissions mode at speeds of up to 87mph.</p> \n <p>There are also three turbo petrol and two diesel engines in the Arteon line-up. The petrols range from 187bhp to 276bhp, while the 148bhp and 197bhp diesels are fitted with an updated selective catalytic reduction (SCR) filter and a new AdBlue system that, Volkswagen claims, reduces NOx emissions by around 80%. Buyers can choose between a six-speed manual or a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox, with four-wheel drive offered across the range.</p> \n <p>Unlike <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/2020-volkswagen-golf-pictures-performance-on-sale-date\">the new Golf</a>, the Arteon isn't available with mild-hybrid powertrains because it still sits atop the original-specification MQB platform. This&nbsp;means we're unlikely to see mild-hybrid variants introduced until the second-generation model arrives.</p> \n <p>The restyled Arteon receives a raft of design changes, including a new grille with a light band, revised LED headlights and a range of new alloy wheel designs ranging in diameter from 18in to 20in. There are four different styles: basic, Elegance, R-Line and R. The performance models feature typical R styling cues, including a beefed-up front bumper with large cooling ducts, blue-painted brake calipers, chrome exhaust pipes and 20in 'performance' alloys.</p> \n <p>Inside, there’s a redesigned dashboard with a new upper section, a standard 10.25in digital instrument display, a new multifunction steering wheel and Volkswagen's latest infotainment system, with a standard 8.0in or optional 9.2in touchscreen.</p> \n <p>Martin Hube, spokesman for the Arteon model line, said: “We listened to feedback from our Arteon customers to further improve the Arteon family, not only adding a new derivative but also giving it a completely new and very sophisticated interior, which is very premium in terms of material. It has, basically, a Touareg interior.”</p> \n <p>Equipment levels vary according to trim, but standard kit includes a new multifunction steering wheel with touch-sensitive controls, illuminated trim panels and digital air conditioning controls. R models add black carbon trim elements, leather-upholstered sports seats with integrated headrests and an additional Race driving mode, while mid-range Elegance and R-Line cars feature stainless steel footrests, a sports steering wheel and velour/leather seats.</p> \n <p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p> \n <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/2020-volkswagen-golf-pictures-performance-on-sale-date\">New 2020 Volkswagen Golf: all the details</a></strong></p> \n <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/motor-shows-new-york-motor-show/new-volkswagen-id-4-shown-undisguised-chinese-documents\">New Volkswagen ID 4 shown undisguised in Chinese documents</a>&nbsp;</strong></p> \n <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/industry/volkswagen-reveals-new-look-high-performance-r-brand\">Volkswagen reveals new look for high-performance R brand</a></strong></p> \n <p><iframe allow=\"accelerometer;

One of them is <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-reviews/alpine\">Alpine</a>, which has a new brand boss and a secure future after months of speculation.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>The new strategy is being deployed by the group’s new boss, <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/industry/ex-seat-chief-luca-de-meo-appointed-new-renault-boss\">ex-Seat CEO Luca de Meo</a>. The four core business units are the Renault, <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-reviews/dacia\">Dacia</a> and Alpine brands, plus a New Mobility operation.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>\"The company needs to change its ‘game module’ and move from a search for volume to a search for value and profitability,” said de Meo. “The organisation around four strong brands and large cross-functional functions would make it possible to work in a simpler way, more oriented to the markets and customers, with a team spirit, to seek the best possible result.”</p> \n <p>De Meo&nbsp;heads up the Renault brand, with sales and marketing EVP Denis le Vot piloting the new structure at Dacia and deputy CEO and CFO Clotilde Delbos taking control of New Mobility.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>But the biggest news is the appointment of Cyril Abiteboul – Renault Sport Racing boss and a pivotal figure in Renault’s return to Formula 1 as a works team – as head of Alpine. While this is good news for the sports car brand, it is speculated (but unconfirmed) that the F1 outfit could be renamed to incorporate Alpine branding.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>Alpine’s future <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/industry/alpine-could-become-electric-only-performance-brand\">had been called into question </a>earlier this year, with a number of key figures in the A110’s development leaving and an uncertain future for its Dieppe base.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>Renault said in May that it was staging an “open reflection” on the future of the French facility once production of the A110 ends. Autocar understands that a plan has been worked up to turn Alpine into an all-electric performance brand, but nothing has been confirmed.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>Renault also announced in May that it <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/industry/updated-renault-cut-15000-jobs-part-major-cost-cuts\">would be slashing its fixed costs by more than €2 billion (£1.7b) in the next three years</a>, leading to the loss of 15,000 jobs worldwide. It posted heavy losses and was already proposing to restructure before the pandemic-induced sales slump made it more urgent.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>Renault has declined to comment beyond the released details and de Meo’s statement. Further details of brand-specific organisational changes are expected to be detailed later this year.&nbsp;</p> \n <p><strong><span>READ MORE</span></strong></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/industry/inside-industry-was-ghosn-holding-renault-nissan-mitsubishi-together\"><strong>Inside the industry: was Ghosn holding Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi together?&nbsp;</strong></a></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/renault/captur/first-drives/renault-captur-e-tech-plug-hybrid-2020-uk-review\"><b>Renault Captur E-Tech plug-in hybrid 2020 UK review</b></a></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/three-kind-alpine-a110-vs-a110-s-vs-life110\"><strong>Three of a kind: Alpine A110 vs A110s vs Life110</strong></a></p> \n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 04 Sep 2020 11:51:38 +0000","feedId":13379,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"ebbf54d69ebd339bd152bbcc9f710bb7","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/new_renault_zoe_-_international_test_drive_portugal_-_dec_2016_5_0_0.jpg?itok=irY6L3Su":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn54@2020_5/2020/09/05/08-50-43-685_ddeb764e2d3d4b1c.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295843549},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","title":"Opinion: Is the new S-Class too tech-focused for its own good?","link":"https://www.autocar.co.uk/opinion/new-cars/opinion-new-s-class-too-tech-focused-its-own-good","description":"<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/opinion/new-cars/opinion-new-s-class-too-tech-focused-its-own-good\"><img src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/98-mercedes-benz-s-class-official-reveal-tracking-side_0.jpg?itok=oLSxJdUR\" width=\"190\" height=\"125\" alt=\"Mercedes-Benz S-Class\" title=\"Mercedes-Benz S-Class\" /></a> It's described as the most advanced car Mercedes makes, but our man reckons that may not be enough to keep the luxury saloon relevant \n<div class=\"iframe-container-www-youtube-com\"> \n <p>It’s great to see the <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/2021-mercedes-s-class-luxury-saloon-reinvented-tech-focus\">2021&nbsp;Mercedes&nbsp;S-Class</a> continue its decades-long gentle exterior evolution that makes it so identifiable, but permit me some (perhaps premature) cynicism regarding the interior.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>While I can only comment on the images we've seen as part of the unveil – we’ve yet to get close to one in the metal because the reveal is virtual – I am concerned that Mercedes has caught the <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-reviews/tesla\">Tesla</a> bug a bit too acutely.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>Every S-Class generation has been a technological step change, so it’s only natural that advanced cabin tech dominates. But whereas you can get in, say, a <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/history-mercedes-s-class-picture-special\">20-year-old W220</a>-generation&nbsp;S-Class and it still feels like an expensive, special place to sit, I can’t help but feel this one won’t date too well, given&nbsp;so much of the interior architecture is focused so strongly around the digital features.&nbsp;</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"596\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/88-mercedes-benz-s-class-official-reveal-studio-dashboard_0.jpg?itok=wI-XKe0F\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>It’s the same with most modern cars as touchscreens now dominate interior designs and it's particularly acute at the luxury end of the market, where such a big financial investment means these cars&nbsp;are often kept for longer. Even if you update software over the air (which you can with the new S), what will the actual hardware and screen itself feel and look&nbsp;like in a decade’s time? And more to the point, should we really become so reliant on touchscreens when our readers frequently tell us they are a distraction?</p> \n <p>This is a debate that has raged on for years&nbsp;and it won't end any time soon. I hope these concerns are unfounded and Mercedes has created an S-Class that prioritises ergonomics and a sense of feeling ‘special’ inside over an endless list of gizmos that may never be used by owners.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>The luxury saloon market is floundering in Europe in terms of sales, with core brands fighting over an increasingly small part of the pie. And it's not hard to see the problem. The tech you can get even in an <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/mercedes-benz/a-class\">A-Class</a> these days is extensive, so pricier luxury models have to differentiate with exemplary fit and finish, world-beating refinement and a real sense of occasion as priorities.&nbsp; Otherwise, what’s the point?</p> \n <p>&nbsp;</p> \n <p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p> \n <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/2021-mercedes-s-class-luxury-saloon-reinvented-tech-focus\">2021 Mercedes S-Class: luxury saloon reinvented with tech focus</a>&nbsp;</strong></p> \n <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/first-ride-2020-mercedes-benz-s-class-prototype\">First ride: 2020 Mercedes-Benz S-Class prototype</a>&nbsp;</strong></p> \n <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/used-cars/nearly-new-buying-guide-mercedes-benz-s-class\">Nearly-new buying guide: Mercedes-Benz S-Class</a></strong></p> \n <p><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vzx9uFsztlo\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p> \n <p>&nbsp;</p> \n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 12:40:36 +0000","feedId":13379,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"7ce98efe127d2d3b7aa54e900420441f","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/98-mercedes-benz-s-class-official-reveal-tracking-side_0.jpg?itok=oLSxJdUR":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn49@2020_6/2020/09/05/08-50-43-787_970f6f24117dbbe4.webp","https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/88-mercedes-benz-s-class-official-reveal-studio-dashboard_0.jpg?itok=wI-XKe0F":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295843550},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","title":"Alpine A110 Legende GT makes first UK appearance","link":"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/motor-shows-geneva-motor-show/alpine-a110-legende-gt-makes-first-uk-appearance","description":"<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/motor-shows-geneva-motor-show/alpine-a110-legende-gt-makes-first-uk-appearance\"><img src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/alpine_a110_legende_gt_uk_debut.jpg?itok=a0cf8Rlu\" width=\"190\" height=\"125\" alt=\"2020 Alpine A110 Légende GT in UK\" title=\"2020 Alpine A110 Légende GT in UK\" /></a> French sports coupé one of two limited edition models due to go on sale in 2020 \n<div class=\"iframe-container-www-youtube-com\"> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-reviews/alpine\">Alpine</a> has brought its limited edition A110 Légende GT to the UK for the first time.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>The French sports car made back-to-back&nbsp;appearances&nbsp;at the London Concours&nbsp;and&nbsp;Concours of Elegance Hampton Court Palace - two of only a handful of motor shows to go ahead since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n <p>The&nbsp;Légende GT is billed as&nbsp;“the most refined interpretation of the A110 to date”, and conceived&nbsp;as a more long distance-friendly version of <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/alpine/a110\">the acclaimed sports car</a>.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>Based on the current A110 Légende, the GT can be told apart from the standard car by its gold badging and 18in alloy wheels, translucent white rear light clusters and amber-coloured leather seats. It will be sold in three colours: Deep Black and Abyss Blue, which are already available on the standard A110, and a new option called Mercury Silver, seen in public for the first time here.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>The car’s seats are six-way adjustable as standard, while additional bespoke interior features include a 12 o’ clock steering wheel marker, brown panel stitching, carbonfibre trim elements and a commemorative numbered plaque on the centre console. An extra storage unit between the two seats underlines the variant’s touring potential.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>The A110’s 1.8-litre turbocharged engine is unaltered;&nbsp;the Légende GT packs 249bhp, can accelerate from 0-62mph in 4.5 seconds and will hit a top speed of 156mph. A performance exhaust, uprated Brembo brakes, parking sensors, a reversing camera and upgraded speaker system feature as standard.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>Just 400 units will be offered worldwide, with prices starting from £59,140 in the UK&nbsp;– roughly a £10,000 premium over the standard A110 Pure.</p> \n <p>Alpine has also revealed the A110 Color Edition, which will be available for a limited time in a new, unique colour each year. For 2020, the Color Edition is painted in Sunflower Yellow, a shade taken from Alpine’s original colour palette from the 1960s.&nbsp;</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"596\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/geneva_images_1.jpg?itok=zQIAHOI5\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>The Color Edition is based on the <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/alpine/a110-s/first-drives/alpine-a110-s-2019-review\">range-topping A110 S</a>, and as such is powered by an uprated version of the A110’s four-cylinder motor, producing 288bhp. That model’s performance-oriented chassis set-up also features.</p> \n <p>Rounding off Alpine’s three-pronged unveiling is the Atelier Alpine personalisation programme, which will offer 29 new heritage-inspired paint colours for the A110, each of which will be applied to just&nbsp;110 cars. The special hues can&nbsp;be specified for&nbsp;all models in the A110 range&nbsp;for an additional £4200.</p> \n <p><strong>Read more</strong></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/alpine/a110-s/first-drives/alpine-a110-s-2019-review\"><strong>Alpine A110 S 2019 review​</strong></a></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/alpine-unveils-rally-inspired-a110-sportsx-concept\"><strong>Alpine unveils rally-inspired A110 SportsX concept</strong></a></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/andrew-frankels-car-decade-alpine-a110\"><strong>Andrew Frankel's car of the decade: Alpine A110​</strong></a></p> \n <p><span class=\"wysiwyg-embed\"></span></p> \n <iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ntZ2ONiu9vw\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n <p></p> \n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 04 Sep 2020 10:17:48 +0000","feedId":13379,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"80f4a2005b2aac4f5568b71bc62f0af0","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/alpine_a110_legende_gt_uk_debut.jpg?itok=a0cf8Rlu":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn30@2020_3/2020/09/05/08-50-45-196_8a57735bed4c87e0.webp","https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/geneva_images_1.jpg?itok=zQIAHOI5":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn24@2020_3/2020/09/05/08-50-47-130_e5bde4d3f250cb39.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295843550},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","title":"Opinion: Why F1 should embrace nostalgia with throwback races","link":"https://www.autocar.co.uk/opinion/motorsport/opinion-why-f1-should-embrace-nostalgia-throwback-races","description":"<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/opinion/motorsport/opinion-why-f1-should-embrace-nostalgia-throwback-races\"><img src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/4-chevrolet.jpg?itok=UTxWrsMS\" width=\"190\" height=\"125\" alt=\"Chevrolet\" title=\"Chevrolet\" /></a>\n<blockquote class=\"image-field-caption\">\n  These Chevrolet stock cars are twins born 57 years apart\n</blockquote> A Nascar-style retro-themed annual event could be a hit with F1 fans \n<div class=\"iframe-container-www-youtube-com\"> \n <p>Everyone knows Formula 1 was better in the good old days. Of course it was – although exactly when those days were likely depends on when you first became a fan. That’s nostalgia for you. In truth, the F1 of whichever era you look back on most fondly probably wasn’t quite as good as you remember.</p> \n <p>Still, F1 fans are often prone to nostalgia, in part because the sport itself is fixated on the future. Most sports remain the same in essence for decades, but F1 is forever evolving, due to a never-ceasing drive to push the limits of technology. And that creates a disconnect between long-time fans and the contemporary sport.</p> \n <p>With 2020 marking <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/f1-70-why-car-firms-cant-resist-thrill-racing\">70 years of the F1 World Championship</a>, the sport’s bosses have been nodding to the past: the TV intro features loads of archive footage and there was even a 70th Anniversary Grand Prix. But I have a really simple idea to really engage with nostalgic fans: we need a throwback race.</p> \n <p>Full disclosure: this isn’t my idea. I’ve stolen it from Nascar, another category that has struggled to hold onto its fans as it has evolved over the years.</p> \n <p>For each of the past five years, Nascar has run the Southern 500 at Darlington Raceway as the Throwback Weekend. The storied event was first held in 1950, and the old-school oval is a favourite of drivers and long-time fans.</p> \n <p>Each year has featured a different theme, with the cars painted in special liveries that reflect it – often requiring sponsors to agree to their logos appearing in completely off-brand colour schemes. But as the tradition has grown, most sponsors have embraced it.</p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.nascar.com/gallery/paint-scheme-preview-darlington-throwback-race-2020/#photo-1\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"(C) NASCAR 2020\" class=\"image-body-image\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/hero-template_2020_darlington_9-5.jpg?itok=Mk0eXiHg\" /></a></p> \n <p>Past years have celebrated the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. For this Sunday’s Southern 500, the theme is champions, and there are some cracking liveries. My favourite is the scheme that Austin Dillon is running, reflecting one used by the legendary Junior Johnson (who never won a title as a driver but did as a team owner).</p> \n <p>Elsewhere, Hendrick Motorsports’ four cars pay tribute to seven-time champion Jimmie Johnson in his final full season. Johnson’s team-mates are running liveries from his career, while his car celebrates fellow seven-timers Richard Petty and Dale Earnhardt.</p> \n <p>Predictably, the Throwback Weekend has proved to be a huge success – and I think F1 should copy it. While you wouldn’t want teams changing liveries every week (as they do in Nascar), a once-a-year retro grand prix would surely be a hit. <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-reviews/mercedes-benz\">Mercedes</a> – which is using its livery this year to highlight racism – could run a scheme reflecting Juan Manuel Fangio’s 1950s W196. How about George Russell driving a <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/motorsport/exclusive-williams-f1-team-outlines-bold-recovery-plan\">Williams</a> painted to reflect fellow battling Brit Nigel Mansell’s 1992 title winner? <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/industry/aston-martin-and-red-bull-plan-more-incredible-products-under-new-deal\">Red Bull</a> could even go back to its roots as Stewart and break out some tartan…</p> \n <p>Clearly, this idea <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/motorsport/how-fix-formula-1-according-autocar\">won’t fix the problems that hamper F1</a> and make many nostalgic for (what we remember as) the good old days. But for the sake of a bit of paint, some creative thinking and a few understanding sponsors, it’s a simple idea that could help to build interest and entertain long-time fans.</p> \n <p>Admit it: you’re already thinking of which liveries you’d like revived, aren’t you?</p> \n <p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p> \n <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/motorsport/f1-2020-four-new-races-added-calendar\">F1 2020: four new races added to calendar</a>&nbsp;</strong></p> \n <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/motorsport/f1-2020-everything-you-need-know-season-restarts\">F1 2020: everything you need to know as the season restarts</a>&nbsp;</strong></p> \n <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/opinion/motorsport/racing-lines-how-f1-can-become-more-competitive\">Racing lines: How F1 can become more competitive</a></strong></p> \n <p><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oavyKN479Qw\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p> \n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 04 Sep 2020 05:01:24 +0000","feedId":13379,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"bca520877b1fb6375a9ff06a00786186","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/4-chevrolet.jpg?itok=UTxWrsMS":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx30/cdn49@2020_1/2020/09/05/08-50-47-763_6170f64a940ee1dc.webp","https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/hero-template_2020_darlington_9-5.jpg?itok=Mk0eXiHg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn25@2020_6/2020/09/05/08-50-43-831_7c9117c45cbc9cf0.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295843550},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","title":"New BMW i7: electric 7 Series spotted for the first time","link":"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/new-bmw-i7-electric-7-series-spotted-first-time","description":"<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/new-bmw-i7-electric-7-series-spotted-first-time\"><img src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/_sb16101.jpg?itok=lcht6Ny5\" width=\"190\" height=\"125\" alt=\"BMW i7 prototype\" title=\"BMW i7 prototype\" /></a> Munich's answer to Mercedes-Benz EQS will take styling cues from iNext SUV and retain prominent grille \n<div class=\"iframe-container-www-youtube-com\"> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-reviews/bmw\">BMW</a> is gearing up to launch its answer to the&nbsp;upcoming<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/electric-jaguar-xj-2020\">&nbsp;Jaguar XJ</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/mercedes-eqs-electric-luxury-limo-spawn-amg-version\">Mercedes-Benz EQS</a><span>&nbsp;</span>electric luxury saloons, as&nbsp;the all-new i7 has been spotted testing for the first time.</p> \n <p>To be sold alongside <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/bmw-confirms-next-7-series-be-petrol-diesel-hybrid-and-electric\">petrol, diesel and hybrid versions of the next-generation 7 Series from 2022</a>, the i7 will sit atop BMW’s flexible CLAR platform and likely take its power from a variation of the electric powertrain featured in the <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/new-bmw-ix3-munichs-second-ev-offers-285-mile-range\">new iX3 SUV</a>.</p> \n <p>The iX3 features BMW’s fifth-generation eDrive system, which comprises a rear-mounted motor that drives the rear axle only through a single-speed gearbox&nbsp;and&nbsp;takes its power from an 80kWh lithium ion battery for a WLTP-certified range of 285 miles.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>The&nbsp;more upmarket i7, however, will likely pack significantly more power to bring it into line with its Jaguar and Mercedes rivals, both of which will place a heavy emphasis on performance&nbsp;and offer a range of nearer 400 miles.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>BMW recently claimed the electric 7 Series would be “the top, most powerful” model in the line-up, suggesting it could be offered as a performance variant that would approach the V12-powered 760Li’s 601bhp output.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>A brief glimpse of the interior suggests the i7 will feature a similar cabin layout to BMW's iNext electric SUV, with a prominent central infotainment display and curved digital gauge cluster. This prototype, however, doesn't appear to feature the larger car’s polygonal steering wheel.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>The i7 will likely offer similar autonomous driving functions to the iNext, however, which is described as the first BMW in which the driver is no longer required to take care of the task of driving.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>Although under heavy wraps, this i7 prototype gives clues as to the styling of the seventh-generation 7 Series. It looks like the current car’s controversial large kidney grilles are here to stay, in line with BMW product boss Peter Henrich’s recent affirmation that <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/bmw-continues-defend-new-styling-direction\">customers want “strong characters and bold design</a>”, although those on the electric model will be blanked off, as is customary.</p> \n <p>The next-generation 7 Series'&nbsp;proportions are also familiar, with a long wheelbase, extended front and rear overhangs and a low ride height.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>The i7 forms part of BMW’s drive to electrify a quarter of its fleet by 2021, a third by 2025 and half&nbsp;by 2030. It will be joined in showrooms by the iX3, i4 saloon, iNext and&nbsp;upcoming electric variants of the X1, 5 Series and 3 Series.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>The latter&nbsp;won't be called the i3,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/bmw/i3\">given the electric hatchback of that name</a> remains on sale.</p> \n <p><strong>Read more</strong></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/new-bmw-ix3-munichs-second-ev-offers-285-mile-range\"><strong>New BMW iX3: Munich's second EV offers 285-mile range​</strong></a></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/bmw-confirms-next-7-series-be-petrol-diesel-hybrid-and-electric\"><strong>BMW confirms next 7 Series to be petrol, diesel, hybrid and electric</strong></a></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/motor-shows-geneva-motor-show/bmw-i4-electric-saloon-shown-near-production-form\"><strong>BMW i4 electric saloon shown in near-production form</strong></a></p> \n <p><span class=\"wysiwyg-embed\"></span></p> \n <iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4md2e5qgMGM\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n <p></p> \n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Sep 2020 15:02:00 +0000","feedId":13379,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"0693184f9da9904c31c3c10481fe14a3","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/_sb16101.jpg?itok=lcht6Ny5":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn16@2020_6/2020/09/05/08-50-46-845_3d6e977bb6fc0d8f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295843550},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","title":"New 2021 Mercedes S-Class to be revealed today","link":"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/new-2021-mercedes-s-class-be-revealed-today","description":"<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/new-2021-mercedes-s-class-be-revealed-today\"><img src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/s-class_sketch.jpg?itok=MCXIZxst\" width=\"190\" height=\"125\" alt=\"Mercedes-Benz S-Class sketch\" title=\"Mercedes-Benz S-Class sketch\" /></a> Hybrid-only S-Class will be unveiled with evolved styling and a tech-heavy interior, including an augmented reality HUD \n<div class=\"iframe-container-www-youtube-com\"> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-reviews/mercedes-benz\">Mercedes-Benz</a>&nbsp;is set to unveil the new generation S-Class later today.</p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/2021-mercedes-s-class-luxury-saloon-reinvented-tech-focus\"><strong>The new S-Class has been officially unveiled - see it here.</strong></a></p> \n <p>The latest version of the luxury saloon is due to debut ahead of its arrival in showrooms early next year, with a focus on technology and refinement.

The system can detect traffic and suggest a suitable gap to keep with the car in front, using coloured bars to suggest when you're too close, while navigation instructions update constantly to direct the driver around roundabouts and when filtering between lanes.&nbsp;Active lane keeping assist also uses coloured indicators to suggest when not enough steering lock has been applied through a corner.&nbsp;</p> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-partner=\"tweetdeck\">\n  <p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\">Ready for the next level of displays?

This particular mule, which is covered only in a thin plastic wrapping,&nbsp;shows off undisguised headlights and&nbsp;tail-lights, taking&nbsp;inspiration from that of the&nbsp;</span><span>latest&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/mercedes-benz/cls\">CLS</a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> \n <p><span>Further visible details include&nbsp;a new interpretation of the classic Mercedes-Benz grille and door handles that sit flush with&nbsp;bodywork and pop out when the car is unlocked. The latter is understood to be one factor contributing to best-in-class aerodynamic properties.&nbsp;</span></p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"601\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/mercedes_s-class_spyshots3.jpg?itok=1UUg1HS4\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>The seventh-generation S-Class looks set to regain its place at the forefront of the brand's technical know-how, with a range of new electrified powertrains and&nbsp;advanced driver assist features. Comfort and technology levels will take a boost, with the target of lifting it beyond rivals such as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/bmw/7-series\">7 Series</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/audi/a8\">Audi A8</a>.</p> \n <p>The new Mercedes flagship, which is due in UK showrooms next year, has been developed to support two distinctly different saloon models for the first time. While standard versions are set to receive a range of plug-in hybrid drivetrains, the German car maker will also launch an aerodynamically optimised <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/industry/mercedes-eq-s-be-flagship-%C2%A39bn-electric-model-blitz\">pure-electric version</a> that will serve as the flagship model for its&nbsp;new <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/mercedes-eq-range-lead-daimler-ev-product-offensive\">EQ electric vehicle sub-brand</a>.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>Badged <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/industry/mercedes-eq-s-be-flagship-%C2%A39bn-electric-model-blitz\">EQS</a>, the new model will offer a claimed range in excess of 310 miles on the latest WLTP test cycle when it goes on sale in 2022. Plug-in hybrid versions of the S-Class will feature part-time zero-emission capability for distances of up to 62 miles, together with the option of a newly developed 4Matic four-wheel drive system with fully variable apportioning of drive between the front and rear axles.</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"601\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/_sb11477.jpg?itok=P8pBFBmp\" width=\"900\" />&nbsp;</p> \n <p>The EQS forms part of Mercedes’ £9 billion programme to introduce more than 10 dedicated electric vehicles to the UK market within the next six years.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>In a further change, it is believed that Mercedes-Benz has decided to do away with its long tradition of offering the standard S-Class, which goes under the internal codename W223, with two different wheelbases. Nothing is official at this stage, but it is understood that the growth of the <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/mercedes-benz/e-class\">E-Class</a> to a length of 4920mm is behind a decision to produce the new S-Class exclusively in long-wheelbase guise, with the car measuring around 5280mm in length.&nbsp;</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"601\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/_sb11458.jpg?itok=tP_cItpL\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>However, while the standard S-Class sits on the MRA platform, the more technically advanced four-wheel-drive EQS will be the first Mercedes-Benz model to be based on the new Modular Electric Architecture (MEA) platform. Unlike the structures being developed to underpin smaller EQ models, it is not based on an existing platform but has been developed as dedicated EV architecture with a flat floor to house batteries.</p> \n <p>The drivelines set to power hybrid versions of the new S-Class are based around Mercedes’ latest 3.0-litre and 2.9-litre in-line six-cylinder petrol and diesel engines and the AMG-developed 4.0-litre V8, all of which operate in combination with a disc-shaped electric motor housed within the automatic gearbox and a lithium ion battery located in the boot floor.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>The electric EQS is set to receive two electric motors – one acting on the front axle and the other driving the rear – providing permanent four-wheel drive in all variants. In the EQC, this set-up delivers more than 400bhp and some 516lb ft, although engineers involved on the development of the EQS suggest it will offer even greater levels of power and torque, with a planned AMG performance model earmarked to produce more than 600bhp.</p> \n <p>Despite the differing platforms, both the standard S-Class and the EQS are set to share the same active suspension system. A development of the existing S-Class’s AirMatic+ system, it works in combination with a 48V electrical architecture and a stereo camera that scans the road ahead to adjust the spring and damper action on each wheel, allowing it to not only counteract body lean in corners but also to better control pitch.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>The EQS will adopt its own distinct styling. Reflecting the packaging advantages inherent in electric vehicles, it receives a shorter bonnet and more heavily raked windscreen than the standard version of the new S-Class, similar to that of the <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/mercedes-benz/cls\">CLS</a>.&nbsp;</p> \n <p><strong>Read more</strong></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/motor-shows-geneva-motor-show/mercedes-reduce-model-line-platforms-and-powertrains\"><strong>Mercedes to reduce model line-up, platforms and powertrains</strong></a></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/mercedes-eqs-electric-luxury-limo-spawn-amg-version\"><strong>Mercedes EQS: electric luxury limo to spawn AMG version</strong></a></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/farewell-v12-celebrating-endangered-engine\"><strong>Farewell to the V12: celebrating the endangered engine​</strong></a></p> \n <p><span class=\"wysiwyg-embed\"></span></p> \n <iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3P90wZjukIs\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n <p></p> \n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 10:43:02 +0000","feedId":13379,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"55ddd7f021166b815a0737dac0ea3393","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/s-class_sketch.jpg?itok=MCXIZxst":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx19/cdn24@2020_2/2020/09/05/08-50-48-676_5724e30a60b9ea0c.webp","https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/mercedes_s-class_spyshots3.jpg?itok=1UUg1HS4":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn2@2020_2/2020/09/05/08-50-43-871_5dc4911062c06781.webp","https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/_sb11477.jpg?itok=P8pBFBmp":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn72@2020_6/2020/09/05/08-51-21-085_c56f2d50bb3ba7df.webp","https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/_sb11458.jpg?itok=tP_cItpL":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn57@2020_4/2020/09/05/08-50-45-854_096f8674cdf4a04d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295843551},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","title":"Jeep Renegade 4xe 2020 review","link":"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/jeep/renegade/first-drives/jeep-renegade-4xe-2020-review","description":"<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/jeep/renegade/first-drives/jeep-renegade-4xe-2020-review\"><img src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/jeep-29072020_0317.jpg?itok=wjuN6JG9\" width=\"190\" height=\"125\" alt=\"Jeep Renegade 4xe front\" title=\"Jeep Renegade 4xe front\" /></a> Jeep's first plunge into electrification is on in its most popular and smallest model. Is it worth splashing out for? \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> “It’s the start of a new era!” Jeep says. “It’s to reduce your fleet CO2 average!” we say. Regardless, it’s a show of confidence in the rough and tough US maker that it’s the first Fiat Chrysler Automobiles brand with a European presence to receive a plug-in hybrid powertrain.&nbsp;And it won’t be the last. It’ll come as no surprise that Jeep is one of the biggest polluters in the group’s stable, and even FCA’s emissions credit pooling with Tesla will go only so far to remedying that. So Jeep needs electrification to do some of the legwork. The ever-popular Renegade takes priority but soon to follow are a plug-in Compass and Wrangler, and all models will feature some form of battery propulsion by 2022.&nbsp;The Renegade 4xe (pronounced 4-by-e) joins an ever-growing rank of plug-in SUVs, but Jeep touts the Mini Countryman PHEV&nbsp;as its main challenger. Pricing is broadly similar, although the Jeep is more comprehensively equipped as standard.&nbsp;It makes use of a 1.3-litre turbo petrol engine, itself giving 128bhp (or a sprightly 177bhp in top-spec Trailhawk trim, which we’re not driving here). That’s combined with a 59bhp electric motor mounted over the rear axle in all models for four-wheel drive without the need for a second driveshaft.Those output figures are healthy enough, but they’re lugging a car that’s between 130kg and 200kg heavier (depending on spec) than the pure combustion-engined variants. Despite an 11.4kWh battery crammed under the passenger compartment, Jeep claims there has been no loss of space, although the hardware under the boot floor robs 20 litres of outright capacity.&nbsp;","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 04 Sep 2020 11:30:33 +0000","feedId":13379,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"88c73509df463294398f6c91828ca04d","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/jeep-29072020_0317.jpg?itok=wjuN6JG9":null},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295843549},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","title":"2021 Ineos Grenadier makes UK debut alongside off-road icons","link":"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/ineos-grenadier-2021","description":"<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/ineos-grenadier-2021\"><img src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/40-ineos-grenadier.jpg?itok=d3NFn9Fp\" width=\"190\" height=\"125\" alt=\"Ineos Grenadier\" title=\"Ineos Grenadier\" /></a>\n<blockquote class=\"image-field-caption\">\n  Grenadier's design is mainly Defender-influenced, but hints of other cars feature too\n</blockquote> Singular utilitarian focus is matched with modern tech and powerful BMW engines \n<div class=\"iframe-container-www-youtube-com\"> \n <p>Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s rugged new off-roader, the <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/2021-ineos-grenadier-first-prototype-caught-testing-disguise\">Ineos Grenadier</a>, has appeared for the first time in public, displayed at London's Concours of Elegance alongside the 4x4 icons that inspired its design.</p> \n <p>The Grenadier will be parked up next to the collection of historic off-roaders that make up Ineos' own private fleet, including an original Mercedes G-Wagen, a Toyota Land Cruiser FJ40, a Willys Jeep and the earliest known production example of the original Land Series I.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>Ineos designer Toby Ecuyer said:&nbsp;“At the outset of the Grenadier project, we brought some of the great 4x4s of the past into the studio to look closely at what made them so enduring. And now, it’s fantastic to see Grenadier in the company of these legends.</p> \n <p>\"You can see common design traits and proportions, and certainly the same clarity of purpose. I think the Grenadier sits very naturally among these 4x4 icons, and if others agree, then we’ve achieved our design objective.”</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/13-ineos-grenadier-static-rear.jpg?itok=1ehzWY0s\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>Despite the new car's resemblance to cars like the Defender, the Grenadier is an all-new 4x4 created by a ground-up team and brand, with modern components, a state-of-the-art powertrain and possibly an even more singular purpose than the icon that it seeks to supplant.</p> \n <p>Similar in size to the latest <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/mercedes-benz/g-class\">Mercedes-Benz G-Class</a> and powered by a modular range of six-cylinder <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-reviews/bmw\">BMW</a> diesel and petrol engines, it’s expected to be priced from £40,000 when it hits the market late next year, initially as a five-door station wagon then “soon afterwards” as a four-door pick-up truck. A short-wheelbase car may come after, alongside other versions.</p> \n <p>Production will take several years to ramp up for markets around the world, but insiders say it will be profitable at an annual output of about 25,000.</p> \n <p>Ratcliffe, founder and majority owner of the £50 billion British petrochemicals group Ineos, is a steadfast devotee of the old Defender. He came up with the idea of building a replacement of his own when <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/industry/car-industry-now-how-will-jaguar-land-rover-look-after-crisis\">Jaguar Land Rover</a> declined to sell him its designs or tooling to continue when production ceased at Solihull after 67 years in January 2016.</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/19-ineos-grenadier-static-rear.jpg?itok=Y5CUhLDo\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>Two years ago, after forming Ineos Automotive, Ratcliffe enlisted his friend and favourite superyacht designer, Toby Ecuyer – who is usually based on the south coast of England – to form and lead the Grenadier design team. He also appointed former chemical engineer Dirk Heilmann as Ineos Automotive CEO and set him the task of creating the 4x4’s mechanical package, working with a band of engineers based mainly at Magna Steyr in Graz, Austria.</p> \n <p>Named after Ratcliffe’s favourite pub in Belgravia, London, the Grenadier is being unveiled now, 18 months before its expected on-sale date, because its creators believe they will find it easier to complete a tightly planned million-mile global test programme if they can drive it “in plain sight”. Testing began last winter in Sweden. Meanwhile, two new factories are being built: one in Portugal for chassis-making and one in South Wales for final assembly.</p> \n <p>Last week, Autocar held a virtual meeting with Ecuyer, Heilmann and commercial director Mark Tennant to see the wraps come off the Grenadier and hear more about its purpose and capabilities. We saw the finished exterior but not the “hose-it-out” interior Ratcliffe has ordered because details are still being finalised.</p> \n <p>“We’re using the line ‘Built on Purpose’ for the Grenadier,” said Tennant, “because for this project, function must always lead. We’re focusing on a high standard of off-road performance first, and there’s an Ineos tradition of using straightforward, simple language for a straightforward, simple car. Not that we’re Luddites; it’s not spartan or out of date. It will have all the connectivity and screen technology you would expect. And it will be comfortable, too, because owners will spend many hours in their machines.”</p> \n <p><strong>Body design</strong></p> \n <p>Ecuyer doesn’t shy away from remarks about the Grenadier’s resemblance to the Defender but stresses that the team came to the current design and specification after researching a large number of competitor vehicles, many of which were bought for benchmarking.</p> \n <p>He said: “We had <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-reviews/jeep\">Jeeps</a>, <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-reviews/land-rover\">Land Rovers</a>, <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/toyota/hilux\">Toyota Hiluxes</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/used-cars/used-car-buying-guide-toyota-land-cruiser\">Toyota FJ40 [Land Cruiser]</a>, <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/mitsubishi-still-aiming-develop-new-shogun-roader\">Nissan Patrols</a>, <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/motor-shows-detroit-motor-show/fords-baby-bronco-suv-leaked-dealer-presentation\">Ford Broncos</a>. And we looked at vans, lorries, Unimogs, military vehicles, tractors. African-spec vehicles were particularly interesting. They all shaped our plan for a vehicle that would be extremely capable but also very honest and uncomplicated.”</p> \n <p>The result is a simple, well-proportioned and familiar-looking off-roader with straight sides, a clamshell bonnet rising above flat-topped front wings, a steep, fairly flat windscreen and a flat roof with rain gutters running all the way around.</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/15-ineos-grenadier-close-up.jpg?itok=UvajLWNn\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>The grille is simple and vertical, the LED headlights are round and the large wheels are positioned to minimise body overhangs and take advantage of rubberised wheel arches.</p> \n <p>The station wagon body has three windows each side. Like the windscreen, they and a lot of the panelling appear to be flat, but they aren’t quite. Ecuyer said very gentle curvature confers a modern sophistication on the design it otherwise wouldn’t have.</p> \n <p>Most reminiscent of the Defender is the Grenadier’s body ‘shoulder’ that runs from the top of the front wings in a dead straight line right to the rear end. Ecuyer said this gives room for ‘stuff’ inside the bottom half of the doors while allowing their tops to be “no thicker than they need to be”.</p> \n <p>The doors have external hinges that help with the door removal that will suit some users and give the car’s design the honesty Ecuyer sought.</p> \n <p>“It was really important to us that this design should be easily read, with nothing complicated or mysterious about it,” said Ecuyer. “You can see how the doors and bonnet are attached. There are no hidden pillars or tricks with glass. It’s comfortable to be around, not too clever. And there’s none of the clever technology people have developed to sanitise big SUVs. It’s just honest.”</p> \n <p>Ecuyer admitted to plenty of debate about the Grenadier’s rear-end design: for a long time, the team were settled on a classic split tailgate, before deciding late in the day on the big-door-small-door layout.</p> \n <p>Tailgates can make vehicles hard to load or unload, said Ecuyer, and the swing-out spare wheel carrier would have been “a nightmare”.</p> \n <p>The small door can be opened before the large one to provide access to the space-saver tool compartment that’s innovatively pressed into its skin below the glass.</p> \n <p>The round tail-lights “share a common language” with the round headlights and are mounted ideally on the extra space provided by the body shoulder, happily where modern law requires them to be visible. “They’re the result of a very practical problem,” said Ecuyer, “not a wafty sketch in a cafe somewhere…”</p> \n <p>Interesting evidence of Ecuyer’s nautical design background abounds. The roof can be used to carry loads without a rack, and one artful touch is the provision of four tie bars on the sides of the roof that look a lot like the roof lights of an old Land Rover.</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/17-land-rover-defender-hero-front.jpg?itok=6djOZVum\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>There are also pre-wired “utility rails” running through the doors and under the rear side windows, because Ineos expects owners to use their Grenadiers for camping. These rails will allow for the mounting of lights, for example.</p> \n <p>Although they’re not talking about the interior today, the Ineos team makes clear that it includes more such features. “We haven’t swathed the dash just to make it look nice,” said Ecuyer. “If there’s space available, we open it up for use.”</p> \n <p>Ineos will design factory-fit options and aftermarket kit for the Grenadier but isn’t shy about making it ‘open-source’ so other equipment makers can produce add-ons to suit.</p> \n <p>“Every owner’s use for their vehicle will be different,” said Heilmann, “and we’re very happy with that.”</p> \n <p><strong>Chassis and powertrain</strong></p> \n <p>Heilmann said he expects the Grenadier to be heavier than the old Defender 110, which is narrower but slightly longer, but that’s mostly because the Land Rover is a considerably simpler, less well-equipped vehicle with a much lighter powertrain. The target weight is around 2400kg, but today’s initial prototypes are 80kg too heavy, so weight must be reduced to improve the Grenadier’s all-important off-road performance.</p> \n <p>Ineos’s engine choice is the <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/2017-bmw-5-series-saloon-and-estate-latest-spy-pictures\">BMW B57/B58</a> family, so each Grenadier will have a modular 3.0-litre petrol or diesel straight six that sends its drive through a ZF-supplied eight-speed automatic gearbox (and a separate low-range transfer case). Depending on spec, these engines make anything from 261bhp to nearly 400bhp in their BMW applications.</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/12-ineos-grenadier-hero-front.jpg?itok=nKaS86iL\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>Heilmann said that although the Grenadier’s performance will make off-roading a priority, its on-road ability will be “fine for anyone who’s used to driving, say, <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/jeep/wrangler\">a Jeep Wrangler</a>”. However, the performance potential will probably require an on-road speed limiter.</p> \n <p>The car’s relatively old-tech body-on-frame chassis, twin live axles and non-independent coil suspension are a rarity nowadays; even the Hilux has independent front suspension. However, the body is a complex mixture of aluminium, high-strength steel and composites.</p> \n <p>“We’ve had to learn that aluminium isn’t always the best choice for strength and crash purposes,” said Heilmann, “so we’ve chosen the right materials for the right jobs.” But much of the outer skin – the bonnet, the doors and the mudguards – is aluminium.</p> \n <p><strong>Timetable and marketing</strong></p> \n <p>Tennant and Heilmann say the project is running only a few weeks behind, despite <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/advice/coronavirus-what-motorists-need-know\">Covid-19</a>, and they’re looking now at ways of getting that time back. “It’s a tight schedule,” Heilmann said, “but by 2021 we want to be doing our first production runs, and at the end of 2021 we should have production cars coming off the line.</p> \n <p>“For now, the time-critical areas are going well. Our key suppliers – people like our axle partner in northern Italy – are with us. The challenge is to get the components together and have them properly tested.”</p> \n <p>Tennant said decisions about the dealer network are still being made but that Ineos wants to sell the Grenadier as directly as it can. He plans an announcement soon about how and where cars will be serviced.</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/16-ineos-grenadier-static-side.jpg?itok=FIgylFqq\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>“The world of car retailing is moving rather rapidly at present,” he said ruefully.</p> \n <p>For a start, Europe and North America will be the key markets, but Ineos is also very interested in Australia, Africa and South-East Asia, where it is confident the Grenadier’s ruggedness will go down well.</p> \n <p>“Experience centres will be a high priority,” said Tennant. “No one is going to want to buy one of these just by driving it around the block.”</p> \n <p><strong>Q&amp;A: Toby Ecuyer. Ineos Grenadier design leader</strong></p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/11-toby-ecuyer.jpg?itok=p607KOjR\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p><em><strong>So you’re not a car designer?</strong></em></p> \n <p>“No, at least not until now. I grew up on a farm in Derbyshire around tractors and Land Rovers, but I was interested in cars.</p> \n <p>“When I was about nine, I wrote to Austin Rover with some car sketches. They wrote back politely, basically saying the cars were terrible but that they had a design department and, when I was old enough, I should try to join their training scheme. Until then, I didn’t realise design was an actual job, and that really sparked my interest to know how things were created.”</p> \n <p><em><strong>How did you get into design?</strong></em></p> \n <p>“I trained as an architect and then got into boat design – long projects, 80-metre superyachts and for private customers. That’s how I got to know Jim Ratcliffe. I designed a couple of boats for him and looked after a building project. I was involved in the early talks about the Grenadier, then Jim asked me if I would like to be involved. It sounded interesting, and it has been fascinating.”</p> \n <p><em><strong>Has learning a new discipline been hard?</strong></em></p> \n <p>“Well, I’ve learned that it isn’t necessarily wrong to change horses. There are some interesting parallels in surface design and design thinking. And although I’m the design leader, there are others in the team. I haven’t done all this on my own.”</p> \n <p><strong><em>What’s it like working with Jim Ratcliffe?</em></strong></p> \n <p>“Jim loves the design process, and he gets very involved. He has brilliant ideas. My job is to help him get them onto paper. When you’re building a superyacht, you’re talking about a four-year programme, so you get to know a person really well. We had a good friendship – and a mutual enjoyment of cars.”</p> \n <p><em><strong>Is this a car to love or a tool?</strong></em></p> \n <p>“Both, really. We were very interested in vehicles that had both proven themselves in the field and found their way into people’s hearts.</p> \n <p>“Not all modern SUVs were like this. There’s an honesty about cars in our collection that people tend to adopt and identify with, and we wanted that for Grenadier. That’s why we assembled our collection of vehicles for benchmarking. They were all vehicles that were well-respected.”</p> \n <p><em><strong>What will you think when people draw similarities to the Land Rover Defender?</strong></em></p> \n <p>“It has been fascinating, benchmarking all the cars we have. One thing I’ve learned is how little there is between cars. I mean, you only have to change a vehicle a little to make it look like something different. Shift the headlights a bit and you’ve suddenly made a Ford Bronco.”</p> \n <p><em><strong>How did you define your objectives for the Grenadier?</strong></em></p> \n <p>“We made a list of qualities we wanted to achieve: assured, robust, faithful, dependable and purposeful. We used them as a kind of checklist. Every time we had a decision to make about the car, we would run through the list to see if it met them. I’m hoping people will recognise those things in the production car.”</p> \n <p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p> \n <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/official-ineos-confirms-bridgend-factory-grenadier-4x4\">Official: Ineos confirms Bridgend factory for Grenadier 4x4</a>&nbsp;</strong></p> \n <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/jaguar-land-rover-readies-2021-range-rover-amid-lockdown-delays\">Jaguar Land Rover readies 2021 Range Rover amid lockdown delays</a>&nbsp;</strong></p> \n <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/land-rover/defender-2020\">Land Rover Defender review</a></strong></p> \n <p><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DCPs2flOkZg\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p> \n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Fri, 04 Sep 2020 09:22:23 +0000","feedId":13379,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"b9374b691a13317362fb2f162a2709d6","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/40-ineos-grenadier.jpg?itok=d3NFn9Fp":null,"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/13-ineos-grenadier-static-rear.jpg?itok=1ehzWY0s":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn14@2020_5/2020/09/05/08-50-47-451_8c9c1ba0309436b3.webp","https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/19-ineos-grenadier-static-rear.jpg?itok=Y5CUhLDo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn71@2020_2/2020/09/05/08-50-46-056_91d8fe5080c0921f.webp","https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/15-ineos-grenadier-close-up.jpg?itok=UvajLWNn":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn19@2020_4/2020/09/05/08-50-46-203_81545c79cc5d03e3.webp","https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/17-land-rover-defender-hero-front.jpg?itok=6djOZVum":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn37@2020_1/2020/09/05/08-50-47-129_3078ec001571d552.webp","https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/12-ineos-grenadier-hero-front.jpg?itok=nKaS86iL":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn89@2020_4/2020/09/05/08-50-43-868_42c442f67450dfc1.webp","https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/16-ineos-grenadier-static-side.jpg?itok=FIgylFqq":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn96@2020_4/2020/09/05/08-50-43-835_b95f4daa0c734153.webp","https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/11-toby-ecuyer.jpg?itok=p607KOjR":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn28@2020_2/2020/09/05/08-50-46-085_0987ea34b88cae83.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295843550},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","title":"Road-legal Brabham BT62R hypercar revealed with 700bhp","link":"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/road-legal-brabham-bt62r-hypercar-revealed-700bhp","description":"<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/road-legal-brabham-bt62r-hypercar-revealed-700bhp\"><img src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/20-brabham-bt62r.jpg?itok=eJm6M4B8\" width=\"190\" height=\"125\" alt=\"Brabham BT62R\" title=\"Brabham BT62R\" /></a> Third variant of Brabham's BT62 revealed, joining race-spec Ultimate Track and Competition versions \n<div class=\"iframe-container-www-youtube-com\"> \n <p>Brabham Automotive has revealed a road-legal version of its<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/brabham-bt62-691bhp-track-weapon-takes-silverstone\"> BT62 hypercar</a>, called the BT62R, and the first examples will be delivered to customers in the next few weeks.</p> \n <p>As the third BT62 variant announced by the brand, after the <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/brabham-bt62-700bhp-track-only-hypercar-demonstrated-goodwood\">£1 million Ultimate Track</a> and <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/brabham-bt62-hypercar-adds-entry-level-%C2%A3750000-competition-variant\">£750,000 Competition</a> versions, the £1.25m BT62R shares much of its chassis and aerodynamic hardware with those other models. Although <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/brabham-bt62-hypercar-adds-entry-level-%C2%A3750000-competition-variant\">Brabham</a> says it's tuned for the road, the firm also says the BT62R is equally \"at home on the track\".</p> \n <p>Just 70 BT62 cars will be built, encompassing all three variants. Brabham expects the GT62R to account for&nbsp;between 30% and 50% of these models.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>During the launch of the road-going variant, Brabham also announced plans for further expansion, confirming it will reveal more about another new model, described as a “fully homolated road car”, in the next few months.</p> \n <p>The BT62R retains the 5.4-litre naturally aspirated V8 engine used in the other two variants, but with revised engine mapping for use on the road. It develops 700bhp and 492lb ft of torque, which is delivered through a six-speed sequential gearbox.</p> \n <p>The car sports the same carbonfibre body as the track variants but with a few crucial changes to aid better on-road vehicle dynamics. The model features a revised front splitter and rear diffuser, a new top-mounted air intake and a redesigned and road-compliant single-plane rear wing.</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/brabham_bt62r_-6.jpg?itok=y4KJb3uk\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>Brabham said the result is a car that “maintains the incredible dynamics of a race car - acceleration, deceleration and lateral variation - and combines them with the manners and comfort of a road car.”</p> \n <p>Two different versions of the road car are offered, dubbed Signature and Celebration Series. The Celebration version is distinguished by one of 35 racing liveries marking Brabham’s 35 wins in Formula 1 and gold badging.</p> \n <p>Inside, the BT62R is significantly more luxurious than the stripped-back Ultimate Track and Competition variants. Brabham claims a “special emphasis was placed on everyday drivability” during the car’s development. Customers can choose from either leather- or Alcantara-finished carbonfibre seats, with contrast stitching. Brabham has also added a new climate control system and digital control panel, including a digital rear camera.</p> \n <p>Brabham Automotive boss Dan Marks said: “Launching the BT62R is a great achievement for the team at Brabham Automotive. All the requisite design and engineering to turn the track BT62 into the road-going BT62R has been done in-house by our team of engineers, which is a great testimony to their endeavour and expertise.”</p> \n <p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p> \n <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/brabham-bt62-hypercar-adds-entry-level-%C2%A3750000-competition-variant\">Brabham BT62 hypercar adds entry-level £750,000 Competition variant</a></strong></p> \n <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/brabham-bt62-691bhp-track-weapon-takes-silverstone\">Brabham BT62: 691bhp track weapon takes on Silverstone</a>&nbsp;</strong></p> \n <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/brabham-bt62-700bhp-track-only-hypercar-demonstrated-goodwood\">Brabham BT62: 700bhp track-only hypercar demonstrated at Goodwood</a></strong></p> \n <p><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vzx9uFsztlo\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p> \n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Sep 2020 07:01:11 +0000","feedId":13379,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"b386d8229bf44b60a9eb1ea071ba2163","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/20-brabham-bt62r.jpg?itok=eJm6M4B8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn55@2020_4/2020/09/05/08-50-46-301_38a9dbf8b1e02ae3.webp","https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/brabham_bt62r_-6.jpg?itok=y4KJb3uk":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn53@2020_6/2020/09/05/08-50-45-039_4eb15e5bd1c58dce.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295843550},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","title":"Porsche seeks partner to develop synthetic fuels","link":"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/industry/porsche-seeks-partner-develop-synthetic-fuels","description":"<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/industry/porsche-seeks-partner-develop-synthetic-fuels\"><img src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/1-porsche-taycan-2020-rt-hero-front.jpg?itok=iIyiHbUg\" width=\"190\" height=\"125\" alt=\"Porsche Taycan\" title=\"Porsche Taycan\" /></a>\n<blockquote class=\"image-field-caption\">\n  Porsche introduced its first electric car, the Taycan, earlier this year \n</blockquote> German marque follows Volkswagen and Bentley siblings in researching e-fuels and aims to build factories to prove viability \n<div class=\"iframe-container-www-youtube-com\"> \n <p>Porsche has announced that it wants to “drive forward the development of synthetic fuels [e-fuels]” and is seeking partners to build pilot factories to prove&nbsp;e-fuels' viability.</p> \n <p>Although <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-reviews/porsche\">Porsche</a> is investing in electrification, as evidenced by the <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/porsche-taycan-specs-sale-date-performance\">introduction of the Taycan EV </a>earlier this year, it believes&nbsp;the technology is not reducing its carbon footprint quickly enough.</p> \n <p>Porsche’s R&amp;D boss, Michael Steiner, said: “Electric mobility is an exciting and convincing technology but, taken on its own, it is taking us towards our sustainability targets at a slower pace than we would like. That’s why we are also committing to e-fuels – and not ignoring possible applications in motorsports, either.”</p> \n <p>Another reason&nbsp;Porsche is investing in e-fuels, he said, is because they are a “fundamental component” of improving the sustainability of existing fleets. A further advantage is that, unlike electrification, they do not require significant mechanical changes to existing cars.</p> \n <p>E-Fuels have long been of interest to the car industry. They function similarly to kerosene, diesel or petrol processed from crude oil but are produced from CO2 and hydrogen using renewable energy.</p> \n <p>Porsche’s VW Group sibling brands, <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-reviews/volkswagen\">Volkswagen</a> and <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-reviews/bentley\">Bentley</a>, are researching the technology, as is <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-reviews/mclaren\">McLaren</a>. However, not all firms are as enthusiastic. <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-reviews/mercedes-benz\">Mercedes</a> has recently snubbed e-fuels, <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/industry/mercedes-rd-boss-synthetic-fuel-not-viable-option\">questioning their viability</a>.</p> \n <p>Although Porsche aims for half of its vehicles sold to be <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/next-gen-porsche-cayenne-could-be-fully-electric\">electric by 2025</a>, the marque is committed to pure-combustion engines in the medium term. Steiner stressed that Porsche’s existing fleet is large, and although its hybrid vehicles are powered electrically for short drives, they frequently undertake longer trips, which require combustion engines.</p> \n <p>Porsche’s focus on synthetic fuels reflects wider trends. Earlier this year, the government announced that it<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/industry/government-plans-e10-petrol-switch-2021\"> plans to introduce lower-carbon E10 petrol</a>, which is made with 10% ethanol, as <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/industry/government-plans-e10-petrol-switch-2021\">standard at UK filling stations in 2021</a>.</p> \n <p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p> \n <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/industry/volkswagen-combustion-engine-has-life-it-yet\">Volkswagen: Combustion engine has life in it yet</a>&nbsp;</strong></p> \n <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/industry/mclaren-advocates-synthetic-fuel-alternative-evs\">McLaren advocates synthetic fuel as alternative to EVs</a>&nbsp;</strong></p> \n <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/industry/mercedes-rd-boss-synthetic-fuel-not-viable-option\">Mercedes R&amp;D boss: synthetic fuel not a viable option</a></strong></p> \n <p><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vzx9uFsztlo\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p> \n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 15:58:00 +0000","feedId":13379,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"b180c903cfe2d7d3daaaf94dca4e7257","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/1-porsche-taycan-2020-rt-hero-front.jpg?itok=iIyiHbUg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn87@2020_5/2020/09/05/08-50-48-284_940388133a63be38.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295843550},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","title":"Nearly new buying guide: Skoda Karoq","link":"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/used-cars/nearly-new-buying-guide-skoda-karoq","description":"<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/used-cars/nearly-new-buying-guide-skoda-karoq\"><img src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/1-skoda-karoq-scout-2019-rt-hero-front.jpg?itok=vi2-Bk-E\" width=\"190\" height=\"125\" alt=\"Skoda Karoq\" title=\"Skoda Karoq\" /></a> This could be your family’s new best friend, from £15k up. We have the info \n<div class=\"iframe-container-www-youtube-com\"> \n <p>What’s in a name? We all loved the <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/skoda/yeti-2013-2017\">Yeti</a>, even though it looked insane and had an odd moniker. The <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/skoda/karoq\">Karoq’s</a> name is odd, too, but the car beneath the badge is entirely and in some instances delightfully conventional. Larger than the Yeti both inside and out, the Karoq was created with practicality as its main brief – so it retained the smart touches and versatility that made its predecessor so popular, if not that standout styling.</p> \n <p>There’s a good array of engines. The petrol range has consisted of 113bhp 1.0-litre, 148bhp 1.5-litre and 187bhp 2.0-litre units. For diesel, you can pick between a 113bhp 1.6-litre and two 2.0 diesels of 148bhp and 187bhp. You can also seek out a dual-clutch automatic gearbox, while four-wheel drive is available on the 1.5 and 2.0 petrols and the 2.0 diesel models.</p> \n <p>There are varying trim levels, too. SE brings 17in alloy wheels, dual-zone climate control, front and rear electric windows and an 8.0in touchscreen that features smartphone mirroring. SE Technology adds adaptive cruise control and front and rear parking sensors, while SE L has a dedicated built-in sat-nav. Later Sport Line trim features 19in alloys and sports seats, while top-rung Edition spec adds a wider, 9.2in infotainment screen and a panoramic sunroof.</p> \n <p>To drive, the Karoq is a very pleasant thing. It isn’t quite as sharp in the handling department as <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/seat/ateca\">the Seat Ateca</a>, with which it shares a platform, but it’s tidier and more agile than its other platform mate,<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/volkswagen/tiguan\"> the Volkswagen Tiguan</a>. It comes up trumps for comfort, with a well-judged ride that smooths off all but the harshest bumps in town and is delightfully plush at higher speeds.</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"596\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/30-skoda-karoq-scout-2019-rt-otr-side_0.jpg?itok=RXl3hinZ\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>The Karoq’s greatest asset, however, is its interior. It’s smart and beautifully built, and there’s loads of room for driver and front passenger, and an excellent driving position.</p> \n <p>The car’s appeal remains strong as you go further back in it because the rear doors open nice and wide and the rear bench is pretty spacious. If you choose an SE L or Edition, you get a fantastically useful 40/20/40-split folding rear seat – or the option to remove the rear seats entirely to maximise boot space. This system was also available as part of the VarioFlex package on SE and SE Technology models.</p> \n <p>The boot isn’t the biggest in the class, but it is very well shaped, which means you can carry a useful amount in it. And if you don’t choose a car with the VarioFlex seating, your consolation prize is an adjustable boot floor with a hidden space beneath the cover for smaller items.</p> \n <p>Prices for used Karoqs start at a decent £15,000. Up the budget to £16,000-£18,000 and you’ll find plenty of 2018 cars and 2019 cars. Spend around £19,000-£21,000 on a more recent Karoq.</p> \n <p><strong>Need to know</strong></p> \n <p>The 1.0-litre petrol has a WLTP figure of 43.5mpg but the 1.5-litre petrol is only slightly less, at 41.5mpg, thanks to fuel-saving cylinder-deactivation tech. The 1.6-litre diesel is rated at 49.6mpg but the 148bhp 2.0-litre is slightly better still, at 50.4mpg.</p> \n <p>It’s possible that a small number of Karoqs built in February 2019 have a cracked left front seat frame.

Over half of the production run had already been accounted for before the car's existence was revealed to the public.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>The Cosworth-developed, naturally aspirated V12 engine powering the T50 has been re-engineered with&nbsp;revised cylinder heads, a higher compression ratio&nbsp;and an all-new free-flow exhaust system&nbsp;to produce beyond 700bhp. According to Murray himself, this was only possible in a track car, which doesn't have to contend with noise or emission regulations. A bespoke new six-speed transmission has new drive ratios and replaces the road car's manual gearstick with paddle shifters.</p> \n <p>Significant upgrades to the car's aerodynamics pair the road-going T50's&nbsp;signature rear-mounted fan&nbsp;with a new 1758mm-wide rear wing, new front splitter, underbody aerofoil and adjustable diffusers. Combined, the changes allow the&nbsp;T50s to&nbsp;generate more than 1500kg&nbsp;of downforce. A new roof-mounted aero fin also helps boost cornering stability, allowing the car to generate 2.5-3g under braking.</p> \n <p>Unlike the road car, which has multiple aerodynamic modes, the T50s will run in High Downforce mode at all times, with the diffuser ducts fully open and the fan running permanently at 7000rpm.</p> \n <p>Ride height has been lowered by 40mm front and rear,&nbsp;oil cooling systems relocated to improve airflow to the rear wing&nbsp;and new brake ducting added to assist with temperature management. Forged&nbsp;magnesium wheels significantly reduce the car’s unsprung mass, but as&nbsp;per Murray's insistence that supercars don't require bespoke tyres, the T50s will ride on&nbsp;Michelin Cup Sport 2s.</p> \n <p>Stripping back the interior has helped shave 94kg compared with the road-going car, with air conditioning, infotainment, storage and sound-deadening materials all removed. Road-going displays have also been removed, with performance-focused information moved to an F1-style rectangular steering wheel.</p> \n <p>The centrally positioned&nbsp;driver's seat has been&nbsp;exchanged for a carbonfibre racing bucket and six-point racing harness, while one of the two passenger seats has been deleted in the name of lightness.</p> \n <p>“With an unwavering focus on performance, and free from road-going legislation and maintenance considerations, the T50s will achieve astonishing performance on track, demonstrating the full extent of the car’s capabilities,\"&nbsp;Murray said. \"We’ve thrown everything at pushing this car beyond the levels of anything that’s been done before. It’s a celebration of British engineering and our team’s extensive motorsport experience.”</p> \n <p>GMA is currently discussing the potential for a GT1 sports club and race series with the SRO Motorsports Group, with Murray's team offering a full range of pit, garage, and support equipment for owners. Owners will receive a 'Trackspeed' customisation pack that includes set-up, training, racing and support, with options to fine-tune suspension and chassis balance to suit their driving style.</p> \n <p>According to the company, the T50s will carry a \"historically significant\" name, which is set to be announced later this year alongside the official reveal of the car. This suggests it could carry the GTR name seen on track-only versions of <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/mclaren/f1-1992-1998\">the Murray-penned McLaren F1</a>, to which the T50 is a spiritual successor. There's a chance it will reference the&nbsp;BT46 designation carried by the original Brabham fan car, also designed by Murray.</p> \n <p>The road-going T50 sold out within 48 hours of its official unveilling. Just 100 cars will be built, in the UK, throughout 2022. Production of the 25 racing T50s cars will then follow in early 2023.</p> \n <p><strong>READ MORE&nbsp;</strong></p> \n <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/gordon-murray-t50-v12-powered-mclaren-f1-successor\">Gordon Murray T50 is V12-powered McLaren F1 successor​</a></strong></p> \n <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/gordon-murray-making-£28m-t50-supercar-reality\">Gordon Murray on making the £2.8m T50 supercar a reality​</a></strong></p> \n <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/opinion/new-cars/why-gordon-murray-t50-could-be-daily-driver\">Why the Gordon Murray T50 could be a daily driver​</a></strong></p> \n <p><span class=\"wysiwyg-embed\"></span></p> \n <iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oavyKN479Qw\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\n <p></p> \n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 03 Sep 2020 16:01:24 +0000","feedId":13379,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"701e5c7b5602a3b684f9d64ba833e49b","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/gordon-murray-automotive-t.50s.jpg?itok=q-CH4Rz_":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn88@2020_5/2020/09/05/08-50-45-891_09bc6da553d8b11f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295843550},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","title":"New Hyundai Tucson: teaser pics show bold new design","link":"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/new-hyundai-tucson-teaser-pics-show-bold-new-design","description":"<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/new-hyundai-tucson-teaser-pics-show-bold-new-design\"><img src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/1hyundaitucson2.jpg?itok=SkNz38ng\" width=\"190\" height=\"125\" alt=\"Hyundai Tucson\" /></a>\n<blockquote class=\"image-field-caption\">\n  Hyundai Tucson\n</blockquote> Fourth-generation SUV is set for major overhaul, with new-look design and high-tech interior overhaul \n<div> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-reviews/hyundai\">Hyundai</a> has given the first official glimpse of the new <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/hyundai/tucson\">Tucson</a> ahead of its unveiling&nbsp;on 15 September, promising a “revolutionary redesign” for the SUV.</p> \n <p>The Korean manufacturer has released a series of teaser images previewing both the exterior and interior styling of the fourth-generation Nissan Qashqai rival, which Hyundai says reflects an “avant-garde Parametric Dynamics&nbsp;design theme”.</p> \n <p>The exterior teaser photos show that the Tucson will be given a bold new front grille along with bold front lights referred&nbsp;to as ‘parametric hidden lights’.&nbsp;The&nbsp;daytime running lights are integrated into the grille, with Hyundai saying they will only be visible when switched on.</p> \n <p>The new Tucson's interior showcases Hyundai’s vision of a “dual cockpit layout”, with a large portrait-angled touchscreen built into the centre of the dashboard and minimal use of physical switchgear.&nbsp;</p> \n <p>Sangyup Lee, Hyundai’s global design boss, said that the new Tucson’s design continued the marque’s Senuous Sportiness&nbsp;design language.

Volkswagen claims that the entire production and delivery process is carbon neutral, even including the shipping.&nbsp;</p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/volkswagen/id-3/first-drives/volkswagen-id-3-2020-review\"><strong>Autocar's Volkswagen ID 3 2020 review</strong></a></p> \n <p>The limited-run First Edition models are priced&nbsp;from £38,880&nbsp;and were&nbsp;offered only to people who&nbsp;previously placed a £750 deposit. First Edition versions of the ID 3 will feature the mid-size 'Pro' battery offering a claimed range of 260 miles, and will feature special badges and extra kit. Buyers will also be offered 2000kWh of charging via We Charge, which Volkswagen claims is enough for 34 rapid charges and worth around £500.</p> \n <p>General sales of the ID 3&nbsp;are due to begin in the UK in the coming weeks, and the model will eventually be offered in seven main variants, with three different battery capacities and two power outputs.</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/the_first_truck_leaves_port_with_customer_id.3_1st_editions.jpg?itok=R2WoOvJX\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>The late stages of the ID 3's development has been hit by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/volkswagen-id-3-delays-continue-software-problems-pile\">well-publicised&nbsp;software issues</a>, and the early cars delivered to customers in September will be without a number of software features, including the&nbsp;augmented-reality functions for the car's head-up display (although these won't be&nbsp;offered on initial UK models)&nbsp;and some of&nbsp;the App Connect features.</p> \n <p>The first machines that have arrived in Britain will be without some of the App Connect, but those who take delivery of them will be given membership of a 'First Movers' club, which will include an eventual software update to install the software. Those leasing cars also won't pay any rates for the first three months.</p> \n <p>Speaking about the decision to launch the car before the full software system is available, Silke Bagschik, Volkswagen's e-mobility sales chief, said: \"The software is&nbsp;not yet up to Volkswagen standards that we want to give to customers, but we wanted to give them the option of having the car and enjoying the driving experience of it as much as we are. And we will upgrade all the software when it's ready.\"</p> \n <p>The electric hatchback will eventually be offered with three&nbsp;battery&nbsp;capacities and two power outputs. The First Edition model&nbsp;will use the mid-size 'Pro' 58kWh battery for&nbsp;a claimed range of 260 miles.&nbsp;It <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/volkswagen/id-3/first-drives/volkswagen-id-3-2020-review\">will offer 201bhp driven through the rear wheels</a>, 229lb ft of torque and a top speed of 99mph. The car can be charged through a 100kW DC connection or a 11kW AC system.</p> \n <p><span>The mid-size Pro battery will eventually be offered with two power outputs, with a lower 143bhp version that will be aorund two seconds slower to reach 0-62mph.&nbsp;</span></p> \n <p><span>The 45kWh Pure battery will be offered with outputs of 125bhp and 148bhp, while the largest 77kWh Pro S battery will use the 201bhp motor. Because of the extra weight of the battery, the&nbsp;Pro S model will only be offered with a four-seat layout.</span></p> \n <p>In Germany, the ID 3 First will be offered in three trim levels –&nbsp;basic, Plus and Max - although only the mid-level version will intially be offered in the UK.</p> \n <p>The ID 3 First cars offered in the UK will feature 19in alloy wheels, 30-colour ambient lighting, heated seat and steering wheel, and matrix LED front and LED rear lights. The First models will feature&nbsp;an Exterior Style Silver pack featuring a silver roofline and grey sills and bumpers. Buyers can choose from four exterior colours and three interior schemes.</p> \n <p><img alt=\"\" class=\"image-body-image\" height=\"601\" src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/id.3_1st_editions_being_unloaded_at_port_4.jpg?itok=eoRhpCR6\" width=\"900\" /></p> \n <p>The UK-bound models also come with a rear-view camera as standard, along with automatic cruise control, rear privacy glass and an anti-theft alarm. Notably, the mid-level ID 3 First models that will be offered in the UK at launch don't&nbsp;come with the top-level cockpit infotainment system that includes the head-up display. That means the only software upgrade UK buyers will require will be for&nbsp;the full App Connect features.</p> \n <p>General ordering for the ID 3 for those who haven't pre-booked will open four weeks after the car first goes on sale. Volkswagen has yet to outline trim levels and pricing for those models, or when various power levels and battery sizes will be introduced.</p> \n <p>Volkswagen offered a pre-ordering service for the ID 3 First, with more than 35,000 customers worldwide <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/motor-shows-frankfurt-motor-show/volkswagen-id-3-electric-nissan-leaf-rival-be-revealed\">placing a refundable deposit</a>. Those who placed a deposit in continental Europe were able to buy their cars from 17 June onwards. The delay in the UK was due to the&nbsp;extra time required to gain type approval for right-hand-drive versions.</p> \n <p><span>Volkswagen sales boss Jürgen Stackmann</span>&nbsp;claimed&nbsp;that Volkswagen was still aiming to meet its target of building 100,000 ID 3s this year&nbsp;but that it might be unable to fully recover from the extended shutdown in the second half of the year.</p> \n <p>Prices for the ID 3 in the UK will eventually start from around £27,500 before the government grant&nbsp;for the entry-level 45kWh Pure version.&nbsp;</p> \n <p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p> \n <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/volkswagen/id-3/first-drives/volkswagen-id-3-2020-review\">Autocar's Volkswagen ID 3 2020 review</a></strong></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/volkswagen-id-3-delays-continue-software-problems-pile\"><strong>Volkswagen ID 3 delays continue as software problems mount</strong></a></p> \n <p><a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/volkswagen/id-3/first-drives/volkswagen-id-3-2020-review\"><strong>First drive: 2020 Volkswagen ID 3 prototype</strong></a></p> \n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 09:20:25 +0000","feedId":13379,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"8a8989018a6fb6325947827b5b46cf57","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/the_first_id.3_drives_off_the_ship.jpg?itok=BFmVG5CH":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn8@2020_1/2020/09/05/08-50-46-015_de03e26ee7c86cb4.webp","https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/the_first_truck_leaves_port_with_customer_id.3_1st_editions.jpg?itok=R2WoOvJX":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn12@2020_4/2020/09/05/08-50-47-062_5fdc2572850ef485.webp","https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/body-image/public/id.3_1st_editions_being_unloaded_at_port_4.jpg?itok=eoRhpCR6":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn73@2020_4/2020/09/05/08-50-44-891_07c1e6a11cd3e699.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295843551},{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","title":"Renault Megane Sport Tourer E-Tech 2020 review","link":"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/renault/megane/first-drives/renault-megane-sport-tourer-e-tech-2020-review","description":"<a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/renault/megane/first-drives/renault-megane-sport-tourer-e-tech-2020-review\"><img src=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/1a-renault-megane-e-tech-phev-2020-uk-fd-hero-front.jpg?itok=HoUTR0lx\" width=\"190\" height=\"125\" alt=\"Renault Megane Sport Tourer E-Tech PHEV 2020 first drive review - tracking front\" title=\"Renault Megane Sport Tourer E-Tech PHEV 2020 first drive review - tracking front\" /></a> New plug-in hybrid version of handsome Megane estate gets driven on UK roads in left-hand-drive guise There’s more to this facelifted fourth-generation Renault Mégane Sport Tourer than a lightly revamped cabin and a few modest exterior styling tweaks.&nbsp;The big news here is that the estate version of Renault’s accomplished C-segment model is now available as a plug-in hybrid, with the tax-friendly status and feel-good eco credentials that the addition of a plug socket and supplementary electric motor inevitably brings.&nbsp;It joins the newly released hybrid Clio supermini and the plug-in Captur crossover in Renault’s expanding ‘E-Tech’ family of partly electrified vehicles, and the hope is that these new models will help warm customers up to the idea of owning a fully electric vehicle (such as the Zoe) further down the line.They all make use of the same normally aspirated 1.6-litre four-cylinder petrol engine, which is paired with a smaller electric motor and an integrated starter-generator. But where the Clio is only a conventional hybrid and so comes with a 1.2kWh battery for short bursts of electric-only driving, the Captur and Mégane gain a larger 9.8kWh (7.5kWh gross) power source.&nbsp;So the plug-in Mégane can travel a WLTP-certified 30 miles on nothing but electricity alone; manages a claimed economy figure of 217.9mpg; and thanks to a lab-tested CO2 emissions rating of 30g/km, falls into the 10% benefit-in-kind tax bracket. Company car owners will no doubt find that last part appealing.","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 02 Sep 2020 05:01:24 +0000","feedId":13379,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"18ba5c100275c5d6330a375896a35e5d","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/car_review_image_190/public/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/1a-renault-megane-e-tech-phev-2020-uk-fd-hero-front.jpg?itok=HoUTR0lx":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn48@2020_6/2020/09/05/08-50-46-115_848b8f7072f1321d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1599295843551}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","updatedTime":"2020-09-05 16:50:43","feedId":13379,"fetchDate":"Sat, 05 Sep 2020 08:50:43 +0000","fetchMs":868,"handleMs":1174,"totalMs":53473,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":50,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"259fd9e3ae01f734143a220053069654","hostName":"europe65*","requestId":"70d4078b9dd14d359c4a314fe80f45ea_13379","contentType":"application/rss+xml; charset=utf-8","totalBytes":10850792,"bgimgsTotal":0,"bgimgsGithubTotal":0,"articlesImgsTotal":167,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":155,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx8":6,"myreaderx15":6,"myreaderx7":6,"myreaderx6":6,"myreaderx16":6,"myreaderx32":6,"myreaderx4":6,"myreaderx10":5,"myreaderx11":6,"myreaderx33":6,"myreaderx3":6,"myreaderx12":5,"myreaderx2":6,"myreaderx1":6,"myreaderx13":5,"myreaderx30":5,"myreaderx31":6,"myreaderx18":5,"myreaderx19":6,"myreaderx":6,"myreaderx25":6,"myreaderx27":6,"myreaderx21":6,"myreaderx22":5,"myreaderx24":6,"myreaderx5oss":6,"myreaderx29":5},"failGithubMap":{"myreaderx14":6,"myreaderx23":6}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 04:38:30","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 04:38:30","id":13379,"name":"Autocar RSS Feed","url":"http://www.autocar.co.uk/rss/latestnews/","subscriber":null,"website":null,"icon":"https://www.autocar.co.uk/favicon.ico","icon_jsdelivr":null,"description":"Welcome to nirvana for car enthusiasts.
