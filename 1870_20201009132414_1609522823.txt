Avoid limp stalks. Choose stalks of equal thickness to ensure even cooking times.</li> \n <li><strong>Broccoli</strong>: Choose broccoli with firm stalks, tight florets, and crisp green leaves. Avoid yellowed or flowering florets.</li> \n <li><strong>Brussels Sprouts</strong>: Choose firm, compact, bright green heads. Avoid sprouts with wilted or loose outer leaves.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Noticing a trend? You want FIRM vegetables, not soggy or squishy ones. Just start there, and look for the veggies that seem healthy to you. You can always get better at judging vegetable quality later.</p> \n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">2) CONSIDER PRE-CUT VEGGIES:</span>&nbsp;</strong>If you’re worried about picking out fresh vegetables – I know this can be intimidating – look into buying pre-cut bags of vegetables! I personally love buying pre-cut broccoli and cauliflower, and bags of Brussels sprouts.</p> \n<p>These are generally on the wall next to the fresh veggies, and might cost slightly more than the produce you bag up yourself.</p> \n<p><em>That’s because a lot of the work is DONE FOR YOU!</em></p> \n<p>I’m all for anything that reduces the number of steps between you and “veggies in your tummy:”</p> \n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3557942\" src=\"https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/circuit_training_is_a_win_win_win.gif\" alt=\"precut veggies are a win win win\" width=\"377\" height=\"226\" /></p> \n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">3) LEARN HOW LONG YOU HAVE TO EAT THE VEGGIE</span>:</strong></p> \n<p>Once you’ve bought your veggies, use <a href=\"https://stilltasty.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">StillTasty.com</a>, to figure out how long you can leave them in your fridge:</p> \n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3603404\" src=\"https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Asparagus.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"649\" height=\"271\" srcset=\"https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Asparagus.png 649w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Asparagus-300x125.png 300w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Asparagus-600x251.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 649px) 100vw, 649px\" /></p> \n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3603405 size-full\" src=\"https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Brocolli.png\" alt=\"You have 3-5 days with fresh broccoli before it goes bad.\" width=\"646\" height=\"268\" srcset=\"https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Brocolli.png 646w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Brocolli-300x124.png 300w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Brocolli-600x249.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 646px) 100vw, 646px\" /> <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3603406 size-full\" src=\"https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Brussels-Sprouts.png\" alt=\"you have 3-5 days with brussels sprouts before they go bad.\" width=\"652\" height=\"267\" srcset=\"https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Brussels-Sprouts.png 652w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Brussels-Sprouts-300x123.png 300w, https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Brussels-Sprouts-600x246.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 652px) 100vw, 652px\" /></p> \n<p><strong>Generally speaking, you’ll be good if you cook a vegetable within 3 days of bringing it home:</strong> you can <a href=\"https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/a-step-by-step-guide-to-meal-planning-and-prep/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">batch cook large quantities</a> and then you’ll have MANY more days before the food goes bad.</p> \n<p>If you’re NOT sure if you can still cook a veggie, or if it’s gone bad…give it a smell.

Give me a plate full of roasted broccoli covered in “Everything but the Bagel” seasoning from Trader Joes, and it’s Veggie Valhalla.</p> \n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3854025\" src=\"https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/gopher-gif.gif\" alt=\"A gopher with veggies gif\" width=\"496\" height=\"280\" /></p> \n<p>If you don’t like a particular vegetable yet, try preparing it a different way! From raw to steamed to baked to grilled to sautéed in bacon grease (see #4) to blended, you have so many options!</p> \n<p><strong>2) Blend them up! </strong>Add frozen spinach or kale to your <a href=\"https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/protein-shakes-for-newbies-what-to-buy-when-to-drink/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">protein shake smoothies</a>. This is my personal favorite, and is part of the reason I get so many servings of vegetables every day.</p> \n<p><strong>Here’s my post-strength training workout smoothie:</strong></p> \n<ul> \n <li>12 oz of water.</li> \n <li>2 scoops of whey protein.</li> \n <li>1/2 cup of Quaker Oats.</li> \n <li>1 cup of frozen mixed berries.</li> \n <li>1 cup of frozen spinach.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Believe it or not, adding frozen spinach (or kale) doesn’t really change the taste AND you can get an extra serving of vegetables without trying.</p> \n<p><em>That’s one extra daily serving of a super veggie!</em></p> \n<p><strong>3) Make a combo bite with a food you like:</strong>&nbsp;If you can learn to cook something like <a title=\"Chicken Stir Fry\" href=\"https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/2011/02/21/a-decent-meal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">chicken stir fry</a>, you can make sure that every vegetable bite also has plenty of rice and chicken.</p> \n<p>You can do the same if you make mini potatoes, chicken, and broccoli.
