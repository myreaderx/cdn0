They depict two seascapes, two sailboats, and a skeleton in the middle. Its title comes from a quote by Patrick Geddes, a city planner noted for his improvements to the living conditions of Edinburgh's then-infamously crowded and unsanitary Old Town. According to Geddes: \"A city is more than a place in space, it is a drama in time.\"</p>\n<p>Located near the Calton Road (downhill) terminus of the well-known<a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jacobs-ladder\"> Jacob's Ladder</a>, the artwork draws meaning from the Ladder itself, which can be seen as a connection between the Old and New Towns. Additionally, it leads to the many monuments atop Calton Hill, which also offer views of the Firth of Forth, Edinburgh's gateway to the sea.</p>\n<p>One of the most notable monuments of Calton Hill is dedicated to Robert Burns, considered <a class=\"destination-link place-destination-link\" title=\"Things to do in Scotland\" href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/scotland\" data-destination-link-kind=\"place\" data-geo-id=\"4406\" data-title=\"Scotland\" data-slug=\"scotland\">Scotland</a>'s national poet. Active during the late 18th-century, Burns once intended to emigrate to <a class=\"destination-link place-destination-link\" title=\"Things to do in Jamaica\" href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/jamaica\" data-destination-link-kind=\"place\" data-geo-id=\"4610\" data-title=\"Jamaica\" data-slug=\"jamaica\">Jamaica</a> and oversee a plantation worked by slaves. His boat was set to depart from Edinburgh's port of Leith, but his precarious financial situation kept him from following through. Instead, he stayed in Scotland and eventually gained stronger abolitionist views, which lead to his poem \"The Slave's Lament\".</p>\n<p>While neither Fagen nor the Edinburgh Art Festival state that \"A Drama in Time\" is directly related to the African slave trade by European powers, Fagen has addressed Burns's \"Lament\" in other works. Considering the imagery of European Age of Discovery-style boats alongside sunny beach scenery and a representation of death, it's likely that the work is meant to relate to the heavy legacy of major European cities such as Edinburgh itself, and perhaps, slavery.</p>\n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 16:00:00 +0000","feedId":51,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"13e8c4052473469176d168d35223f6fe","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/media/W1siZiIsInVwbG9hZHMvcGxhY2VfaW1hZ2VzLzUwYmQ3NTNmLTYxYzctNDFiNC1iZTc3LTk5ZDc0MDlmOGVlYzc3ZDc4MDk1ZjBkOTRmY2RhOV9JTUdfMjAyMDA5MzBfMTc0NjIzNzUzLmpwZyJdLFsicCIsImNvbnZlcnQiLCItYXV0by1vcmllbnQgIl0sWyJwIiwidGh1bWIiLCIzMjAyeDIxMzUrMzI1KzAiXSxbInAiLCJjb252ZXJ0IiwiLXF1YWxpdHkgODEgLWF1dG8tb3JpZW50Il0sWyJwIiwidGh1bWIiLCIzMDB4MjAwIyJdXQ/IMG_20200930_174623753.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx29/cdn42@2020_6/2020/11/17/16-31-14-147_dda746efc374e943.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605630674029},{"createdTime":"2020-11-18 00:31:14","updatedTime":"2020-11-18 00:31:14","title":"Jarjeer Mule And Donkey Refuge in Marrakesh, Morocco","link":"https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/jarjeer-donkey-refuge","description":"\n        <p><img alt=\"Jarjeer Mule And Donkey Refuge\" data-width=\"2496\" data-height=\"1664\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/media/W1siZiIsInVwbG9hZHMvcGxhY2VfaW1hZ2VzL2RiMTJhNzliLTRkZDUtNDI0Ny05ZTBmLTgzZjAwYjlkZGI5OWFiYTEyYzBmY2U2NzgyODU1MF9CTF9KYXJqZWVyXzEyLmpwZyJdLFsicCIsImNvbnZlcnQiLCItYXV0by1vcmllbnQgIl0sWyJwIiwidGh1bWIiLCIyNDg0eDE2NTYrMCs4Il0sWyJwIiwiY29udmVydCIsIi1xdWFsaXR5IDgxIC1hdXRvLW9yaWVudCJdLFsicCIsInRodW1iIiwiMzAweDIwMCMiXV0/BL_Jarjeer_12.jpg\" /></p> <p>Exiting <a class=\"destination-link place-destination-link\" title=\"Things to do in Marrakesh, Morocco\" href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/marrakesh-morocco\" data-destination-link-kind=\"place\" data-geo-id=\"2751\" data-title=\"Marrakesh, Morocco\" data-slug=\"marrakesh-morocco\">Marrakesh</a> (Marrakech), the view seems to empty out like sand in an hourglass and becomes all sky. The highway to the south runs along a line of futuristic-looking lights and eventually arrives at the Jarjeer Mule And Donkey Refuge.</p>\n<p>Terracotta cubist buildings mirror the minimalist logo of Jarjeer. The refuge is comprised of a home, stables, and corrals, as well as courtyards and fountains set in landscaping crisscrossed by footpaths, bees, and butterflies.</p>\n<p>The refuge is the creation of Susan Machin and Charles Hantom, who were both lawyers in <a class=\"destination-link place-destination-link\" title=\"Things to do in England\" href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/england\" data-destination-link-kind=\"place\" data-geo-id=\"4396\" data-title=\"England\" data-slug=\"england\">England</a> before retiring and purchasing the land where the refuge is housed. The idea arose when the two worked with an animal rescue organization and took home a donkey that needed more long-term care. After someone else brought them another donkey, the idea of creating a sanctuary began to take form. The couple brought in dozens of equines, as well as several dogs.</p>\n<p>A visit to the sanctuary is both heartwarming and heartbreaking. Once animals are brought to the refuge, they stay for the rest of their lives and are never tethered. It's truly a retirement home for donkeys who were working animals most of their lives. They roam free and are fed twice a day on alfalfa and sugar beets.</p>\n<p>Some of the animals’ stories are truly horrifying and the marks still show on their bodies. Working donkeys are often abandoned if they become injured in <a class=\"destination-link place-destination-link\" title=\"Things to do in Morocco\" href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/morocco\" data-destination-link-kind=\"place\" data-geo-id=\"4568\" data-title=\"Morocco\" data-slug=\"morocco\">Morocco</a> and many arrive at the sanctuary in poor physical condition. Caleche horses often arrive starved because their owners can’t feed them without substantial business from tourists. However, the center does a great job of helping the animals rebound.</p>\n<p>There are many tragedies in these animals’ backstories, but the overall experience of Jarjeer is uplifting. Witnessing the animals being comforted and at peace is an enlightening experience. </p>\n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 15:00:00 +0000","feedId":51,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"e7fe863d5f29c8eb3f767496ddea5e95","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/media/W1siZiIsInVwbG9hZHMvcGxhY2VfaW1hZ2VzL2RiMTJhNzliLTRkZDUtNDI0Ny05ZTBmLTgzZjAwYjlkZGI5OWFiYTEyYzBmY2U2NzgyODU1MF9CTF9KYXJqZWVyXzEyLmpwZyJdLFsicCIsImNvbnZlcnQiLCItYXV0by1vcmllbnQgIl0sWyJwIiwidGh1bWIiLCIyNDg0eDE2NTYrMCs4Il0sWyJwIiwiY29udmVydCIsIi1xdWFsaXR5IDgxIC1hdXRvLW9yaWVudCJdLFsicCIsInRodW1iIiwiMzAweDIwMCMiXV0/BL_Jarjeer_12.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn39@2020_2/2020/11/17/16-31-31-588_c87fbb4e94c2b457.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605630674028},{"createdTime":"2020-11-18 00:31:14","updatedTime":"2020-11-18 00:31:14","title":"Leather Balls and 3,000-Year-Old Pants Hint at an Ancient Asian Sport","link":"https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/found-ancient-balls-xinjiang","description":"\n        <p>A little over 3,000 years ago, a roughly 40-year-old man was laid to rest in a cemetery in what is now the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region in Northwest China. He was wearing fancy pants. Possibly the oldest trousers in the world, they had an enlarged crotch area, indicating he spent a lot of time on horseback. A pair of red leather boots completed the ancient ensemble.</p>\n<p>But perhaps the most curious component of the grave was a leather ball, around the size of a human fist. When it was excavated in the 1970s, no one knew how old the tomb was. Now, the leather balls have finally been dated to approximately the same period as the pants. The results were published in the open-access <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X20303679?dgcid=raven_sd_aip_email#!\"><em>Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports</em></a><em>. </em></p>\n<p>“We can now confirm that these three leather balls from Yanghai are the oldest leather balls in Eurasia,” says Patrick Wertmann, an archaeologist at the University of Zurich and lead author of the recent study. “They were life tools, used for play or useful training.”</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/78636/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>The grave in question is just one of 3,000 found at Yanghai, in the Turpan Basin. Since 2003, just over 500 of the graves have been excavated, and three of them—including the tomb of the well-to-do horseman—yielded the balls, two of which were marked with a red cross.</p>\n<p>In the first millennium BC, Yanghai was home to a sophisticated community of horseback riders. Wertmann says they were some of the earliest horse domesticators in the area, and that the presence of the balls—and the depiction of horseback ball games elsewhere in China—suggests that the balls may have been used for sport. The Yanghai Tombs, as they are known, span nearly 1,400 years, and most have been well-preserved. The most recent date to the Han Dynasty, or roughly the 2nd century. The site offers archaeologists a glimpse of what mattered to these ancient riders, from their riding trousers to their red-leather boots.</p>\n<p>“The whole Turpan Basin is like a treasure trove because of the climate conditions,” Wertmann says. “It's extremely hot and extremely dry. For us as archaeologists it’s really good, because all these organic materials are naturally preserved, including textiles, leather, wood, and also the human animal and plant remains that are not usually preserved in archaeological contexts.”</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/78642/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>The balls—which are stuffed with wool and hair, wrapped in treated rawhide, and crimped closed on top—look a lot like large soup dumplings. They’re half a millennium older than other excavated balls from Eurasia, according to Wertmann. At least one of the balls had strike marks and had apparently burst open, perhaps after it was struck in a game. The red crosses—which also show up in later Chinese art depicting stick-and-ball games—may have been painted to help the tan balls stand out from the brown landscape.</p>\n<p>The balls were no joke. “They’re actually really hard,” Wertmann says. “You could compare these leather balls from Yanghai with modern baseballs.”</p>\n<p>More recent art from elsewhere in China shows polo-like games being played on horseback with sticks. Curved wooden sticks were also found in some graves in Yanghai, though they are younger than the leather balls, so the two were not necessarily used in tandem.</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/78637/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>“I appreciate how cautious the authors are in their interpretations of these balls, essentially saying we cannot determine based on current evidence that these balls can be linked with polo,” says Jeffrey Blomster, an archaeologist at George Washington University who has worked on numerous ball-game sites in Mesoamerica, and who is unaffiliated with the recent paper. “While we cannot say for sure what kind of game, or even activity, was performed using these balls, the fact that all three are nearly the same size suggests a similar use for all three.”<br /><br />With thousands of graves left to excavate at Yanghai, archaeologists may learn more about the exact purpose of these balls. The elements of sport are there, and for the researchers who study them, the game’s afoot.</p>\n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 14:00:00 +0000","feedId":51,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"fd80b29088935afc34bc7ca2a04f1d4a","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Isaac Schultz","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/78636/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn38@2020_4/2020/11/17/16-31-14-405_4ef53c58ece00e3c.webp","https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/78642/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn32@2020_5/2020/11/17/16-31-14-180_b89b9913a6122e7e.webp","https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/78637/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn36@2020_4/2020/11/17/16-31-14-275_c7b2ce560f9e6542.jpg"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605630674031},{"createdTime":"2020-11-18 00:31:14","updatedTime":"2020-11-18 00:31:14","title":"Abandoned Badbea in Highland Council, Scotland","link":"https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/abandoned-badbea","description":"\n        <p><img alt=\"Abandoned Badbea\" data-width=\"3072\" data-height=\"2304\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/media/W1siZiIsInVwbG9hZHMvcGxhY2VfaW1hZ2VzLzA1YWQxODI3LTExYTItNGVlNC1hOWZjLTU3NWJjMjViZmQ0Y2JkZWI2MjdlMDIxMTc0MGZiMF9CYWRiZWEzLmpwZyJdLFsicCIsImNvbnZlcnQiLCItYXV0by1vcmllbnQgIl0sWyJwIiwidGh1bWIiLCIzMDY3eDIwNDUrMCsyNTkiXSxbInAiLCJjb252ZXJ0IiwiLXF1YWxpdHkgODEgLWF1dG8tb3JpZW50Il0sWyJwIiwidGh1bWIiLCIzMDB4MjAwIyJdXQ/Badbea3.jpg\" /></p> <p>Records show that this area was originally inhabited around 1793, but Badbea is most famous for the remains of the clearance village.
