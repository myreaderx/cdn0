Can It Help Solve The World’s Most Pressing Social And Environmental Problems?\" /><p>With the arrival of Blockchain technology and its potential to disrupt the status quo, we have a relatively new &#8216;fix&#8217; (or at least some bandaids) for many of our most severe problems as a civilisation.</p>\n<p>We have not changed that much since we started farming communities in the Agricultural Age some 10,000 years ago, followed by the Industrial Revolution several centuries ago and the Information Age.</p>\n<p>Some are calling the next epoch already &#8211; the Big Data Age, which also envelops IoT, AI and of course Blockchain. But I would argue that we are entering an attention economy as attention is becoming more scarce with all the digital distractions in our lives now,</p>\n<p>Other&#8217;s believe optimistically that technology will take us to a new renaissance with what some call the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagination_age\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Imagination Age or Creative Age</a>  — where creativity and imagination will become the primary creators of economic value. While I would love to see us advanced bipeds all entertain each other for a living, we also have to be careful that we don&#8217;t end up like the fat people in WALL-E. Or wake up to a barrage of Kardashian clones and drones. We need to revamp many of our current civilisation&#8217;s self-inflicted problems.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://richardkastelein.com/walle.jpg\" alt=\"creative imagination age - walle?\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" /></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s time for the next leap of technologies that will evolve us from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Age\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Information Age</a> to a new epoch where we must make a paradigm shift to solve some of our civilisation&#8217;s most significant problems. We must use decentralisation technologies like Blockchain as well as IoT, AI, Robotics, Quantum Computing, and technologies we don&#8217;t even know today.</p>\n<p>I see the blockchain revolution is analogous to the net revolution in 1994-2002 which popped similarly to the ICO fervour 2016-2018 early players, both investors and entrepreneurs did well. Still, suddenly everyone&#8217;s feet got cold, and there was an exodus in both cases.</p>\n<p>In the Netherlands where I live, the first real economic bubble took place with tulips of all things. Interestingly <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_mania\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Wikipedia prefers to call it &#8220;tulip mania&#8221;</a> rather than a bubble. Mania is perfectly apropos, however, as it was crazy!</p>\n<p>When the Dot Com bubble exploded and expected winners like pets.com got laughed out the door. But that guy who wanted to sell used books online from Amazon. He stuck around. Now he sells everything at a<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong> <span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">small</span> </strong></span>company called Amazon.</p>\n<p>In the last millennium, the Internet was a toy. Today it&#8217;s not a game, it&#8217;s integral for most humans on the planet.</p>\n<p>Now it&#8217;s the centre of most people&#8217;s social, economic, educational delivery, dating. Food supplier et al. It found it&#8217;s way back after the crash in Silicon and so will Blockchain and cryptocurrencies.</p>\n<p>We already see more economic activity in the Security Token markets and almost multinational companies beyond banks, are working on Blockchain Projects. And like the Dot Com bubble, our industry is now coming out of the bottom of a Gartner trough.</p>\n<p>In reality, most consumers will never even understand or maybe even hear the word Blockchain — it&#8217;s not upfront, it runs on algorithms and will always be a foundational technology that makes people&#8217;s lives better.</p>\n<p>And what matters is the fact Blockchain will contribute towards the improvement of many people&#8217;s daily lives. And what better means of doing therefore than taking on the <a href=\"https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">United Nations (UN&#8217;s) Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)</a>?</p>\n<p>There are many techno-pundits that this technology has the potential to shift the balance of power far from centralised authorities within the field of communications, business, and even politics or law. While some talk about Blockchain being over-hyped and underdeveloped, many corporations, entrepreneur, governments and institutions are taking the technology too seriously. Linked <a href=\"https://www.ledgerinsights.com/linkedin-blockchain-most-in-demand-hard-skill-in-2020/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">wrote that the most in-demand hard skills in 2020 are in the Blockchain industry.</a></p>\n<p>Most of this year&#8217;s hard skills are in rapidly evolving fields and emphasise the importance of analysing data, and 2020 is the first year Blockchain has topped LinkedIn&#8217;s in-demand skills list.</p>\n<p>Many Blockchain-based use cases are already being explored in law, finance, education, government, agricultural, energy, health and plenty of different sectors of economic and non-commercial activities.</p>\n<p>There are some Blockchain success stories, but we are not there yet. This is like 1994 with the Internet at the technological level, while Tokenomics feels more like just after the Millenium when the market&#8217;s crashed during the Dot Com times and people were tentative about the Internet. Particularly some of the mainstream media like Newsweek.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.the-blockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NEWSWEEK.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-50610\" src=\"https://www.the-blockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NEWSWEEK-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"How Will Blockchain Technology Be Leveraged To Solve  Un&#039;s 17 Sustainable Development Goals?

Most Central Banks globally are working with Blockchain technology to create <a href=\"https://www.the-blockchain.com/?s=cbdc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC)</a>. Digital currencies decentralise the money system allowing for more equitable distribution of wealth and create a pathway to <a href=\"https://www.the-blockchain.com/?s=%22universal+basic+income%22\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> Universal Basic Income.</a></p>\n<p>Cryptocurrencies and other blockchain-based tokens can also help lift the world&#8217;s two billion-strong unbanked population to trade and transact more. Initiatives such as BitPesa and CariCoin are beginning to gain traction, and blockchain solutions are disrupting the vast global remittances market and easing the burden of migration.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/@wmougayar/tokenomics-a-business-guide-to-token-usage-utility-and-value-b19242053416\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\"> Tokenomics</a> can put grease on the wheels of the global economic system and decentralise banking and financial systems.</p>\n<p>The ability to &#8216;tokenise&#8217; both digital assets (with <a href=\"https://www.the-blockchain.com/?s=cryptocurrency+%22digital+assets%22\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cryptocurrencies</a> and<a href=\"https://www.the-blockchain.com/?s=%22NFT%22\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> non-fungible tokens</a>) and<a href=\"https://www.the-blockchain.com/2017/10/19/proof-suite-announces-token-sale-blockchain-platform-designed-tokenize-insure-real-world-assets/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> real-world assets </a>(real estate, gold, equity, bonds and even an Andy Warhol painting ) will create a financial system where more people can have access to liquidity.</p>\n<h3>GOAL 2: End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture</h3>\n<p>Blockchain technology is also being used to sort out<a href=\"https://www.the-blockchain.com/2016/05/19/blockchain-startup-bitland-to-implement-blockchain-property-records-in-ghana/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> land rights in Ghana </a>where many are now getting legal rights (on an immutable ledger rather than in a corrupt government workers desk).</p>\n<p>Nature Magazine <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/550043e.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\"> writes</a>:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;Blockchain could boost food security Blockchain technology is helping to meet sustainability challenges &#8211; for example, in renewable energy and conservation </em><em>Food security could also benefit from the technology&#8217;s transparency, relatively low transaction costs and instantaneous application. Blockchain assignment of unique digital identifiers to food products would make them traceable through supply chains, along with their growth conditions, batch numbers and expiry dates. This would help to prevent food waste, allow consumers to work out the ecological footprint of their food, and guide the distribution of surplus food to those who need it. This shared and immutable register of foods and transactions would prevent fraud and enable source identification of a foodborne illness. And as digital technologies are used to manage farms, Blockchain will promote sharing of on-farm data. &#8220;</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>The World Food Programme is currently expanding its Ethereum-based Blockchain after saving millions of dollars in bank transfers by utilising decentralised blockchain technology. Now, the WFP feeds over 100 million people across 80 countries.&#8221;</em></p>\n<h3>GOAL 3: Good Health and Well-being</h3>\n<p>Health records are a mess. There has never been a system like <a href=\"https://www.the-blockchain.com/?s=health+blockchain+records\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> Blockchain that can allow for the level of both security and privacy needed in healthcare.</a></p>\n<p>Meaning all those doctors and hospitals records, you scatter in different hospitals and different specialists can be available in a kind of Blockchain locker (which may act like a person&#8217;s self-sovereign identity). Medical records, social data, biological ID, genetic information would be decentralised.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.the-blockchain.com/?s=Self-sovereign+identity+target=\" rel=\"noopener\"> Self-sovereign identity </a>starts with the notion that we all are the makers of our own identity, online and off. Because they do not rely on any centralised authority, self-sovereign identity systems are decentralised, mirroring the way identity works in real life.</p>\n<h3>GOAL 4: Quality Education</h3>\n<p>Think immutability again now with <a href=\"https://www.the-blockchain.com/2019/04/23/nine-major-universities-to-build-blockchain-solution-for-digital-academic-credentials/target=\" rel=\"noopener\">college records, </a>academic proficiency and progress records.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;Much like the Internet, the Blockchain is a decentralised network that creates a new paradigm for thinking about future social infrastructures. This innovation has particular relevance in the area of professional and academic certifications. The Blockchain is an immutable ledger of transactions replicated across a global network. Historically, this ledger is used to record financial transactions (who sent it, who received it, and how much was sent). This same infrastructure is now used to record the conferring of achievements (academic degrees, professional training, licenses to practice, prizes, and the like) using the same general data structure (who issued it, who received it, and an encrypted record that is used for verification).&#8221; the Blockchain acts as a notary to record and later verify any professional or academic claim, without having to consult a centralised authority.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/4-ways-blockchain-will-transform-higher-education/#:~:text=Improve%20record%20keeping-,The%20most%20promising%20use%20case%20for%20blockchain%20in%20higher%20education,an%20intermediary%20to%20verify%20them.target=\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Gartner outlines </a>&#8220;The most ambitious uses for blockchain in higher education could disrupt the industry.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>GOAL 5: Gender Equality</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/how-blockchain-can-be-used-to-promote-gender-equality\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\"> By using Blockchain to create a more accessible and open financial system, we can empower people, </a>especially those left out or underserved by today&#8217;s infrastructure.

These assets have been proven to garner returns for investors over time and represent opportunities for wealth generation that were not historically accessible to the majority of people. That is, until now, with the development of fractional asset ownership enabled by tokenisation. Blockchain technology forms the foundation for the next version of the sharing economy, which could be even better for regular people because of investment opportunities.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Tokenising real-world assets like cars, real estate, and art, will enable that outside of the one per cent to take part in this high-valued asset economy, which is crucial for the health of the economy overall. In a recent Nasdaq article, Peter Daisyme stated, &#8220;ownership is an important concept in a thriving economy, giving people the chance to grow their wealth by buying and holding assets.&#8221; We are living in the perfect time to introduce new technology to assist more people in participating in such growth opportunities.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>Real estate comprises an asset class that tends to appreciate over time, but one that is not easy to buy into. By enabling fractional ownership, the market can be open to all, allowing anyone to get a slice of the pie regardless of net worth. Similar to other assets such as exotic cars, fine art, wine, and jewellery, people can now take part and invest their money into digital assets that will continue to grow in value over time.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>By applying blockchain technology&#8217;s capabilities for fractional ownership to value asset classes, we can bring about an upgraded version of the current sharing economy; one that works for everyone and not just the 1%. As this fractional ownership model can be utilised for any real-world asset, blockchain technology is the solution we need that will help boost economies and solve investment inequalities.&#8221;</em></p>\n<h2>GOAL 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities</h2>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;Blockchain is not the first -and certainly will not be the last- network fever we will experience. This paper shows how blockchain networks will disrupt the urban context as well, similarly to what it is happening in the fintech and insurtech spaces, among many other emerging application domains. We put forward the Future Living Framework as the meta use case of more comprehensive research called Blockchain4Cities. In this use case, which uses the UN&#8217;s New Urban Agenda (NUA) as exemplifying model, we show the benefits of using Blockchain in the urban field. We do so by breaking down the NUA in policies, planning, regulations and standards and dissecting these further into Quito&#8217;s Implementation Plan (QIP) themes and scopes. Use case results confirm that Blockchain will disrupt urban networks, like Cybernetics did in 1948, Ekistics a decade later, and the Metabolists and Webbists in the late sixties. The Ubiquitous Computing arrived later, in the seventies, and disrupted all the previous network efforts, lasting until the current Internet of Things (IoT) and its sister concept Smart Cities, when IoT is used in an urban context. Blockchain is here to take on and be the next network for cities.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;it is Blockchain&#8217;s decentralised and disruptive approach what will eradicate the subordination of physical networks to virtual ones thanks to its inherent coopetition networking environment. Next, section three tackles our sustainability challenges and unveils how Blockchain&#8217;s competitive environment, plus its immutable accountability capabilities, will naturally empower and incentivise citizens to deliver codes as physical actions. Lastly, section four presents the example that uses the New Urban Agenda as a use case to prove sections&#8217; three arguments: it will be this a bottom-up implementation of economic, environmental and social codes and people&#8217;s codes ownership what will make us succeed in tackling our fundamental global challenges.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Leveraging Blockchain for Sustainability and Open Innovation: A Cyber-Resilient Approach toward EU Green Deal and UN Sustainable Development Goals By<a href=\"https://www.intechopen.com/books/computer-security-threats/leveraging-blockchain-for-sustainability-and-open-innovation-a-cyber-resilient-approach-toward-eu-gr#B14target=\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> Paula Fraga-Lamas and Tiago M.

Cybersecurity should be implemented by design in the underlying technologies (e.g., IoT, AR, AI).</em></li>\n<li><em>It is related to an organisation (e.g., corporation or individual) acknowledgement of the impact of its actions, assuming responsibility for them. It implies to quantify the internal and external effects of the activities and report them to all the stakeholders. Such reporting needs to be understandable, relevant, reliable, and comparable between different organisations and over time.</em></li>\n<li><em>It implies that the external impact can be obtained from reporting by all the external stakeholders. </em></li>\n<li><em>It is the ability to identify and trace assets (e.g., products, parts, processes, events, data, and materials) from their origins to production and distribution processes and, ultimately, until the end of their life cycle. Regarding Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM), it also relates to human rights (e.g., fair trade, safety in labour, and privacy) and anti-corruption laws [18]. Therefore, it is a critical organisational capability to foster sustainability. Two main categories can be considered within traceability: internal (i.e., tracking and tracing assets within an organisation) and external (i.e., it seeks to know the flow of information and assets between different logistics systems and processes among several organisations).&#8221;</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;The Industry 4.0 paradigm is expected to represent the next phase in the digitalisation of all the sectors in the economy [8]. Supply chain traceability has been traditionally performed by wireless technologies like radio-frequency identification (RFID) [44], which can be enhanced with additional security capabilities [45]. The next step forward is the so-called smart label [46], which adds novel features like event detection, interaction, and IoT capabilities. Such IoT solutions link cyber and physical worlds while enabling the tracking and monitoring of assets and processes. Thus, Blockchain goes one step further, making feasible end-to-end transparency in global supply chains. Business data can be shared rapidly between the different stakeholders across a trusted network [13]. Also, smart contracts provide lower transaction costs by avoiding the intervention of intermediaries and third parties.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p><em>Dr John Clippinger <a href=\"https://law.mit.edu/pub/rmsllc/release/1target=\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"> points out:</a></em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>&#8220;One can imagine a kind of robotic building that uses new materials, AI, IOT, and sensors to provide adaptive spaces that change according to time, circumstance, energy, use, and occupant.

By creating a broad market signal that verifiably identifies asset classes that are negatively correlated with fossil-based industries and assets, investors gain the financially credible option for divesting themselves of fossil-based assets and allocating portions of their portfolios to z-carbon and equitable asset classes.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>The independent algorithmic certification of asset attributes and behaviours are rapidly maturing in blockchain applications for logistics, supply chain, renewable energy, and trading. These initiatives will pave the path toward z-carbon asset allocation options.

In 2015, they took on Haiti. First, a considerable majority of citizens — especially in rural areas — are un-banked, they lack access to traditional banking services. Second, they&#8217;re more vulnerable to institutional corruption, which makes any activity where wealth is accumulated vulnerable.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><em>We knew that to deploy our program, and we needed a secure and transparent system to track, record and store the value that citizens would bank when they turned in their recycled plastic at a local redemption centre.
