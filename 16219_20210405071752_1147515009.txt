Yes, it’s been a weird week filled with news articles about digital art selling for millions of dollars. Huh? Exactly. Well, after reading way too many articles that still didn’t really help me understand what an NFT is <em>{Non-Fluffy-Towel?}</em>, I invited my good friend, artist <a href=\"http://treyspeegle.com/\">Trey Speegle</a>, to come on the podcast to give us the inside scoop, because if anyone can put the FUN in “Non-FUNgible Tokens”, it’s Trey! He dipped his toe into the NFT pool this past Wednesday, so we talked on Tuesday for the <em>“I wonder what’s going to happen”</em> conversation, and then we hit record again on Friday for the <em>“did anything happen or not”</em> follow up!
