In 2016, <a href=\"https://www.allure.com/story/estee-lauder-bought-too-faced-cosmetics\">the brand was bought by Estee Lauder </a>for a staggering $1.45 billion.</p><p>Ironically, Blandino used to work at the Estee Lauder beauty counter back in the 1990s, a time when he says \"everyone was taking makeup way too seriously.\"&#160;</p><p>\"It was very regimented, very controlled, very step one, two, three, four,\" he told Business Insider. \"I just realized very quickly, being a guy working behind the counter, that they were missing the fun, creative dream aspect of beauty.\"&#160;</p><p>He said his experience behind the counter inspired him to cofound a brand that would inspire people to \"dream and to reinvent themselves every day to express themselves.\"&#160;</p><p>\"This is all about giving you self-confidence in the world to go conquer and do anything you want to do,\" cofounder Jeremy Johnson told Business Insider.</p><p>The branding of Too Faced has allowed it to remain a millennial favorite for over two decades. It's one of the best-selling makeup brands at Sephora, and has an acclaimed mascara that, for instance, <a href=\"https://www.allure.com/review/too-faced-better-than-sex-mascara\">won the 2020 Allure reader's choice poll</a>. But the brand is proving Gen Z-friendly, too. It has <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/toofaced/?hl=en\">13.2 million followers on Instagram</a>, and had <a href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/too-faced-lip-plumper-tik-tok-213123041.html\">a lip plumper go viral on TikTok</a> back in the spring.&#160;</p><p>\"The world's getting smaller — the internet and social media, it's brought us all so much closer together,\" Blandino said. \"These social stars, these kids on YouTube, these fabulous and amazing makeup artists, these boys and men, who are wearing makeup in their own way — it's just such a whole new, amazing world of beauty that we're just so thrilled to be a part of.\"&#160;</p><p>But of course there are some aspects of business that are universal, and Blandino shared four pieces of advice for aspiring entrepreneurs looking to create their own robust brands.&#160;</p>\n<div id=\"slideshow\">\n\tLook to create a brand that is authentic\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f64f1ac57b7da001ee12802?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Too Faced\" height=\"3582\" width=\"4776\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Dave Kotinsky / Stringer / Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>Blandino said authenticity is very important for both brands and entrepreneurs looking to create a company.</p><p>In fact, creating something authentic should be at the heart of a business, as should developing authentic relationships with customers and brand partners. The latter, he said, are an important and \"incredibly\" powerful way to get brand messages across.&#160;</p><p>\"The days of just paying somebody to you show your product, while there is no relationship with the brand, are gone. I think people see through that and it's disingenuous,\" he said. \"It is so important to align yourself with social stars and influencers who you believe really vibes and is on the same beat as your brand.\"</p>\n\tEmbrace new technology — yes, even TikTok\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5ed50a855af6cc053b7e0c53?format=jpeg\" alt=\"TikTok\" height=\"1667\" width=\"2222\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Lionel Bonaventure/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>New technology platforms seem to pop up every decade or so, but Blandino said it's important to embrace each and every one of them.</p><p>\"It's just another layer of creativity, another layer of expressing your brand and connecting with your client in a very immediate way through something that's incredibly entertaining entertainment,\" he said.</p><p>\"It's incredibly similar and totally different in many ways, but in the end, it is just about connecting with your customer, with your client and sharing your brand through a really personal way.\"&#160;</p>\n\tAim for your company to have a unique perspective and purpose\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f64f29a57b7da001ee1280b?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Too Faced\" height=\"3999\" width=\"5333\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Presley Ann / Stringer / Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>It's also important for a company to have a unique perspective, vision, and purpose, Blandino said.&#160;</p><p>\"You must come in with something new, with something personal,\" he continued. \"Otherwise, the world doesn't need another Too Faced. You know, it exists.\"</p><p>He stressed that aspiring entrepreneurs need to have perseverance, and it's important to truly believe, not only in yourself, but also in the company you are trying to create.</p><p>\"You've got to have a belief deep down that the world needs you,\" he continued. \"It can't just be, 'I want to be rich.' You need to have a passion and a purpose to bring something to the world.\"&#160;</p>\n\tBeing an entrepreneur will knock you down — but it's important to get back up\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f64ef93323fc4001e0d7277?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Too Faced\" height=\"1536\" width=\"1920\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of Too Faced</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t<p>Blandino is all too familiar with stress, but said that it's imperative to never give up &#8212; even if there is a a new \"struggle\" every day.&#160;</p><p>\"From having a retailer in the very early days, declare bankruptcy and take a bunch of your products and not pay you, to figuring out when you have something super-successful &#8212; how can you order enough of it and catch up to catch up to the momentum?\" he said, recounting his experiences launching Too Faced. \"That's something we still still struggle with today, but you don't give up. You find a way, you don't give up. Failure's not an option.\"&#160;</p>\n</div><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/cofounder-of-too-faced-gives-career-advice-for-aspiring-entrepreneurs-2020-9'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=i9jGSaMSTi0:ZqVRyUChqrc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=i9jGSaMSTi0:ZqVRyUChqrc:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=i9jGSaMSTi0:ZqVRyUChqrc:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=i9jGSaMSTi0:ZqVRyUChqrc:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=i9jGSaMSTi0:ZqVRyUChqrc:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=i9jGSaMSTi0:ZqVRyUChqrc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=i9jGSaMSTi0:ZqVRyUChqrc:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=i9jGSaMSTi0:ZqVRyUChqrc:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/i9jGSaMSTi0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 20 Sep 2020 13:50:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f64eee9323fc4001e0d7270?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"1608f322116a4fad2740723bb0a53458","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn69@2020_6/2020/09/20/17-35-50-070_e5415a36abaef317.webp","destWidth":1536,"destHeight":1152,"sourceBytes":76756,"destBytes":76756,"author":"ddavis@businessinsider.com (Dominic-Madori Davis)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5f64ef1e323fc4001e0d7273?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn100@2020_4/2020/09/20/17-35-47-847_a1946ee7788869b5.webp","https://i.insider.com/5f64f1ac57b7da001ee12802?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn95@2020_4/2020/09/20/17-35-48-627_8bdd91c254a442af.webp","https://i.insider.com/5ed50a855af6cc053b7e0c53?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn73@2020_4/2020/09/20/17-35-35-696_ab6a62eef642accc.webp","https://i.insider.com/5f64f29a57b7da001ee1280b?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn3@2020_6/2020/09/20/17-35-45-633_c8446edf502264ae.webp","https://i.insider.com/5f64ef93323fc4001e0d7277?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn63@2020_4/2020/09/20/17-35-40-447_552138c02a7c059a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn62@2020_4/2020/09/20/17-35-46-023_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=i9jGSaMSTi0:ZqVRyUChqrc:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn75@2020_6/2020/09/20/17-35-37-110_d8f878bbb984541c.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=i9jGSaMSTi0:ZqVRyUChqrc:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx33/cdn87@2020_4/2020/09/20/17-35-48-639_3787c2239e2abf95.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=i9jGSaMSTi0:ZqVRyUChqrc:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx3/cdn35@2020_2/2020/09/20/17-35-40-200_e3bdd2a2b886ec28.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/i9jGSaMSTi0":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn8@2020_5/2020/09/20/17-35-47-156_ad063a3c1638bf08.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1600623333132},{"createdTime":"2020-09-21 01:35:33","updatedTime":"2020-09-21 01:35:33","title":"The EU wants to give itself the power to kick US tech giants out of Europe","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/eu-new-powers-tech-giants-2020-9","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f67201a323fc4001e0d7501?format=jpeg\" alt=\"FILE PHOTO: European Internal Markets Commissioner-designate Thierry Breton of France speaks during his hearing before the European Parliament in Brussels, Belgium, November 14, 2019.

But, as she told Business Insider, she recently turned 30 and found that her city needs and wants had changed.&#160;</p><p>\"I wanted things that NYC just couldn't offer, even on a $90,000 salary for a single, fiscally responsible person,\" she said. \"I wanted a good quality of life, space in my home, a less crowded existence especially in my commute and general day-to-day, and access to the outdoors for some mental healing.\"&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f63cbe4323fc4001e0d6ff1?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Denver Colorado skyline\" height=\"1668\" width=\"2223\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Denver, Colorado.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Brad McGinley Photography / Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>When the pandemic struck, she lost her job as a sales account executive in tech and was paying $2,000 a month for a fourth-floor walk-up apartment with roach problems. \"There was nothing to stay in NYC for,\" she said.</p><p>But even as NYC no longer felt like the answer, she wasn't prepared to give up her career in the tech industry or city life altogether. Enter: Denver.&#160;</p><p>Occean said the mountain city \"ticked so many boxes I needed in this stage of my life.\" Despite never having visited, the practicality of the decision and the fact that her sister had just moved there was enough to prompt her to take the leap in June. Now, she's living in a North Capitol Hill apartment where she's paying nearly $600 less a month and living in 300 more square feet than her former NYC apartment.</p><h2>A practical place to weather the pandemic</h2><p><strong>Name</strong>: Naka Canlas Potts, 27</p><p><strong>Moved from</strong>: Denton, Texas</p><p><strong>Moved to</strong>: Fort Collins, Colorado</p><p>Nika Canlas Potts, 27, moved to Fort Collins with her spouse in August because of the pandemic. Before the move, the couple had been living in Denton, Texas, for 10 years. Potts told Business Insider she doesn't think the pandemic is anywhere near over.</p><p>\"It came down to the idea of, 'Where do we want to spend the next year of the pandemic,'\" she said, adding that the hobbies that had kept them sane during the beginning of the pandemic — walks, hikes, and camping — became impossible as Texas grew hot and humid. Moving to a foothills city in Colorado, she said, gave them the opportunity to be outside and partake in safe, socially distant activities.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f63cc74323fc4001e0d6ff5?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Fort Collins Colorado\" height=\"1668\" width=\"2223\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Footbridge over Cache la Poudre River at whitewater park in downtown Fort Collins, Colorado, with Powerhouse Energy Campus of Colorado State University in background.\n<p class=\"copyright\">marekuliasz / Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Potts said she found leaving Denton easy because many places had shut down to never reopen, and they were working remotely for the foreseeable future. Even though they've only been in Fort Collins for a week, she said they're already loving it because it allows for more physical activity, has public transportation, and has better weather.&#160;</p><p>Colorado doesn't offer Potts a more affordable lifestyle, but she thinks they're getting their money's worth. Even though they're paying $600 more a month in rent for a house similar to the one they had in Texas, they don't have to drive as much, run the air conditioning as frequently, or pay for a gym membership, which cuts down on other costs.</p><p>\"We definitely will need to be more thrifty here, but so far, it has felt worth it,\" she said.</p><h2>The promise of a better lifestyle</h2><p><strong>Name</strong>: Alissa Johnson, 23</p><p><strong>Moved from</strong>: Minneapolis, Minnesota</p><p><strong>Moved to</strong>: Aurora, Colorado</p><p>A better lifestyle is what drew 23-year-old Alissa Johnson to Aurora, Colorado, in May. She and her boyfriend had been living in a rocky part of northern Minneapolis, Minnesota. They visited a few friends in Colorado and \"fell in love,\" she said, describing the state as a mix between Washington and Minnesota.</p><p>Back in Minneapolis, Johnson found herself in some frightening situations as a bystander in both a robbery at a dollar store and police search that she said involved 25 cop cars and a helicopter. \"I had this gut feeling of, 'You need to leave,'\" she said.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f63cfdd323fc4001e0d7006?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Aurora Colorado shopping mall\" height=\"1664\" width=\"2218\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Pedestrians walk by a fire pit and the clock tower along South Main Street at Southlands Mall in Aurora, Colorado.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Anya Semenoff / Contributor</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>She found a place for herself and her boyfriend in about two days, she said. They're paying about $100 more a month in rent, but thinks it's worth the swimming pool and gym in the building.</p><p>She said she's thankful she listened to her gut. \"If we would have stayed, we would have been directly in the area of the riots and protests in Minneapolis,\" she said. \"We had gone back to visit family, and the gas station that I had gone to every morning was burnt down and people were flooding the streets at night.\"</p><p>Colorado, she said, has been good for her because she's a \"big outdoorsy person\" who likes a view and clean water — two things she said Minneapolis lacked.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-flocking-to-colorado-pandemic-wears-on-2020-9'>Business Insider</a></div><div

holiday shopping season — as the industry weathers a year unlike any before.</p><p>To do so, stakeholders are looking to create a brand-new shopping festival called \"10.10,\" taking place online on October 10.</p><p>The occasion is a nod to China's massive Singles' Day shopping event, which happens on November 11 (11/11) each year. In 2019, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/alibaba-singles-day-beats-amazons-estimated-prime-day-sales-2019-11\">Singles' Day generated about $38.3 billion in sales</a>, according to Alibaba, which hosts the 24-hour shopping extravaganza.&#160;</p><p>With 10.10, American retailers can look to \"create excitement\" and \"bring back the magic and the fun of shopping,\" according to Coresight Research's founder and CEO, Deborah Weinswig, who conceptualized the festival along with&#160; rewards app Shopkick.&#160;</p><p>As part of the festival, the group is encouraging retailers to run special promotions on October 10. There's also a charitable element, as customers shopping with participating retailers will be given the option to donate their earned rewards to a charity of their choice. Shopkick will create a website for the festival. The retailers participating in the event have not been disclosed.</p><p>The timing of 10.10 is no coincidence. As the holiday shopping season draws closer, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/holiday-shopping-could-bring-issues-for-retailers-execs-2020-8\">retailers are beginning to warn</a> that their systems could become overloaded and customers could face order delays close to the holidays. Shipping volumes <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-retail-shipping/fearing-shipping-crunch-retailers-set-earliest-ever-holiday-sale-plans-idUSKBN25H158\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"60\" data-uri=\"d5def91ff01fbce141d67c890dd74f91\">have been unusually high</a> as consumers opt to shop online and stay largely at home amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. If more people are shopping around the same time due to the holidays, the problem could get worse.&#160;</p><p>By hosting a festival at the beginning of October, Weinswig said, the group hopes to \"pull the shopping season forward\" so that demand can be spread out for a longer period of time.</p><p>The festival is a form of \"thinking about how to elongate the season, how to make sure that that product is delivered when the consumer wants to give it and to get it,\" Weinswig said.&#160;&#160;</p><p>Other <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/holiday-deals-target-kohls-nordstrom-begin-before-thanksgiving-2020-8\">retailers including Kohl's, Target, and Nordstrom</a> have said they'd begin holiday deals in October or November in order to allow for safe environments in stores and to avoid potential shipping bottlenecks.

Back in March, my daughter's school closed, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/quarantined-with-ex-husband-since-march-covid-pandemic-2020-7\">I moved back in with my ex-husband</a> to safely co-parent, and my freelance work began to dry up. Like most everyone, my daily routine and creature comforts were completely gone, and I felt like a mess.</p><p>I've never been the Gywneth Paltrow, glowy, goddess-of-perfection-and-wellness type, but in the past, self-care meant getting to an exercise class in the morning or meeting up with friends for dinner. Without access to these, at the start of quarantine, I became a person who was always reaching for my phone, obsessively reading the latest news alerts and living in a constant state of fear.&#160;</p><p>After completely losing my cool with my daughter one night, I knew that something had to give. I felt I'd lost myself, and it was taking a toll on those closest to me. I needed to find a way to feel grounded again. I thought of my former methods of self-care, considered my therapist's (often ignored) suggestions, and did a little research. Then, I came up with a ritual to better start and end my day.&#160;</p><h2><strong>I've started waking up earlier for alone time to prepare for the day.</strong><strong>&#160;</strong></h2><p>For someone coping with anxiety or depression, simply facing the day can be overwhelming, but <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-gen-y-psy/201810/the-power-routines-in-your-mental-health\">studies show</a> that maintaining a consistent daily routine can greatly benefit your mental health. I have certainly seen the results firsthand.&#160;</p><p>I wake up around 6 a.m. to ensure that I'm up before my daughter has a chance to barge in with an array of nuanced questions about sea animals. Sure, sleeping in for a few extra hours can be rejuvenating, but if I wake up and am immediately thrown into the madness of the day, I feel perpetually behind. Instead, taking about 20 minutes total for myself has helped to increase my productivity, energy, and overall mood.</p><h2><strong>Before anyone needs my attention, I go to my dedicated space and get still.&#160;</strong></h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f64cefd57b7da001ee12731?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Katie Nave\" height=\"3024\" width=\"4032\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Nave starts her day at 6 a.m. for some quiet time before her daughter wakes up.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Katie Nave</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>I've found it helpful to sit in the same spot in the corner of my bedroom each morning, light incense or a candle, and say a quick prayer or simply listen to my breath. I bought my floor cushion from a woman I met in Mexico, but there are <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/listing/716435574/meditation-cushion-seating-floor-pillow?ga_order=most_relevant&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_search_query=floor+cushion&ref=sr_gallery-1-5&organic_search_click=1&pro=1&frs=1_click=1&#38;pro=1&#38;frs=1\">similar cushions</a> available online that can ship almost anywhere. For me, this isn't a religious practice or a formal meditation. It is simply a way to get still, get quiet, and get centered.</p><p>I've also started pulling<a href=\"https://hauswitchstore.com/collections/tarot-oracle-decks/products/55724\"> tarot cards</a>&#160;each morning to help inspire reflection and direction. While this is likely not for everyone, I got inspired to do so after spending a weekend with my wonderfully witchy friend who walked me through how to do a simple tarot spread.

Ideally, before starting the day, I'll take a few minutes to jot down my thoughts, purge my fears, and create a gratitude list. Getting super granular about specific areas of gratitude is a great anecdote for stress. A list may simply include my healthy lungs, my daughter's soft snores, a thoughtful text from a friend, or my cup of coffee.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f64cfc557b7da001ee12736?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Katie Nave\" height=\"2274\" width=\"3024\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Nave has tried to write a journal entry each day during quarantine.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Katie Nave</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>I keep a stack of <a href=\"https://www.papersource.com/desk/lively-floral-journals-10001293.html\">simple journals from Paper Source</a> next to my bed that I try to write in each day.

I'm not alone in this, as <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/us-study-finds-covid-19-pandemic-transforms-cell-phone-usage-301066502.html\">studies show</a> that the pandemic has led to a large increase in cell phone usage. We're all feeling bored, lonely, and seeking pleasure. However, each time we pick up our phones, the flood of alerts can cause stress hormones to go through the roof.</p><p>Putting my phone away about an hour before bed and taking space to decompress from the day has helped me to feel more calm and has drastically improved my sleep.</p><h2><strong>A simple meditation practice at night helps me to sleep better. </strong></h2><p>I've always been resistant to meditation. I get itchy, bored, or simply fall asleep while attempting a long, formal practice. It annoyed the shit out of me when my ex discovered transcendental meditation, so it's likely that I'm still holding a personal grudge. Still, <a href=\"https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/meditation-in-depth\">studies show</a> that meditation is highly beneficial to one's mental and physical health, so I've stopped trying to fight it.</p><p>I've recently embraced the practice of sitting still, listening to my breath, and clearing my mind for a few minutes each night.

The thoughts expressed are those of the author.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, thinks that drug companies may develop a <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/fauci-predicts-safe-effective-coronavirus-vaccine-end-year-n1239055\">COVID-19 vaccine before year's end</a>.&#160;&#160;</p><p>But that doesn't mean the pandemic will be over. Far from it.</p><p>Distributing hundreds of millions of vaccine doses will pose an enormous challenge, and our country's medical supply chain — responsible for producing, transporting, and delivering crucial equipment and treatments nationwide — is <a href=\"https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-1326\">already overwhelmed</a>.&#160;</p><p>From shortages of life-saving medical devices to logistical obstacles, the United States is woefully unprepared — especially since the upcoming flu season will complicate the rollout of any such vaccine. Dismantling these roadblocks in the supply chain is the only way to end this pandemic.</p><h2>With the oncoming flu season, essential medical materials will be in short supply</h2><p>COVID-19 cases started soaring in the United States in mid-March, as the 2019-2020 flu season was winding down. We haven't yet experienced an entire season with influenza and the coronavirus both circulating at full force.&#160;</p><p>A concurrent surge without adequate preparation would be a disaster — for patients, providers, and the supply chain. COVID-19 and the flu both cause similar respiratory symptoms. Hospitals and ICUs experienced severe shortages of critical supplies toward the beginning of the pandemic, forcing states to compete for life-saving resources like ventilators and respirators. Given that <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2018-2019.html\">hundreds of thousands of Americans are hospitalized with the flu each year</a>, an influx of more patients with similar needs could create even larger demand for equipment that's already in short supply.&#160;</p><p>Stopping this impending surge will require an adequate number of flu vaccines, more supplies, closely monitored delivery, and more funding — all of which the vaccine supply chain already struggles with.&#160;</p><p>Even before COVID-19, there were <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-vaccine-makers-are-hunting-for-vital-equipment-glass-vials-11592317525\">limited reserves of the medical-grade glass</a> used to make vaccine vials. The glass contains a specific composition of chemicals, which makes it more resistant to temperature changes and helps keep vaccines stable. It takes days or weeks to melt and mold it into the necessary vials.&#160;&#160;</p><p>The syringes used to inject inoculations are also running low. The United States needs an <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/07/02/covid-mask-shortage-left-us-unprotected-syringes-next/5359482002/\">estimated 850 million more syringes</a> to distribute both coronavirus and seasonal influenza vaccines. As of May, it only had 15 million syringes stockpiled, and the current efforts to close that gap are not very reassuring. Though the Department of Health and Human Services has contracted with several companies to manufacture 820 million more syringes, <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/07/02/covid-mask-shortage-left-us-unprotected-syringes-next/5359482002/\">only 420 million will be available by the end of the year</a>, according to reporting from USA Today.</p><h2>Keeping vaccines cold enough during transportation poses another challenge</h2><p>Beyond the scarcity of materials, there are shortcomings within the \"cold chain\" for vaccines. The cold chain is a section of the supply chain that requires temperature control. It's a necessary component of the transportation process for a number of different goods — ranging from ice cream to insulin.&#160;</p><p>Vaccines have to be kept at a constant, cool temperature, typically between 35 and 46 degrees Fahrenheit, even when transported across the country. Outside of this range, they lose their potency and must be thrown away. Many of the COVID-19 vaccines in development may <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-19-vaccine-race-turns-deep-freezers-into-a-hot-commodity-11599217201\">require even cooler temperatures</a> — dipping as low as negative 112 degrees Fahrenheit — making cold chain transportation even more challenging.&#160;</p><p>While there have been advances in technology used to refrigerate in-transit vaccines, mistakes can still happen far too easily. It only takes one trucking leg or storage facility that isn't temperature-controlled to spoil an entire batch.&#160;</p><p>If there's any hope in preventing vaccine shortages and the havoc that would wreak on our nation's health care system, these issues must be addressed.</p><h2>Fortunately, our political leaders can help — and already are</h2><p>The US government has entered into contracts with multiple private companies like <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-vaccine-makers-are-hunting-for-vital-equipment-glass-vials-11592317525\">SiO2</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/drugmakers-race-to-build-covid-19-vaccine-supply-chains-11596101586\">Corning</a>, allowing them to expand their manufacturing capacities and make more medical-grade vials. Fostering more of these longstanding partnerships between government and private commercial enterprises would help alleviate roadblocks in the vaccine supply chain by preventing shortages of crucial materials, long before those supplies are needed.&#160;</p><p>The government could also rethink how it allocates vaccines. Typically, flu vaccines are distributed based on cities' and states' populations. But this approach doesn't reflect the share of the population that is willing to actually get the vaccine. When the uptake rate in a population is low, unused vaccines accumulate. Health officials should take historical uptake rates into account to prevent surpluses in some regions and shortages in others.&#160;&#160;</p><p>Even still, these changes won't help without a more streamlined cold chain transportation process. New temperature-controlled delivery technologies can prove expensive. But making simple changes — like limiting handoff points, consolidating shipments, and monitoring the temperature of shipments in real-time — can mitigate damages to scarce vaccine supplies.&#160;</p><p>Developing an effective COVID-19 vaccine is merely the beginning of the end of this pandemic. To wipe out the virus, lawmakers need to address shortfalls in the vaccine supply chain.&#160;</p><p><em>Purushottam Meena, Ph.D., is an associate professor of operations management in the School of

This year has been absolutely devastating for a myriad of reasons, but it has also had a few bright spots. I got married, left my job, started a business, and moved to a new apartment.&#160;</p><p>When I was younger, I would let one awful event ruin my day, week, or even month. Every time something good happened, the awful thing I worried about would loom over me like a perpetual dark cloud. One of the biggest lessons I've learned this year is that good and bad&#160;<em>can</em> coexist. When something's bad, it's not&#160;<em>all</em>&#160;bad, and vice versa.</p><p>My birthday is approaching, so I wanted to reflect on my 28th year of life and share some practical nuggets that I've found useful.</p><h2><strong>1. The quality of your work will eventually catch up to your ambition.</strong></h2><p>I've been working on The Profile for three years. It's come a long way since then. The reason it has gotten better is because I didn't give up on it — even when it was bad.</p><p><a href=\"https://theprofile.substack.com/p/ira-glass-the-king-of-storytelling\">Ira Glass said</a>&#160;that everybody who does interesting, creative work went through years where they had really good taste and could tell their product wasn't as good as they wanted it to be. It fell short. And that's exactly when most people quit.</p><p>It took Glass 10 years of podcasts for him to feel like his taste caught up to his ambition. The only way to close the gap between taste and skill? Doing the work week after week, day after day. \"It is only by going through a volume of work that you're going to catch up and close that gap,\" he said.</p><h2><strong>2. Find ways to fall into intellectual rabbit holes.</strong></h2><p>When I sit down to write, I typically draw on my experiences for ideas. But during quarantine, those real-life experiences have dwindled. So I've had to learn how to create an environment that facilitates falling into rabbit holes.</p><p>The first way I do that is by pestering interesting people to have conversations with me. The second is to go on a walk outside and&#160;<em>actively</em> observe my surroundings. And finally, I sometimes just take a book from my bookshelf, open it to a random page and start reading. Ideas are all around us… we just need to notice them.</p><h2><strong>3. Take mental breaks throughout the day.</strong></h2><p>After a long period of staring at the screen, my mind starts screaming. That's when I know I need to take a break. For me, there are several activities that soothe me, and I use them to break up my day in three chunks.</p><p>In the morning, I do 10 to 20 minutes of yoga. In the afternoon, I exercise for about 30 minutes. And in the evening, I take a walk with Anthony for about 45 minutes to an hour. All three things are physical because they get my blood flowing, allowing me to step away from technology and let my mind wander. This has been the single-best, most-rewarding change I've made in the last year.</p><h2><strong>4. Chase what you don't know.</strong></h2><p>It's so damn easy to label ourselves a certain type of person. For a long time, I was a \"journalist.\" Suddenly, I'm an entrepreneur! Who knows what I'll be five years from now? The point is not to let your identity become stagnant.</p><p>Actor Willem Dafoe, who has played a Spider-Man villain, Vincent van Gogh, and Jesus, <a href=\"https://time.com/5714746/willem-dafoe-the-lighthouse-interview/\">says</a> that so much of what we do is predicated on an idea of ourselves that we're trying to protect. It's part of the reason he enjoys playing such a range of characters. He's always chasing after what he doesn't know. \"Do things that don't let you decide definitively who you are and the way things are,\" he said.</p><h2><strong>5. Be interesting, not perfect.</strong></h2><p>I used to optimize for perfection. Now I optimize for being interesting. Think about the favorite people in your life. Do you care that their hair is perfectly combed? Or do you not even notice that because you're so captivated by their brain?</p><p>Whether it's art, movies, or books, people talk more about the flawed things that get stuck in their heads than they do the obvious, perfect things.&#160;<a href=\"https://theprofile.substack.com/p/the-profile-dossier-malcolm-gladwell\">Malcolm Gladwell</a> said, \"You want an aftertaste, and that comes from not everything being perfectly blended together. The question is: What is interesting? That's what has to drive any creative act.\"</p><h2><strong>6. Competence is the antidote to fear.</strong></h2><p>I used to be absolutely terrified of public speaking. At the thought of it, I'd start nervously sweating. But here's the thing: Things aren't scary. People get scared.</p><p>I learned this from&#160;<a href=\"https://theprofile.substack.com/p/the-profile-dossier-chris-hadfield\">astronaut Chris Hadfield</a>. He uses the following example: When you first learned how to ride a bike, you were fearful because you could crash and hurt yourself. Then, as you got better and more confident in your skills, it became silly to be afraid of a bike. Yet the bike itself didn't change — it remained just as dangerous as it always was. <em>You</em>&#160;are the one who changed. Competence breeds confidence.</p><h2><strong>7. Your choices belong only to you and no one else.</strong></h2><p>One of my biggest worries before I left my job at Fortune was: \"What if I disappoint someone?\" When I think about this question now, I am amazed at the self-centered assumption it implies. Who — aside from my incredibly supportive family — cares so much about my life choices that they would be ... disappointed?</p><p>The brutal truth is that we're all busy navigating our own lives to have enough time to be disappointed in other people's decisions. I've learned to normalize my life. Do whatever makes you happy, and stop letting other people's misinformed judgments dictate your day-to-day.&#160;</p><h2><strong>8. Love is not an emotion; it's a skill.</strong></h2><p>Everything in life —&#160;yes, even love —&#160;is a skill. When&#160;<a href=\"https://theprofile.substack.com/p/100-couples-share-their-secrets-to\">I asked couples for their best marriage advice</a>, the one thing that kept coming up is that they understood that a loving partnership is a constant work in progress, and there's always room for improvement.</p><p>One reader told me, \"It has to be worked on; sharpened regularly. Much like any other craft, the time that goes into keeping it fresh and vibrant must be respected. And like all important skills, it must be used.\"</p><h2><strong>9. Life is about good people and good stories.</strong></h2><p>Because we've all been in quarantine for months now, I've become much more intentional about the people I want to spend time with. Although my circle of friends has gotten even smaller, it's grown exponentially in terms of amazing conversations and unforgettable memories.</p><p><a href=\"https://theprofile.substack.com/p/the-profile-dossier-shonda-rhimes\">As Shonda Rhimes put it:</a>&#160;\"I now work to see people, not as I'd rewrite them, but as they have written themselves. I see them for who they are. And for who I am with them.\"</p><h2><strong>10. No matter what, always bet on yourself.</strong></h2><p>One of the more mind-blowing things I've realized in the last year is that no job, no person, no amount of money will ever fulfill me if my self-worth is tied to something external.</p><p><a href=\"https://theprofile.substack.com/p/i-quit-my-job-at-the-start-of-the\">I've written about this before</a>, but it's incredibly liberating to have your identity tied to your own name. The best thing I did is start The Profile in 2017 because it gave me another identity — one that allowed me to be 100% myself.</p><h2><strong>11. Get proximate to suffering.</strong></h2><p>After everything that's happened in 2020, it's become crystal clear that many of us live in a bubble.

First, I sample the regular gas-powered version, and because I like big pickups, I often end up a happy guy. But then I spend some time with the diesel-engined model, and I forget all about the gas-burner.</p><p>Diesel and pickups! Two great tastes that go great together! A beautiful friendship!</p><p>Choose your cliché, but the bottom line is that diesel power, for obvious reasons, makes sense for large trucks — especially if you intend to do any sort of serious work, haul heavy loads, or tow more than a modest camper or trailer.&#160;</p><p>Ram makes a dandy full-size pickup. The Ram 1500 was Business Insider's <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/ram-1500-pickup-truck-business-insider-car-year-winner-2019-11#:~:text=The%20RAM%201500%20pickup%20truck,of%20the%20Year%20%2D%20Business%20Insider&text=The%20word%20%22Insider%22.%22.\">2019 Car of the Year</a>, and it was a vehicle that impressed us mightily when tested on both the East and West Coasts. But the diesel is even better if you can imagine improving on greatness, as I found out when I borrowed the 2020 edition of the pickup, in a handsome \"Diamond Black Crystal Pearl-Coat\" paint job, for a week over the summer.</p><h2>Rebel, Rebel ... I love you so!</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f64c3e9323fc4001e0d7130?format=jpeg\" alt=\"RAM 1500 Diesel\" height=\"1385\" width=\"1847\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The pickup is optimized for off-roading.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Matthew DeBord/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>And what a pickup it was! The Base Crew Cab 4x4 was $47,990, but many options — including the \"Rebel Level 2\" equipment group ($3,000) and a $5,000 diesel motor — brought my as-tested price to $71,305. A tech package that added heated seats and a heated steering wheel also tacked $3,000 on the sticker, and assorted other goodies embellished the Ram by $200 to $500 here and there.</p><p>But that's the usual story full-size pickups, which are best thought of these days as nearly infinitely option-able, yielding some wide price ranges for the manufacturers that sell everything from bare-bones work trucks to luxurious half-tons.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f64c45b323fc4001e0d7131?format=jpeg\" alt=\"RAM 1500 Diesel\" height=\"1310\" width=\"1747\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>I out the RAM 1500 Rebel to use for a serious run to the garden center.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Matthew DeBord/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Allow me to explain why I was testing the Ram 1500 in the first place: gardening! We sort of amped- p our summertime gardening game this year and had to make a journey of modest distance to a center in New Jersey that we'd heard about from our gardening underground.&#160;</p><p>An SUV wasn't going to cut it; we needed a proper pickup with the proper bed. And as you can see from the photo above, we made good use of it.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f64c3cb57b7da001ee126da?format=jpeg\" alt=\"RAM 1500 Diesel\" height=\"1500\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The bed divider came in handy.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Matthew DeBord/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>The Ram 1500 I tested came with both a tonneau cover, which was easily folded back, and a bed-separator — a great feature that allowed me to divide the box into one area for heavy bags of soil and one for plants. Using the divider to create a spot for the plants close to the cab meant that I could return home at highway speed without worrying about the load shifting, and I didn't have to employ the Ram 1500's tie-down points.</p><p>The truck also had the useful RamBox \"saddlebags,\" a pair of lockable storage compartments at the bed's flanks. I didn't need them, but the feature does use the interior of the Ram 1500's body panels to create some additional capacity, where otherwise an owner might be looking at a third-party setup to tote tools or gear.</p><h2>Trading horsepower for torque, torque, and more torque</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f64c3ca323fc4001e0d712c?format=jpeg\" alt=\"RAM 1500 Diesel\" height=\"1500\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The truck also features RamBox storage compartments.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Matthew DeBord/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>The 3.0-liter, turbodiesel V6 makes 260 horsepower but — get this — 480 pound-feet of torque.</p><p>That translates into monumental pulling power. The Rebel can tow more than 12,500 pounds, all while putting up some tasty fuel-economy numbers: 21 mpg in the city, 29 on the highway, and 24 combined. (Gas-engined trucks offer a 395-horsepower V8 and a 305-horsepower V6.)&#160;</p><p>The Ram's eight-speed automatic handles all of that torque rather gracefully, piping it to the capable four-wheel-drive system. But it doesn't alter the Rebel diesel's demeanor, which put me in the mind of a small freight train when I was tooling down the highway.</p><p>The truck can go from a standstill to 60 mph in about eight seconds, and when you sum all this up, you see what the Rebel is all about: bold off-roading, an answer to the Ford F-150 Raptor.</p><p>The knobby Goodyear tires were a giveaway, but the overall packaging of my Rebel test truck suggested that one could apply the vehicle to a greater variety of tasks than just trail-busting — crammed as it was with infotainment tech, connectivity, premium appointments, and that dashing black paint job.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f64c3ca323fc4001e0d712d?format=jpeg\" alt=\"RAM 1500 Diesel\" height=\"1500\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The diesel engine was a torque monster.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Matthew DeBord/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>The blacked-out treatment went further than the paint: the $525 exterior package brought a black grille with black framing, a black Ram badge, and black 18-inch wheels.</p><p>As far as off-roading goes, I could point out that black shows dirt, but the Rebel looks so dang cool that I doubt it would stay dirty for long, if ever. This is a pickup that wants to pay frequent visits to the car wash.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f64c3c957b7da001ee126d5?format=jpeg\" alt=\"RAM 1500 Diesel\" height=\"1500\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The styling is aggressive.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Matthew DeBord/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Note, however, that there are textured running boards, making getting in and out of the lifted pickup much easier, but also making it possible to scrape mud off your boots before soiling the primo cab.</p><h2>&#160;A high-end interior and a high-end verdict</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f64c3cb323fc4001e0d712f?format=jpeg\" alt=\"RAM 1500 Diesel\" height=\"1503\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The RAM Rebel&#39;s interior was premium.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Matthew DeBord/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>The all-black exterior theme continues inside the Rebel, with plush front bucket seats and a comfy, capacious rear configuration. A dual-pane sunroof brightens the cabin considerably, but it's a $1,500 extra.&#160;</p><p>My test truck was chock full o' tech, starting with the 8.4-inch central touchscreen running Fiat Chrysler's underrated Uconnect infotainment system. This setup handles everything from Bluetooth and USB device connectivity to GPS navigation (with USB ports dedicated to charging). I enjoyed the dulcet tones of a 19-speaker Harman-Kardon premium audio system and had Apple CarPlay and Android Auto in reserve.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f64c3ca57b7da001ee126d8?format=jpeg\" alt=\"RAM 1500 Diesel\" height=\"1503\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>I fell for the Rebel.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Matthew DeBord/Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>The Ram 1500 was the best full-size pick we drove, off all the half-tons on the market, in the period from about 2015 until last year, when the new Ram grabbed top prize in our Car of Year competition.&#160;</p><p>I had no complaints about the gas-engined V8 I tested in 2019, but the diesel V6 was something special. If you aren't driving fast all the time, you grow to love the succulent surge of torque that an awesome diesel produces, and the visual presentation of the Ram 1500 Rebel intensifies that impression.</p><p>Simply put, the Ram 1500 Rebel diesel is addictive to drive and addictive to look at, in a totally badass sort of way. I think it shook up the gardening center on that day I visited — Darth Vader unsettling the 'burbs.</p><p>It's worth pointing out that although the truck has attitude galore, it also gets the job done. This imitating pickup carried flowers and potting soil home, safely and it style. And that says more about the modern, full-size pickup truck world these days than just about anything else.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

checks back into play earlier this week, calling for Republicans to get behind another big aid package.</p><p>But the Senate GOP hasn't been swayed so far — and they're doubling down on their reluctance to approve more federal spending after Democrats blocked a slimmed-down $300 billion package last week.</p><p>On Wednesday, Trump tweeted that Republicans should \"go for the much higher numbers\" on coronavirus aid. He later praised a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/bipartisan-house-lawmakers-unveil-stimulus-plan-unemployment-economy-2020-9\">$1.5 trillion relief plan</a> that a bipartisan group of 50 House lawmakers put forward.</p><p>\"Some of the Republicans disagree, but I think I can convince them to go along with that because I like the larger number,\" Trump said at a press conference. \"I want to see people get money.\"</p><p>However, top Senate Republicans immediately threw cold water on the idea.</p><p>\"This used to be the White House versus Pelosi up until about now — now the president's coming in and saying we can maybe go to $1.5 trillion,\" Senate Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-17/republicans-are-divided-again-on-stimulus-this-time-by-trump\">told Bloomberg on Thursday.</a> \"He better be careful of that because I don't think that will get through the United States Senate.\"</p><p>It indicates Trump may have limited influence prodding Republicans to support additional stimulus spending. Before negotiations collapsed last month, Trump largely sat them out, leaving it up to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows — two of his top lieutenants — to engage with Democrats.</p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong>&#160;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/investing-advice-5-portfolio-moves-second-round-stimulus-andrew-sheets-2020-9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-analytics-module=\"body_link\" data-analytics-post-depth=\"80\" data-uri=\"34eada2db0ca11066be5cd3d491c5dad\">Morgan Stanley says the stock market's future is 'unusually dependent' on another stimulus package — and recommends 5 portfolio moves to make if Congress passes another round</a></em></p><p>Democrats led by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi are insisting on at least $2.2 trillion in federal spending. They lowered their demand from $3.4 trillion, the size of an aid package House Democrats passed in May. It included provisions for additional stimulus checks, $600 unemployment benefits, and state aid.</p><p>There are still areas of fierce disagreement between Republicans and Democrats. Talks fell through in early August after both sides failed to bridge divisions on federal unemployment aid and state aid, prompting Trump to implement several executive actions.</p><h2>\"Are we trying to get the economy back up and running or should we keep it shut down?\"</h2><p>Oren Cass, executive director of American Compass and a conservative economist in contact with several congressional GOP offices, says the standoff between both parties stems from conflicting views of what a package should achieve.</p><p>\"The core disagreement: Are we trying to get the economy back up and running or should we keep it shut down?\" Cass told Business Insider.</p><p>Complicating matters is that Republicans never coalesced around an aid package. They unveiled a $1 trillion plan in late July, but Senate Republicans never brought it to a vote since scores of lawmakers within their party opposed the price tag.</p><p>Cass favors another stimulus package to prop up the economy, saying its recovery can be accelerated by helping people return to work. He adds additional relief legislation would likely benefit the GOP politically ahead of November.</p><p>\"It seems odd for the controlling party in power in both the Senate and White House with an incredibly important, close and contentious election a few months away to be rejecting the idea of an economic policy that's much needed and very popular,\" Cass said.</p><p>Indeed, <a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/americans-overwhelmingly-support-continuation-coronavirus-stimulus-and-relief-programs\">an Ipsos poll conducted in late July</a> found strong support across party lines for additional stimulus measures:</p><ul><li>Around 77% of Americans supported additional stimulus checks.</li><li>76% of Americans backed additional unemployment benefits, though no amount was specified.</li><li>Around 82% of Americans approved providing more loans to small businesses.</li></ul><p>Many economists are urging lawmakers to approve more spending to address the economic fallout from the pandemic, which threatens to deepen the pain for nearly 29 million Americans still receiving some form of unemployment benefits.</p><p>\"State and local governments are facing extreme budget distress; food insecurity is at its highest level in decades,\" Jay C. Shambaugh, a former Obama administration economist, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/17/opinion/covid-relief-plan-congress.html\">recently wrote in a New York Times op-ed.</a> \"We've regained only about half the jobs lost in the spring. More money from Congress is both fiscally affordable and deeply needed.\"</p><p>With negotiations bogged down, the White House and congressional Democrats have turned their attention to a stop-gap bill to fund the government past October 1, the end of the fiscal year. Early on, Mnuchin and Pelosi agreed to keep that legislation separate from coronavirus relief.</p><p>Failure to reach an agreement there as well could cause a government shutdown just weeks ahead of the presidential election.</p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-investing-strategy-advice-election-vaccine-contrarian-ideas-ms-2020-9\"

three steps can help you gain the skills and knowledge to confidently call yourself an expert.&#160;</li>\n<li>David Mitroff, Google mentor and psychology PhD, says it's important to spend at least three years, at a minimum, learning about a topic in depth.&#160;</li>\n<li>Build up the confidence to declare yourself an expert, make sure you have the knowledge to back it up, and don't be afraid to show it.&#160;</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>Do you think of yourself as an expert in your industry? You may be more of one than you realize. In an engaging&#160;<a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/david_mitroff_when_are_you_good_enough_to_become_an_indsutry_expert\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TEDx Talk</a>, marketing consultant, Google mentor, and psychology PhD David Mitroff picks apart the question of what it takes to be an expert at something and when you should start saying that you are — because if you don't, no one else will.</p><p>Mitroff began thinking about this after he gave a talk and two old men came up to him and said, \"You're really funny. You should be a standup comic.\"&#160;</p><p>He wasn't so sure, but he looked up the definition of a standup comic, and read that it was someone who interacts with the audience and is dynamic and fun. \"I do that,\" he thought. So he decided to put \"standup comic\" in&#160;his LinkedIn profile. After all, he figured, people who eat ice cream and post about it call themselves food bloggers, so why not?</p><p>The town where he'd met the old men asked him to return and give a second talk. On the basis of&#160;his previous talk and his LinkedIn profile, they promoted this new event calling him a consultant and standup comic. The presentation&#160;went well and the audience laughed. But an old friend of Mitroff's called him up insisting that he couldn't call himself a standup comic because he hadn't performed at places like The Improv. Mitroff pointed out that if you Googled the name of the (small) town where he'd spoken and the term&#160;\"standup comic,\" results one through 10&#160;were about him, on account of the promotion for his talk.</p><p>\"So when are you an expert?\" Mitroff asked. \"Is it when others say you are? Is it when two old guys say you are or your friend says you're not? Is it when you say you are?\"</p><p>We all know the reasons for not calling ourselves an expert. There's imposter syndrome, the feeling&#160;that your accomplishments are the result of luck and that you're in constant danger of being exposed as a fraud. If you believe this, then claiming to be an expert only increases your danger of being called out as a fake.</p><p>More rationally, you may also be concerned about the&#160;<a href=\"https://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/top-stupidity-researcher-do-these-5-things-to-be-instantly-smarter.html\">Dunning-Kruger effect</a>, a well-known and widespread phenomenon in which people believe themselves to be more expert than they are. \"As you start learning something more and more, you realize you know less and less and less,\" Mitroff said. \"You've got to learn more and more skills about it.\"&#160;</p><p>Mitroff is not suggesting that you should declare yourself an expert on fly-fishing, for instance, after one successful fishing trip. Instead, he says, if you want to become an expert at something, do these three&#160;things:</p><h2>1. Spend three years learning your topic</h2><p>\"After a lot of research, and a lot of time and pain, I believe it takes three years to become an expert,\" he said. (He's leaving aside fields where there's a set certification path, for instance the four years of medical school followed by a residency required to become a physician.)</p><p>\"Now does that mean you just wait three years and then say, 'OK, I'm an expert now'? No, you actually have to do stuff,\" he said. Begin by acquiring knowledge, and then keep on learning. \"The research shows that experts continue to learn and educate themselves more and more and more, and they surround themselves with other people to become even more expert,\" he said. \"You don't just become an expert and stop learning.\"</p><p>Think about the smartest people you know. I'm willing to bet most of them do just this. Or think about some of the smartest and most iconic entrepreneurs, such as&#160;<a href=\"http://www.inc.com/minda-zetlin/warren-buffett-birthday-90-bill-gates-cake-video-friendship.html\">Bill Gates and Warren Buffett</a>. They spend much of their time reading, studying, and talking to other experts to continue expanding their expertise. If, after decades of constant learning, these guys still don't know everything they need to, chances are you won't either.</p><h2>2. Build your confidence</h2><p>Being an expert won't do you much good if you never tell anyone about it. \"You have to believe in yourself,\" Mitroff said. \"You have to believe in your product, or believe in your service. You have to believe in your community, and you have to believe in what you're doing.\"</p><p>If you've followed the first step and put in the time to learn&#160;your topic and practice&#160;your skills, then you've already gone at least some of the way to becoming an expert. Being an expert doesn't mean that you're never wrong, it doesn't mean you know absolutely everything, and it doesn't mean that other experts will always agree with you. It means you've put in the time and work to learn as much about your topic as you can, and that you're continuing to learn more every day.&#160;</p><p>So if you've put in that time and you've learned a lot, own it! Declare yourself an expert. Don't let naysayers like Mitroff's friend get inside your head and shake that confidence.</p><h2>3. Take action</h2><p>Your expertise will be of no use to anyone if all you do is sit around saying what an expert you are. So put your expertise to practical use.</p><p>As a marketing consultant, Mitroff made an astute observation: Most people who are nominated for awards don't win them, but the mere fact of being nominated brings them visibility and prestige. Armed with that knowledge, he began nominating his clients and other people he knew for awards in their fields. \"Why not?\" he said. \"They might accidentally win sometimes, but if they don't win it doesn't matter.\"</p><p>Others began nominating Mitroff for awards in return, and he also began nominating himself.

After only a few days, I'm already a fan of changes Messages, while the new App Library didn't seem like anything special.&#160;</p>\n<div id=\"slideshow\">\n\tThe many small new features in Messages add up to one of the most useful updates in iOS14 for me, because it's probably the app I use the most throughout the day.\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f64d67b323fc4001e0d71c2?format=jpeg\" alt=\"iOS 14 Messages\" height=\"979\" width=\"1305\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Apple</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t\n\tPinning conversations is a minor change, but it's also super helpful to easily reach the people and group chats I return to the most.\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f64d70657b7da001ee1275f?format=jpeg\" alt=\"iOS 14 Messages\" height=\"1858\" width=\"2478\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>iOS 14 Messages.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Mary Meisenzahl</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t\n\tPinning a conversation puts it at the top of the Messages app. For me, making the photo larger rather than the text makes it easy to quickly find my important conversations.\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f64d75357b7da001ee12761?format=jpeg\" alt=\"iOS 14 Messages\" height=\"1478\" width=\"1971\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>iOS 14 Messages.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Mary Meisenzahl</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t\n\tMessages got some other common sense updates, like tagging people in a group message, and threading messages.\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f64dd5c57b7da001ee12789?format=jpeg\" alt=\"iOS 14 Messages\" height=\"1857\" width=\"2476\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>iOS 14 Messages.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Mary Meisenzahl</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t\n\tTo start a thread, just hold down on a message and the \"reply\" option will pop up.\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f64dd0557b7da001ee12784?format=jpeg\" alt=\"iOS 14 Messages\" height=\"1880\" width=\"2507\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>iOS 14 Messages.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Mary Meisenzahl</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t\n\tThen you can view just the thread, which can be helpful in a fast moving group chat.\n\t<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f64dda257b7da001ee1278a?format=jpeg\" alt=\"iOS 14 Messages\" height=\"1842\" width=\"2457\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>iOS 14 Messages.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Mary Meisenzahl</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\t\n\tThreading and tagging people seems so obvious, I have to wonder why Apple did not implement them earlier, like many other messaging apps have.

At the end of July, those benefits lapsed, and a month and a half later, Congress has yet to pass another package.</p><p>But on August 8, President Trump allocated $44 billion to FEMA to provide grants to states in order to bridge the gap between the original stimulus package and the next one— whenever that may be, if it happens at all.</p><p>The Lost Wages Supplemental Payment Assistance Grant allowed states to decide on their own if they needed the money and apply it accordingly. The deadline for the grant was September 10, and now states are figuring out how to distribute the money, and in many cases have already sent it out.</p><p>The $300 weekly unemployment bonus payments you may have heard about recently are a part of this rollout, but their distribution status at a state level varies.</p><p>Every state except South Dakota applied for the FEMA grant.

In order to be eligible for the FEMA grant funds, a household must already be receiving $100 in unemployment benefits.

Find anyone who's interacted with you professionally and can vouch for your work ethic and other transferable skills.</li>\n<li>When you ask them to be a reference, be upfront and include a job description or a few bullets of accomplishments you'd like to highlight.

Where are you — a student who might not have ever had a \"real\" job before — supposed to get references from? Will a prospective employer really want to hear from the manager at the sandwich shop you worked at during the summers, your biology professor, or your swim coach? The answer may surprise you.&#160;</p><h2><strong>What do employers really want to know?</strong></h2><p>Most hiring managers and recruiters know from your resume (and from common sense) that their college grad applicants aren't going to come to the table with extensive industry experience. However, professional references are still a useful tool for them because it can shed light on who you are as a person and responsible job seeker.</p><p>\"From the professional evaluation stance of a recruiter, it's more about whether you have references and can get them quickly,\" said Mike Ruggiero, senior recruiter at Lionbridge Technologies. \"They're really looking for people who can offer insight beyond, 'I gave Molly a task and Molly completed it,'\" he said. In other words, think about who in your life can vouch for your <a href=\"https://www.monster.com/career-advice/article/work-ethic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">work ethic</a>, your&#160;<a href=\"https://www.monster.com/career-advice/article/problem-solving\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">problem-solving skills</a>, and your team mentality — not just that you can do a job, but that you are a standout in all that you do.</p><p>\"Employers want to know that someone coming off their degree isn't just about skills,\" Ruggiero added.</p><p>Hiring managers will be most impressed if you have a&#160;<a href=\"https://www.monster.com/career-advice/article/prepare-your-references\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">list of references</a>&#160;ready to go as it will show that you came prepared.&#160;</p><h2><strong>Who should you ask to act as your reference?</strong></h2><p>A reference can really be anyone that can&#160;<a href=\"http://www.monster.com/career-advice/article/what-employers-want-from-job-references-hot-jobs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">speak about your abilities and performance</a>. \"It can be a boss during your summer job, a coach, a professor. But it should be someone that has a professional type of experience with you,\" said Wes Perry, SVP and chief talent officer at Leader Bank, N.A.</p><p>In other words,&#160;<a href=\"https://www.monster.com/career-advice/article/Whats-Wrong-with-Personal-Reference\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">you don't want to ask Uncle Dave</a> or your next door neighbor to give you a reference. \"I've seen that happen a lot, and it shows that you don't get it,\" said Perry.</p><p>To figure out who the best references are for a particular position, simply ask your recruiter what types of references they want, suggests Ruggiero. \"Ask your recruiting team, how can I get you the best information?\" For example, if they want someone who can discuss your ability to be a work on a team, who better than a team coach or activity adviser?</p><p>\"Recruiters love sports players because they have to be&#160;<a href=\"https://www.monster.com/career-advice/article/5-ways-to-be-a-good-team-player-hot-jobs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">part of a team</a>, be dedicated, and stay focused on training,\" said Ruggiero. If you're not an athlete, that's fine — you could be the chair of your math club, or the director of your drama group. \"Those types of references can be valuable if they can speak to how you have shown teamwork, professionalism, and the ability to meet deadlines,\" he said.</p><p>Again, it's expected that the entry-level grad might not have that many professional references, said Perry, but do the best you can to explain why you chose the references that you did. Something like: \"I'm giving you this professor because they can talk about a research project that we worked on and how I contributed.\"</p><p>Most important is making sure that the references you provide will speak highly of you. \"Sometimes a reference might say, 'I'm surprised this person picked me,'\" said Perry, and that can be a kiss of death. That's why you want to make sure to vet your potential references beforehand. \"They're going to either say they would or wouldn't be a good reference with you — most will be upfront,\" said Perry.</p><h2><strong>How should you ask for a reference?</strong></h2><p>If you're&#160;<a href=\"https://www.monster.com/career-advice/article/ask-letter-recommendation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">asking someone to take the time to say something good about you</a>, you want to make sure that they first of all remember you, and that they know a little something about the position you're seeking. You might ask via email, phone, or in person, depending on your current relationship with the person. An old professor would work best over email, whereas a current boss at your part-time job would be just fine in person.</p><p>Be upfront about what you need from your reference, and be humble. You can say something like: \"I'm applying to a very exciting position, and was hoping you had five minutes to chat about potentially being a reference for me since you're highly respected in the industry.\" This approach offers them a compliment and is respectful of their time, said Ruggiero.</p><p>Speaking of time, don't get frustrated and give up if you don't hear back from someone immediately, said Perry. \"People are busy, so it's OK to give a little nudge,\" he said. Once you do hear back, provide them with the job description, and share a few bullet points reminding them about your accomplishments, especially if it's been a while since you worked with the person.</p><p>And don't forget: Send along thank-you notes every step of the process, said Ruggiero. \"You want to show that you always appreciate people so they'll know they're not just being used,\" he said.</p><h2><strong>What about written references?</strong></h2><p>The majority of employers will want to speak to references so they can ask specific questions, but it doesn't hurt to have a couple of letters in your back pocket, said Ruggiero.</p><p>This is especially helpful if you have a great experience with a professor who&#160;you know is retiring, or you can ask your supervisor at the end of an internship just in case they move on before you start your job search.</p><p>\"I've done that where I had a VP who I knew was retiring, so I asked if they would mind writing a letter of reference for me,\" said Perry. Students can do the same. Say:&#160;<em>\"I'm going to graduate next year, but I was wondering if you wouldn't mind writing a letter of reference on university letterhead.\"</em></p><p>\"It's always good to be able to say, 'I do have several written letters that I can provide immediately, and I can provide you contact information as well,'\" said Ruggiero. It shows that you had the foresight to be prepared, and are handling your job search in a very professional way.</p><p>Could you use more information on how to have a successful first-time job search?&#160;<a href=\"https://member.monster.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Join Monster for free today</a>.

UK, according to a pocket money app.</p><p>A study by RoosterMoney of 24,000 kids in the UK aged between four and 14 had Roblox, a virtual gaming platform, in top spot, followed by Epic Games' \"Fortnite,\" a battle-royale video game.</p><p>Within these games, users can buy outfits and accessories to personalize virtual characters.&#160;</p><p>Epic Games has been <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/fortnite-epic-games-apple-lawsuit-explained-2020-8\">fighting with Apple since \"Fortnite\"</a> launched its own in-game payment system in August, breaking the rules of the App Store.&#160;</p><p>Lego came in third in the pocket money league table, which assessed children's spending during the pandemic, while traditional purchases of books, magazines, and sweets slipped down to fourth place, from the top spots in the list.</p><h3>Kids saving more money than last year</h3><p>Their teeth aren't the only thing kids are saving this year: The Roostermoney study — which surveyed children that use the app, designed to help children save and manage money — revealed that kids are stashing away 43.5% of their pocket money on average, compared to 38% in 2019, a 14% rise.</p><p>Lego, Roblox and Apple are the top three brands that children save up for, the study found.</p><p>The average pocket money rate for children in the UK stands at £4.60 ($5.96) a week, amounting to £239 ($309) a year — kids are saving on average £104 ($135) annually for a rainy day.&#160;</p><p>The average UK adult savings rate is 5.5%, according to <a href=\"https://themoneycharity.org.uk/media/March-2020-Money-Statistics.pdf\">The Money Charity</a>.&#160;</p><p>A spokesperson from Roostermoney told Business Insider that the premise of the pocket money app is to help kids be better with cash, and to educate them on how to save. Children can use the app to log what they spend their money on, allocating it into different pots to save for the next trend, whilst parents monitor their spending.&#160;</p><p>The CEO of Roostermoney, Will Carmichael, said in a statement that he hopes parents have used the last few months to have more conversations with their kids about money.</p><p>\"With the last few months accelerating our move to becoming a cashless society, we can see that reflected not only in our own spending habits, but in that of our children too,\" he said, adding that it's encouraging that saving rates are high.</p><p>Further research from Roostermoney sent to Business Insider revealed that the most common chore for children receiving pocket money is cleaning their bedroom — while the most lucrative chore is washing the car. Parents are likely to give their child an extra few pennies for being good, as well as brave, the research said.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/kids-splashing-cash-fortnite-roblox-online-games-not-sweets-books-2020-9'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Zz0M4GmstTE:1sZXWqa9HHA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Zz0M4GmstTE:1sZXWqa9HHA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Zz0M4GmstTE:1sZXWqa9HHA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Zz0M4GmstTE:1sZXWqa9HHA:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Zz0M4GmstTE:1sZXWqa9HHA:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Zz0M4GmstTE:1sZXWqa9HHA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=Zz0M4GmstTE:1sZXWqa9HHA:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Zz0M4GmstTE:1sZXWqa9HHA:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/Zz0M4GmstTE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 20 Sep 2020 08:33:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f64da1857b7da001ee12774?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"ce425a2c90e2fc9f899f3de1378a2710","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn87@2020_2/2020/09/20/17-35-50-983_7021b029df9d7d68.webp","destWidth":1631,"destHeight":1223,"sourceBytes":38860,"destBytes":38860,"author":"insider@insider.com (Kate Duffy)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5ec3f2fd5af6cc51cd4abfd9?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn96@2020_2/2020/09/20/17-35-37-097_b3396fa8a44bd460.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn62@2020_4/2020/09/20/17-35-46-023_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Zz0M4GmstTE:1sZXWqa9HHA:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn64@2020_2/2020/09/20/17-35-43-006_21c81f49267a76bd.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Zz0M4GmstTE:1sZXWqa9HHA:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn24@2020_6/2020/09/20/17-35-41-565_06661225c0e8b666.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=Zz0M4GmstTE:1sZXWqa9HHA:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn3@2020_5/2020/09/20/17-35-48-765_25fe9ef5180efd37.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/Zz0M4GmstTE":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn89@2020_2/2020/09/20/17-35-40-631_71e6a669b3e6459d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1600623333164},{"createdTime":"2020-09-21 01:35:33","updatedTime":"2020-09-21 01:35:33","title":"Job diary: I'm a professional mermaid who makes upwards of $250 for an appearance.

I enjoyed sewing and costuming recreationally, so it was a great match for my interests.&#160;</p><h2><strong>Early on, I made my own mermaid fabric costume compete with a swimmable version of Ariel's tail.</strong></h2><p>I even wound up taking a <a href=\"https://mermaidislandtours.com/index.html\">mermaid class</a> wearing the tail. The class taught us a series of basic swim styles such as the dolphin kick, flips and corkscrew turns.</p><p>I also enjoyed taking photographs so, at the age of 19, I combined these interests and took a job as a photo ambassador and wardrobe assistant at SeaWorld. It was 2014, the same year I'd begun doing pencil sketches of a character I'd dreamed up that I'd later call <a href=\"https://www.theseafaringmermaid.org/\">Nymphia, The Nautilus Mermaid</a>.</p><p>Soon after, a merman friend of mine introduced me to <a href=\"https://mernetwork.com/index/content.php?s=dfb8813ded209f28a315d21396301bf2\">MerNetwork</a>, a merfolk community, and encouraged me to get involved. It didn't take long for me to get hooked.</p><p>In 2016, I headed off to Otis College of Art &#38; Design in Los Angeles to study fashion design. I ended up leaving after the first semester, returning to SeaWorld as a seasonal employee.&#160;</p><p>That same year I got my first paid mermaid gig. A friend recommended me for a mermaid meet and greet at The Escondido Renaissance Faire, which was a lot of fun. I wore my Ariel tail, and together we greeted people in a grotto set-up and handed out treasure to the children. That was the day I brought my character Nymphia to life for the first time.&#160;</p><h2><strong>It was my mom who first pointed out that this could be a business for me.</strong></h2><p><strong><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f65007f57b7da001ee12879?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Gabrielle Rivera Nymphia full body tail photo credit Brandi Rollins\" height=\"2048\" width=\"1638\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Nymphia wearing her full body tail.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Brandi Rollins</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></strong></p><p>I live with my parents in Oakland and the three of us were regularly meeting in our living room, conducting informal business meetings, and discussing what it would take for me to turn this into a reality. We talked about everything from resources to costuming to budget. With their support, for the first time, I remember thinking becoming a professional entrepre-mermaid might just be an actual possibility.</p><p>From there, I joined a local group known as the Ocean Beach Mer Pod, and soon I was doing both paid and volunteer appearances. Two months after my first mermaid gig, I got certified as an Open Water Scuba Diver through PADI. I also commissioned husband and wife duo, Jim and Alicia Ward of <a href=\"http://www.seethroughsea.com/custom-mermaid-tails.html\"><em>See Through Sea</em></a>, to design a custom silicone mermaid tail which cost $2,700. It weighs 36 pounds, and feels like you're swimming with a dumbbell attached to you. It's made of medical-grade silicone and it feels more like a prosthetic than a costume. I named her Moana.&#160;</p><p>Silicone tails are a big investment, running between $1,000 to $6,000 depending on the maker. They are mostly handmade by small creators however there are a handful of larger companies like <a href=\"https://www.themertailor.com/\">Mertailor</a> which offer mass silicones.</p><p>Fabric tails like neoprene are more comfortable, weigh less, are easier to put on, and way more cost-effective ($300-$500) but they're nowhere near as realistic looking.&#160;</p><p>When it comes to silicone versus fabric, it really comes down to just picking your poison.</p><h2><strong>It typically takes me between two and a half to three hours to get into full costume.&#160;</strong></h2><p><strong><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f65047757b7da001ee12896?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Nymphia on a log, photo credit Brandi Rollins\" height=\"2048\" width=\"1639\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>It can take up to three hours to get fully dressed as Nymphia.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Brandi Rollins</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></strong></p><p>Getting my tail on is a process. I begin by applying a water-based lubricant to my legs so I can slide into it easier. Then I lay down on a yoga mat and put my feet into the monofin, and begin sliding it up the length of my body. It usually takes me half an hour to do and it feels like I'm wearing a giant condom on my body because silicone suctions to your skin.&#160;</p><p>I'm a makeup geek so that part takes the longest, especially when it comes to the feminine contouring. I wear a lace front wig that I glue to my scalp and use a small army of bobby pins and a crown to anchor it down. One time it came off in the water and all my makeup smeared, but luckily it was during a practice swim.</p><h2><strong>Cosplay really helped me build up confidence in my femininity, and I feel my most feminine as a mermaid.</strong></h2><p>I didn't come out to my parents as trans until I was living in Los Angeles in 2017. It was more of a passive kind of talk, but by then I was already using feminine pronouns to refer to myself.&#160;</p><h2><strong>At times, it can be harder to book events as a transgender woman.&#160;</strong></h2><p>People won't admit that's why they don't hire me, but I've heard it through the grapevine. I'm very upfront about being trans. In fact, I recently served as an ambassador and speaker for trans merfolk at the California Mermaid Convention in 2019.</p><p>When I do work, I do it all — kids' parties, corporate events, beach visits and meet and greets, and aquarium and water shows. My rate is $250 for a 90-minute appearance on dry land and $275 in the water.&#160;</p><h2><strong>I always have an assistant on hand whose job is to act like my land legs.&#160;</strong></h2><p><strong><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f6503d4323fc4001e0d732c?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Gabrielle Rivera Nymphia and Pirate assistant photo credit Brandi Rollins\" height=\"2400\" width=\"3199\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Rivera often has her assistant dress up in a pirate costume.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Brandi Rollins</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure></strong></p><p>If I'm working near the water, I can just roll into it, but if I'm on dry land, my assistant carries me — which isn't the easiest task, considering I weigh 162 pounds and my tail weighs nearly another 40. Sometimes he tosses me over his shoulder and carries me into an event like the catch of the day. It's also helpful to have him with me in case some drunk guy tries to play let's drown the mermaid. Fortunately, I haven't had any run-ins with that personally, but in my industry, we've all heard the stories.&#160;</p><p>In addition to my mermaid work, I work as the lifeguard instructor for Bay Club at The Gateway, a private fitness club in San Francisco.&#160;</p><h2><strong>Both my jobs require me to be at my mental and physical best.</strong></h2><p>This means plenty of sleep (8-10 hours nightly), lots of protein (eggs are my best friend), practice swims, vocal warm-ups, and deep breathing exercises. I can hold my breath underwater in a static position for two minutes and 25 seconds, and my active breath-hold is between 45-75 seconds if I swim really slowly on a good day. Once during a photo shoot, the legendary mermaid model and activist ocean ecology activist, Hannah Fraser, joked I almost killed her underwater photographer because I held my breath for so long.</p><p>Since COVID-19, business is a lot slower because no one is hosting events, but I've found ways to branch out. I've begun offering virtual storytime, as well as personalized videos for special occasions or simply to say 'shello' for between $35-50. The pandemic has also provided me with the downtime I needed to create a free <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzHSjnPCWWIazB4E01adWLg?view_as=subscriber\">YouTube channel</a> for kids storytimes, as well as a <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/legendofthesea\">podcast</a> called Nymphia: Legend of the Sea.&#160;</p><h2><strong>For me, this is not just a job, it's a lifestyle.&#160;</strong></h2><p>Whatever methods I can use to encourage people to dream big through my work, I use.&#160;</p><p>It's especially important for me, as a 25-year-old woman of trans identity, to spread the message that anyone can achieve their wildest dreams.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

Both offer five seats, all-electric driving, and quick acceleration. Here's how they stack up against each other.</p><p>As a quick refresher, the Polestar 2 is the first all-electric car from the new Volvo- and Geely-backed brand. It was officially unveiled in 2019 with US deliveries to reservation holders scheduled to start this month.</p><p>The Model 3 is Tesla's first stab at a lower-cost EV for the masses.

Both have their strengths — but most importantly, both are solid EV choices for anyone looking to transition away from internal combustion engines. They don't rely on fossil fuels, but everything else about them basically feels like you're driving a normal car.</p><h2><strong>Interior</strong></h2><h3><strong>Tesla Model 3</strong></h3><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f64bfb257b7da001ee126c1?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Tesla Model 3_2\" height=\"1560\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Tesla Model 3.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Tesla</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>The Tesla Model 3's interior is famously minimalist, with everything controlled via the big, horizontally mounted center touch screen. From there, you can view the car's status, navigation instructions, and music options.&#160;<p>I found the screen to be an interesting idea, but impractical in practice. I dislike having to look away from the road to adjust something via a touchscreen. There wasn't a traditional driver-facing information cluster, either.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f64bfd657b7da001ee126c2?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Tesla Model 3_3\" height=\"1664\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Tesla Model 3.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Tesla</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Also, the center console surface is covered with piano black trim — reflective, black plastic — which I hate because it gets grubby with fingerprints so quickly. Underneath all the piano-black trim, however, is a huge amount of very handy storage space.</p><p>The rest of the Model 3's interior is just as stark, but the leathers are soft and the wood inlaid in the dash is a nice touch. It seats five passengers and has a decent-sized trunk, as well as a front trunk. Tesla <a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/presskit\">quotes</a> the luggage capacity to be 15 cubic feet.</p><h3><strong>Polestar 2</strong></h3><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f36b389e89ebf001f0449ae?format=jpeg\" alt=\"2021 Polestar 2_OEM_10\" height=\"1667\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>2021 Polestar 2.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Polestar</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>The 2's interior looks like a car interior, which I am more familiar with and prefer using. There's also a big touchscreen, yes, but there's also an information cluster you can easily see while driving.&#160;<p>The 2 also has Google's Android operating system built in, which meant that the interface and user experience were all familiar to me, an Android user. It's an intuitive system and didn't force me to learn a new UI/UX just because I was in an unfamiliar car.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f36b387e89ebf001f0449a9?format=jpeg\" alt=\"2021 Polestar 2_OEM_4\" height=\"1667\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>2021 Polestar 2.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Polestar</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Interior materials were also nice to the touch, but Polestar's commitment to sustainability — seat fabrics made from recycled plastic bottles, interior plastics made from waste cork products, and floor mats made from recycled fishing nets — is cool. A leather interior is available upon request, though.</p><p>The 2 also has a front trunk in addition to its rear trunk. Polestar quotes the luggage capacity to be 15.5 cubic feet.&#160;</p><h2><strong>Exterior</strong></h2><h3><strong>Tesla Model 3</strong></h3><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f64c102323fc4001e0d711b?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Tesla Model 3_9\" height=\"1665\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Tesla Model 3.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Tesla</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>According to <a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/presskit\">Tesla's own measurements</a>, the Model 3 is 184.8 inches long, 82.2 inches wide with mirrors, and 56.8 inches tall.&#160;</p><p>Its design is far softer and more oblong than the 2's, with rounded headlights.</p><h3><strong>Polestar 2</strong></h3><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f36b384e89ebf001f0449a7?format=jpeg\" alt=\"2021 Polestar 2_OEM_1\" height=\"1667\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>2021 Polestar 2.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Polestar</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>The 2, according to Polestar's measurements, is 181.3 inches long, 78.1 inches wide with mirrors, and 58.2 inches tall.<p>Maybe it's because there are so many Model 3s driving around now that everyone knows what they look like, but the 2 is visually far more striking to me. I love the Thor's Hammer daytime running lights and the overall shape of the vehicle.&#160;</p><h2><strong>Driving Impressions</strong></h2><h3><strong>Tesla Model 3</strong></h3><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f64c03e57b7da001ee126c6?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Tesla Model 3_7\" height=\"1406\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Tesla Model 3.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Tesla</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>Evaluating electric cars on how they drive is sort of a pointless exercise, as they all drive basically the same: seamless acceleration, silent save for the futuristic whirring, quick. The big differences come down to the packaging, fit and finish, and the user experience.&#160;<p>In Long Range, Dual Motor, all-wheel drive setup, the Model 3 produces <a href=\"https://www.motortrend.com/cars/tesla/model-3/2018/2018-tesla-model-3-long-range-dual-motor-first-test-review/#:~:text=Nothing%20demonstrates%20that%20new%20reality,context%20really%20drives%20it%20home.\">a claimed 346 horsepower</a> and can achieve an estimated 145 mph top speed and hit 60 mph in <a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/model3/design#battery\">just 4.4 seconds</a>.&#160;</p><p>If you opt for the Model 3 Performance, however, the claimed power output jumps to <a href=\"https://www.thecarconnection.com/overview/tesla_model-3_2020\">450 horsepower and 471 pound-feet of torque</a>. Zero to 60 mph is achieved in <a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/model3/design#battery\">an estimated</a> 3.2 seconds and there's a 162 mph top speed.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f64c10f323fc4001e0d711c?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Tesla Model 3\" height=\"2000\" width=\"1712\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Tesla Model 3.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Tesla</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>The Long Range Model 3 is quick, but the Performance Model 3 feels like a rocket. The acceleration is so instant that it feels like being shot forward with the world's biggest cannon. It never got old. It was never not entertaining.</p><p>In my own evaluation, I found the Model 3's steering to be weighted very favorably, not too light and not too heavy. It felt quite natural.</p><p>Forward visibility out of the Model 3 was also phenomenal. The low, short hood gave a near-unencumbered view through the windshield.&#160;</p><p>The Model 3 also offers Autopilot capabilities — Tesla's advanced driver-assistance system, which does not allow for fully automated driving. In my own experience, Autopilot and General Motors' Super Cruise are among the best driver-assistance systems currently on the market.</p><h3><strong>Polestar 2</strong></h3><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f36b2f2e89ebf001f04499c?format=jpeg\" alt=\"2021 Polestar 2_KL_18\" height=\"1667\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>2021 Polestar 2.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Kristen Lee/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>The 2 produces a claimed 408 horsepower and 487 pound-feet of torque. It also has an all-wheel-drive setup. Zero to 60 mph takes an estimated 4.5 seconds. Polestar did not provide a top speed estimate.&#160;<p>I didn't love the 2's steering feedback. In its standard setting, it was far too light. In sport mode, there was a bit more weight to it, but I never felt like it adequately communicated the road very well to me.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f36b2f2e89ebf001f04499b?format=jpeg\" alt=\"2021 Polestar 2_KL_14\" height=\"1667\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>2021 Polestar 2.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Kristen Lee/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>Everything else was great, though. The car's low center of gravity and instant acceleration made it feel much smaller and dartier than it actually was. One-pedal driving is also very easy to master.<p>The 2 is also very quick, and for the purposes of the general public, doesn't need to be any quicker. But if you want the neck-snapping acceleration, nothing really beats the Model 3 Performance.&#160;</p><p>The 2 offers Pilot Assist, <a href=\"https://www.motortrend.com/news/volvo-pilot-assist-how-it-works/\">Volvo's version of driver-assistance technology</a>, but I didn't get a chance to try it.</p><h2><strong>Range</strong></h2><h3><strong>Tesla Model 3</strong></h3><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f64c73f57b7da001ee12702?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Tesla Model 3_5\" height=\"1406\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Tesla Model 3.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Tesla</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>In its Long Range configuration, the Model 3 returns an estimated 322 miles, which surpasses that mystical 300-mile mark that people seemed to be stuck on. The Standard Range Plus Model 3, which comes with rear-wheel drive, is an estimated 250 miles. The Performance has an estimated range of 299 miles.<p>Tesla also has an expansive Supercharger network, which means that there are more places for owners to charge their Teslas when away from home.</p><h3><strong>Polestar 2</strong></h3><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f36b2f0e89ebf001f044997?format=jpeg\" alt=\"2021 Polestar 2_KL_11\" height=\"1667\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>2021 Polestar 2.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Kristen Lee/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>The 2 has been available for a much shorter amount of time than the Model 3, so there's really only one version available to buyers during the time of this writing: the \"launch edition.\"<p>The 2 has not yet been tested by the EPA, but InsideEVs suggests that the range could be <a href=\"https://insideevs.com/news/419595/polestar-2-epa-range-target/\">275 miles</a>.</p><p>Polestar cars use the Combined Charging System plug, which is different from the one Teslas use.

The \"vegan\" interior didn't appear any less premium even though it didn't use cowhide.&#160;</p><p>Overall, I thought the 2's fit and finish was nicer than the Tesla's, <a href=\"https://electrek.co/2020/07/13/tesla-former-vp-quality-explains-issues/\">which apparently can vary depending on which car you get</a>.</p><p>True, the Long Range most likely has a longer range than the 2, and Tesla's Supercharger network is far more extensive, but I wager most of an EV's charging takes place at home over the course of its ownership. The <a href=\"https://www.utilitydive.com/news/chargepoint-commits-1b-to-expand-ev-charging-as-ocasio-cortez-others-unve/571979/\">US charging infrastructure network is expanding</a>, too, so it's not like there won't be anywhere to charge a Polestar.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f64c02c323fc4001e0d7118?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Tesla Model 3_4\" height=\"1406\" width=\"2500\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Tesla Model 3.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Tesla</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>I also think Polestar's free pickup and delivery service is pretty sweet. It's unfortunate for those who don't live near a Polestar location, but for those who do, it's very convenient. Should Polestar really catch on here and expand its locations, it also expands the area it can service — no local franchise laws to tangle with.&#160;</p><p>Yes, on paper, it seems like the Model 3 has the 2 beat. The Tesla is slightly cheaper, has a longer range, offers a Performance model, and can be optioned with the very capable Autopilot system. But choosing a car is rarely a logical act, and being in the Polestar just made me happier.</p><p>Sometimes it's not more complicated than that.</p><figure>\n\t<img

These lesser-known parties launch nationwide grassroots efforts to collect signatures, file paperwork, and clear innumerable bureaucratic roadblocks. In many cases, a bid also requires reaching a vote-percentage threshold in down-ballot elections for the national party's presidential candidate to stand a chance of making it onto the ballot.</p><p>Even then, candidates are hampered by minuscule name recognition, left out of most national polling, and <a href=\"https://reason.com/2016/06/03/gary-johnson-polls-debates-libertarian/\">locked out of the</a> presidential debates.</p><p>It's a rigged game.&#160;</p><p>As of now, the Libertarian and Green parties are the only third parties that regularly gain widespread ballot access (Libertarians are on ballots in all 50 states; the Greens are in 45 states). But both parties are routinely dismissed as a \"<a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/america-isnt-really-set-up-for-third-party-presidential-bids/\">waste of a vote</a>.\"&#160;</p><p>All in all, it's a massive undertaking to make a difference as a third party in the US. So it's intriguing when a new alternative to the Democratic and Republican stranglehold tries to make some noise.</p><p>The latest attempt to enter the fray, <a href=\"https://articlesofunity.org/\">Unity 2020</a>, wants to be taken seriously as a \"patriotic\" movement that stands as the last hope \"to save the Republic from the disaster that looms on our current path.\"</p><p>It's making some noise thanks to a prominent internet presence. But the massive holes in its plan — to say nothing of its logic that seems unmoored from political reality — have led at least one critic from a third party to call it \"snake oil.\"&#160;</p><h2>A 'patriotic' presidential ticket with no party</h2><p>Unity 2020 is the brainchild of former Evergreen State College professor Bret Weinstein, a charter member of the \"<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/opinion/intellectual-dark-web.html\">intellectual dark web</a>\" (IDW) who is probably best-known for being the target of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cMYfxOFBBM\">a student-led mob on campus</a> in 2017. Unity 2020 isn't a party; it's \"a grassroots presidential campaign to restore patriotic, courageous &#38; capable leadership to the United States,\" according to its website.&#160;</p><p>Fundamental to the Unity 2020 ethos is the belief that the country faces certain doom if either President Donald Trump or Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden wins the election in November. The idea, then, is that a \"patriotic\" bipartisan ticket can save the day.</p><p>Weinstein told me Unity 2020 has about <a href=\"https://articlesofunity.org/support/\">1,000 volunteers and has eschewed fundraising</a> to preemptively cut off any accusations of financial grifting. Such a small and impoverished operation stands little chance of even making as much electoral impact as the perennial third-party candidate <a href=\"https://rocky101.com/en_us/en/\">Rocky De La Fuente</a>. But the movement is generating noise because of IDW's broad audience reach online.</p><p>Weinstein in June unveiled the \"Articles of Unity\" on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4H-0S89pxU\">Tucker Carlson's Fox News show</a> — which this summer <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2020/06/tucker-carlson-tonight-draws-record-4-3-million-viewers-in-2q-amid-all-time-highs-for-fox-news-channel-1202974105/\">broke the record</a> for being the highest-rated cable-news show in history.</p><p>In addition to his YouTube channel with over 220,000 subscribers, Weinstein also recently made his latest of several appearances on the \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRCzZp1J0v0\">Joe Rogan Experience</a>,\" one of the most popular YouTube shows and podcasts. The interview with Rogan — a fellow IDWer — has been viewed more than 6.5 million times. And that's just on YouTube, which doesn't account for the millions of audio-only downloads and streams Rogan gets with every episode.</p><p>Carlson's and Rogan's audiences are massive — and loyal. While it may not have reached \"the mainstream,\" it's clear that Weinstein is leveraging his network to spread Unity 2020's message to a large audience.</p><p>So what is that message? The \"Articles of Unity\" published on Unity 2020's website show a passion for shaking up the establishment, uprooting the staid two-party system, and moving toward democratic initiatives like ranked voting as a way of juicing more ideological diversity into politics, while chiseling away at two-party tribal hackery.</p><p>Hey, no one ever changed the world by thinking pragmatically. And judging by the many vagaries in the nitty-gritty of its plan, neither has Unity 2020.&#160;</p><p>While Unity 2020 has grand ideas, the organizers have a few practical problems. They have no ballot access less than 50 days before the general election, which is constitutionally required to take place on November 3. They have volunteers but very little organizational infrastructure. And the two candidates they've picked haven't agreed to run on their ticket and have already endorsed their respective parties' standard-bearers.</p><p>Oh also, a coin flip will determine whether the Democrat or the Republican serves as president or vice president, and the order of the ticket will be reversed every four years.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f64e16557b7da001ee127aa?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Tulsi Gabbard\" height=\"2543\" width=\"5086\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Rep. Tulsi Gabbard at a campaign event in February.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Brendan McDermid/REUTERS</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h2>A hardcore Trump supporter and a renegade Democrat to unify us all</h2><p>Supporters submitted over 2,000 candidate nominations, according to Weinstein, and the top six were then voted on via ranked online ballots.&#160;</p><p><a href=\"https://articlesofunity.org/news/\">Eight rounds of online voting</a> — with 7,919 votes in all — ultimately yielded two sitting members of Congress (as well as military veterans) as Unity 2020's presidential ticket: Republican Rep. Dan Crenshaw and Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard.&#160;</p><p>(I made numerous attempts to reach Crenshaw's and Gabbard's spokespeople to see if they were at all interested in running for president under the Unity 2020 banner but never got a response.)</p><p>Crenshaw was a featured speaker at last month's Republican National Convention, where he endorsed Trump. Gabbard ran for the Democratic nomination this year, finishing with a grand total of two delegates and the dubious honor of being the candidate <a href=\"https://morningconsult.com/2019/12/23/lesser-known-democrats-seize-spotlight-raise-profile-with-los-angeles-debate/\">most disliked by Democratic primary voters</a>. Upon dropping out of the race, she endorsed Biden.</p><p>I asked Weinstein in a phone interview last week how a dyed-in-the-wool Trump-supporting conservative and a renegade Democrat would appeal to moderates, centrists, or independents.&#160;</p><p>\"The ticket isn't moderate. The ticket is patriotic. And what makes the ticket viable is that both of these people are intelligent. They are clearly willing to make sacrifices on behalf of the nation. And they clearly both have courage,\" Weinstein said.</p><p>Unity 2020 was designed to draw voters \"equally from the two major parties,\" Weinstein said. But the two candidates selected may have some problems bridging that gap.</p><p>Gabbard's unpopularity within her own party, Weinstein said, comes in no small part from \"an absolutely bizarre attack from the DNC, with Hillary Clinton accusing her, of all things, of being a Russian asset.\"</p><p>Weinstein added, \"As somebody who grew up during the Cold War, seeing that kind of rhetoric deployed domestically in a political context against an obvious patriot is jaw-dropping.\"</p><p>Regarding Crenshaw, Weinstein said, \"He is a loyal Republican, but I have also spent a fair amount of time talking to Dan, and I find him interpersonally very reasonable. Dan, I would argue, is a person I have long hypothesized exists, which is to say someone who functions well within the current system but would prefer that the system did not have this partisan feature.\"</p><p>Weinstein sees no evidence of patriotism in Trump or Biden, calling the president \"an entirely cynical actor who does what is necessary to advance his own cause\" and describing Biden as a \"lifelong machine politician\" who has run his campaign in \"a decrepit condition.\"</p><p>A self-described \"radical progressive,\" Weinstein said: \"Economic inequality, growing past a certain point, tends to trigger revolts.\" But he added, \"The focus on race on the BLM left is going to drive the entire nation to a place that it has been in the past, where race was a primary feature of how we viewed each other. And anybody who understands the United States knows that moving in that direction will be negative and not positive.\"</p><p>It's not just the forces of the political duopoly that Weinstein is fighting, it's what he sees as political bias in Big Tech.</p><p>Twitter permanently suspended Unity 2020's \"@ArticlesOfUnity\" account for violating its \"platform manipulation and spam policy,\" a company spokesman told me. Weinstein said an <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BretWeinstein/status/1302456933132062720\">internal investigation</a> of Unity 2020's volunteers found no evidence of such violations and that Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EricRWeinstein/status/1303816088870776833\">has ignored</a> appeals. A <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AoUHistory\">new account</a> has been set up by Unity 2020 volunteers to document Twitter's alleged suppression of Unity-related hashtags and links.</p><p>None of this is an accident, according to Weinstein.&#160;</p><p>\"It is noteworthy that in the Twitter communications division, Kamala Harris' former press secretary is now highly placed,\" Weinstein said, referring to Joe Pacilio, who worked for Harris in that capacity when she was California's attorney general.</p><p>According to Twitter, Pacilio is a spokesperson and has nothing to do with policy enforcement. But he's <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/harris-twitter-trump/\">been accused without evidence by conservative websites</a> of policing Trump's tweets anyway.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f64e54257b7da001ee127c9?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Unity 2020\" height=\"768\" width=\"1536\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Unity 2020.\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi5N_uAqApEUIlg32QzkPlg\" target=\"_blank\">Bret Weinstein</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h2>Brother, can you spare your national ballot access?&#160;</h2><p>Needless to say, the odds are stacked against Unity 2020. Among its many disadvantages, it has no ballot access to an election that's less than two months from now.</p><p>But Weinstein has a plan for that, too: Third parties — particularly the Libertarian and Green parties — should hand over their ballot access to Unity 2020 out of a sense of patriotism.</p><p>\"Libertarians and the Greens have achieved something very difficult: They have gained national ballot access. However, their role in American politics is effectively as a footnote,\" Weinstein said. \"But with the intent of making the point now at this moment in history, neither one is positioned to win … It is almost impossible to imagine Howie Hawkins or Jo Jorgensen ascending to the presidency.\"</p><p>Hawkins and Jorgensen are the respective nominees for the Green Party and the Libertarian Party.</p><p>Weinstein added: \"I have put my ideology aside, and all of the other volunteers inside of Unity have put their ideologies aside, in order to advance a plan for the good of the nation; the Libertarians and/or the Greens could do the same thing at this moment.\"&#160;</p><p>The Libertarians and Greens have other ideas about Unity 2020's ambitions.&#160;</p><p>\"They're absolute f---ing morons,\" Nicholas Sarwark, the Libertarian Party chair from 2014 to 2020, said. \"They don't have any plan for ballot access other than pretending it's not a thing.\"</p><p>Sarwark said Unity 2020's plan is to \"transcend laws\" by using a kind of magical thinking that he likened to Marianne Williamson's <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/03/magazine/marianne-williamson-2020.html\">big-on-love and short-on-policy campaign</a>.</p><p>\"Who's your ticket? Dan Crenshaw and Tulsi Gabbard? And the runners-up were William McRaven and Andrew Yang. It's like the start of '<a href=\"https://streetfighter.fandom.com/wiki/Character_Select\">Street Fighter</a>': Randomize your fighter and let's see how it goes,\" Sarwark added.</p><p>Sarwark said the potential Unity 2020 candidates were \"popular with a lot of people\" whose second choice would be Trump and that the project itself \"is an attempt to dismiss all of the work that's been done over decades by somebody who's done no work, and it should be treated with all due respect.\"</p><p>The Libertarian Party's executive director, Dan Fishman, said Unity 2020 \"feels like snake oil\" sold by \"people who should know better.\"</p><p>Fishman noted ballot-access deadlines have already passed and said getting the Libertarians on all 50 states' ballots (plus DC) was particularly difficult this year.</p><p>\"Without question this was the most difficult year ever to get 50-state ballot access. Because in the COVID era, nobody wants to take a pen and a piece of paper from you and sign their name to a petition,\" Fishman said.&#160;</p><p>Fishman said the idea that the Libertarian Party would just hand over its ballot access after successfully completing all the \"arduous\" required work was risible. He added that Weinstein appeared to be \"a person who hasn't done any due diligence at all.\"</p><p>As for the argument that the Libertarians have a patriotic duty to dump their ticket in favor of Unity 2020's, Fishman called that notion \"fearmongering\" and the opposite of patriotism.</p><p>\"We're not looking to elect somebody other than a Republican or Democrat,\" Fishman said. \"We're looking to elect a Libertarian.\"</p><p>The Greens agree.&#160;</p><p>\"Greens want to run Greens for office,\" Michael O'Neil, the Green Party's communications manager, said. \"They want to run candidates who will advocate for our platform and for the policies that we believe in. That's what political parties are supposed to do.\"</p><p>O'Neil is more sympathetic to the Unity 2020 cause than the Libertarians I spoke with.&#160;</p><p>He said the Greens were \"in 100% agreement with the motivation for the Unity 2020 project\" to bring about structural reform and \"democratize our elections.\" But O'Neil added, \"This change is not going to come in one election. It's certainly not going to come in the last two or three months of a presidential election.\"</p><p>However, the Greens have no intention of partnering with Unity 2020 to get Crenshaw and Gabbard on their ticket.</p><p>\"The Green Party nomination is not for anyone to hand out or to trade,\" O'Neil said.&#160;</p><p>\"What people need to understand about creating actual democratic political parties is that they have to be accountable to their membership, they need to be transparent, and, you know, they aren't built in a day,\" O'Neil added.</p><p>Weinstein doesn't buy these arguments and says it's defeatist to believe it's too late in the process to run the Crenshaw-Gabbard (or Gabbard-Crenshaw) ticket — and win.&#160;</p><p>\"Instead of as spoilers, [third parties] would be understood as heroes putting aside their interests for the moment to save a republic that many people seem to understand is in jeopardy,\" Weinstein said. \"It is the right thing to do, the honorable thing to do. And it is also the strategically savvy thing to do.\"</p><p>Weinstein has <a href=\"https://youtu.be/19g95qtDc0Y?t=321\">alluded to elements of his plan</a> that he has not yet made public, and he insists that ballot-access deadlines, running candidates who've already endorsed Trump or Biden, and <a href=\"https://reason.com/2020/09/09/the-incredible-shrinking-3rd-party-voter/\">a cyclical downturn in third-party interest</a> are not immovable barriers.</p><p>\"We discovered that nobody was going to enter the race that could possibly save us from this disastrous outcome, and somebody needed to do something,\" Weinstein said.&#160;</p><p>But he conceded, \"If I had it to do over again, if I knew the future, if I knew where we were going to end up where we did, would I have started much earlier? You better believe it.\"</p><p>In reality, there's little chance a freshman congressman and a lame-duck congresswoman on a random party line would make a dent in the polls against a sitting president and a former vice president. But prospective third-party voters who caught Weinstein on Rogan's show could be swayed, which given enough volume, might chip away at the already modest expected returns for third parties.</p><p>As for the notion that the Libertarians and Greens would team up with Unity 2020, representatives from both parties said they have not been asked.</p><ul class=\"read-more-links\"><li>Read more:</li><li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/stop-making-excuses-protesters-act-like-bad-cops-portland-seattle-2020-9\" data-analytics-position=\"4\" data-analytics-module=\"\">Stop making excuses for the 'protesters' that act like bad cops</a><br><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/depression-doesnt-take-time-off-coronavirus-pandemic-quarantine-lockdown-2020-5\" data-analytics-position=\"5\" data-analytics-module=\"\"></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/depression-doesnt-take-time-off-coronavirus-pandemic-quarantine-lockdown-2020-5\" data-analytics-position=\"5\" data-analytics-module=\"\">Depression doesn't take time off for a pandemic</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/delete-social-media-phone-parasite-mental-health-instagram-twitter-facebook-2020-9\" data-analytics-position=\"6\" data-analytics-module=\"\">Social media is a parasite, it bleeds you to live</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-dangerously-gullible-uncle-facebook-antifa-conspiracy-theory-2020-9\" data-analytics-position=\"7\" data-analytics-module=\"\">Trump is your dangerously gullible uncle on Facebook</a></li></ul><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/unity-2020-idw-patriotic-bipartisan-presidential-tulsi-gabbard-crenshaw-2020-9'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=w476fOXwOtA:BE5JYHMQEc0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=w476fOXwOtA:BE5JYHMQEc0:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=w476fOXwOtA:BE5JYHMQEc0:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=w476fOXwOtA:BE5JYHMQEc0:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=w476fOXwOtA:BE5JYHMQEc0:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=w476fOXwOtA:BE5JYHMQEc0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=w476fOXwOtA:BE5JYHMQEc0:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=w476fOXwOtA:BE5JYHMQEc0:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/w476fOXwOtA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 20 Sep 2020 12:10:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f64e4c3323fc4001e0d7236?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"b3e35532309b80b6aa61a9f40d647fa0","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn61@2020_2/2020/09/20/17-35-35-711_bc852207517b55aa.webp","destWidth":1610,"destHeight":1208,"sourceBytes":68352,"destBytes":68352,"author":"afisher@businessinsider.com (Anthony L.

That's down from 16,350 km (10,159 miles) <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/nasa-s-juno-spacecraft-spots-jupiter-s-great-red-spot\">in 2017</a>, but still significantly larger than Earth's&#160;<a href=\"https://www.universetoday.com/15055/diameter-of-earth/\">12,742-km</a>&#160;(7917.5-mile) diameter.</p><p>Recently, the Great Red Spot's shrinkage has slowed, but not entirely halted.</p><p>Just below it is a storm called Oval BA. It's much younger than the Great Red Spot, but absolutely fascinating in its own right. It&#160;<a href=\"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0019103500965485\">formed in the late 1990s</a>&#160;from three smaller storms that had been raging for 60 years, and has been intensifying ever since.</p><p>Interestingly, it started its newly merged life as a white storm. Then, in 2006, scientists noticed that it was changing colour – turning <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20081019024917/https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2006/02mar_redjr.htm\">red like its larger cousin</a>. It didn't stay that way, as you can see. It faded back to white over the course of a few years. But Hubble's new image reveals that the white coloration wasn't permanent either. Oval BA seems to be turning red again.</p><p>This will be a fascinating thing to watch in the future, to determine if there's any rhyme or reason behind these colour changes, but it would likely be many years before a pattern can be discerned.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f652d8757b7da001ee12986?format=jpeg\" alt=\"jupiter storm\" height=\"652\" width=\"1314\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>A bright white storm has appeared in Jupiter&#39;s northern hemisphere.\n<p class=\"copyright\">(NASA, ESA, A.

We've not seen these before, and scientists think that it might be a nascent long-lived storm, similar to the Great Red Spot and Oval BA in the south.</p><p>There's certainly a lot there for planetary scientists to sink their teeth into as they try to understand Jupiter's wild and unpredictable atmosphere.

That's why we have seasons.</p><p>It's also why the northern and southern hemisphere experience seasons <a href=\"https://www.e-education.psu.edu/emsc100tsb/node/227\">at opposite times</a>: During winter in the northern hemisphere, the southern hemisphere is tilted more towards the sun, and vice versa.</p><p>Meanwhile, Earth is also constantly rotating, which keeps its heating even – kind of like a planet-sized rotisserie chicken <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/when-spring-equinox-happens-march-2018-03#:~:text=The%20vernal%20or%20spring%20equinox,sun%20appears%20almost%20directly%20overhead.\">twisting over a spit</a>.&#160;</p><p>The axial tilt's most dramatic effect comes during the solstices, since those are the two days when one side of the planet is tilted the farthest away from the sun and the other is the closest. On December 21, the northern hemisphere receives less than nine hours of daylight, while the southern hemisphere receives more than 15.</p><p>During the summer solstice, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/physicsJ/status/1274224011287785472?s=20\">O'Donoghue explained</a> on Twitter, \"sunlight is most intense as it only has to pass through a short column of atmosphere.\" That's why it gets hot during summertime in general.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5d88cea52e22af0ad94fd20c?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Earth during equinox\" height=\"1213\" width=\"1667\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Shayanne Gal/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>The two times of the year when Earth's axis isn't tilted towards or away from the sun – leading sunlight to hit the northern and southern hemispheres equally — are the equinoxes. On those days, both sides of the planet experience an equal 12 hours of sunlight and darkness.</p><p>So if you were to stand directly on the equator at 9:30 a.m. ET on Tuesday, your shadow would be at <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/when-spring-equinox-happens-march-2018-03#:~:text=The%20vernal%20or%20spring%20equinox,sun%20appears%20almost%20directly%20overhead.\">its absolute minimum</a>. The sun would also appear almost directly overhead.&#160;</p><p>But the shadowless moment would be fleeting, since Earth moves around the sun at about 66,600 mph.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/how-equinox-and-solstice-work-in-simple-animation-2020-9'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=oH9CM14i10c:WkGrQHOq89E:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=oH9CM14i10c:WkGrQHOq89E:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=oH9CM14i10c:WkGrQHOq89E:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=oH9CM14i10c:WkGrQHOq89E:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=oH9CM14i10c:WkGrQHOq89E:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=oH9CM14i10c:WkGrQHOq89E:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=oH9CM14i10c:WkGrQHOq89E:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=oH9CM14i10c:WkGrQHOq89E:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/oH9CM14i10c\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Sun, 20 Sep 2020 13:34:00 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5f64f449323fc4001e0d729f?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"595b76ba96d81618c90f79246950d7dc","destWidth":1617,"destHeight":1213,"sourceBytes":39078,"destBytes":39078,"author":"insider@insider.com (Susie Neilson)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5d079cfe6fc92046153c4b73?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn66@2020_1/2020/09/20/17-35-43-625_206c2e0f96894d3c.webp","https://i.insider.com/5f64e8fa323fc4001e0d7252?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn45@2020_5/2020/09/20/17-35-51-231_9ae96a0f9655b770.webp","https://i.insider.com/5d88cea52e22af0ad94fd20c?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn88@2020_1/2020/09/20/17-35-45-679_0e91716ac7039027.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn62@2020_4/2020/09/20/17-35-46-023_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=oH9CM14i10c:WkGrQHOq89E:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn9@2020_5/2020/09/20/17-35-43-343_c8f23dfb880e1b23.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=oH9CM14i10c:WkGrQHOq89E:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn17@2020_6/2020/09/20/17-35-38-001_952e7598d7ee97a0.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":null,"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=oH9CM14i10c:WkGrQHOq89E:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn6@2020_6/2020/09/20/17-35-43-337_3947c55c3f2610fa.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/oH9CM14i10c":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn24@2020_1/2020/09/20/17-35-40-099_a7699cc2e36a03b1.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1600623333160},{"createdTime":"2020-09-21 01:35:33","updatedTime":"2020-09-21 01:35:33","title":"These custom sleeper cabs are like luxurious tiny homes for long-haul truckers — see inside","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/ari-legacy-sleepers-custom-sleeper-cabs-long-haul-truck-drivers-2020-9","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f64e0e057b7da001ee127a6?format=jpeg\" alt=\"ARI Legacy Sleepers\" height=\"1884\" width=\"3877\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">ARI Legacy Sleepers</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul class=\"summary-list\">\n<li>ARI Legacy Sleepers builds custom sleeper cabs for long-haul truckers.&#160;</li>\n<li>The sleepers offer amenities truckers don't always have access to, like toilets, showers, kitchens, and full-sized beds.&#160;</li>\n<li>ARI can build in cool features like motorcycle garages, pull-out grills, upscale kitchens, and gaming stations.&#160;</li>\n<li>While a basic sleeper might run you $55,000, a large, customized build could cost upward of $150,000.&#160;</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet\">Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>Life on the road can be challenging for long-haul truckers; they generally work for weeks at a time, sleep in a small area in the cab, and depend on truck stops for the restroom, meals, and showers.

John Wayne Walding, then in his mid-20s, suddenly found himself in an intense firefight that changed his life forever.</p><p>The mission was to capture or kill a local terrorist leader holed up in a mountain fortress occupied by Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin forces in eastern Afghanistan.</p><p>The plan was to insert US Special Forces soldiers and Afghan commandos into a valley below by helicopter and take the enemy by surprise. Once they were on the ground, the joint force was expected to climb into the mountains on foot, infiltrate the town, neutralize the hostiles, and get out.</p><p>Some of the troops called to execute the mission questioned whether it was too risky. Their concerns were brushed aside, and the mission moved forward as planned. A fellow Green Beret who went with Walding on the mission told Insider it was \"cursed\" from the start.</p><p>This is the story of not just that fateful mission, but Walding's refusal to give up after tragedy struck.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f5fe2eb323fc4001e0d6261?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Ryan Wallen and John Wayne Walding\" height=\"940\" width=\"733\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>John Wayne Walding and Ryan Wallen, a fellow Green Beret who accompanied Walding on the fateful mission.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Courtesy photo</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h2>'A very long day at the office'</h2><p>On April 6, 2008, a handful of troops with Operational Detachment Alpha 3336, 3rd Special Forces Group and a number of Afghan commandos flew into Shok Valley. It was the start of what Walding called \"a very long day at the office.\"</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f6746ca323fc4001e0d7506?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Shok Valley\" height=\"800\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Shok Valley\n<p class=\"copyright\">US Army graphic</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Their troubles began almost immediately upon arrival.</p><p>\"We couldn't even land, the terrain was so f---ing bad,\" Walding's friend and fellow Green Beret, former Staff Sgt. Ryan Wallen, recalled. \"Our helicopter just kind of hovered about 10 feet up over a freezing cold river and gigantic rocks, and we had to jump out of the back. This was already a rough start.\"</p><p>Their situation quickly got worse. As the lead element made its way toward the objective, the mountains suddenly erupted with gunfire. A large force of several hundred enemies ambushed the American and Afghan troops, upending the mission and turning it into a terrifying fight for survival.</p><p>\"Gunfire just opened up on us,\" Wallen said. He was positioned down by the river near the base of the mountain when the bullets started to fly.</p><p>\"I took a [rocket-propelled grenade] and kind of got blown out,\" Wallen continued. \"I was laying half in the water, bleeding out of my throat and chest, beaten up a little bit. The overpressure kind of f---ed me up.\"</p><p>Nothing vital had been damaged in the blast, so the team's medic, Staff Sgt. Ron Shurer, was able to get him patched up and back in the fight. Farther up the mountain, the lead element was pinned down and taking heavy fire.</p><p>An Afghan interpreter had been killed, and two US soldiers, Staff Sgt. Dillon Behr and Staff Sgt. Luis Morales, were severely wounded. Supporting, Walding moved into position between them and the incoming fire. \"That's when I got shot,\" he said.</p><p>An enemy sniper shot Walding in the leg, nearly tearing it from his body. \"It was hanging on by like a tendon or two,\" Wallen said. \"I've never seen an injury that looked that bad.\"</p><p>\"I never will forget falling forward and then rolling over to see that leg just hanging there by only about an inch of flesh,\" Walding recalled. \"It was the worst pain I've ever felt in my life.\"</p><p>Walding was not done fighting though. After putting a tourniquet in place to stop the bleeding, he used his boot laces to strap the bottom part of his leg to his thigh, picked up his rifle, and got back to it.</p><p>Most of the US Special Forces team suffered wounds of one kind or another, but \"as f---ed up as everybody was, we didn't have time for anybody to lay there bleeding and dying,\" Wallen said.</p><p>American planes were called into conduct dozens of danger-close airstrikes with large bombs that Walding said blacked out the sun with debris.</p><p>Unable to move forward with their mission, the US and Afghan troops fought fiercely for hours just to stay alive until they could be pulled out.</p><p>Wallen and a few others helped get Walding down the mountain and to the evacuation point. \"As the medevac birds were coming in, we were dragging casualties across the river, and it was freezing,\" he said.&#160;</p><p>They tried a couple of times to get Walding on a helicopter but were unsuccessful, as the helos were either full or taking rounds, and each time they failed, they had to carry him back across the river to a safe position shielded from the gunfire.</p><p>\"Finally, a third bird came in, and we took JW back across the river a fifth time,\" Wallen said. \"We were finally able to get him on that bird, but we ended up giving John hypothermia along with all of his damn injuries. It was like bad things kept stacking up.\"</p><p>All of the US troops that went into Shok Valley made it out alive. Some of the Afghans, however, did not. Although they were unable to complete the mission, the US and Afghan forces left behind hundreds of enemy dead.</p><p>Ten members of Walding's team, himself included, would later be awarded the Silver Star. Not since Vietnam had that many Silver Stars been awarded for a single engagement. And, two of the soldiers who were in Shok Valley <a href=\"https://mohmuseum.org/battle-of-shok-valley/\">later received</a> the Medal of Honor for their courage under fire.</p><p>The immediate aftermath was no celebration though. Walding, who had hoped that his leg could be saved, went into surgery. \"I never will forget waking up the next day,\" he recalled. He said he was afraid to look down. When he finally did, he cried.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f63a1a0323fc4001e0d6eb6?format=jpeg\" alt=\"John Wayne Walding\" height=\"1506\" width=\"1000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>John Wayne Walding\n<p class=\"copyright\">US Army Photo by Capt. David Chace</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h2><strong>'A leg was not going to stop me'</strong></h2><p>John Wayne Walding was born on the Fourth of July in Texas. His father named him after the famous actor who starred in classic Westerns and war movies because, in his words, if \"you have a cool birthday, you need a cool name.\"</p><p>But while Walding was named after the man who directed and starred in the 1968 film \"The Green Berets,\" he never thought much about the military until he was about 20 years old and realized he needed a real job.</p><p>Walding talked to a recruiter who asked him if he wanted to shoot missiles. He said \"Hell yeah\" and joined the Army as a Patriot missile operator.</p><p>He found his true calling after he joined up though. \"As soon as I saw the Green Berets and what the tip of the spear really is, that really got my gears spinning,\" he told Insider.</p><p>Wallen met Walding when the latter joined his team as a Green Beret, and they quickly became good friends.</p><p>\"It was one of those connections that, just right away, we just kind of hit it off,\" Wallen said. \"We developed a really strong bond, and then it was just solidified when we were baptized in blood together.\"</p><p>Wallen said he was one of the first people to see Walding when he came out of surgery after being wounded in Shok Valley.</p><p>Walding had been torn apart in battle, something not easily overcome, something that some never overcome, but he determined he was not done being an elite soldier. \"Donning that Green Beret was one of the most profound moments of my life, and a leg was not going to stop me from doing that,\" he told Insider.</p><p>Being a Green Beret meant being a part of something special, something meaningful that's bigger than any one person. Reflecting on the events that unfolded in Shok Valley, Walding said, \"We didn't get through that day because I was great or any of our guys. It was because we were willing to fight to the death to keep each other alive.\"</p><p>\"You don't just wake up the day after all of that and say, 'Well, I guess I'll hang up the hat.'\"</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f601560323fc4001e0d62ad?format=jpeg\" alt=\"John Wayne Walding\" height=\"819\" width=\"1224\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>John Wayne Walding\n<p class=\"copyright\">Courtesy photo</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h2>'You do it because you love it'</h2><p>Walding said that he tries to live his life in such a way that he is not simply good, but great. Following his recovery, he decided to become a Special Forces sniper.</p><p>Just two years after he sustained a life-altering injury, Walding began the intense seven-week Special Forces Sniper Course at the John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School at Fort Bragg, North Carolina equipped with a ruggedized prosthetic and a determination to excel against all odds.</p><p>\"Why did I keep going? Because I loved it,\" Walding said.</p><p>\"You don't do what I did because you like it. You do it because you love it,\" he continued. \"To become a Green Beret, there's a lot of people that quit because they just liked it. They liked the idea of being one, but that's not how I live.\"</p><p>Snipers are essential assets who provide battlefield intelligence and long-range precision fires, and the training is challenging across the military.</p><p>For the Special Forces, sniper training can be even more demanding. Through shooting and marksmanship sessions, gun runs, stalking, fast rope training, and climbing exercises, Walding held his own despite his prosthetic. \"I never finished last,\" he said.</p><p>Walding made history in the summer of 2010 by becoming the first amputee to graduate from the elite special warfare sniper course.</p><p>\"His story is incredible,\" Wallen said. \"I don't know that many people on the planet have the kind of resilience he does.\" That's not to say that there weren't bad days, but when times got tough, it was his faith, family and friends, and love of country that got him through.</p><p>Walding wanted to return to his team and operational status, but he ultimately decided against it, opting instead to stay on as an instructor.</p><p>\"I knew that no matter how good I was with one leg, a Green Beret with two was always going to be better,\" Walding told Insider, explaining that he would never want to be in a scenario where one of his brothers or sisters was injured or killed because of him. \"I wouldn't be able to live with myself,\" he said.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f63bc3457b7da001ee12567?format=jpeg\" alt=\"John Wayne Walding\" height=\"3840\" width=\"5760\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>John Wayne Walding\n<p class=\"copyright\">Courtesy photo</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h2>'Forever remember the cost of freedom'</h2><p>After serving 12 years in the military, Walding retired in 2013 as a Sergeant First Class. He now lives in Texas with his wife and four kids.</p><p>As a civilian, Walding continues to serve.</p><p>He started Gallantry Global Logistics, a company named after the words on the back of his Silver Star, which reads \"for gallantry in action.\" He hopes to see it become the largest veteran employer in Texas. He is also the co-founder of Live to Give, a water bottle company that donates half of all profits to veteran and first responder charities.</p><p>Walding named his shipping company after his Silver Star, but the Purple Heart he was awarded for the injuries he suffered in Afghanistan has tremendous meaning too.</p><p>\"I wear that Purple Heart figuratively every day,\" Walding said. \"Every single day, I wake up and I see my leg is missing. I will forever remember the cost of freedom. It really is a driving factor for me to not be good, but be great.\"</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

For three years, he says he spent half his summer vacations working for corporations and the other half living like a monk in India.</p><p>Along his journey, Jay applied the mindsets and practices he learned as a monk to everyday life, with a mission to make wisdom go viral by creating videos — which are now viewed by billions of people worldwide.</p><p>More recently, he incorporated his journey, and the lessons he learned along the way, into his first book, \"<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/a-practical-approach-to-finding-meaning-in-your-work-2020-9\">Think Like a Monk: Train Your Mind for Peace and Purpose Every Day</a>.\"&#160;</p><p>In our conversation, Jay talks about uncovering your personal values, following your own life journey, the importance of intentions, overcoming fear and his best career advice.</p><p><strong>You start your book talking about values. How do you figure out what your values are and then start to notice those values in other people?</strong></p><p>If you want to really know your values, look at where you spend your time, and look at where you spend your money. That is a genuine view of what your values are. People say, \"Oh, do a reflection exercise,\" or, \"Look inside yourself and ask yourself what your values are.\"</p><p>The truth is your values are what you spend your time, and what you spend your money, and what you spend your energy on. So let's look at time, for example. We spend a <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/science-explains-why-we-really-do-need-to-sleep-a-third-of-our-lives-away/\">third of our lives in bed</a>. We spent countless hours getting ready every day. You're spending all of that time over a lifetime just taking care of your body.</p><p>Most of us spend most of our money on rent; <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/06/how-much-of-your-income-you-should-be-spending-on-housing.html\">25% or 30% of our money is spent on rent</a>. So our values are dictated by where we spend our time, and where we spend our money. And what I recommend to everyone in this book is do an audit of where you spend your time and money, and ask yourself whether that feels right. If you do that activity and you're like, \"Oh, wow, this is exactly what I believe in,\" then you're winning. If you do that activity and you're getting scared by the numbers, then it's time you need to switch.</p><p><strong>There are so many different things competing for our time now, especially with social media and the fear of missing out. How do we decide what to listen to and move in a direction that's authentic to us, while avoiding distractions?</strong></p><p>I read somewhere that we're exposed to more negative information today in 24 hours than we were in our whole lifetime 25 years ago. That's insane, if you think about it.</p><p>So the amount we're having to process, whether it's notifications, alerts, news messages, it's just completely sensationalized and catapulted in terms of volume. That's where our values become so important, because if you don't have a core set of values that you've defined, it means you're constantly being guided by everyone else's.</p><p>There's a beautiful statement in the Bhagavad Gita that I quote in \"Think Like a Monk.\" The verse says: \"Better to live your own life imperfectly then to impersonate someone else's life perfectly.\"&#160;</p><p>I think all of us, at some point in our life come to a moment of reflection where we think, \"I think I'm living someone else's life.\" I'm doing someone else's job. I'm doing someone else's career. I'm doing someone else's passion. I'm not actually living the life I want to live.</p><p>It would be great to get to a point where I get an opportunity and I can say, \"Actually, Dan would be better at this opportunity, why don't I give it to him?\"</p><p>That would actually be maturing in your values, and that would actually be maturing in knowing what's right for you and what's right for someone else. You're able to look at something and say, \"That is definitely for me because my values are so aligned, but actually I could find things that my friends would do better at, and I should be able to introduce them to that.\"&#160;</p><p><strong>Can you talk a little bit about setting intentions and then following through on them, because a lot of people talk a big game, but action doesn't follow?&#160;</strong></p><p>Intention is the why behind what you do. I have two separate clients who give a lot in charity every single year.</p><p>Let's say that their charity amount, every single year, is in the one to five million dollar range. They both give the same amount in charity. One does it for press and publicity, and the other one does it because they really believe in the cause and then we really want to serve and support the people that they're donating money to. The second one is the happier person.</p><p>The intention doesn't affect whether the kids are helped, whether the money received at the end helps the people change their lives or whether the money has an impact, because that happens either way. But the intention defines whether you are happy, and that's what I love so much about it.</p><p><strong>One of my favorite parts of the book is when you talk about getting to the root of the problem and you say, ask why, why, why, why. Can you give an example about how you did that in your own life?</strong></p><p>In the book, I talk about how to build a \"why ladder,\" because mostly what we're dealing with is our superficial fears, or we're dealing with the latest trend and news that's upsetting us, but we're not really dealing with the root.</p><p>And the problem is if you're not dealing with the root, you can't really solve it; you're just dealing with another symptom.</p><p>An example is, let's say I was scared of going off to become a monk and worried about what that meant. I asked myself, \"Why am I scared of that?\" Answer: \"Because I may never get a job again.\"</p><p>Okay, why am I scared that I may never get a job again? Because I may never be able to make money or support my family.</p><p>Okay. Well, why am I scared of that? Well, because I don't want to let my parents down. It's like, well, why don't I want to let my parents down? Because I don't want to let my parents down.</p><p>And then all of a sudden it hit you that that is the root cause of why you're not taking this moment. Now, you can actually focus your energy on overcoming that fear rather than what you thought the fear was, which was that you're scared of becoming a monk.</p><p>And so, so many of us are not making that career change because we think we're scared of something, but we haven't really found the root of our fear and so we don't deal with the root of our fear — and that way it consumes us.&#160;</p><p><strong>What's your best piece of career advice?&#160;</strong></p><p>Go really deep in becoming an expert in your passion. I have this rule right now, where every year I should be doing something that I love. So there should be something in my life that I'm loving. Right now what I'm loving is my podcast \"On Purpose.\" I'm in love with doing it because I've been doing it for a year and I've got into the flow.</p><p>Every year, you should be doing something that you're learning. So you should always be learning about what you want to do the next year. If you're not learning a year in advance, that dream is not happening. So when I was writing the book, I learned how to write a book the year before, so that made writing easier. The year before I launched the podcast, I was learning how to launch a podcast. And then every year you should be launching something. So this book is what I'm launching this year.&#160;</p><p>Every year, pick something that you're loving, something that you're learning, and something that you're launching. The loving gives you satisfaction and happiness, the learning gives you excitement and curiosity, and the launching gives you a new learning curve, a new risk, and a new excitement.</p><p><strong>Watch the full video interview on </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE5uo2SodR4\"><strong>YouTube</strong></a><strong>&#160;</strong></p><iframe

And earlier, news broke that Donald Trump admitted in March to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/09/09/us/trump-vs-biden/trump-acknowledges-report-that-he-played-down-the-threat-of-the-virus-calling-himself-a-cheerleader\">intentionally downplaying the virus</a>, even though he was aware that the virus is \"deadly\" and more threatening than the seasonal flu. Since Trump first started lying about the threat, nearly <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/09/09/covid-updates-astrazeneca-vaccine-trial-honolulu-trump/5754245002/\">200,000 Americans</a> have died from COVID-19.&#160;</p><p>Trump's only concern seems to be the optics of his re-election campaign, putting the safety of students in the crosshairs. Students have been thrust into a lose-lose situation. Either schools can choose to convert to virtual learning and let students fall behind academically, or they can return to in-person classes while risking their communities' health. Either way, students are the ones who lose.</p><p>Virtual learning isn't working, and it's<a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-and-social-sector/our-insights/covid-19-and-student-learning-in-the-united-states-the-hurt-could-last-a-lifetime#\"> widening the gap</a> between students based on factors like socioeconomic status and race. Parents are expected to work full-time jobs on top of re-learning algebra they haven't seen since the '90s. And students with family members at home during the day are the lucky ones — many students don't have parents who have the ability to work remotely.</p><p>Additionally, some students have even struggled through virtual learning without having internet access at home. Just recently, a photo went viral of two students who resorted to<a href=\"https://twitter.com/kdeleon/status/1299386969873461248\"> sitting outside of a Taco Bell</a> to connect to their online classes.</p><p>On the other hand, I've seen firsthand that in-person learning during the pandemic isn't the solution either. Since we returned to the University of Notre Dame for classes on campus less than a month ago,<a href=\"https://here.nd.edu/our-approach/dashboard/\"> 654 members</a> of our community have already tested positive for COVID-19.</p><p>After an immediate spike less than two weeks into classes, the school had to temporarily revert to virtual learning to get the virus under control. Notre Dame is doing everything it can to keep us safe, but there's no way to contain the virus when it is relentlessly spreading from coast to coast. Notre Dame's not alone — take a look at other colleges and universities across the country. From the<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/they-put-us-all-danger-unc-chapel-hill-students-outraged-n1237200\"> University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill</a> to the<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/29/us/university-of-alabama-covid-19-cases-trnd/index.html\"> University of Alabama</a>, infection rates skyrocketed once students returned to campus, and the outcomes could be deadly.</p><p>On top of the impact on our learning this year, the pandemic is going to harm our career trajectories for years to come. Trump's mismanagement of the coronavirus crisis has cost millions of Americans their jobs, forced small businesses to close, and destroyed our economy.</p><p>Students have already felt the economic impacts of COVID-19 after<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-internships-cancelled-college-student-job-2020-3\"> losing their internships</a> and summer jobs. For those of us who worked virtually this summer, missing out on critical in-person professional experiences and networking opportunities is bound to stagnate our growth when we begin our careers.&#160;</p><h2>We can fix this at the ballot box&#160;</h2><p>The coronavirus touched my own family this spring. My great-uncle checked into a hospital after experiencing coronavirus symptoms in March, and he never saw a member of our family again. He passed away several weeks later — a solitary and painful death. My story isn't unique – people around the world have suffered loss from the virus. By failing to act, the Trump administration told us that those lives weren't worth saving. I had a semblance of hope that Trump would see the death toll and respond by taking action, but instead he dismissed our losses,<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/04/politics/trump-covid-death-toll-is-what-it-is/index.html\"> saying</a>, \"It is what it is.\"&#160;</p><p>When a crisis happens, the most important part of being a leader is having a plan. But Trump failed to have a plan in the early days of the pandemic, and he still doesn't have one now. Back-to-school season is a nightmare this year because we are suffering the consequences of Trump's failure to protect the American people.</p><p>Students deserve steady leadership to address this crisis. We need a President who will put his constituents first by creating a plan informed by science. We need a leader who will believe that my great-uncle's life was one that was worth saving.&#160;</p><p>From the early days of the pandemic, Joe Biden immediately created a<a href=\"https://joebiden.com/beat-covid19/\"> roadmap</a> to steer our nation out of this crisis. He put forth a<a href=\"https://joebiden.com/school-reopening/\"> plan</a> for reopening schools safely — something Trump should have done long ago. Under the leadership of the Biden-Harris administration, schools won't be forced into the same no-win situation next time around. We will finally have leaders who will take concrete steps to ridding us of this virus once and for all.</p><p>Joe Biden leads with purpose. He listens to the advice of public health experts. Biden has the empathy to understand the pain that students are going though, and he will restore the soul of our nation. Students need Joe Biden in the White House.</p><p><em>Rachel Palermo is a J.D. candidate at Notre Dame Law School.

stories</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>Many RV, camper van, and travel trailer makers have started catering their road travel builds to accommodate the rising popularity of digital nomads and \"work from anywhere\" crowd amid the pandemic.</p><p>A<a href=\"https://s29814.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/StateofIndependence-ResearchBrief-DigitalNomads.pdf\">&#160;study by MBO Partners</a> found that 4.8 million Americans called themselves \"digital nomads\" in 2018. And now that the pandemic has forced 42% percent of US workers to work from home full-time — <a href=\"https://news.stanford.edu/2020/06/29/snapshot-new-working-home-economy/\">according to data from Stanford economist Nicholas Bloom</a> — this number may continue skyrocketing.</p><p>It's also no industry secret that the pandemic and this subsequent work from home movement has caused a road travel reawakening among Americans. In recent months, many <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/camper-van-conversion-companies-resilience-in-sales-despite-the-coronavirus-2020-5\">camper van</a> and RV makers have <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/rv-sales-skyrocketing-as-lockdown-ends-2020-6\">reported skyrocketing interest messages, inquiries, and sales</a> amid the pandemic's presence in the US.</p><p>This rise in sales amid an unprecedented time, combined with an increasing number of permanent and long-term remote workers, has put a spotlight on the digital nomad community. And despite how recent this development has been, the impact can already be seen by camper van rental platforms such as Europe-based Indie Campers, which reported a 66% increase in requests from digital nomads looking to book camper vans from July to September comparing data from 2019 to 2020.</p><p>As a result, this popular trend is now being observed and tapped into by the industry that enables the \"work from anywhere\" community</p><p>This includes <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/flippie-diy-ikea-based-ram-promaster-van-built-less-than-1000-2019-10\">Ram Promaster</a> van conversion company Dave and Matt Vans, which has about a quarter of its customer base using its vans for digital nomad purposes, according to the company.</p><p>\"Particularly since COVID, it's been really cool to track the clients who use [our] vans to work remotely,\" Matt Felser, co-founder of Dave and Matt Vans, told Business Insider. \"They still have a home base, whatever that may be, but they have identified the van as their chance to be able to go to the mountains for a week at a time … [and] do their job, and have purchased these vehicles to work remotely for weeks at a time.\"</p><h2>Old amenities for a new market</h2><p>Several road travel makers, such as Dave and Matt Vans, have been in the \"work from anywhere\" market since before the pandemic by including amenities like bathrooms, tables, and internet and phone connectivity packages.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f57f0167ed0ee001e25e126?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Bowlus Road Chief&#39;s Endless Highways Performance Edition. 1\" height=\"1162\" width=\"1549\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Bowlus Road Chief&#39;s Endless Highways Performance Edition.\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://bowlusroadchief.com/endless-highways-performance-edition/\" target=\"_blank\">Bowlus Road Chief</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>For these makers, it's more about adding updates as they come instead of completely changing any existing floor plans.</p><p>\"The customer we designed for's ultimate vacation does include still being connected in some way,\" luxury trailer maker <a href=\"https://bowlusroadchief.com/blog/travel-guides/behind-the-adventurer-helena-mitchell/\">Bowlus Road Chief's head of sales</a> Helena Mitchell-Long Bowlus told Business Insider.</p><p>According to Mitchell-Long, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/bowlus-road-chief-luxury-225000-rv-trailer-off-grid-weeks-2020-5\">Bowlus Road Chief's Endless Highways trailer</a> already has a floor plan that is suitable for remote digital nomads. Therefore, instead of creating a new product that will only cater to the \"work from the road\" crowd, the company will add updates to its existing trailer. This includes, for example, the potential addition of a stronger WiFi router when it becomes available in the market.</p><p>The \"update-based\" model is also being employed by Leisure Travel Vans, which once specialized in building a wide variety of RVs and travel trailers before pivoting to smaller <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/leisure-travel-vans-2021-unity-rv-mercedes-benz-sprinter-2020-8\">luxury Class C RVs — such as the Unity RV —</a> in order to match the recent rising demands of smaller van-based builds.&#160;</p><p>\"[The updates] are continuing, and it's always going to be continuing,\" Dean Corrigal of Leisure Travel Vans told Business Insider. \"It's a big growing segment.\"</p><p>According to Corrigal, about 30 to 40% of emails that Leisure Travel Vans has been receiving have come from customers who have asked specifically about the vans' mobile office capabilities.</p><p>As of now, the company estimates that 20% of its customers are currently using their Leisure Travel Vans as a mobile office, but Corrigal predicts this number will continue increasing in the future.</p><p>\"It's a huge amount of first-time buyers sending request emails to us ... people that want to work from their RVs are right behind that,\" Corrigal said. \"I think it's a huge growing segment, and the longer this COVID-19 thing lasts, the more the RV industry is going to go forward and push in sales.\"</p><h2>New amenities for old players</h2><p>Moving forward, several other makers who haven't traditionally catered their products to the digital nomad segment will now start planning updates and floor plans in-part around the community.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f57f08c7ed0ee001e25e128?format=jpeg\" alt=\"The GlamperRV Business Line.\" height=\"1666\" width=\"2222\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The GlamperRV Business Line.\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://www.glamperrv.co.uk/glamperrvs/glamperrv-business-line/\" target=\"_blank\">GlamperRV</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Some road travel makers have altered the design of their tiny homes on wheels to be remote work-friendly. This includes <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/glamperrv-rv-with-luxury-office-workspace-2020-7\">GlamperRV's $93,450 Business Line RV</a>, which was created amid the pandemic to meet the demands for \"flexible home offices,\" according to the UK-based RV maker.</p><p>\"As we learned more about the Class B van business, we started to see those demands for connectivity,\" vice president at Winnebago Brian Hazelton told Business Insider. \"That customer group was really pushing us to do … a lot of those things before the COVID pandemic started.</p><p>\"But obviously with COVID, we're ramping up the pace and really trying to look at the product and say, 'Okay, how can we not take the traditional RV and make it into an office, but maybe start designing the office and make it into a traditional RV',\" Hazelton continued.</p><p>For Winnebago, this means designing an office-capable RV — or updating prior builds — with options like improved soundproofing, quieter power systems, and ergonomic seating.</p><p>The motorhome maker has yet to implement all of these changes amid the pandemic, especially because Winnebago wants to create a space that is customizable by offering different floor plans, according to Hazelton. It has, however, recently included remote work-friendly ticket items — such as larger countertops and a quieter generator — into several of its currently existing builds, and will be revealing new products in the fall.</p><h2>RVs now need to be designed to work in</h2><p>\"Work from home is now one of the big boxes that product development has to check when they're considering a new product,\" Hazelton said.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f57f0ce7ed0ee001e25e12b?format=jpeg\" alt=\"AIRMKT 2021 Flying Cloud 23FB Exterior Bug Eye_80832 WEB\" height=\"1690\" width=\"2253\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The 2021 Flying Cloud.\n<p class=\"copyright\"><a href=\"https://www.airstream.com/blog/refreshing-the-flying-cloud-decor-for-2021/\" target=\"_blank\">Airstream</a></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Airstream is also taking a similar approach to Winnebago by updating existing floor plans to be more inclusive of the remote workers segment, president and CEO of Airstream Bob Wheeler told Business Insider.</p><p>According to Wheeler, the road travel company was originally planning to cater to its existing \"work from anywhere\" client base, but the pandemic expedited these plans.</p><p>\"We tried to look at some of our floor plans and say, 'where could we carve out a dedicated work area so you don't have to clean up your workday in order to have a meal [at the dinette table]?'\" Wheeler said.</p><p>The new layouts will feature a compact desk with \"stowaway seating\", USB and 110-volt outlets, and desk storage. But in order to create space for the desk, the company will have to make adjustments to pre-existing amenities, such as decreasing the size of dinettes or removing a secondary bed.</p><p>According to Wheeler, the Airstream is hoping to have these new floor plans available by this month. As of now, it will <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/airstreams-new-2021-flying-cloud-and-international-interiors-2020-6\">only be in the Flying Cloud travel trailer</a>, specifically in the 30-foot option, 27-foot front bedroom, 25-foot front bedroom, and 23-foot corner bed floor plans.&#160;</p><p>\"It's not overkill,\" Wheeler said. \"You don't need a five-foot-wide slab [desk] in your travel trailer, but we find that when we talk to people about the option to have this area where they can set up and leave their work set up and still live in the rest of the trailer, that's really appealing.\"</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/rv-camper-van-travel-trailer-makers-changing-digital-nomads-2020-9'>Business
