Google famously entered the smartphone industry with the Pixel, its first, entirely &#8216;Made by Google&#8217; smartphone. The Pixel smartphone went onto redefine what a pure Android experience could look like, becoming the gold standard in the Android OS experience. James Tsai&#8217;s Google Pixel Smartwatch concept does the same for the Android Wear OS.</p><p>Embodying Google&#8217;s playful-serious aesthetic, the Pixel Smartwatch concept comes in a traditional round format, and in a variety of quirkily named colors. The Android Wear OS logo displays clearly on the always-on display of the watch, transforming into a colorful set of watch hands every time you look at it to read the time. The watch comes with Google&#8217;s top-notch voice AI, all of Google&#8217;s native apps, and a heart-rate monitor on the back, which ties in well with Google&#8217;s acquisition of Fitbit and their entire fitness-tech ecosystem. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if this wearable concept were entirely waterproof too, just to fire shots at Apple!</p><p>Designer: <a\nhref=\"https://www.jamestsai.com/\" target=\"_blank\"

range of furniture called the My Old New Series which she describes as the materialization of the feelings of lightness while exposing the constant restlessness caused by the perception of how time flows. It reminds me of the Japanese art of &#8216;Kintsugi&#8217; where you put back broken pots using gold &#8211; so every crack is like a gold vein. This has a similar sentiment to it as it completes the furniture with acrylics &#8211; I call it &#8216;Budget Kintsugi&#8217;.</p><p>&#8220;It offers freedom and shares the building momentum. Still with questions, spaces, breaths &#8211; never ending, but gaining fearlessly the field of possibilities along the way and hope for the untouchable future,&#8221; says Freitas. It is complete within itself even if at a first glance it doesn&#8217;t look like it &#8211; much like ourselves.</p><p>Designer: <a\nhref=\"https://tatianefreitas.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tatiane Freitas</a></p><p><img\nclass=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-272954\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/my_old_new_series_hero_02.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"1050\" /></p><p><img\nclass=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-272955\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/my_old_new_series_hero_03.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"1050\" /></p><p><img\nclass=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-272956\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/my_old_new_series_hero_04.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"1050\" /></p><p><img\nclass=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-272953\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/my_old_new_series_hero_01.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"1380\" /></p><p><img\nclass=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-272958\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/my_old_new_series_hero_06.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"1624\" /></p><p><img\nclass=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-272957\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/my_old_new_series_hero_05.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"1119\" /></p> ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 00:22:14 +0000","feedId":64,"bgimg":"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/my_old_new_series_hero.jpg","linkMd5":"59ab3de02d83158f5b4a16b0ca3f96ce","author":"Takashi Yamada","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/my_old_new_series_hero.jpg":null,"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/my_old_new_series_hero_02.jpg":null,"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/my_old_new_series_hero_03.jpg":null,"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/my_old_new_series_hero_04.jpg":null,"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/my_old_new_series_hero_01.jpg":null,"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/my_old_new_series_hero_06.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn27@2020_2/2020/08/12/12-37-15-046_9f885fde291f73d7.webp","https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/my_old_new_series_hero_05.jpg":null}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-12 20:22:09","updatedTime":"2020-08-12 20:22:09","title":"Watch this camper expand into a two story tiny house powered by solar panels!","link":"https://www.yankodesign.com/?p=272816","description":"<p><iframe\ntitle=\"Demonstratie level systeem Haaks Opperland\" width=\"1050\" height=\"591\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6PKRATq-Sxk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>I love tiny homes and cabin designs because they show how you can creatively optimize small spaces and still make them highly functional. The latest on my list is the Haaks &#8216;Opperland&#8217; camper because it is something I haven&#8217;t seen before &#8211; an expandable trailer! This cool camper turns into a tiny two-story house!</p><p>This durable camper is actually a hidden tiny home that brings exceptional comfort and enhanced capabilities while you choose your views. The compact structure is capable of being transported on a flatbed truck so you can bring your home and turn it into a vacation home in any place you like. Flexible lifestyle goes hand in hand with pop-up home designs like the Opperland camper that offers a sleeping loft as well as a lower section open for meal preparation, dining, relaxation, and other activities. A triangular pop-up roof transforms the wood-clad camper into your tiny home with all amenities and appliances. There is a small bathroom at the back of the camper including a shower and the staircase opposite it that leads to the upper level where a double mattress fills the space illuminated by a whimsical triangular window located in the pitch of the roof. &#8220;With the push of a button, the camper extends its support legs, so that the car can be driven under it; this remains available for day trips. The module self-levels and the automatically retracting roof unfolds your sleeping area,&#8221; explains the team.</p><p>The cabin offers 45 liters of freshwater storage along with a wastewater tank and also features a Truma water heater along with a Victron inverter to provide essential amenities for inhabitants. It also has solar panels that provide the owners with endless power and let them travel for days. The tiny structure includes a kitchen with a sink, an induction cooktop, and an 81-l fridge/freezer. this is all powered by a 360-ah lithium-ion battery onboard. Large windows flood it with ample natural light and ventilation. The idea was to enable people to feel at home in the camper and make most of the gift of freedom that comes with it. &#8220;The Haaks camper is proof to me that durability, comfort, and beauty can go well together. A bold and innovative design that you want to be seen with,&#8221; says lberic Pater, Sustainability Manager at IKEA Netherlands.</p><p>Designer: <a\nhref=\"https://haaks.camp/haaks-campers/\"

efficiency","link":"https://www.yankodesign.com/?p=272274","description":"<p><iframe\ntitle=\"PomaBrush – The Most Powerful Silicone Electric Toothbrush\" src=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pomabrush/best-electric-toothbrush-cool-toothbrush-design/widget/video.html\" height=\"590.625\" width=\"1050\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p><p>There&#8217;s a case to be made for all-silicone toothbrushes. Aside from being just as, if not more efficient than nylon bristles, they&#8217;re food-grade, easy to clean/maintain, and they&#8217;re durable. A silicone toothbrush will outlast your regular toothbrush by years, allowing less plastic waste to enter the environment. Combine that with a beautiful minimal aesthetic and you get something as sleek and beautiful as the Pomabrush, an A&#8217; Design Award-winning toothbrush with a silicone body and bristles, and an internal motor that vibrates at 15,000 vibrations per minute, allowing those bristles to gently but effectively scrub your teeth as well as massage your gums.</p><p>Pomabrush&#8217;s silicone bristles are much more gentle on your teeth than a regular toothbrush. The wide bristle design cleans between your teeth as a soft toothpick would. Silicone&#8217;s natural friction allows it to scrape food and plaque off your teeth with incredible efficiency (if you&#8217;ve ever used a silicone spatula, you know how effective those are), while making sure it doesn&#8217;t damage your tooth&#8217;s enamel or hurt your gums. Pomabrush&#8217;s design helps give you a delicate yet efficient brushing experience in a format that&#8217;s 20% smaller than most electric toothbrushes, but lasts 10 times longer when it comes to battery life.</p><p>Ditching the notion that a toothbrush should come with a multicolored handle and color-coordinated bristles, the Pomabrush&#8217;s aesthetic is as clean and as pure as it could possibly be. The brush literally embodies the sleekness of Italian design, with a single color body and matte surfacing, silicone bristles, a comfortable grip, and a single recessed button to switch it on or off. IPx7 waterproofing means you can use the brush in the shower too, and those silicone bristles are designed to be non-porous and anti-bacterial too, making your brush safe enough to use for years. The Pomabrush comes with its own slim wireless charging case that sits beautifully on your bathroom countertop or slides right into your bag or backpack while traveling, so you can carry your brush with you and use it wherever you go, be it on the road, at an airport, in a hotel, or even at a sleepover. Plus let&#8217;s not forget that it&#8217;s also lighter, smaller, infinitely classier, more delicate/efficient than most toothbrushes, and lasts years but needs charging only once every 4 months!</p><p>Designer: Taras Polishchuk</p><p><a\nhref=\"https://pomabrush.kckb.st/ae7c2a74\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Click Here to Buy Now: $83</strong></a> <del\ndatetime=\"2020-08-10T07:36:47+00:00\">$157</del> (47% 0ff).

Created out of plywood, this kayak was inspired by the designer&#8217;s trip to Venice, Italy, where she wanted to sail the canals with her sister but didn&#8217;t have space to store a two-seater kayak without paying for a bigger parking spot. &#8220;After all the calculations to achieve my desired aesthetic lines, the correct waterline and the center of gravity, the challenge was to turn the five-meter long kayak into a two-meter long, a dimension I specified that would make it ideal to store behind my car in my parking spot,&#8221; says Borràs.</p><p>The final version achieves the foldable feature by dividing the kayak into three different sections through two five-degree transversal cuts so that the prow and stern of the boat could collapse in the center to their maximum length but without interfering with each other. When collapsed, these would lay on the backrests which would also fold thanks to the wooden ball joints Borràs installed. There are four strategically positioned hatch fasteners that secure the prow and stern in place for sailing, and two ports that give access to a storage space which also allows the user to remove any excess moisture that could build over time in the two enclosed sections. With clean lines and strikingly red in color, this kayak is designed to wow with both aesthetics and its performance!</p><p>Designer: Cristina Borràs</p><p><img\nclass=\"alignnone size-full

height=\"700\" /></p><p>Gaming controllers have a lot of potential to get better, something compatible with different games, and most importantly comfortable to play with for longer sessions. We need a gadget like Morphox which is a conceptual controller designed to adapt to a variety of gaming experiences while still being ergonomic.</p><p>While most tech is now becoming modular to adapt to our flexible lifestyle (or flexible game choices), gaming controllers are still pretty set in their mold. Morphox breaks this mold with a design that creatively incorporates feedback from existing controllers like the placement of the trigger button for better access which is a starting point. &#8220;This personal exploration project of mine where I have taken the idea of playing around with the controller of the future that lets you be more into the game hypothetically having an apt. compatible console system that these controllers work,&#8221; says Gohil.</p><p>The triggers are ergonomically placed to maximize the gaming experience. To reduce the strain on the index finger, the triggers were positioned to optimize middle and fourth finger functionality instead. However, the placement and the undefined clickable area of the square (menu) button makes me question how that click will play out. The improved positioning of the buttons on the joystick comes with a softer touch and accurate locomotive tracking feature. Morphox comes with modular parts and accessories that make it a multipurpose controller &#8211; you can turn it into a firing gun, a steering wheel, or even an &#8216;explorer&#8217; dashboard by extending it to become a smart bike handle. The possibilities are endless with this design and I hope to see controllers get more creative because it isn&#8217;t &#8216;fun and a game&#8217;, it is fun and games&#8217;!</p><p>Designer: Chinmay

From prepping to cooking to storing meals, or even doing your dishes becomes simple and efficient. Since a lot of our time and energy is spent in the kitchen (it&#8217;s either cook or be taken over by cravings for me), it’s important to select the correct products to be our little helpers.

The most obvious instance is in desserts, where people tend to get picky. I, for instance, am a basic vanilla and fruit junkie, while others around me usually tend to gravitate towards decadent chocolate desserts. The Cheat Sheets allow you to simultaneously cook two separate dishes in their respective containers – as opposed to using rudimentary aluminum foil dividers, or running your oven for two separate cycles. The Cheat Sheets let you responsibly divide and utilize real estate on your baking tray, giving you the ability to be versatile, and still be in control of your cooking. In fact, each Cheat Sheet container-set comes with its own baking tray, as well as a handy guide that gives you cooking times and temperatures for all your food, so you never over or undercook any ingredient again.</p><p><img\nclass=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-272983\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/kitchen-appliances-that-will-perfectly-assist-your-chef-dreams-part-5/02-kitchen-appliances_quarantine-cooking_Ordine_portable-stove2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p><p><img\nclass=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-272982\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/kitchen-appliances-that-will-perfectly-assist-your-chef-dreams-part-5/02-kitchen-appliances_quarantine-cooking_Ordine_portable-stove.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"1365\" /></p><p><a\nhref=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2019/01/18/a-hob-set-free/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ordine</a> by Adriano Design is an innovative cooking solution designed for the modern user.

When you need a knife’s blade to do the work for you, a heavier blade allows for better cutting, so rather than having different knives for different applications, the <a\nhref=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/08/03/these-kitchen-knives-let-you-adjust-their-center-of-gravity-for-a-uniquely-custom-chopping-experience/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ecriture Perfect Knives</a> come with a switch on the handle that lets you shift the knife’s center of gravity. A sliding weight inside the hollow handle allows you to decide the knife’s balancing point, giving you better control based on your technique. The Ecriture Perfect Knives come in a set of 6 exquisitely designed blades for handling a variety of tasks.

With a self-sufficient system that takes care of all your plant’s needs, a hydroponics water tank that lets you grow plants without soil, and a pod-based system that allows you to plug in and grow as many as 39 different herbs at the same time, the Herb Garden is the equivalent of having an entire backyard orchard, but in a form factor that’s just 30 inches long and nearly 8 inches wide. The Herb Garden takes the guess-work out of gardening too, with sensors that help it understand what your plant needs, and WiFi connectivity that lets you know when to replenish its internal water reservoir. The Herb Garden’s internal app even lets you know when your plants are ripe for picking, and supplies you with a list of recipes based on what you’ve got growing in your ‘backyard’, so to speak.</p><p><img\nclass=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-272984\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/kitchen-appliances-that-will-perfectly-assist-your-chef-dreams-part-5/03-kitchen-appliances_quarantine-cooking_Steamie-steam-cooker.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p><p><img\nclass=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-272985\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/kitchen-appliances-that-will-perfectly-assist-your-chef-dreams-part-5/03-kitchen-appliances_quarantine-cooking_Steamie-steam-cooker2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p><p><a\nhref=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/03/11/this-steam-cooker-combines-smart-sophisticated-technology-with-healthy-cooking\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">STEAMIE</a>, designed and developed by award-winning Mindsailors Design Studio, reintroduces steam into mainstream cooking. Steam has a way of cooking food without diluting its flavor, giving you healthy food that’s rich in nutrients as well as packed with great taste. The tabletop appliance uses this power to help prepare food that’s both nutritious and tasty. The layered appliance houses a water bath below, and food (be it veggies or meat) placed in perforated trays above. STEAMIE then uses a unique turbo convection method to rapidly steam-cook the food. These pressurized jets of steam measure 125°C and instantly close external pores of meat, vegetables or seafood, locking the flavor within, while the heat from the steam helps cook the food. The fact that the food isn’t immersed in water (like with boiling) helps keep the food from tasting watery or ‘wet’.</p><p><img\nclass=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-272988\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/kitchen-appliances-that-will-perfectly-assist-your-chef-dreams-part-5/05-kitchen-appliances_quarantine-cooking_Mitsubishi-Toaster.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p><p><img\nclass=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-272989\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/kitchen-appliances-that-will-perfectly-assist-your-chef-dreams-part-5/05-kitchen-appliances_quarantine-cooking_Mitsubishi-Toaster2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p><p>Mimicking a waffle maker, the<a\nhref=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2019/11/07/mitsubishis-bread-oven-perfects-a-slice-of-toast-in-true-japanese-style/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> Mitsubishi Bread Oven</a> looks like it’s come straight out of the ’80s with its retro-esque veneer brown look.

furniture!","link":"https://www.yankodesign.com/?p=273026","description":"<p><img\nclass=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273034\"

break the aesthetics of a space. It is about good design and not expensive pieces (although, they do sometimes go hand in hand). While we always pay more attention to the bigger pieces that arguably catch the eye like tables and couches, it is the supporting elements like good lighting that can elevate your interior game &#8211; almost literally with this Pulley lamp!</p><p>As the name suggests, the conceptual pulley-based lamp adds a dynamic and playful element to the otherwise standard floor lamp which never makes you go &#8220;Wow, where&#8217;d you get that?&#8221;. This lamp reveals geometric movements as a feature of the design. &#8220;The focus was on purely revealing the structure of the lamp and the pulley that supports the lamp,&#8221; says Kim. Using the sliding switch will slightly tilt the lamp upwards to turn it off and the reverse motion will restore it back to its resting position which is perpendicular to the pole. It is more of a focus light that can help with reading or working as opposed to the traditional floor lamp that provides an ambient light by usually dimly flooding the ceiling which isn&#8217;t helpful for the purpose mentioned earlier.</p><p>The lamp itself is minimal and sleek, it could fit unobtrusively with any modern interior theme. It almost looks as if Apple launched a lamp because of its simple aesthetics, clean linear design, and the signature white tones. If the concept includes a sound that goes with the tactile feature of turning the light on/off it would be great &#8211; who doesn&#8217;t love a satisfying, animated click sound! It certainly makes for a lovely upgrade from those black-pole-inverted-lampshade floor lamps that we all had in our 20s!</p><p>Designer: Seongju Kim</p><p><img\nclass=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273033\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/273026/07-pulley_lamp_yankodesign.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p><p><img\nclass=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273030\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/273026/04-pulley_lamp_yankodesign.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p><p><img\nclass=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273031\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/273026/05-pulley_lamp_yankodesign.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p><p><img\nclass=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273029\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/273026/03-pulley_lamp_yankodesign.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p><p><img\nclass=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273032\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/273026/06-pulley_lamp_yankodesign.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p><p><img\nclass=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273028\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/273026/02-pulley_lamp_yankodesign.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p><p><img\nclass=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-273027\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/273026/01-pulley_lamp_yankodesign.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p> ","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Wed, 12 Aug 2020 02:45:35 +0000","feedId":64,"bgimg":"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/273026/08-pulley_lamp_yankodesign.jpg","linkMd5":"db84334f3434596527091bcb7f1876a9","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn73@2020_1/2020/08/12/12-22-37-334_272e5b5abb3112e9.webp","author":"Ruchi Thukral","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/273026/08-pulley_lamp_yankodesign.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn73@2020_1/2020/08/12/12-22-37-334_272e5b5abb3112e9.webp","https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/273026/07-pulley_lamp_yankodesign.jpg":null,"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/273026/04-pulley_lamp_yankodesign.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx17/cdn6@2020_1/2020/08/12/12-32-44-303_ad87938aed09e321.webp","https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/273026/05-pulley_lamp_yankodesign.jpg":null,"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/273026/03-pulley_lamp_yankodesign.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn61@2020_5/2020/08/12/12-27-42-810_13249f6bda4886d4.webp","https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/273026/06-pulley_lamp_yankodesign.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn42@2020_3/2020/08/12/12-28-43-924_ff2e0840b08d4dd3.webp","https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/273026/02-pulley_lamp_yankodesign.jpg":null,"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/273026/01-pulley_lamp_yankodesign.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn70@2020_1/2020/08/12/12-26-41-664_62bf245c6bff8b0b.webp"}},{"createdTime":"2020-08-12 20:22:09","updatedTime":"2020-08-12 20:22:09","title":"A Japanese-inspired wireless charger designed to help you break your smartphone addiction!","link":"https://www.yankodesign.com/?p=272863","description":"<p><img\nclass=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-272879\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2020/08/this-zen-wireless-charger-uses-an-indicator-to-stop-the-need-to-compulsively-check-your-phone/11-Hyuu-Wireless-Charger_Zen_Japanese-tech_concious-design.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1050\" height=\"700\" /></p><p>Let&#8217;s be honest, how many of us feel FOMO if we have to separate from our phones for even the smallest amount of time? Smartphone addiction has been a problem even before COVID ( Report show that 60% of U.S. college students consider themselves to have a cell phone addiction) &#8211; the quarantine, separation, and fear of the unknown has raised this addiction to a whole level! The solution to this? Practicing mindfulness. The Japanese have been practicing meditation and mindfulness through centuries, one of the prime examples of this is the minimalistic beauty of the zen garden. Designer Juwon Kim decided to merge tech and tradition, creating a design that aims to improve our lifestyle by helping us break free from our bad habits and to lead a healthier lifestyle.</p><p>Meet HYUU &#8211; a wireless smartphone charger elevated to help you break the obsessive need to keep checking on our phones while charging so we can return back to our mindless scrolling! Almost meditative in design, HYUU takes inspiration from the Japanese zen gardens. The gadget&#8217;s surface replicates the patterns we find in the sand with an incense-stick like indicator that attaches to its base. The process of placing your gadget on the charger means taking a break from constant exposure to content. This process of leaving your device to charge is also a way to get some quality me-time, so at the end of the day, you are not left wondering &#8211; where did the day just go?! Now, the initial moment of keeping our gadgets and walking away feels almost scary according to the designer &#8220;Because FOMO is an only human and universal emotion, it cannot be completely eliminated, but I tried to put the meaning of time, situation, and space that can be controlled. Therefore, what about providing time to look back on yourself without blaming yourself for feeling FOMO?&#8221; The simple indicator comes into play here &#8211; as your device charges, the led indicator on the incense stick also lowers, signaling an end to the relaxation time while keeping in check our compulsive need to continuously keep checking our phones. The charging level of the phone can now be known without actually looking at the screen &#8211; giving you quality, uninterrupted me time!</p><p>&#8220;Karesansui(かれさんすい), which is based on &#8216;discovering something out of nothing&#8217;, is a space where you can look at the garden and answer your own question.&#8221; says the designer. The same way, this wireless charger is a small yet definitive step to help you disconnect and focus on your self. Afterall as our favorite Grand Jedi Master Yoda puts it &#8216;In a dark place we find ourselves, and a little more knowledge lights our way.&#8217; Let&#8217;s come out of this quarantine with an improved understanding of ourselves!</p><p>Designer: Juwon Kim</p><p><img\nsrc=\"https://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/project_modules/max_1200/c23d65101640793.5f232c18c4b2b.gif\" alt=\"Incense light\"

want","link":"https://www.yankodesign.com/?p=272449","description":"<p><iframe\ntitle=\"Beluga tent 6-in-1 from Qaou\" src=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/beluga/beluga-tent-6-in-1-from-qaou/widget/video.html\" height=\"590.625\" width=\"1050\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p><p>Camping is all about location and weather, and those two factors can heavily influence how you camp. Sometimes it&#8217;s sunny out, sometimes it suddenly begins pouring. Your campsite could be grassy, muddy, gravel-filled, or even have a rivulet or stream flowing underneath. A myriad of factors determine your camping experience, and it only makes sense that your camping equipment/shelter adjusts itself based on those factors. Meet the Beluga tent, a shapeshifting, modular tent that can be laid out in not 2 or 3, but rather 6 different formats. You could use the Beluga (or parts of it) as a tent, a tent with an awning, a tarp, a roof-like shelter, a cocoon-hammock, or two separate open hammocks. Depending on the weather, the location, the number of people you&#8217;re camping with, and whether you&#8217;ve got a trailer/RV with you, the Beluga adjusts, modifies to give you the experience you need.</p><p>Designed to be portable, adjustable, and modular too, the Beluga easily transforms based on your needs. The tent accommodates two people, although its modular nature allows you to attach multiple tents to each other to create a large camping community. The tent comes with an inner enclosure, held in place using aluminum rods, and covered with an outer cover that helps properly shield you from elements like the rain or even the sun. To help extend the tent&#8217;s footprint, the Beluga even comes with an awning that attaches to the entrance, giving you a nice shaded &#8216;patio&#8217; of sorts right outside your tent. The magic, however, lies in the fact that all these components, the enclosure, clad, and awning, can be used in a variety of ways. The awning and outer clad easily double up as two individual hammocks when you want, or a hammock with its own cover when you&#8217;re looking for some shade. You could even set them up as a roofed shelter away from your tent, or even use them as awnings outside your RV or caravan. No matter your camping setup, the Beluga adjusts to give you just the shelter you need&#8230; and even if you&#8217;re faced with inclement weather, or a damp/muddy campsite, the tent itself comes with an elevated entrance, so water or mud never seeps into your enclosure.</p><p>The Beluga tent is named after the beluga, a large white whale found in parts of the Arctic, owing to the tent&#8217;s white color. Some would say it&#8217;s sort of impractical to have a tent that&#8217;s white in color because of all the mud, dirt, grass, etc., but the Beluga tent wears its color as a badge of honor because it comes made entirely from recycled plastic water bottles&#8230; and to prevent the use of environment-harming chemical dyes, the tent just opts to stay white instead. Each Beluga tent is made using an average of 125 plastic bottles, helping cut environmental waste, and the tent even comes with a 2-year warranty, with every part being serviceable/repairable to increase its product life. Designed to be waterproof, the tent does manage to repel dirt and mud with ease, and that all-white canopy actually helps keep the inside of the tent cooler during the day too. In fact, the aluminum poles used in the Beluga are created with a lower carbon footprint too, so your entire camping experience is great for you, as well as for mother nature!</p><p>Designer: Qaou Outdoor</p><p><a\nhref=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/beluga/beluga-tent-6-in-1-from-qaou?ref=creator_nav\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Click Here to Buy Now: $234</strong></a> <del\ndatetime=\"2020-08-11T10:41:30+00:00\">$371</del> ($137 off).
