With COVID-19 introducing new points of stress, communities are seeing a rise in mental health issues and needs. New <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/pulse/mental-health.htm\">Census Bureau</a> data released last week shows that a third of Americans are now showing signs of clinical anxiety or depression.</p>\n  <p>The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) is the nation’s largest grassroots mental health organization and we’re partnering with Google to provide access to mental health resources. Starting today when people in the U.S. search on Google for information about anxiety, we’ll provide access to a <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/410326\">clinically-validated questionnaire</a> called the <a href=\"https://www.integration.samhsa.gov/clinical-practice/GAD708.19.08Cartwright.pdf\">GAD-7</a> (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7).

The blend of practical experience with scientific and social research has yielded simple and actionable safety messages that people can trust in the event of an emergency like an earthquake, wildfire, hurricane or flash flood. Sometimes these are simple actions like listening for more information from local authorities or following evacuation orders. Other messages are practical things like moving valuables to safety if you’re near an area that may flood or preparing an emergency kit to keep nearby.</p>\n  <b><br /></b>\n  <p><b>How do you ensure these safety tips are relevant for people across multiple countries?</b></p>\n  <p>We work with a network of 192 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies around the globe—each one operates in its own language, and understands unique local challenges and needs. We gave each partner a set of standard, evidence-based messages for 20 different hazards across 6 different time scales (mitigation, seasonal forecast, watch, warning, immediate, and recovery). This localization process included consultation with their government partners to finalize the messages that we’re sharing with the public.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p><b>How, if at all, have these recommendations changed with the impact of COVID-19?</b></p>\n  <p>As one example, safety tips now advise having additional items in emergency kits—such as hand sanitizer and cloth face coverings. It will be important to have these on hand so that people can continue being safe, and keeping their neighbors safe, in case they need to evacuate their homes and stay in close proximity to others.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p><b>What are some of the top challenges in communicating disaster safety information to the public?</b></p>\n  <p>Trust and consistency are two of the biggest challenges. Every person accesses information through&nbsp; many different channels. There’s a high volume of content to navigate, which can leave people confused or even unaware of what to do when there is an emergency. With the Red Cross safety messages that can be delivered through Google SOS alerts and by an API to other channels, we’re offering consistent, evidence-based safety messages prepared by a trusted source.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p><b>Now that we’re in hurricane and wildfire seasons, what’s the number one piece of advice you can give to readers to stay safe?&nbsp;</b></p>\n  <p>The most important thing is to have a plan and make sure you and your loved ones know what to do when there’s an emergency. This includes identifying a trusted source of information, knowing and practicing the steps you will take in an emergency and identifying the items and must-haves you may need for your recovery.</p>\n </div>\n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Thu, 20 Aug 2020 13:00:00 +0000","feedId":10205,"bgimg":"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Kansas_flood_collapsed_-_in_device4X.max-1000x1000.png","linkMd5":"0d50f8f1f518f847da633bd244437d19","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn26@2020_3/2020/08/25/00-47-00-005_7cbc32f027ec088a.webp","destWidth":471,"destHeight":1000,"sourceBytes":203690,"destBytes":49570,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Kansas_flood_collapsed_-_in_device4X.max-1000x1000.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn26@2020_3/2020/08/25/00-47-00-005_7cbc32f027ec088a.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/InsideSearch/~4/LzaPkqZxukA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn58@2020_4/2020/08/25/00-49-01-435_e27711545331972d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598316419610},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:46:59","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:46:59","title":"Mapping wildfires with the power of satellite data","link":"https://blog.google/products/search/mapping-wildfires-with-satellite-data/","description":"<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>Ten years ago, I was inside the Google office in Haifa, Israel when the devastating Carmel Mountain fire started blazing not far from us.

Google has built digital tools to help brands do this, including the <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/maps/see-your-messages-local-businesses-google-maps/\">ability to message</a> customers through Google Maps and Search, via Google My Business. Messaging has become such a valuable way to connect with customers that twice as many businesses are messaging via Google now, compared to last year.</p>\n  <p>Today we’re expanding <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/business-communications/business-messages\">Business Messages</a> in Maps and Search to support all kinds of businesses, and giving them the ability to integrate Business Messages directly with their customer service platforms. Business Messages provides brands a comprehensive messaging solution across Android devices, and through Maps on iOS. To improve connections with customers, we’ve recently introduced new smart replies, visual product carousels, and unique welcome messages. There’s also a smooth transition from automated replies to a customer service agent, so that it's not disruptive when the customer messages a business.</p>\n  <p>Several organizations, including Woolworths, Walmart and MyGov were among the first to try the updated Business Messages experience to make customer care more effective and efficient, particularly during COVID-19. Woolworths, Australia's largest supermarket, allows customers to search for products and see availability and aisle information at their local store, plus get details about hours and COVID-19 related updates to make shopping easier. In just a few messages, Walmart lets customers quickly find up-to-date information about store hours, pick-up and delivery options, precautions and more. And MyGov, with partner Amplify.ai, is providing help and answering live questions from Indian citizens about hours, COVID-19 helplines, and ways to volunteer and donate, for more than 11,000 food and night shelters across India. <br /></p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_carousel\">\n <div class=\"h-c-page article-module\">\n  <div class=\"article-module glue-pagination h-c-carousel

Even the smallest of details, such as irregularities of skin color and patterns, are important.”&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>Unlike some of Google’s AR animals, like a dog or tiger, dinosaurs pose a new technical challenge: their massive size. The new auto-scale feature on Android can now automatically calculate the distance between your phone and a surface in your space and resize the dinosaur so it fits on your phone screen. If you tap “View actual size,” AR tracking technology automatically repositions the dinosaur in your space to make room for it.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \">\n    <img alt=\"view actual size.gif\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/view_actual_size.gif\" />\n    <figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \">\n     <div class=\"rich-text\">\n      <p>New auto-scale feature on Android</p>\n     </div>\n    </figcaption>\n   </figure>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <h3>How to access and share</h3>\n  <p></p>\n  <p>On <a href=\"https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/9817187?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&amp;oco=1\">Android</a>, search for “dinosaur” or one of the 10 dinosaurs on the <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox\">Google app</a> or any Android browser and tap “View in 3D.” You can see 3D content on devices running with Android 7 and above and you can see AR content on <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/ar/discover/supported-devices\">ARCore-enabled devices</a>.

Even though I’ve been vegetarian for 20 years, I still enjoy the art and technique of barbecuing with fire.</p>\n  <p></p>\n  <p></p>\n  <ol>\n   <li><p></p><p>Dry-brine the meat (0.1 oz of salt per pound of beef) at least 24 hours before smoking.</p><p></p></li>\n   <li><p></p><p>Prepare the smoker, then apply <a href=\"https://amazingribs.com/tested-recipes/spice-rubs-and-pastes/big-bad-beef-rub-recipe\">big bad beef rub</a> to the meat just before adding to the smoker.</p><p></p></li>\n   <li><p></p><p>Aim to keep smoker between 225 and 250 degrees Fahrenheit (275 degrees if you're using logs instead of charcoal) and add wood chunks to fire every 30 minutes for the first two hours.</p><p></p></li>\n   <li><p></p><p>When the meat hits \"<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=bbq+the+stall\">the stall</a>,\" wrap tightly with heavy duty aluminum foil and return to the fire (also known as, the Texas Crutch).</p><p></p></li>\n   <li><p></p><p>Smoke until it reaches an internal temperature of 190 degrees Fahrenheit (about 12 hours).</p><p></p></li>\n   <li><p></p><p>Remove from heat and let sit, still wrapped, until temperature drops below 140 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><p></p></li>\n  </ol>\n  <p></p>\n  <p></p>\n  <p></p>\n  <h3>Steak and Tenderstem Broccoli</h3>\n  <p><b>Submitted by Ken Graham, Financial Analyst</b></p>\n  <p>When I first started grilling, I wanted to perfect this popular method of getting the meat as close to the heat as possible.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p></p>\n  <p></p>\n  <ol>\n   <li><p></p><p></p><p>Buy the best quality meat you can afford, about ¾-inch thick is best for this method. Good steak should stand up on it's own, no real sauce or spice needed. I like rib eye, but to each their own.</p><p></p><p></p></li>\n   <li><p></p><p></p><p>Take the steaks out of the fridge about an hour before you want to cook them, season with salt and then put them back in the fridge.</p><p></p><p></p></li>\n   <li><p></p><p></p><p>Pat the steaks dry when you take them out of the fridge; water will inhibit the browning of the meat.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p></li>\n   <li><p></p><p></p><p>You want your grill screaming hot, so whack it up to max on all burners. Before you turn it up, take the grates off, and then place one of the grates directly on the bars (if it's gas) or coals (if it's charcoal).&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p></li>\n   <li><p></p><p></p><p>Grill your steaks on the grate flipping every minute. Three or four minutes should get you to medium rare, depending on the heat of the grill, but using a meat thermometer is best; you want to get it around 130-135 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><p></p><p></p></li>\n   <li><p></p><p></p><p>Serve with whatever sides you like, but I like Tenderstem broccoli, which I grill on the grates I used for the steak. They pick up some of the steak flavor and cook quickly but stay crunchy.</p><p></p><p></p></li>\n  </ol>\n  <p></p>\n  <p></p>\n  <h3>Wine Can Chicken</h3>\n  <p><b>Submitted by Helynn Nelson, People Consultant and Nekosi Nelson, Staffing Lead</b></p>\n  <p>This recipe is one of the first experimental dishes my husband, Kosi, cooked 15 years ago when we were newlyweds and it gets better and better with time. He’s allowed me to co-opt his recipe a bit by introducing one of my favorite ingredients...wine! I run the Google wine club in our Austin office, so I also want to suggest a wine pairing: I’d enjoy this meal with a Viognier or an oaked Fume Blanc.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p></p>\n  <p></p>\n  <ol>\n   <li><p></p><p></p><p>Gather your ingredients: 2 tablespoons Tony Chachere seasoning; 2 tablespoons Kosher salt; 2 tablespoons onion powder; 2 teaspoons dried thyme; 2 teaspoons dried oregano; 2 teaspoons black pepper; 2 teaspoons garlic powder. For the chicken (I usually choose one around four pounds), you’ll need: olive oil; a 12 oz can of dry white wine.</p><p></p><p></p></li>\n   <li><p></p><p></p><p>Mix all the dry ingredients together.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p></li>\n   <li><p></p><p></p><p>Marinate your chicken in the seasonings 24 hours before grilling. Remember to season the cavity (and wrap in plastic wrap).</p><p></p><p></p></li>\n   <li><p></p><p></p><p>Preheat your grill to medium-high heat.</p><p></p><p></p></li>\n   <li><p></p><p></p><p>Rub the chicken and its cavity down with the olive oil. Pour out 1/4 of the wine and sit the chicken on top of the wine can. Place the chicken in the center of the hot grill and cover. Cook the chicken for an hour to an hour and a half, or until an instant-read thermometer registers 165 degrees Fahrenheit. Once cooked, cover loosely with foil and let rest for 10 minutes before carving.</p><p></p><p></p></li>\n  </ol>\n  <p></p>\n  <p></p>\n  <h3>Ancho Chile Skirt Steak Tacos</h3>\n  <p><b>Submitted by Kayla Geier, Senior Communications Associate</b></p>\n  <p>My family's favorite activity is getting together and cooking–whether it's tamales for Christmas or tacos for the Fourth of July. Since my grandfather's passing I've taken the role of grilling, using some of his \"secrets\", along with tricks from a few cookbooks. I find that grilling helps me keep his memory alive.</p>\n  <p></p>\n  <p></p>\n  <ol>\n   <li>Place steak (recipe calls for 2 lbs) in a large zip-top plastic freezer bag or covered bowl.&nbsp;</li>\n   <li>Stir together the juice of 2 limes, 1 tablespoon cumin, 1 tablespoon ancho chile powder, 1/4 tablespoon onion salt and 2 tablespoons garlic powder.&nbsp;</li>\n   <li>Whisk the above in 1/4 cup olive oil, and pour over flank steak.&nbsp;</li>\n   <li>Seal bag, and turn to coat. Chill 1-12 hours.</li>\n   <li>Grill to your liking–medium is always preferred.&nbsp;</li>\n   <li>Top with slices of cucumber (it'll cool down the heat), your favorite salsa (mine is Tapatio) and fresh guac with the spice of Serrano chiles on a flour tortilla.</li>\n  </ol>\n  <p></p>\n  <p></p>\n  <p></p>\n  <h3>Uncle Buck’s Ribs</h3>\n  <p><b>Submitted by Susannah Callahan, Product Marketing Manager at Google Nest</b></p>\n  <p>Growing up in St. Louis, pork baby back ribs were always a favorite, especially around the Fourth of July. My Uncle Buck—not that one, but just as funny—has been perfecting his rib recipe for friends and family since the 1970s. The layers of marinade and sauces make these ribs extra juicy and tender, but also easy enough to tackle for grilling novices.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p></p>\n  <ol>\n   <li><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Around 24-48 hours before grill time, place 4-5 lbs (or two full racks) of pork baby back ribs (membrane removed), in the following marinade:&nbsp;1 cup chicken broth;&nbsp;1 cup soy sauce;&nbsp;1 cup brown sugar;&nbsp;5 tablespoons cider vinegar;&nbsp;5 tablespoons olive oil;&nbsp;½ teaspoon garlic powder;&nbsp;½ teaspoon dehydrated onion;&nbsp;1 tablespoon of paprika;&nbsp;1 tablespoon of cornstarch;&nbsp;3 tablespoons liquid smoke;&nbsp;salt and pepper .</p><p></p><p></p><p></p></li>\n   <li><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>30 minutes before grilling, glaze the ribs with Korean BBQ sauce (make sure it has apple and pear puree). This sweet sauce helps to caramelize the ribs when they hit the grill.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p></li>\n   <li><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Heat the grill to 550-600 degrees Fahrenheit and baste each side of the ribs on the grill twice, for two to three minutes.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><p></p></li>\n   <li><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Then, turn the grill down to 300 degrees and repeat the basting process and timing above two more times with the leftover marinade.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><p></p></li>\n   <li><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Lastly, turn the temperature down to 200 degrees and baste each side with your choice of thick honey BBQ sauce three times for three minutes.

We put a lot of time and effort into <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/mission/users/\">improving our search systems</a> to ensure that’s the case.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>Working on <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/search/search-language-understanding-bert/\">improvements to our language understanding</a> and other search systems is only part of why Google remains so helpful. Equally important is our ability to fight <a href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/35769\">spam</a>. Without our spam-fighting systems and teams, the quality of Search would be reduced--it would be a lot harder to find helpful information you can trust.&nbsp;</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>With low quality pages spamming their way into the top results, the greater the chances that people could get tricked by phony sites trying to steal personal information or infect their computers with malware. If you’ve ever gone into your spam folder in Gmail, that’s akin to what Search results would be like without our spam detection capabilities.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>Every year we publish a Webspam Report that details the efforts behind reducing spam in your search results and supporting the community of site creators whose websites we help you discover. To coincide with <a href=\"https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2020/06/how-we-fought-search-spam-on-google.html\">this year’s report</a>, we wanted to give some additional context for why spam-fighting is so important, and how we go about it.</p>\n  <br />\n  <h3>Defining “spam”</h3>\n  <p>We’ve always designed our systems to prioritize the most relevant and reliable webpages at the top. We <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/algorithms/\">publicly describe the factors</a> that go into our ranking systems so that web creators can understand the types of content that our systems will recognize as high quality.</p>\n  <p>We define “spam” as using techniques that attempt to mimic these signals without actually delivering on the promise of a high quality content, or other tactics that might prove harmful to searchers.</p>\n  <p>Our <a href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/35769?hl=en\">Webmaster Guidelines</a> detail the types of spammy behavior that is discouraged and can lead to a lower ranking: everything from <a href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/2721312\">scraping pages</a> and <a href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66358\">keyword stuffing</a> to participating in <a href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66356\">link schemes</a> and implementing <a href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/2721217\">sneaky redirects</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>Fighting spam is never-ending battle, a constant game of cat-and-mouse against existing and new spammy behaviors. This threat of spam is why we’ve continued to be very careful about how much detail we reveal about how our systems work. However, we do share a lot, including <a href=\"https://www.google.com/webmasters/learn/\">resources</a> that provide transparency about the positive behaviors creators should follow to create great information and gain visibility and traffic from Search.</p>\n  <br />\n  <h3>Spotting the spammers</h3>\n  <p>The first step of fighting spam is detection. So how do we spot it? We employ a combination of manual reviews by our analysts and a variety of automated detection systems.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>We can’t share the specific techniques we use for spam fighting because that would weaken our protections and ultimately make Search much less useful. But we can share about spammy behavior that can be detected systematically.&nbsp;</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>After all, a low quality page might include the right words and phrases that match what you searched for, so our language systems wouldn’t be able to detect unhelpful pages from content alone. The telltale signs of spam are in the behavioral tactics used and how they try to manipulate our ranking systems against our <a href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/35769?hl=en\">Webmaster Guidelines</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>Our spam-fighting systems detect these behaviors so we can tackle this problem at scale. In fact, the scale is huge. Last year, we observed that more than 25 billion of the pages we find each day are spammy. (If each of those pages were a page in a book, that would be more than 20 million copies of “War &amp; Peace” each day!) This leads to an important question: once we find all this spam, what happens next?</p>\n  <br />\n  <h3>Stopping the spammers</h3>\n  <p>When it comes to how we handle spam, it depends on the type of spam and how severe the violation is. For most of the 25 billion spammy pages detected each day, we’re able to automatically recognize their spammy behavior and ensure they don’t rank well in our results. But that’s not the case for everything.&nbsp;</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>As with anything, our automated systems aren’t perfect. That’s why we also supplement them with human review, a team that does its own spam sleuthing to understand if content or sites are violating our guidelines. Often, this human review process leads to better automated systems. We look to understand how that spam got past our systems and then work to improve our detection, so that we catch the particular case and automatically detect many other similar cases overall.</p>\n  <p><br />In other cases, we may issue what’s called a <a href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9044175\">manual action</a>, when one of our human spam reviewers finds that content that isn’t complying with our Webmaster Guidelines. This can lead to a demotion or a removal of spam content from our search results, especially if it’s deemed to be particularly harmful, like a hacked site that has pages distributing malware to visitors.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>When a manual action takes place, we send a notice to the site owner via <a href=\"https://search.google.com/search-console/about\">Search Console</a>, which webmasters can see in their Manual Actions Report. We send millions of these notices each year, and it gives site owners the opportunity to fix the issue and submit for reconsideration. After all, not all “spam” is purposeful, so if a site owner has inadvertently tried tactics that run afoul of our guidelines, or if their site has been compromised by hackers, we want to ensure they can make things right and have their useful information again available to people in Search. This brings us back to why we invest so much effort in fighting spam: so that Search can bring you good, helpful and safe content from sites across the web.</p>\n  <br />\n  <h3>Discovering great information</h3>\n  <p>It’s unfortunate that there’s so much spam, and so much effort that has to be spent fighting it. But that shouldn’t overshadow the fact there are millions upon millions of businesses, publishers and websites with great content for people to discover. We want them to succeed, and we provide tools, support and guidance to help.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>We publish our <a href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7451184\">own Search Engine Optimization Starter Guide</a> to provide tips on how to succeed with appropriate techniques in Search. Our Search Relations team <a href=\"https://www.google.com/webmasters/connect/\">conducts</a> virtual office hours, monitors our <a href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/community\">Webmaster Community forums</a>, and (when possible!) hosts and participates in events around the world to help site creators improve their presence in Search. We provide a variety of <a href=\"https://www.google.com/webmasters/\">support resources</a>, as well as the <a href=\"https://search.google.com/search-console\">Search Console</a> toolset to help creators with search.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>We’d also encourage anyone to visit our <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/\">How Google Search Works site</a>, which shares more generally about how our systems work to generate great search results for everyone.</p>\n  <p><br /></p>\n </div>\n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 09 Jun 2020 18:00:00 +0000","feedId":10205,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"b881cb9b863349d08f193687bdc2db89","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/InsideSearch/~4/CkSXGZSXeF8":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx32/cdn18@2020_4/2020/08/25/00-49-01-347_60e0b5db0a610a73.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598316419614},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:46:59","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:46:59","title":"Update your Business Profile on Google Maps and Search","link":"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/small-business/business-profile-maps-and-search/","description":"<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>When it comes to your business’s online presence, putting your best foot forward matters.

This year, the team at Spotify predicts that “This is America” by Childish Gambino and “Alright” by Kendrick Lamar are likely to be mainstays during summer 2020.&nbsp; The resurgence of these older tracks is likely due to cultural conversations focused on supporting the Black community. In fact, global Google Trends searches for the meaning of “This is America,” by Childish Gambino spiked more than 700 percent over the past month.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>In no particular order, <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX4zbZrYRGVam?si=Y_Bvam8CTnOBdxzfSczgqg\">here’s</a> Spotify’s playlist of predictions for summer 2020, which you can stream on your Nest device by saying, “Hey Google, play Songs of Summer.” The playlist includes current hits like “<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/7ytR5pFWmSjzHJIeQkgog4?si=B0MUclWuRfCuiGSiisxdNA\">ROCKSTAR</a>” by DaBaby, featuring Roddy Ricch and “<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/6UelLqGlWMcVH1E5c4H7lY\">Watermelon Sugar</a>” by Harry Styles.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /></p>\n  <h3>Your Summer Rewind playlist from Spotify</h3>\n  <p>This year, it feels especially important to relive the glory of summers past.

In less than half a second, our systems sort through hundreds of billions of web pages to try and find the most relevant and helpful results available.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>Because the web and people’s information needs keep changing, we make a lot of improvements to our search algorithms to keep up. Thousands per year, in fact. And we’re always working on new ways to make our results more helpful whether it’s a new feature, or bringing new <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/search/search-language-understanding-bert/\">language understanding capabilities</a> to Search.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>The improvements we make go through an evaluation process designed so that people around the world continue to find Google useful for whatever they’re looking for. Here are some ways that insights and feedback from people around the world help make Search better.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p><b>Our research team at work</b></p>\n  <p>Changes that we make to Search are aimed at making it easier for people to find useful information, but depending on their interests, what language they speak, and where they are in the world, different people have different information needs. It’s our mission to make information universally accessible and useful, and we are committed to serving all of our users in pursuit of that goal.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>This is why we have a research team whose job it is to talk to people all around the world to understand how Search can be more useful. We invite people to give us feedback on different iterations of our projects and we do field research to understand how people in different communities access information online.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>For example, we’ve learned over the years about the unique needs and technical limitations that people in emerging markets have when accessing information online. So we developed Google Go, a lightweight search app that works well with less powerful phones and less reliable connections. On Google Go, we’ve also introduced uniquely helpful features, including <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/technology/next-billion-users/make-google-read-it/\">one that lets you listen to web pages out loud</a>, which is particularly useful for people learning a new language or who may be less comfortable with reading long text. Features like these would not be possible without insights from the people who will ultimately use them.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p><b>Search quality raters</b></p>\n  <p>A key part of our evaluation process is getting feedback from everyday users about whether our ranking systems and proposed improvements are working well. But what do we mean by “working well”? We publish publicly available <a href=\"https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/guidelines.raterhub.com/en//searchqualityevaluatorguidelines.pdf\">rater guidelines</a> that describe in great detail how our systems intend to surface great content. These guidelines are more than 160 pages long, but if we have to boil it down to just a phrase, we like to say that Search is designed to return relevant results from the most reliable sources available.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>Our <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/algorithms/\">systems use signals</a> from the web itself—like where words in your search appear on web pages, or how pages link to one another on the web—to understand what information is related to your query and whether it’s information that people tend to trust. But notions of relevance and trustworthiness are ultimately human judgments, so to measure whether our systems are in fact understanding these correctly, we need to gather insights from people.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>To do this, we have a group of more than 10,000 people all over the world we call “search quality raters.” Raters help us measure how people are likely to experience our results. They provide ratings based on our <a href=\"https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/guidelines.raterhub.com/en//searchqualityevaluatorguidelines.pdf\">guidelines</a> and represent real users and their likely information needs, using their best judgment to represent their locale. These people study and are tested on our rater guidelines before they can begin to provide ratings.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p><b>How rating works</b></p>\n  <p>Here’s how a rater task works: we generate a sample of queries (say, a few hundred). A group of raters will be assigned this set of queries, and they’re shown two versions of results pages for those searches. One set of results is from the current version of Google, and the other set is from an improvement we’re considering.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>Raters review every page listed in the results set and evaluate that page against the query, based on our rater guidelines. They evaluate whether those pages meet the information needs based on their understanding of what that query was seeking, and they consider things like how authoritative and trustworthy that source seems to be on the topic in the query. To evaluate things like expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness—sometimes referred to as “E-A-T”—raters are asked to do reputational research on the sources.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>Here’s what that looks like in practice: imagine the sample query is “carrot cake recipe.” The results set may include articles from recipe sites, food magazines, food brands and perhaps blogs. To determine if a webpage meets their information needs, a rater might consider how easy the cooking instructions are to understand, how helpful the recipe is in terms of visual instructions and imagery, and whether there are other useful features on the site, like a shopping list creator or calculator for recipe doubling.&nbsp;</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>To understand if the author has subject matter expertise, a rater would do some online research to see if the author has cooking credentials, has been profiled or referenced on other food websites, or has produced other great content that has garnered positive reviews or ratings on recipe sites. Basically, they do some digging to answer questions like: is this page trustworthy, and does it come from a site or author with a good reputation?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n  <br />\n  <p><b>Ratings are not used directly for search ranking</b></p>\n  <p>Once raters have done this research, they then provide a quality rating for each page. It’s important to note that this rating does not directly impact how this page or site ranks in Search. Nobody is deciding that any given source is “authoritative” or “trustworthy.” In particular, pages are not assigned ratings as a way to determine how well to rank them. Indeed, that would be an impossible task and a poor signal for us to use. With hundreds of billions of pages that are constantly changing, there’s no way humans could evaluate every page on a recurring basis.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>Instead, ratings are a data point that, when taken in aggregate, helps us measure how well our systems are working to deliver great content that’s aligned with how people—across the country and around the world—evaluate information.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>Last year alone, we did more than <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/mission/users/\">383,605 search quality tests and 62,937 side-by-side experiments</a> with our search quality raters to measure the quality of our results and help us make more than 3,600 improvements to our search algorithms.&nbsp;</p>\n  <br />\n  <p><b>In-product experiments</b></p>\n  <p>Our research and rater feedback isn’t the only feedback we use when making improvements. We also need to understand how a new feature will work when it’s actually available in Search and people are using it as they would in real life. To make sure we’re able to get these insights, we test how people interact with new features through live experiments.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>They’re called “live” experiments because they’re actually available to a small proportion of randomly selected people using the current version of Search. To test a change, we will launch a feature to a small percentage of all queries we get, and we look at a number of different metrics to measure the impact.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>Did people click or tap on the new feature? Did most people just scroll past it? Did it make the page load slower? These insights can help us understand quite a bit about whether a new feature or change is helpful and if people will actually use it.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>In 2019, we ran more than 17,000 live traffic experiments to test out new features and improvements to Search. If you compare that with how many launches actually happened (around 3600, remember?), you can see that only the best and most useful improvements make it into Search.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p><b>Always improving</b></p>\n  <p>While our search results will never be perfect, these research and evaluation processes have proven to be very effective over the past two decades. They allow us to make frequent improvements and ensure that the changes we make represent the needs of people around the world coming to Search for information.</p>\n  <p><br /></p>\n </div>\n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 04 Aug 2020 17:00:00 +0000","feedId":10205,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"dad5649be8492a610a39f755ef72576e","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/InsideSearch/~4/ZcGse3pNnoY":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn69@2020_5/2020/08/25/00-49-01-455_fcfbb5df37bd882f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598316419611},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:46:59","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:46:59","title":"Bringing free retail listings to Google Search","link":"https://blog.google/products/shopping/bringing-free-retail-listings-google-search/","description":"<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>When shopping online, it can be daunting to find the right product, the best seller, or the best value.

In this post, we’ll share more about how knowledge panels are automatically generated, how data for the Knowledge Graph is gathered and how we monitor and react to reports of incorrect information.<br /><br /></p>\n  <h3>What’s a knowledge panel?</h3>\n  <a href=\"https://support.google.com/knowledgepanel/answer/9163198\">Knowledge panels</a> are easily recognized by those who do desktop searching, appearing to the right of search results:\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \">\n    <img alt=\"Knowledge Panel\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Eddie.max-1000x1000.png\" />\n   </figure>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>Our systems aim to show the most relevant and popular information for a topic within a knowledge panel. Because no topic is the same, exactly what is shown in a knowledge panel will vary. But typically, they’ll include:<br /><br /></p>\n  <ul>\n   <li>Title and short summary of the topic</li>\n   <li>A longer description of the subject</li>\n   <li>A picture or pictures of the person, place or thing</li>\n   <li>Key facts, such as when a notable figure was born or where something is located</li>\n   <li>Links to social profiles and official websites</li>\n  </ul>\n  <br />\n  <p>Knowledge panels might also include special information related to particular topics. For example:<br /><br /></p>\n  <ul>\n   <li>Songs from musical artists</li>\n   <li>Upcoming episodes from TV shows</li>\n   <li>Rosters of sports teams.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <h3>Sources of information for the Knowledge Graph</h3>\n  <p>The information about an “entity”—a person, place or thing—in our knowledge panels comes from our <a href=\"https://support.google.com/knowledgepanel/answer/9787176\">Knowledge Graph</a>, which was <a href=\"https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/05/introducing-knowledge-graph-things-not.html\">launched in 2012</a>. It’s a system that understands facts and information about entities from materials shared across the web, as well as from open source and licensed databases. It has amassed over 500 billion facts about five billion entities.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>Wikipedia is a commonly-cited source, but it’s not the only one. We draw from hundreds of sources from across the web, including licensing data that appears in knowledge panels for music, sports and TV. We work with medical providers to create carefully vetted content for knowledge panels for health issues. We also draw from <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/event\">special coding</a> that content owners can use, such as to indicate <a href=\"https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2020/02/events-on-search.html\">upcoming events</a>.<br /><br /></p>\n  <h3>On mobile, multiple knowledge panels provide facts</h3>\n  <p>When we first launched knowledge panels, most search activity happened on desktop, where there was room to easily show knowledge panels alongside search results. Today, most search activity happens on mobile, where screen size doesn’t allow for a side-by-side display.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>To this end, information from the Knowledge Graph is often not presented through a single knowledge panel on mobile. Instead, one or more knowledge panels may appear interspersed among the overall results.</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \">\n    <img alt=\"Mobile Knowledge Panel\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Florence.max-1000x1000.png\" />\n   </figure>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <h3>How we work to improve the Knowledge Graph</h3>\n  <p>Inaccuracies in the Knowledge Graph can occasionally happen. Just as we have automatic systems that gather facts for the Knowledge Graph, we also have automatic systems designed to prevent inaccuracies from appearing. However, as with anything, the systems aren’t perfect. That’s why we also accept reports from anyone about issues.</p>\n  <br />\n  <p>Selecting the “Feedback” link at the bottom of a knowledge panel or the three dots at the top of one on mobile brings up options to provide feedback to us:</p>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-image_full_width\">\n <div class=\"article-module h-c-page\">\n  <div class=\"h-c-grid\">\n   <figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \">\n    <img alt=\"Knowledge Panel feedback\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/California.max-1000x1000.png\" />\n   </figure>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>We analyze feedback like this to understand how any actual inaccuracies got past our systems, so that we can make improvements generally across the Knowledge Graph overall. We also remove inaccurate facts that come to our attention for violating our <a href=\"https://support.google.com/knowledgepanel/answer/9787176\">policies</a>, especially prioritizing issues relating to public interest topics such as civic, medical, scientific, and historical issues or where there’s a risk of serious and immediate harm.<br /><br /></p>\n  <h3>How entities can claim and suggest changes to a knowledge panel</h3>\n  <p>Many knowledge panels can be “claimed” by the subject they are about, such as a person or a company. The claiming process—what we call <a href=\"https://support.google.com/knowledgepanel/answer/7534902\">getting verified</a>—allows subjects <a href=\"https://support.google.com/knowledgepanel/answer/7534842\">to provide feedback directly to us</a> about potential changes or to suggest things like a preferred photo. For local businesses, there’s a separate process of claiming that operates through <a href=\"https://www.google.com/business/\">Google My Business</a>. This enables local businesses to manage special elements in their knowledge panels, such as opening hours and contact phone numbers.</p>\n  <p>For more information about topics like this, check out our How Search Works blog <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/search/how-search-works/\">series</a> and <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/\">website</a>.<br /></p>\n </div>\n</div>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 20 May 2020 17:00:00 +0000","feedId":10205,"bgimg":"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Eddie.max-1000x1000.png","linkMd5":"0904db3a323b7e1108cc5bb027026fdd","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn46@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-46-59-923_bcc8b4d16c7b4123.webp","destWidth":1000,"destHeight":807,"sourceBytes":524897,"destBytes":186906,"author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Eddie.max-1000x1000.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn46@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-46-59-923_bcc8b4d16c7b4123.webp","https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Florence.max-1000x1000.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn6@2020_6/2020/08/25/00-49-01-441_31e4379399d394bc.webp","https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/California.max-1000x1000.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn30@2020_1/2020/08/25/00-49-03-419_6f038ba661495d41.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/InsideSearch/~4/RjlUidBVu7E":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn73@2020_3/2020/08/25/00-49-01-442_97f66e306cc86b7e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598316419614},{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 08:46:59","updatedTime":"2020-08-25 08:46:59","title":"Supporting refugees and displaced people on World Refugee Day","link":"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/google-org/supporting-refugees-and-displaced-people-world-refugee-day/","description":"<div class=\"block-paragraph\">\n <div class=\"rich-text\">\n  <p>More than <a href=\"https://www.unhcr.org/globaltrends2019/\">79 million</a> were displaced at the end of last year as a result of persecution, conflict, violence or human rights violations—29 million of which were refugees.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>Since 2015, we’ve given more than $30 million in Google.org grants to help provide emergency support and access to vital information and educational resources to more than one million refugees. Today, on World Refugee Day, we’re renewing our commitment to work together with nonprofits and find more long-term solutions. We’re supporting the <a href=\"https://www.unhcr.org/\">UN Refugee Agency</a> (UNHCR) with $550,000 Google.org and YouTube grants to provide refugees with necessary materials to endure the pandemic, digital skills training series and updates to Google Search in affected countries so people have access to reliable information at all times.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>The global pandemic knows no borders and is affecting everyone—including refugees.

Over the past few months, we’ve added tools and features to make it easier for businesses to keep customers informed, including the ability to add dining options and updated hours to Business Profiles.&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>Today, we’re rolling out support links for businesses to post directly to their Business Profiles on Google, starting first in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand. With this feature, merchants will be able to add a donation link, gift card link or both to their profile. They can also share a personal message in their post to inform customers how funds will be put to use. These support links will be visible to consumers later this month.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>At launch, we’ve partnered with <a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/us/home\">PayPal</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/\">GoFundMe</a> for donations. For gift cards, merchants can link directly to the relevant page on their website or to their gift card offerings with one of our eligible partners, which includes&nbsp;<a href=\"https://squareup.com/us/en\">Square</a>, <a href=\"https://pos.toasttab.com/\">Toast</a>, <a href=\"https://www.clover.com/\">Clover</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vagaro.com/\">Vagaro</a>. While Google is not charging merchants or consumers any fees, there may be partner processing fees associated with campaigns.</p>\n  <p>We know that businesses around the world are looking for financial support during this time. Our initial launch will begin with a subset of businesses to protect against misuse, with plans to expand to more countries, merchants, and partners in a safe and responsible way over the coming weeks.
