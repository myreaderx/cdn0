Around the globe, people have sacrificed to keep each other safe during the pandemic: We gave up large family dinners, trips to regions with fantastic food, and visits to our local watering holes. Now, thanks to public-health measures and vaccination campaigns, we can look forward with anticipation to a future of traveling and eating cheek to jowl once more.</p>\n<p>That’s why I am so excited to share a sneak peek of a project that me, my coauthor <a href=\"https://www.cecilywong.com/\">Cecily Wong</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/gastro\">Gastro Obscura</a> team have been working on for four years. It’s a book, and it will hit the shelves in fall 2021. It’s called <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/1523502193?tag=workmanweb-20\"><em>Gastro Obscura: A Food Adventurer’s Guide</em></a>.</p>\n<figure class=\"  \"><img class=\"article-image  \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/81637/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>The idea behind this guide, based on Gastro Obscura’s articles, recipes, and more, is to expand our understanding and appreciation of what people around the world eat and drink, from Montana to Madagascar. Covering all seven continents, <em>Gastro Obscura</em> explores culinary curiosities that range from a beer made from fog in Chile to Sardinia’s “Threads of God” pasta to Egypt’s 2,000-year-old egg ovens.</p>\n<p>Every page includes information for travelers looking to try unique, local foods and visit unusual eateries, whether in a city center or atop a mountain after a breath-taking hike. It also documents food history (the network of ancient Roman fish-sauce factories), culture (four million women gathering to make rice pudding), and festivals (feeding wild macaques a pyramid of fruit at Thailand’s Monkey Buffet Festival). We hope the book will inspire readers to see what we eat and drink as an endless source of curiosity.</p>\n<p>We will be launching a bigger pre-order campaign this summer (with an exciting pre-order giveaway), but if you want to be the first to get your hands on the book, you can pre-order now by using any of the below links.

A distant cousin of the harp, the 2,000-year-old instrument was once a mainstay in royal courts, and produced “the sweetest sound.” Then, it disappeared, preserved only in historical texts—until now.</p>\n<p>The yazh is one of a handful of lost or obscure folk instruments that Sekar, 24, has been recreating in a studio he began in 2019. It takes Sekar five to six months to build a yazh. Each handcrafted instrument is made from a solid block of wood, and, when finished, is about two feet tall, with seven or 14 strings, a distinctively carved peacock head, slender neck, and a bowl-like resonator. Customers from as far away as Norway, Dubai, and the U.S. have been drawn to <a href=\"https://youtu.be/31ZksEch0OE\">its ethereal sound</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Atlas Obscura</em> spoke to Sekar about his mission to bring back forgotten instruments and how he learned his craft.</p>\n<h3 class=\"article-second-subheading-pre-rd\"><strong>How did you get interested in building musical instruments?</strong></h3>\n<p>I was in 10th grade when I saw the Hawaiian lap steel guitar and wanted to play it. However, at that time, this guitar wasn’t available in India. The only option I had was to build it. I watched YouTube videos and tried making the guitar.</p>\n<p>The process of working with wood became addictive; I was fascinated by it. I thought about its texture, how it felt in my hands. Finally, when I made the instrument and heard its sound, it felt wonderful. Later, I decided to pursue architecture in college, because I wanted to study design. During my summer vacations, I built a string instrument each year, including a banjo and a ukulele.</p>\n<p>I went for an architectural internship to <a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/auroville\">Auroville</a>. It was there that I met a well-known luthier, Erisa Neogy, to whom I showed my instruments. He was kind and was willing to teach me more about instrument-making, which led me to train under him for six months. Since the process fascinated me, after graduating from college, I decided to devote all my time to making instruments.</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81619/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<h3 class=\"article-second-subheading-pre-rd\"><strong>How did you transition from building guitars to crafting ancient Indian instruments?</strong></h3>\n<p>During my time in Auroville, I wondered why I was only making Western instruments. I realized that Western instruments, like the guitar, were everywhere. If students wanted to learn music, the first thought they’d have was to pick up a guitar or play the drums. They wouldn’t even think of playing an Indian instrument. This was something that bothered me.</p>\n<p>The guitar, which only has a history of 500 years, continues to remain popular due to gradual design changes made to it every decade. Hundreds of luthiers work on the instrument, trying out something new to keep the form modern for younger generations. I thought I should do the same with Indian instruments. This is why I started Uru, a company where we redesign folk instruments.</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81617/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<h3 class=\"article-second-subheading-pre-rd\"><strong>The first instrument you designed was the yazh. What fascinated you about it?</strong></h3>\n<p>The beauty about this instrument is that it was once played in temples and in royal courts, as well as among <em>panars</em>, who were an ancient community of musicians. There are Tamil scriptures and literary works written during the Sangam period, sixth century B.C. to the third century, that mention the yazh. Yet, it disappeared. Today, while there are replicas of the yazh available in museums, they are neither original nor playable. I wasn’t also able to find any recorded sound samples or videos of the instrument. So, this created a curiosity in me.</p>\n<h3 class=\"article-second-subheading-pre-rd\"><strong>What was your research process?</strong></h3>\n<p>The first thing I did was collect research documents about the instrument. If you read the Sangam era literature, they exaggerate about it. For instance, it was said that the yazh produced the sweetest sound mankind had ever heard. However, I could not find any factual information, in terms of the length of the strings, or the structure’s accurate dimensions. There were no illustrations accompanying the text either.</p>\n<p>Eventually, I found the <em>Yazh Nool</em>, written by Swami Vipulananda in 1947, which is the only proper research book available on the instrument. The book has detailed information on music theory, how the strings were aligned and musical notations that helped to recreate the sound accurately.</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81618/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<h3 class=\"article-second-subheading-pre-rd\"><strong>What challenges did you face when recreating the yazh?</strong></h3>\n<p>Traditionally, the yazh makers used jackfruit wood. Goat skin would be tightly placed over the instrument’s bowl-shaped resonator. They would use crushed turmeric paste to glue the hide onto it. However, there was a problem in this. If you wanted to change the tone of the instrument by tightening the skin, you would have to open the entire piece and expose it to heat each time.</p>\n<p>So, I decided to introduce the hook-and-bracket system to compensate for this. I also used red cedar, which is lighter than jackfruit wood, to ensure ease in mobility. While carving the resonator, its thickness is determined by tapping the body of the wood and listening. At the point where it starts to ring well, I stop.</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81616/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<h3 class=\"article-second-subheading-pre-rd\"><strong>What other ancient instruments are you bringing back?</strong></h3>\n<p>The p<em>anchamukha vadyam</em>, or the five-faced drum, which belonged to the Chola dynasty period, from the ninth through 13th centuries. It’s a percussion instrument that has five hollow tunnels with skin attached to it. The body was made of bronze and weighed around 200 kilos (440 pounds). Today, the only original piece exists in a temple in Tiruvarur.</p>\n<p>Traditionally, the makers used deer skin. However, since that is not possible now, I’ll be using goat hide instead, and the body will be made using clay to reduce the weight. Right now, I have only built a prototype. However, I'm thinking of going to Tiruvarur and studying the instrument properly, before I begin redesigning it.</p>\n<p>I’m interested in making different instruments from around the world, because I want to study different sounds. I recently made the <em>cajón</em> (a Peruvian percussion instrument), which took two months to build. I also want to craft the Mongolian <em>morin khurr </em>(also known as a horsehead fiddle) and have started researching it. However, part of my process includes hearing stories from local people, which gives me a better understanding of the instrument. Due to the pandemic, this is not currently possible. So, I thought that it might be better to focus on the instruments we have in my part of the world at the moment.</p>\n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 05 Apr 2021 15:05:00 +0000","feedId":51,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"3620a91ba5f554a5fdd81bad1f486012","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Radhika Iyengar","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81619/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx2/cdn35@2020_2/2021/04/07/17-38-07-528_343dd6bce3a1c652.webp","https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81617/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx8/cdn48@2020_3/2021/04/07/17-38-13-038_9ff8169d2c37a307.webp","https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81618/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn95@2020_5/2021/04/07/17-38-07-551_1a4d66bdeea8fc1e.webp","https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81616/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx18/cdn71@2020_2/2021/04/07/17-38-09-231_2bf7231a83dc46db.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617817087206},{"createdTime":"2021-04-08 01:38:07","updatedTime":"2021-04-08 01:38:07","title":"Podcast: The Root Bridges of Cherrapunji","link":"https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/podcast-the-root-bridges-of-cherrapunji","description":"\n        <div>\n<p><strong>Listen and subscribe on <a href=\"https://www.stitcher.com/show/the-atlas-obscura-podcast\">Stitcher</a>, <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-atlas-obscura-podcast/id1555769970\">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/0s0c4Z99PwbW8efTmHckyT\">Spotify</a>, and all major podcast apps.</strong></p>\n</div>\n<hr class=\"baseline-grid-hr\" />\n<p>In this episode of <a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/podcast\">The Atlas Obscura Podcast</a>, we visit the depths of northeastern India, where centuries-old bridges are not built, they are grown.</p>\n<p>Our podcast is an audio guide to the world’s wondrous, awe-inspiring, strange places.

This border is known as \"de brandgrens\" or \"the blaze boundary\" and encircles the area that was bombed in a 12 kilometer (seven-mile) circle. Inside, visitors can see modern buildings, on the other side visitors will see the remaining 18th-century buildings. </p>\n<p>The markings were created by Adriaan Geuze, who submitted the winning design through a competition. The first lamps were installed in May 2009 and the project was completed on May 14, 2019, 70 years after the bombing. The exact border was traced by Ir. Koos Hage. </p>\n<p>Before these lamps were installed, the city would place temporary spots on the anniversary to mark the area.  </p>\n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Wed, 07 Apr 2021 14:00:00 +0000","feedId":51,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"0c74bf9f502e87a23e8a2bc5f1618424","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/media/W1siZiIsInVwbG9hZHMvcGxhY2VfaW1hZ2VzLzEzM2FkM2MzLTg4MmEtNGMxNi05YjE5LTFlNzY0ODg2NzY2NmYwMzNmNTJiYWU5ZGYzMGRlZF9CcmFuZGdyZW5zXy1fUm90dGVyZGFtX1dhcl9NZW1vcmlhbF9vZl9XV0lJX0lNR1AwMzQ3X3NtaWFsX3dwLmpwZyJdLFsicCIsImNvbnZlcnQiLCItYXV0by1vcmllbnQgIl0sWyJwIiwidGh1bWIiLCIyNDU2eDE2MzcrMCszNjEiXSxbInAiLCJjb252ZXJ0IiwiLXF1YWxpdHkgODEgLWF1dG8tb3JpZW50Il0sWyJwIiwidGh1bWIiLCIzMDB4MjAwIyJdXQ/Brandgrens_-_Rotterdam_War_Memorial_of_WWII_IMGP0347_smial_wp.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx31/cdn78@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-38-07-574_1fe92acbd37e7b3f.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617817087194},{"createdTime":"2021-04-08 01:38:07","updatedTime":"2021-04-08 01:38:07","title":"Santuario del Señor de las Peñas in Reyes Etla, Mexico","link":"https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/santuario-del-senor-de-las-penas","description":"\n        <p><img alt=\"\" data-width=\"2048\" data-height=\"1365\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/media/W1siZiIsInVwbG9hZHMvcGxhY2VfaW1hZ2VzL2ZkMGM3MTRlLTlmZmEtNDNiNC1iMDAzLTBiNWE2YmYxYjFlOWUxYWI2ZDJhOTAxMGY0NzRlOF9zYW50dTMuanBnIl0sWyJwIiwiY29udmVydCIsIiJdLFsicCIsImNvbnZlcnQiLCItcXVhbGl0eSA4MSAtYXV0by1vcmllbnQiXSxbInAiLCJ0aHVtYiIsIjMwMHgyMDAjIl1d/santu3.jpg\" /></p> <p>This small Catholic church is located amid farmland near the communities of Reyes Etla and Villa de Etla in <a class=\"destination-link place-destination-link\" title=\"Things to do in Oaxaca, Mexico\" href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/oaxaca-mexico\" data-destination-link-kind=\"place\" data-geo-id=\"17107\" data-title=\"Oaxaca, Mexico\" data-slug=\"oaxaca-mexico\">Oaxaca</a>. It houses an effigy of Christ that is highly venerated by the locals, specially on its feast day during Lent. Known as both \"El Señor de las Peñas\" (the Lord of Rocks) or \"Señor de las Peñitas\" (the Lord of Little Rocks), its feast is one of the most popular in the state.</p>\n<p>What sets this sanctuary apart from similar temples in Oaxaca is that, despite being located in a flat valley, it is surrounded by a few vegetation-covered mounds. But these are not natural hills—they are actually un-excavated Zapotec ruins, now completely buried and overgrown. It is believed that these people regarded the location as sacred due to a fossilized human footprint, attributed to one of the first humans to have existed following the Zapotec creation myth.</p>\n<p>Not coincidentally, modern-day veneration of the Lord of Rocks is tied to a similar footprint, said to have been made by the effigy itself. Although the original Jesus figure was stolen from this sanctuary, a replica is now housed in it and its veneration continues. A plaque near this church states that its construction dates to 1636, which would showcase a continuum of belief in the area from the original Zapotec population, through the Spanish Colonial period and to the present day.</p>\n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 05 Apr 2021 18:00:00 +0000","feedId":51,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"def9bef5cd5ed63941c0ba0910da8e1a","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/media/W1siZiIsInVwbG9hZHMvcGxhY2VfaW1hZ2VzL2ZkMGM3MTRlLTlmZmEtNDNiNC1iMDAzLTBiNWE2YmYxYjFlOWUxYWI2ZDJhOTAxMGY0NzRlOF9zYW50dTMuanBnIl0sWyJwIiwiY29udmVydCIsIiJdLFsicCIsImNvbnZlcnQiLCItcXVhbGl0eSA4MSAtYXV0by1vcmllbnQiXSxbInAiLCJ0aHVtYiIsIjMwMHgyMDAjIl1d/santu3.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn51@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-38-07-497_391a3dd2dcda032b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617817087203},{"createdTime":"2021-04-08 01:38:07","updatedTime":"2021-04-08 01:38:07","title":"Living Sharks Museum in Westerly, Rhode Island","link":"https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/living-sharks-museum","description":"\n        <p><img alt=\"Living Sharks Museum\" data-width=\"2701\" data-height=\"2701\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/media/W1siZiIsInVwbG9hZHMvcGxhY2VfaW1hZ2VzL2I4OWI1NTQwLTAyZmQtNDRiMi1iYjNiLTQyNzAyNmZhZmYwYWJjMTZkZWQzM2VlMTQwMGVjYV9JTUdfRTE5MjcuSlBHIl0sWyJwIiwiY29udmVydCIsIi1hdXRvLW9yaWVudCAiXSxbInAiLCJ0aHVtYiIsIjI3MDF4MTgwMCswKzU3Il0sWyJwIiwiY29udmVydCIsIi1xdWFsaXR5IDgxIC1hdXRvLW9yaWVudCJdLFsicCIsInRodW1iIiwiMzAweDIwMCMiXV0/IMG_E1927.JPG\" /></p> <p>An easel on the sidewalk suggests a pop-up-style shark museum exhibition hiding on the third floor of one of many historical buildings in the heart of downtown Westerly.

The Living Sharks Museum is far ahead of the curve in educating the public on the sharks that populate the waters.

These include food, folk medicine, handicrafts—and cages upon cages of wild animals. “I very much remember the snakes, because I was always fascinated by snakes,” Carvalho says. “But there were turtles and monkeys and thousands of birds.”</p>\n<p>Wildlife trafficking in Brazil happens <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/27/millions-of-animals-trafficked-from-the-amazon-annually-report\">mostly out of sight</a> these days, but it remains a widespread problem. According to <a href=\"https://www.wwf.org.br/informacoes/english/?33822/Illegal-trading-threat-species-all-over-the-world#:~:text=In%20Brazil%20the%20problem%20is%20just%20as%20serious.&#38;text=Around%2038%20million%20wild%20animals,illegally%20trafficked%20animals%20is%20greatest.\">the WWF</a>, “approximately 38 million wild animals are removed from Brazilian natural habitats every year.” About 4 million of them end up as pets. The demand for illegally trafficked animals is greatest near the urban centers of São Paulo and Rio, where Carvalho grew up.</p>\n<p>Carvalho doesn’t recall seeing common marmosets at the market, but they were almost certainly there. “Pocket monkeys,” as they’re sometimes called, were (and still are) immensely popular to keep as pets—at least until they reveal themselves to be fickle, feral, and smelly. Thanks to decades of fed-up pet owners turning them loose, the common marmoset, endemic to the north and central areas of Brazil, has fully invaded the Atlantic rainforest biome that surrounds the urban sprawl along Brazil’s Atlantic coast.</p>\n<p>Today, there are so many common marmosets in Rio, “most people assume they are a native species,” says Carvalho. In the city, common marmosets run rampant, munching on birds’ eggs and wreaking havoc on the food chain. And they’ve gotten away with it for one, very specific reason: They’re adorable.</p>\n<figure class=\" contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/81515/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>Carvalho ended up studying the impact of invasive common marmosets on endemic primates for his PhD studies from 2011 to 2015. What he found was that while common marmosets were multiplying, populations of the area’s native marmosets—the buffy-tufted-ear marmoset among them—were plummeting.</p>\n<p>The buffy-tufted-ear marmoset, Carvalho learned, was fighting a multifront war. These marmosets are arboreal, spending most of their lives high in the trees of the rugged uplands of the Atlantic rainforest, habitat that has all but disappeared amid the region’s rapid and unrelenting urbanization. Diseases—yellow fever and Zika, in particular—have also taken their toll on the species.</p>\n<p>But the biggest threat to the buffy-tufted-ear marmoset came from an unexpected source: those adorable common marmosets.</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81514/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>Carvalho found that “severe hybridization” with common marmosets had walked the buffy-tufted-ear marmoset to the edge of extinction. Common marmosets, hardy and able to adapt to a variety of habitats, had invaded the buffy-tufted-ear marmoset’s range, producing offspring that looked a whole lot like the full-fledged version of the latter. Because the hybrid offspring could pass as a buffy-tufted-ear marmoset, the dismaying trend continued essentially unnoticed. “It would take a trained eye to see that they were hybrids,” says Carvalho, who wrote his dissertation on the genetic and phenotypical differences between pure and hybrid species.</p>\n<p>In the end, he estimated that there were fewer than 10,000 fully buffy-tufted-ear marmosets left, a population much smaller than the “vulnerable” status indicated. (Thanks in part to Carvalho’s work, today the IUCN lists them as one of the world’s <a href=\"https://www.treehugger.com/meet-planets-most-endangered-primates-4868698\">25 most endangered primates</a>. The common marmoset’s status is currently “least concern.”)</p>\n<p>In 2014, Carvalho established the <a href=\"https://www.mountainmarmosetsconservation.com/\">Mountain Marmoset Conservation Program</a>, which now works on behalf of the buffy-tufted-ear marmoset and its kin, the critically endangered buffy-headed marmoset. From the beginning, Carvalho knew one of the organization’s biggest hurdles would be challenging people’s affection for the common marmoset.</p>\n<p>This is a good time to mention that there’s one more thing working against the buffy-tufted-ear marmoset: Unlike the common marmoset, it isn’t cute, at least not by most standards. With a perma-sneer and menacingly orange eyes, the tiny primate looks like it woke up wearing yesterday’s makeup. Because of its haggard countenance and standoffish nature, staff at Carvalho’s organization lovingly call it “the little goth monkey.” (The Portuguese moniker is a tad kinder: <em>sagui-caverinha</em>,* or, “little skull monkey.”)</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81513/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>With a face only a marmoset mother could love, buffy-tufted-ear marmosets would do well to make inroads with the humans deciding their fate. But they don’t. Carvalho says that if you go to any park in Rio with a banana in your hand, “you’ll have five common marmosets near you” in seconds. Buffy-tufted-ear marmosets keep a wide berth. Most people in Rio have never seen one. “They’re invisible,” Carvalho says.</p>\n<p>Conservations often rely on charismatic megafauna—animals big, pretty, fuzzy, or funny enough to inspire people to act on behalf of an entire ecosystem. Often the charismatic species become “keystone species,” poster children to attract funds that will benefit lots of other, less affable creatures (think bugs, snakes, or unsexy plants).</p>\n<p>But the plight of the buffy-tufted-ear marmoset turns that concept on its head. What is a conservationist to do when the invasive species is more charismatic than the native species it’s harming?</p>\n<p>According to a <a href=\"https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fee.2195\">recent study</a> initiated by the <a href=\"https://indynet.de/\">Invasion Dynamics Network</a>, a group of scientists dedicated to studying the impact of biological invasions, “unlike the charisma of threatened species, which has a positive effect on management efforts, charisma in [invasive alien species] usually represents a hindrance to management.”</p>\n<p>This has played out many times over in ecosystems around the world. In southeast Spain, for example, the imported prickly pear cactus has become such an iconic symbol of the region’s landscape, it’s been featured on postage stamps. South Africans adore the purple flowers of invasive jacaranda trees so much, officials in Pretoria adopted the nickname “Jacaranda City.” Released monk parakeets have proliferated <a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/greenwood-cemetery-brooklyn\">in Brooklyn’s Green-Wood Cemetery</a> and in Chicago; <a href=\"https://blockclubchicago.org/2019/07/26/wild-monk-parakeets-are-now-living-on-the-northwest-side/\">a recent headline</a> announced, “neighbors love it.” Perhaps the most infamously charismatic invasive creatures of all are <a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/pablo-escobar-hippo-poop\">Pablo Escobar’s destructive hippos</a>, which have survived constant culling threats thanks to the Colombians who adore them. All of these species thrive at the expense of native flora and fauna.</p>\n<figure class=\"article-pullquote-container\">\n<aside class=\"article-pullquote\">\n<blockquote class=\"article-pullquote-content\">The biggest threat to the buffy-tufted-ear marmoset came from an unexpected source: those adorable common marmosets.</blockquote>\n</aside>\n</figure>\n<p>Ultimately, Carvalho and his team knew a campaign against common marmosets—either through removal or sterilization—was a losing battle. “They’re just too damn cute,” says James Hall, MMCP’s volunteer research coordinator. Brazilians, many of whom enjoy interacting with and feeding common marmosets in their neighborhoods, wouldn’t go for it.</p>\n<p>Instead the MMCP has leaned into other strategies, including fighting to preserve and restore the Atlantic rainforest. The team also built the species’ first dedicated captive breeding center in Viçosa, Brazil, where a safety-net population of non-hybridized buffy-tufted-ear marmosets can be raised should the one in the wild collapse completely. The center’s first pair were introduced just last month. It must have been a match: They’ve already mated, and a pregnancy announcement could come shortly.</p>\n<p>The MMCP has also released a number of environmental education materials designed for kids, including a coloring book, comic book, and board game. “The best thing we can do is talk to our children,” Carvalho insists. “They will be responsible for the [buffy-tufted-ear] marmoset very soon.” He hopes young Brazilians won’t meet the little goth monkey in a market or a zoo, but where it belongs: flourishing in the wild.</p>\n<p><em>*Correction: This phrase initially read “sagui-vaverinha.”</em></p>\n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 05 Apr 2021 17:51:00 +0000","feedId":51,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"3fadd06d66cf1f59e715e5cbf6aff45b","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Ashley Stimpson","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/81515/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn57@2020_2/2021/04/07/17-38-07-730_4bbaa2b09072d9d6.webp","https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81514/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx7/cdn81@2020_3/2021/04/07/17-38-07-612_06434ca1715bc3f6.webp","https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81513/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn80@2020_5/2021/04/07/17-38-07-613_27c0227f1b84d90b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617817087204},{"createdTime":"2021-04-08 01:38:07","updatedTime":"2021-04-08 01:38:07","title":"The Elk of Prince Street in Alexandria, Virginia","link":"https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-elk-of-prince-street","description":"\n        <p><img alt=\"The Elk of Prince Street\" data-width=\"3024\" data-height=\"4032\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/media/W1siZiIsInVwbG9hZHMvcGxhY2VfaW1hZ2VzLzRlZjczMjkwLTEwNjMtNGQ1OC1hYTUzLTBiMzBhOTg0Nzg2NzBkOGIzZWZiNjRmZWNiMTQ5NF9QWExfMjAyMTAzMjRfMjM1MDUwMzYxLmpwZyJdLFsicCIsImNvbnZlcnQiLCItYXV0by1vcmllbnQgIl0sWyJwIiwidGh1bWIiLCIzMDIxeDIwMTQrMCs4MTEiXSxbInAiLCJjb252ZXJ0IiwiLXF1YWxpdHkgODEgLWF1dG8tb3JpZW50Il0sWyJwIiwidGh1bWIiLCIzMDB4MjAwIyJdXQ/PXL_20210324_235050361.jpg\" /></p> <p>A beloved beast in bronze sits beneath the central arch of a historic edifice, one of two visible clues that point to the past life of this Beaux-Arts building.

It was constructed over a period of about three years, an impressive feat considering its size. The lake's surface area is well over 3,o00,000 square feet making it the largest man-made lake in Asia.</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n<div class=\"thumbinner\">The park was designed to provide a natural-looking outdoor space in an urban area. There are recreational facilities, such as a promenade road and a bicycle path, along with inline skating, walking, and jogging trails that encircle the lake. It's a fantastic location for picnics, although, on busy days, visitors might struggle to find a shady tree. </div>\n<div class=\"thumbinner\"> </div>\n<div class=\"thumbinner\">Ilsan Lake Park is divided into two parts by Dal-ma-ji (<span lang=\"ko-Hang\" title=\"Korean-language text\">달맞이섬</span>), an island located in the middle of the lake. The northern part was designed around a natural lake with much of the original plant growth still in situ, while the southern part is an artificial lake surrounded by fountains.</div>\n<div class=\"thumbinner\">\n<p>There is an octagonal pavilion on Dal-ma-ji island called \"Wal-pa-jung\" (<span lang=\"ko-Hang\" title=\"Korean-language text\">월파정</span>). In the middle of the park is the Go-sa fountain (<span lang=\"ko-Hang\" title=\"Korean-language text\">고사 분수</span>), which spouts over 32 feet (10 meters) high.</p>\n<p>Ilsan Lake Park also features a large variety of wildflowers, plants, and botanical gardens. It is beautiful to visit when the cherry blossom and magnolia trees are in full bloom. The lake park acts as the venue for the annual Goyang International Flower Festival.</p>\n<p>Some interesting facts about the park and surrounding area, the Illsan Musical Fountain puts on pretty audio-visual shows twice a night over the weekend.

The building dates back to 1910 when it was once an open-air cattle barn, part of the Fort Worth Stockyard. During World War II, the barn became an airplane factory and in the 1950s it was converted into a large department store.</p>\n<p>The site covers an area of 100,000 square feet and has nearly 20 acres of parking. Inside are several bars and a Texas-size dance floor. The honky-tonk hosts live music showcases where many big names in the country music world have performed. </p>\n<p>A large collection of country music memorabilia is on display in the museum. There is also a Celebrity Wall Of Fame where each entertainer leaves their handprints in concrete and autographed guitars of the stars can be found at the Guitar Bar.</p>\n<p>The venue also contains an indoor rodeo arena in what was the auction ring for cattle. Every Friday and Saturday night there is a live rodeo with professional bull riders. </p>\n<p>Billy Bob’s Texas is also in the <em>Guinness Book of World Records</em> as the location where the biggest round of drinks was purchased. This happened in 1983 when Merle Haggard offered to buy everyone in the bar a whiskey shot. This totaled 5,095 people and cost him $12,737.50.</p>\n<p>Along with being a venue for conventions, parties, and weddings, the bar hosts weekly line dancing classes, has rows of pool tables, a video arcade, kitchens serving authentic Western cuisine, a general store, and a gift shop.</p>\n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 06 Apr 2021 14:00:00 +0000","feedId":51,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"01e2f532201f562840959a612966992b","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/media/W1siZiIsInVwbG9hZHMvcGxhY2VfaW1hZ2VzLzk4NGQxYzlmLTk0YTYtNGViMS1iYWU0LTJiOTkwOTQ0Zjc1ZTNhNDIxYjIwMWU1NWY5NjViZV9UZXhhcyAwODcuSlBHIl0sWyJwIiwiY29udmVydCIsIi1hdXRvLW9yaWVudCAiXSxbInAiLCJ0aHVtYiIsIjg4MXg1ODcrMTArMTI3Il0sWyJwIiwiY29udmVydCIsIi1xdWFsaXR5IDgxIC1hdXRvLW9yaWVudCJdLFsicCIsInRodW1iIiwiMzAweDIwMCMiXV0/Texas%20087.JPG":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx22/cdn31@2020_3/2021/04/07/17-38-10-860_feb7d6f4220ee559.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617817087203},{"createdTime":"2021-04-08 01:38:07","updatedTime":"2021-04-08 01:38:07","title":"Poseokjeong Pavilion in Gyeongju, South Korea","link":"https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/poseokjeong-pavilion","description":"\n        <p><img alt=\"Poseokjeong Pavilion\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"960\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/media/W1siZiIsInVwbG9hZHMvcGxhY2VfaW1hZ2VzLzQ1NjVlOTUyLWU1NTctNDU1Ny1iZjYyLTg2NzUxNDg1YjcwNDA3MTI4NTJjODMwNTg2MWM2Y19Lb3JlYS1HeWVvbmdqdS1Qb3Nlb2tqZW9uZ19zaXRlXzM4MzItMDYuanBnIl0sWyJwIiwiY29udmVydCIsIi1hdXRvLW9yaWVudCAiXSxbInAiLCJ0aHVtYiIsIjEyNzd4ODUxKzIrOTUiXSxbInAiLCJjb252ZXJ0IiwiLXF1YWxpdHkgODEgLWF1dG8tb3JpZW50Il0sWyJwIiwidGh1bWIiLCIzMDB4MjAwIyJdXQ/Korea-Gyeongju-Poseokjeong_site_3832-06.jpg\" /></p> <p>Between the 7th and 9th-centuries, the city of <a class=\"destination-link place-destination-link\" title=\"Things to do in Gyeongju, South Korea\" href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/gyeongju-south-korea\" data-destination-link-kind=\"place\" data-geo-id=\"15540\" data-title=\"Gyeongju, South Korea\" data-slug=\"gyeongju-south-korea\">Gyeongju</a> was the main cultural and political center of Korea, as the capital of the powerful Silla Kingdom that conquered most of the Korean peninsula.</p>\n<p>During this period, known as Unified Silla, many grandiose palaces were constructed in the prosperous city.

When citizen scientists in the Netherlands spotted it in August 2020 while collecting trash along Leiden’s Oude Vest canal, they noticed something unsettling. The glove was torn, and wedged inside a gash beneath the thumb, they saw a tail. It was fringed and a bit rufous, and belonged to a creature that swam in and never found its way out.</p>\n<p>That unfortunate fish—a European perch, <em>Perca fluviatilis</em>—is one of many animals that recently found themselves at the mercy of the wave of pandemic-related disposables. Humans have now been living alongside COVID-19 for more than a year—and that means other animals have, too. For months, <a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/ppe-in-environment\">scientists have suspected</a> that animals are affected by the disposable masks, plastic gloves, and other personal protective equipment (PPE) that people lost or discarded around parks, waterways, and other public spaces. Now researchers have pulled together observations from several countries to see how creatures are grappling with our castoffs.</p>\n<p>The Ocean Conservancy, a Washington, D.C.–based environmental nonprofit, regularly hosts the <a href=\"https://oceanconservancy.org/trash-free-seas/international-coastal-cleanup/\">International Coastal Cleanup</a>, a blitz of trash-picking events around the world. Last July, the organization added “PPE” as a category of trash that participants could <a href=\"https://oceanconservancy.org/trash-free-seas/international-coastal-cleanup/cleanswell/\">log in an app</a>. The Ocean Conservancy followed up with a survey in early 2021, and <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/1lm28pdmv5gmoah/FINAL%20Ocean%20Conservancy%20PPE%20Report%20March%202021.pdf?dl=0\">found that 94 percent of respondents</a> had observed PPE pollution at cleanup events the previous year. (In all, volunteers hauled in nearly 107,220 pieces of PPE—largely masks and gloves—across 70 countries.) Most of this trash was found on sand, grass, or sidewalks, but more than a third of participants reported PPE in oceans or other bodies of water. Just over half of the respondents also noted that they saw rogue pieces of PPE in their home communities every day.</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81671/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>Since PPE was a newly introduced category, there’s no perfect way to evaluate how these numbers compare to previous years’ findings. But the report’s authors suggest that this variety of trash would have been captured by counts in other categories, such as “Personal Hygiene” or the catchall “Other Trash.” (That’s the umbrella that covered it until the middle of 2020, too.) The authors pinpoint PPE as the reason that personal hygiene–type litter was three times more prevalent in the period they measured in 2020, versus the same period over the past three years.</p>\n<p>With ecosystems across the world more flooded with more PPE than ever before, other researchers are tracking how animals are reacting to it. A <a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/ab/aop/article-10.1163-15707563-bja10052/article-10.1163-15707563-bja10052.xml#ref_FN000002\">recent paper in <em>Animal Biology</em></a><em>, </em>the journal of the Royal Dutch Zoological Society, offers a snapshot.</p>\n<p>For that research, a team of scientists in the Netherlands, led by biologists Auke-Florian Hiemstra and Liselotte Rambonnet of the Naturalis Biodiversity Center and Institute of Biology at Leiden University, trawled Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram for images and posts tagged with some combination of words such as “litter,” “COVID,” “face mask,” “PPE,” “entangled,” “entrapment,” “bird nest,” and more. The paper identified 28 sightings, many of which were reported by rescue centers or veterinarians. The team also maintains <a href=\"https://www.covidlitter.com/\">a website</a> that invites anyone around the world to report sightings of animals snared in or ingesting PPE.</p>\n<figure class=\"article-pullquote-container\">\n<aside class=\"article-pullquote\">\n<blockquote class=\"article-pullquote-content\">“There must be cases everywhere around the world.”</blockquote>\n</aside>\n</figure>\n<p>The team found animals relating to our pandemic garbage in several ways. Birds wove the trash into their nests: Common coots in the Netherlands incorporated a face mask and a latex glove, a product that also padded the digs of some sparrows in Warsaw, Poland. More troublingly, other animals confused the detritus with dinner. In September, a Magellanic penguin in Brazil was found to have eaten a face mask. The next month, someone from Malaysia described a long-tailed macaque chewing on one. Still other creatures got stuck. A bat and a hedgehog in the Netherlands found themselves tangled in masks. In February, someone reported one wrapped around a herring gull in Canada. In March, someone in the Philippines saw one of the face coverings strangling coral.</p>\n<p>The picture is gloomy, and it’s still incomplete. That’s partly a geographic issue. Because the pandemic <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">has pummeled so many countries</a>, “There must be cases everywhere around the world,” Hiemstra and Rambonnet write in an email, but the researchers only cast around for mentions in Dutch and English. “We now have found, for example, quite a lot of examples from the Netherlands, yet our country is really small,” they add. “There thus must be much more.” Since their paper came out, they’ve noticed an increase in reports through their website, and they’re confident that more documented sightings will make the global picture clearer.</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81668/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>The other problem is that some encounters between animals and PPE are quite difficult to observe. “It makes sense that birds are being reported—they’re conspicuous, and you have a lot of people looking at them,” says Greg Pauly, a herpetologist and codirector of the Urban Nature Research Center at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, who wasn’t involved in this research. Birders keep close tabs on feathered creatures, and would likely notice if one was twisted in something. It’s much harder to account for PPE that animals might be eating. “Ingestion isn’t something you can easily see, and almost no one is looking at it,” Pauly says. In the new paper, many of the ingestion cases were domestic animals, but based on rafts of evidence about the perils of marine plastics and <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-84846-x\">his own recent research into pre-pandemic plastic consumption among freshwater turtles</a>, Pauly suspects that PPE is probably fouling up the insides of many wild animals, too.</p>\n<p>When researchers do go looking for various kinds of plastic in animals’ guts, “We’re finding it,” Pauly says—but necropsies aren’t especially common. (The specimens that Pauly’s team studied had been in the museum collection for several years before they were sliced open.) When postmortem studies are performed, they may be conducted by veterinarians whose notes don’t usually wind up in journal articles, where other scientists can see them. To complete the picture of how much PPE is really accumulating in animals’ bodies, Pauly says vets, conservation biologists, and others should perform more necropsies, or bring the animals’ bodies to museum collections, where—if there’s room—they could be held for future study.</p>\n<p>Though vaccinations are ramping up in many countries, the pandemic is far from over. Public health advocates recommend that humans continue wearing masks to keep each other safe. To limit the toll on wildlife, we ought to reach for reusable ones, and <a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/ppe-in-environment\">snip the straps of any we discard</a>, just like we do with the plastic rings that cinch six-packs.

Standing tall in a nursery near Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh, its massive canopy is large enough to seat 15 people for a picnic and its branches hang heavy with fruit. Unlike the young trees it towers over, though, the texture of the leaves on each branch is different: Some are dull green or olive green; others are glossy and vibrant. The mangoes on each branch look different too: round, oval, or kidney shaped, some green, some yellow, and others with hues of orange, pink, and purple. That’s because this magical mango tree grows more than 300 varieties.</p>\n<p>Over a video call, Kalimullah Khan, 80, known as the “Mango Man,” introduces me to his creation. Stocky and bearded in a crisp, white kurta pyjama, he sits under its canopy and points out varieties, each identified by a tiny label on its green pedicle: Dasheri mangoes from a nearby village, Himsagar from West Bengal, Langra from Bihar. And of course the prized Alphonso mango, whose sweet, creamy, saffron-colored pulp is in high demand domestically and internationally.</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81641/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>Khan’s mango farm is in Malihabad, a large mango belt and mango-lover’s paradise in Northern India with <a href=\"https://numerical.co.in/numerons/collection/5ceac6bbc217e1b42b3f4c39\">more than 10,000 hectares (38 square miles) of mango farms</a>. Amir Khusro, the Indo-Persian poet, called the mango, which is native to India and its tropical and subtropical climate, the “fairest fruit of Hindustan.” Intensive cultivation began centuries ago under the Mughal Empire, and India remains the largest producer of mangoes in the world, growing more than 1,000 varieties and <a href=\"http://www.isasat.org/Vol-3-issue-1-Jan-2019/AARJ_III_1_2019_9_Thakor_pp80-88.pdf\">accounting for more than 40 percent of production</a>.</p>\n<p>With the help of his son, Khan cultivates 22 acres of farmland first planted by his grandfather in the early 1900s. When Khan dropped out of high school and made this his life work, the family grew just a couple local varieties, much like nearby mango farms. The seeds of his obsession with mango grafting was sown at the age of 15, when Khan saw crossbred roses in a friend’ s garden, with one rose plant growing flowers of different colors. It made him wonder if one tree could also produce different kinds of fruits.</p>\n<p>“Naturally I wanted to replicate what I saw on [that] rose bush on a mango tree,” he says.</p>\n<p>He was 17 when he grafted seven varieties of mango onto a single tree. He was heartbroken when floods killed the tree, but determined to learn more about grafting, which he had learned about on his family orchards. Around the world, farmers and gardeners use grafting to fuse the roots and bottom portion of one plant with the shoots and top part of another. It’s a quick and reliable method of reproduction that can potentially combine the best characteristics of two plants.</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81642/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>Over the years, Khan fine-tuned the art of cutting off a branch from one tree, slicing notched angles into it, and then attaching the orphaned cutting to a new, hybrid tree. In 1987, he started grafting cuttings of different varieties onto a 100-year-old mango tree. He collected samples from across the country to add, seeking out rare varieties. Khan says the tree now grows more than 300 types of mangoes. He calls it <em>Al Muquaraar</em>, or The Resolute.</p>\n<p>“This miracle tree is not just a tree, it’s an orchard by itself, a universe,” says Khan.</p>\n<p>I ask Khan how he protects the tree from birds and insects. “I don’t scare them away,” he says. “Nature’s bounty is for everyone to share.” Khan and his son pack the farm’s produce in crates during harvest season to sell and export, but they give the fruits of the miracle tree away free to visitors who come to see it.</p>\n<p>“Just like two children of the same parents are different in their traits and qualities, mangoes that germinate from the same seed can be totally different,” says Khan, who waxes eloquent about each variety of mango, as if it were a favorite child. In addition to grafting, he breeds new mango varieties, experimenting with taste and texture and, often, creative names. He has named new mangoes after Prime Minister Narendra Modi (Namo Aam) and Bollywood actor Aishwarya Rai. “I created one after the famous cricketer Sachin Tendulkar, and he made a phone call to convey his happiness and thanks,” says Khan. Most recently he named two new mangoes “doctor aam” and “police aam” in thanks of first responders’ work during the pandemic.</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81643/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>Khan has had celebrity visitors to the farm and won numerous awards, including the Padma Shri, one of India’s highest civilian awards, and records in the Limca Book of Records. He has visited Dubai and Iran to teach the art of grafting, and in 1999, he created a mango tree with more than 54 varieties for the Mughal Gardens attached to the Rastrapathi Bhavan, the official residence of the President of India.</p>\n<p>The acclaim is not universal. “It’s only art and of no commercial value,” says D.K. Sharma, the Vice President of the Mango Grower Association of India, who criticizes Khan’s showpiece as cosmetic and not benefiting growers. Khan disagrees, pointing out that grafting is incredibly common in the commercial production of fruits and nuts, since farmers and growers want consistency rather than the variability of growing from seed. He sees it as an art with practical value.</p>\n<p>“I want to live on even after my death, through the mangoes I have grown. I hope that people will eat the fruits of my labor and benefit in some way,” says Khan. “That is the beauty of nature. It keeps on giving.”</p>\n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 06 Apr 2021 18:08:00 +0000","feedId":51,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"0545cb76a8b87a0978e8b347d3703343","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Kalpana Sunder","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81641/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn93@2020_1/2021/04/07/17-38-07-490_bbe6c52d9360f5fd.webp","https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81642/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx23/cdn55@2020_4/2021/04/07/17-38-07-633_3c054cb27a02d49b.webp","https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81643/image.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx4/cdn80@2020_5/2021/04/07/17-38-07-907_92ecf9a169b80fdf.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1617817087194},{"createdTime":"2021-04-08 01:38:07","updatedTime":"2021-04-08 01:38:07","title":"Bowler Hat Sculpture  in Dallas, Texas","link":"https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bowler-hat-sculpture","description":"\n        <p><img alt=\"Dallas Bowler Hat.\" data-width=\"3264\" data-height=\"2448\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/media/W1siZiIsInVwbG9hZHMvcGxhY2VfaW1hZ2VzLzRhNDMzN2RlLTIyM2UtNGJjOS1hYzNiLWQzYzk5OTBmMjI2ZDRkYjE0MzcxZDViMGFhMmJkMV9JTUdfNDY2Mi5KUEciXSxbInAiLCJjb252ZXJ0IiwiLWF1dG8tb3JpZW50ICJdLFsicCIsInRodW1iIiwiMzA4MHgyMDUzKzArMTczIl0sWyJwIiwiY29udmVydCIsIi1xdWFsaXR5IDgxIC1hdXRvLW9yaWVudCJdLFsicCIsInRodW1iIiwiMzAweDIwMCMiXV0/IMG_4662.JPG\" /></p> <p>Feeling dapper?

It was formed in a valley dotted with small volcanoes, when rising magma deep below the Earth’s surface came into contact with groundwater. Lava and water don’t mix—they explode. The resulting detonation obliterated the surrounding forest and left a circular, low-rimmed volcanic crater, called a maar, about 3,000 feet across and more than 600 feet deep.</p>\n<p>The prehistoric rains gradually filled in the hole, forming a lake. Eventually, the subtropical forest grew back, and year after year the trees dropped their leaves and flowers into its still waters. Microscopic algae called diatoms bloomed each spring and died at the end of summer, forming a fine, pale blanket on the lake bottom. In the autumn and winter, a darker layer of decaying plant matter and algal spores settled on top. Together, those alternating seasonal layers formed a barcode-like pattern in the stripy diatomite, recording each year of the maar’s long life.</p>\n<p>Embalmed among the diatoms were the remains of other plants and animals that lived in or fell into the lake. In its depths, the enclosed, anoxic conditions kept every detail perfectly preserved: spiders, orchids, fruit, delicate flowers still dusted with pollen, and freshwater fish with their mouths gaping open.</p>\n<p>Today, Foulden Maar, as it came to be known, is an unremarkable rectangle of heaped white earth located in the middle of a sheep pasture in the Strath Taieri, a broad river valley studded with rock outcrops in New Zealand’s far south. The Earth is now nine to 10 degrees Fahrenheit cooler than it was when the maar was formed, and the nearby mountains are shrouded in snow in winter, the dry fields bare of trees. And despite the riches lying beneath, Foulden Maar is currently off limits to scientists, the result of a protracted dispute with a company that wanted to mine the entire site for diatomite.</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81648/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>Starting in the early 2000s, geologists and miners had cooperated, allowing extraction to occur alongside scientific discovery. The fossils that were uncovered revealed an entire ecosystem of new species, and the diatomite layers provided a valuable high-resolution record of climate change during a time when the Antarctic ice sheets were rapidly melting. Scientists are still trying to unravel the causes of that deglaciation, as it may help to model Earth’s future.</p>\n<p>The annual layers preserved in Foulden Maar form the only record that can “document this time period on human timescales—over periods of seasons to centuries,” says Beth Fox, a paleoclimatologist at the University of Huddersfield in the <a class=\"destination-link article-destination-link\" title=\"Things to do in United Kingdom\" href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/united-kingdom\" data-destination-link-kind=\"article\" data-geo-id=\"4441\" data-title=\"United Kingdom\" data-slug=\"united-kingdom\">United Kingdom</a>, who did her doctoral studies at Foulden Maar. “The scientific value of this deposit is very high.”</p>\n<p>A new mining company, Plaman Resources, bought Foulden Maar in 2015. When Plaman’s ambitious plans for the site were revealed a few years later, researchers worried the fossils would all be crushed to dust, and it seemed the cooperative relationship between science and mining would end too. But New Zealanders rallied behind the fossils, and while Foulden Maar’s fate is still uncertain, it appears that public resistance may have saved the site for science.</p>\n<hr class=\"baseline-grid-hr\" />\n<p>Diatomite is globally abundant and is <a href=\"https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2021/mcs2021-diatomite.pdf\">mined extensively</a> in more than 20 countries. Its presence in the area around Foulden Maar was first described in 1875 by the geologist and naturalist Frederick Hutton, who called it “polishing powder.” Small-scale mining at the site began during World War II. Since then, the diatomite has been extracted, crushed into a substance more commonly known as diatomaceous earth, and used, variously, for polishing metals, filtering sugar, as insulation, for filtering beer and wine, as a cement and paint additive, as a mild abrasive, for making soaps, toothpaste, and <a href=\"https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/ESD19410822.2.19\">face powder</a>, and as an organic pesticide and fertilizer.</p>\n<p>The diatomite at Foulden Maar—and the fossils embedded within it—didn’t initially make much of an impression on Daphne Lee, a geologist at the nearby University of Otago in <a class=\"destination-link article-destination-link\" title=\"Things to do in Dunedin, New Zealand\" href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/dunedin-new-zealand\" data-destination-link-kind=\"article\" data-geo-id=\"1319\" data-title=\"Dunedin, New Zealand\" data-slug=\"dunedin-new-zealand\">Dunedin</a>. Now 70, she first visited the site as an undergraduate student in the late 1960s or early 70s. In the 90s, she went again and collected a few crumbly leaf fossils. But no one recognized the site’s broader significance until 2003, when Lee was organizing a field trip for some visiting geologists.</p>\n<p>One day she and some colleagues arrived for reconnaissance, and the miners working there had just opened up a 15-foot cliff face with a mechanical digger. One of Lee’s colleagues noticed the barcode-like layers of the algal blooms and realized the potential for climate research. The delineations between one year and the next would allow scientists to track changing conditions on an annual basis—a very unusual level of detail. As they poked around in the freshly exposed diatomite, Lee’s group found a few fossil leaves, pristine and perfect.</p>\n<p>“It was really a lightbulb moment,” Lee says. “This place has got both fantastic preservation of leaves and this climate record.”</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81645/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>Jennifer Bannister, a fossil preparator at the university, mounted the 23-million-year-old leaves on slides. She did the same with some leaves from related species she picked in the botanical gardens, and they looked so similar that at first glance Lee had trouble telling the fresh and fossil specimens apart. The airless conditions had preserved the ancient veins, pores, and even some of the leaves’ chemistry.</p>\n<p>In the early days, relations between the scientists and the miners were collegial. Alan Walker was the managing director of Featherston Resources, the mining company working the site back then. Walker, a former geologist himself, was intrigued by the finds. He was especially interested in the possibilities of the climate record. As the company explored the site, Walker alerted Lee’s team every time a new face was opened up. Without mining, Lee says, geologists would never have known about Foulden Maar’s riches at all. To show her appreciation, she even named a new species—a fossil fern—after Walker. (“I was really chuffed,” he says.)</p>\n<p>A decade of discoveries and dozens of scientific papers followed. Lee and her colleagues received a series of prestigious grants that enabled them to spend a few stormy winter weeks in 2009 drilling a core 600 feet into the deposit below the snow-covered pasture. The diatomite layers continued for nearly 400 feet before giving way to volcanic rubble.</p>\n<p>The core gave the scientists a continuous, high-resolution 120,000-year sequence of climate data from an epoch whose warmer temperatures provide a glimpse of what could be in store over the coming centuries. It also contained perfectly pickled leaves. By testing their chemistry and examining their pores under a microscope, one of Lee’s doctoral students, Tammo Reichgelt, was able to <a href=\"https://eos.org/articles/ancient-pickled-leaves-give-a-glimpse-of-global-greening\">show</a> that over the millennia preserved in the core, atmospheric carbon dioxide increased dramatically, then fell to levels similar to those predicted for later this century.</p>\n<p>Reichgelt’s analysis of the leaves revealed that as CO2 levels increased, some plants could harvest that carbon more efficiently for photosynthesis, leading to increased growth and more tolerance for drought. That is not necessarily good news, though—Reichgelt says some <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0253-3.epdf?referrer_access_token=U9I9ylghWQszPPMsbuOs5tRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0O5J0oP_LhVUOgym62AyF5ghuOS5aOCa4g0Agd33biHRPVvzshteII8s6f0432vmaDtwx28IbA_1rUF6bUFrcpPQmlkW8yIrssI3hK9jpJ8kZzTEIuIQmPgiyqj0FPn0ncunCPKX2u6ikr5IkKTJfRKB6Nk_AJt0lw9Z701SZMl9BwrSre6lOjBS9yodCaoCZb27oS0b16hW-aotQByRPF9Q5WAUeDWZwmZqFd6sg34DavohtVDVExWGF3wNLJFM0pqwjzXG9ULrw7uEV5geLZT&#38;tracking_referrer=www.theguardian.com\">studies indicate that</a> while higher atmospheric CO2 might increase yields, the crops are less dense in nutrients, and any increased carbon storage will be still be far outpaced by fossil fuel emissions and deforestation.</p>\n<figure class=\"article-pullquote-container\">\n<aside class=\"article-pullquote\">\n<blockquote class=\"article-pullquote-content\">Without mining, Lee says, geologists would never have known about Foulden Maar’s riches at all.</blockquote>\n</aside>\n</figure>\n<p>The site’s fossils are globally significant, too. Only a handful of fossil orchids have ever been found, anywhere; Lee’s team found two at Foulden Maar. Another of Lee’s doctoral students, Uwe Kaulfuss, had a knack for finding insects. “He really has X-ray eyes,” Lee says. Before Foulden Maar, about six insect fossils were known from the whole of New Zealand. So far, Kaulfuss has found 266 in this one pasture. Some still had eyes, and a few of the beetles retained the greenish-blue iridescence of their shells.</p>\n<p>The researchers also found fossilized bird poop, so Lee believes there are probably feathers and other bird remains waiting to be found—perhaps even those of the extinct <a href=\"https://thespinoff.co.nz/science/17-08-2019/the-giant-parrot-proves-we-have-to-save-foulden-maar/\">giant parrot</a> that was recently discovered at another fossil site an hour’s drive from Foulden Maar.</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81649/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>Fossil sites that preserve soft, delicate organisms like spiders and orchids are very rare globally. And because Foulden Maar provides a series of snapshots of an entire ecosystem, it’s what paleontologists call a “Konservat-Lagerstätte.” In German, “Lagerstätte” means “a sort of motherlode or bonanza” of fossils, says Paul Selden, an emeritus professor of geology at the University of Kansas, while “Konservat” means they are especially well preserved. Selden is an expert in both fossil ecosystems and fossil spiders, and he described the four new arachnid species Kaulfuss found at Foulden Maar. Spider fossils are extremely rare, “and when you do find one, it really is a bonanza,” he says. “Suddenly you’ve learned so much more.”</p>\n<p>In general, Selden says that “Konservat-Lagerstätten” can shed light on key moments in evolution—like <a class=\"destination-link article-destination-link\" title=\"Things to do in Canada\" href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/canada\" data-destination-link-kind=\"article\" data-geo-id=\"4458\" data-title=\"Canada\" data-slug=\"canada\">Canada</a>’s 500-million-year-old Burgess Shale, which helped scientists understand <a href=\"https://burgess-shale.rom.on.ca/en/science/origin/04-cambrian-explosion.php\">the sudden appearance of most modern life forms</a>, or <a class=\"destination-link article-destination-link\" title=\"Things to do in Germany\" href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/germany\" data-destination-link-kind=\"article\" data-geo-id=\"4486\" data-title=\"Germany\" data-slug=\"germany\">Germany</a>’s 48-million-year-old Messel Pit, with its insights into <a href=\"https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/720/\">the emergence of mammals</a>. Globally, Foulden Maar is one of just a handful of these bonanza sites dating from the Miocene Epoch, between 23.03 and 5.33 million years ago.</p>\n<hr class=\"baseline-grid-hr\" />\n<p>Shane Loader and Andrea Bosshard first learned about Foulden Maar one June day in 2018. The filmmaker couple had recently moved to an off-the-grid house on Bosshard’s parents’ land in the Strath Taieri, a 10-minute drive from the fossil site. That morning, the local newspaper included a picture of Daphne Lee on the front page under the headline <a href=\"https://www.odt.co.nz/business/miners-scientists-unlikely-allies\">“Miners, Scientists Unlikely Allies.”</a> The article reported that a multinational company, Plaman Resources, planned to mine diatomite from Foulden Maar, but that scientific access “has been assured.”</p>\n<p>Loader was unsettled: “You know if there’s a mine next door it’s going to impose on you.” So in between film editing, he started delving into company records. “I just wanted to know as much as I could,” he says.</p>\n<p>Plaman Resources was the brainchild of a pair of wealthy Australian investors, Peter Plakidis and Geordie Manolas. After Walker’s company Featherston Resources went under in 2014, Plaman applied for approval from New Zealand’s Overseas Investment Office (OIO) to buy all 100 acres of the existing Foulden Maar land. They finalized the deal in 2015 and bought Featherston’s existing mining permit as well.</p>\n<p>Plaman’s main shareholder was a Malaysian company, Iris Corporation, which was then part-owned by Felda, itself owned by the Malaysian government and one of the world’s largest palm oil producers. In 2014, Iris Corporation had <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2014/05/05/iris-in-jv-to-acquire-nz-mine/\">announced</a> plans to use Foulden Maar diatomite as a fertilizer additive for oil palm plantations.</p>\n<figure class=\"article-pullquote-container\">\n<aside class=\"article-pullquote\">\n<blockquote class=\"article-pullquote-content\">The fossils, the climate record—it was all set to be gobbled up in feed for chickens and pigs.</blockquote>\n</aside>\n</figure>\n<p>The link to palm oil was controversial in New Zealand because of the industry’s role in the destruction of Southeast Asian rainforests. In addition, as forest fires raged across <a class=\"destination-link article-destination-link\" title=\"Things to do in Indonesia\" href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/indonesia\" data-destination-link-kind=\"article\" data-geo-id=\"4492\" data-title=\"Indonesia\" data-slug=\"indonesia\">Indonesia</a> that year, many experts <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2019-09-palm-oil-indonesia-raging-forest.html\">blamed</a> the palm oil industry for draining and clearing peatlands in order to grow the crop, making them highly flammable in the process. After the controversy, Plaman Resources “went quiet,” Loader says. “For two years, they said nothing.”</p>\n<p>In an interview, Manolas, the Plaman co-founder and former chief financial officer, told Undark that the company had begun to explore other uses for diatomite. In 2018, Plaman announced that Foulden Maar contained 31 million metric tons of “globally rare black diatomite”—<a href=\"https://quarryingandminingmag.co.nz/mining-black-pearl/\">Black Pearl</a>, as it was branded. Plaman claimed that if used as an organic feed additive for livestock the product would reduce antibiotic usage, stimulate growth, and improve animals’ gastrointestinal health. Those claims were met with <a href=\"https://www.newsroom.co.nz/2019/05/17/588070?slug=fossil-dirt-nutrition-claims-under-doubt\">skepticism</a> by some animal nutritionists and lacked published scientific evidence. But Manolas says the company was conducting multiple trials with some impressive early results and was working toward peer-reviewed studies.</p>\n<p>Cutting the link with palm oil was a requirement of the investment bank Goldman Sachs, a subsidiary of which had provided a $20 million loan to Plaman, says Manolas. But pivoting from fertilizer to the larger animal feed market meant much more product was needed. The company scaled up its ambitions, putting in another application to the OIO. This time, Plaman asked for permission to remove Iris as a shareholder and to buy the thousand-acre farm surrounding the mine site. That would provide access to the entire diatomite deposit and make more room for mining infrastructure.</p>\n<hr class=\"baseline-grid-hr\" />\n<p>A document leaked to the Otago Daily Times the following year publicly <a href=\"https://www.odt.co.nz/business/leaked-report-sheds-light-mine-project\">revealed</a> the full extent of Plaman’s plans. The report had been confidentially prepared by Goldman Sachs and —Loader was quick to notice—was dismissive of local concerns about the project: “Management does not expect any social or community issues at Foulden Hill,” it read.</p>\n<p>But what caught the eye of Lee, the University of Otago geologist, was the diagram of the proposed mine. It depicted a giant pit encompassing the entire maar, which would apparently be flooded and “rehabilitated” as a “pit lake” in 2048. The fossils, the climate record—it was all set to be gobbled up in feed for chickens and pigs.</p>\n<p>“Until then, I did not really understand that the whole of the Foulden Maar deposit could actually be destroyed,” says Lee.</p>\n<p>Her university still had the 2009 core in storage, but it was slowly degrading. Foulden Maar might contain the answers to questions that scientists don’t even know they have yet, she says: “There's just so much more to discover.”</p>\n<p>Lee began giving media interviews and public talks about the scientific value of the site. Loader and Bosshard formed an activist group called “Save Foulden Maar,” and started a petition calling on the Overseas Investment Office to reject Plaman’s application to buy the surrounding land needed to make the project viable. New Zealand’s former prime minister Helen Clark <a href=\"https://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/clark-joins-opposition-middlemarch-mine-proposal\">weighed in</a> on the side of the scientists and local activists. The story became national news.</p>\n<figure class=\" contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/81650/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>The tide began to turn in May 2019. The New Zealand Minerals Forum—an annual industry meeting—was held in Dunedin, and became a focal point for <a href=\"https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/protesters-block-minerals-forum-in-dunedin/H7ZSB2OLAEGSU37UAEQ66KWNWU/\">protests</a> over both climate change and the plans for Foulden Maar. On the first day of the conference, protestors waving “Preserve Foulden Maar\" placards <a href=\"https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/police-use-bolt-cutters-remove-protesters-dunedin-coal-conference%20\">barricaded</a> the town hall building. The police made repeated attempts to remove them, and industry delegates spent hours trying to get inside the conference hall.</p>\n<p>When the delegates did finally enter, they were welcomed by Dunedin’s then-mayor, Dave Cull. Though he had initially supported the mining plans, Cull made it clear he had changed his mind, saying that the protestors expressed “<a href=\"https://www.newsroom.co.nz/the-un-welcome-speech-dunedins-mayor-gave-miners\">the overwhelming view of this community and my council</a>.” Later that day, Lee <a href=\"https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/better-business/113060254/battle-to-save-essential-foulden-maar-heats-up\">addressed the city council</a> and a packed public gallery, explaining the scientific importance of Foulden Maar. The council soon voted to recognize the site’s significance and support its preservation.</p>\n<p>On June 14, Cull <a href=\"https://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/council-now-formally-opposed-expansion-mine\">made a new submission</a> to the OIO saying that the sale of the land was at odds with the desire of the city to protect the maar.</p>\n<p>The following week, Plaman Resources declared itself insolvent and <a href=\"https://www.gazette.govt.nz/notice/id/2019-al2874\">began the process of liquidating</a> its assets. Manolas says the main reason was that the OIO process had dragged on too long. “Capital, it's got a timeline on it,” he says. “We just ran out of time.” (Goldman Sachs declined to comment for this article<em>,</em> and Iris did not respond to multiple requests for comment.)</p>\n<p>In November 2019, Dunedin’s new mayor, Aaron Hawkins, <a href=\"https://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/dunedin-council-wants-buy-foulden-maar\">announced</a> the city’s <a href=\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/402507/dunedin-council-takes-first-step-towards-buying-foulden-maar\">intention to buy Foulden Maar</a> from Plaman’s receivers — the people charged with winding down the troubled business and repaying its major creditor, the Goldman Sachs subsidiary.</p>\n<p>For Lee, Bosshard, and Loader, it felt like David had beaten Goliath. “Public pressure did what the legislation couldn’t,” Lee says.</p>\n<hr class=\"baseline-grid-hr\" />\n<p>But it’s not over yet.</p>\n<p>Lee looks out at Foulden Maar from the roadside through a windblown barbed-wire fence. It’s as close as she can now get.</p>\n<p>More than a year has passed since negotiations between the city council and Plaman’s receivers began, and <a href=\"https://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/dcc-tight-lipped-whether-it-will-buy-foulden-maar\">no deal has been reached</a>.</p>\n<p>While Plaman Resources, like the other companies, did allow scientists to access the site, in 2018 the company’s receiver, Neale Jackson of Calibre Partners, barred Lee, her students, and other scientists from visiting Foulden Maar, putting research and teaching on hold. Jackson declined to comment for this article.</p>\n<p>Despite the state of limbo, both conservationists and those in the industry are skeptical that mining at the scale Plaman proposed will ever be able to take place. “We would be in fierce opposition,” says Kimberley Collins, a science communicator who was part of the Save Foulden Maar campaign. Alan Walker—the retired miner Lee named a fossil after—agrees. From an industry perspective, he says, the intensity of public backlash could pose too great of a commercial risk.</p>\n<figure class=\"article-image-full-width contains-caption \"><img class=\"article-image with-structured-caption \" src=\"https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/lg/81646/image.jpg\" alt=\"article-image\" width=\"auto\" data-kind=\"article-image\" /></figure>\n<p>Compromise might have been possible, says Manolas, if the land sale had succeeded. Instead, New Zealand now looks less attractive to international investors, he says, and has missed out on incoming capital and an estimated 95 full-time jobs at the mine site alone. He says the diatomite looked set to make a real difference to global farming—and that the mining operation could have brought fossils to light that will now remain buried far beneath the surface, beyond the reach of geologists with university budgets.</p>\n<p>There is truth in that last point, Lee concedes, but says Plaman’s plans to mine the entire deposit in just a few decades would have forever prevented the scientists of the future from using new techniques and answering new questions at Foulden Maar.</p>\n<p>Lee and her colleagues now have a new vision for Foulden Maar’s future. The site could become a kind of geo-park, Lee says, a place for research, education, and controlled tourism: “Educationally, it’s probably one of the best possible sites for teaching about geology, paleontology, and climatology.” As she has done for years with her students and visiting scholars, Lee would like to take schoolchildren and community groups down this rugged farm track to the exposed mine site.</p>\n<p>They would crouch in the pale diatomite dust, she says, and pry its cardboard-like layers open with a knife. In five minutes, they’d find a fossil leaf. If they were there for an hour, they might find a delicate skeletal fish and still be able to make out the patterns on its skin.</p>\n      ","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Tue, 06 Apr
