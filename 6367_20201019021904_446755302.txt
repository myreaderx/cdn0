The distribution ships with several Internet applications, including web browser, IRC client, mail client and instant messenger. The distribution transfers Internet traffic through the Tor network to hide its origin. </p> \n<p>One of the project's latest releases was version 4.11. (At the time of writing 4.12 is about to be published, though without any significant new features.) Lately the project has mostly focused on bug fixes and minor tweaks, though Tails 4.11 introduces the option of persistent storage for some of the distribution's settings and data. Persistent storage is not enabled by default, but can be set up using tools included on the live media. </p> \n<p>Tails is available for 64-bit (x86_64) computers and its live media is approximately 1.2GB in size. The live media can be written to a DVD or USB thumb drive. There are separate files provided depending on whether we want to write the distribution to DVD or USB media, however I tested and confirmed the DVD image can be written to, and run from, a USB thumb drive if need be. </p> \n<p><b>Early impressions</b></p> \n<p>Booting from the Tails media brings up a welcome screen. This graphical interface offers to either start the desktop session or shutdown the operating system. On this welcome screen we can click buttons to bring up settings options that allow us to select our keyboard layout, language, and locale formats. At the bottom of the welcome window is a button which opens additional settings. These extra settings are security related and allow us to assign a password to the administrator account, enable/disable MAC address spoofing, set whether to allow the \"Unsafe Browser\" to run, and how to connect to the Tor network or to disable networking entirely. </p> \n<p><a href=\"https://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20201019#tails\"><img src=\"http://www.tuxmachines.org/files/read-on-white.png\" alt=\"Read more\" title=\"Read the rest of this article\" /></a></p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.tuxmachines.org/node/143373\" target=\"_blank\">read more</a></p>","descriptionType":"text/html","publishedDate":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 01:47:01 +0000","feedId":6367,"bgimg":"","linkMd5":"a22cc66a814c4734574c9f72425d8ed6","bgimgJsdelivr":"","metaImg":"","author":"Roy Schestowitz","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://tails.boum.org/index/city.svg":null,"http://www.tuxmachines.org/files/read-on-white.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn36@2020_3/2020/10/19/02-16-34-343_624a5707f48fd65b.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1603073793582}],"record":{"createdTime":"2020-10-19 10:16:33","updatedTime":"2020-10-19 10:16:33","feedId":6367,"fetchDate":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 02:16:33 +0000","fetchMs":584,"handleMs":24,"totalMs":151375,"newArticles":0,"totalArticles":30,"status":1,"type":0,"ip":"80d50a82a463017eede47e80eb3f5c35","hostName":"us-028*","requestId":"abd709c0af444d158f2f7a7816c712ad_6367","contentType":"application/rss+xml; charset=utf-8","totalBytes":994,"bgimgsTotal":0,"bgimgsGithubTotal":0,"articlesImgsTotal":2,"articlesImgsGithubTotal":1,"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx25":1},"failGithubMap":{}},"feed":{"createdTime":"2020-08-25 04:32:59","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 11:31:13","id":6367,"name":"Tux Machines","url":"http://www.tuxmachines.org/node/feed","subscriber":null,"website":null,"icon":"http://www.tuxmachines.org/files/whitejazz_favicon_0.ico","icon_jsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx61/cdn35@2020_3/2020/09/01/03-30-59-288_5c1d8ff7a9dd6f9b.ico","description":"Your source for Linux and Open Source news, reviews, and howtos.","weekly":null,"link":null},"noPictureArticleList":[{"createdTime":"2020-10-19 10:19:04","updatedTime":"2020-10-19 10:19:04","id":null,"feedId":6367,"linkMd5":"a22cc66a814c4734574c9f72425d8ed6"}],"tmpCommonImgCdnBytes":0,"tmpBodyImgCdnBytes":994,"tmpBgImgCdnBytes":0,"extra4":{"start":1603073792774,"total":0,"statList":[{"spend":784,"msg":"获取xml内容"},{"spend":24,"msg":"解释文章"},{"spend":0,"msg":"上传封面图到cdn"},{"spend":0,"msg":"修正封面图上传失败重新上传"},{"spend":150418,"msg":"正文链接上传到cdn"}]},"extra5":2,"extra6":1,"extra7ImgCdnFailResultVector":[null,null],"extra10_invalidATagHrefValue":{},"extra111_proxyServerAndStatMap":{"http://us-020.herokuapp.com/":{"failCount":1,"successCount":0,"resultList":[null]},"http://us-033.herokuapp.com/":{"failCount":1,"successCount":1,"resultList":[200,null]}},"extra12ImgCdnSuccessResultVector":[{"code":1,"isDone":false,"source":"http://www.tuxmachines.org/files/read-on-white.png","sourceStatusCode":200,"destWidth":95,"destHeight":21,"fixedGithubDest":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx25/cdn36@2020_3/2020/10/19/02-16-34-343_624a5707f48fd65b.webp","sourceBytes":3143,"destBytes":994,"targetWebpQuality":75,"feedId":6367,"totalSpendMs":1397,"convertSpendMs":6,"createdTime":"2020-10-19 10:16:33","host":"us-033*","referer":"http://www.tuxmachines.org/node/143373","linkMd5ListStr":"a22cc66a814c4734574c9f72425d8ed6","githubUser":"myreaderx25","githubHttpCode":201,"extra22GetBytesInfo":"1、没有Referer字段","extra23historyStatusCode":[200],"destSize":"994 B","compressRate":"31.6%","sourceSize":"3.1 KB"}],"successGithubMap":{"myreaderx25":1},"failGithubMap":{}}
