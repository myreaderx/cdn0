Part of being a <a href=\"https://www.monster.com/career-advice/article/teamwork-skills\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">team player</a> is pitching in and helping a colleague meet a crazy deadline, or taking on part of their workload when they need an extra hand. But that's supposed to be once in a while ‚Äî a favor, not a full-time job.</p><p>If you're constantly doing someone else's work, it can be difficult to fulfill your own responsibilities, produce high-quality work and go above and beyond. It could even be the difference between a promotion and staying stagnant.</p><p>And as helpful as you want to be, if your willingness to help turns into an everyday occurrence, you're&#160;<a href=\"https://www.monster.com/career-advice/article/being-taken-advantage-of-at-work-0517\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">being taken advantage of</a>. It may be time to say something. \"Follow the rule of three to make sure you're dealing with a pattern and not an incident,\" said Leigh Steere, cofounder of the Boulder-based management training tool Managing People Better. \"If it happens once, let it go; twice, make a mental note; three times, you have to deal with it,\"</p><p>Monster spoke to career experts to find out how to politely (but firmly)&#160;<a href=\"https://www.monster.com/career-advice/article/say-no-push-back-0717\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">push back</a> on the work your coworker tries to push off.</p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/michael-jordan-view-winning-great-advice-business-leaders-success-2020-5\">Michael Jordan was asked if his desire to win cost him a nice-guy reputation. His emotional response is being touted as one of the best quotes on leadership.</a></em></p><h2><strong>1. Just say no</strong></h2><p>It is possible that your colleague doesn't realize the pattern she has fallen into or how it impacts you. If you've helped her out dozens of times, it makes sense that your colleague keeps swinging by your desk at 5 p.m. with a \"huge favor to ask you.\"</p><p>\"Your communication and lack of assertiveness may be to blame. Retrain that colleague to know you are no longer doing two jobs,\" said Angelina Darrisaw, founder and CEO of the New York-based career coaching firm C-Suite Coach. \"This means being willing to <a href=\"https://www.monster.com/career-advice/article/How-to-Just-Say-No\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">say 'no'&#160;</a>and 'not right now.' If you notice that your coworker always comes to you for 'help' and 'help' turns into you doing their work, start pushing back.\"</p><p>Steele advocates for being more assertive by pointing out the issue and offering a solution. She recommends telling your colleague: \"I don't mind helping every once in awhile, but I'm noticing that you are asking me to help with things from your to-do list frequently. I have a full plate without taking on more, and I need to say no.\"</p><h2><strong>2. Give guidance, not time</strong></h2><p>It is normal to want to say yes when someone asks for your help, but instead of agreeing to take the entire project ‚Äî aka hours of work ‚Äî offer to help your lazy coworker in a less time-intensive capacity.</p><p>\"Hold a brief meeting where you offer suggestions and guidance. Give them a roadmap and let them run with it. If you want, you can suggest a follow-up meeting to review the work before they turn it in,\" said Darrisaw. \"Consulting your colleague is fine, but you shouldn't be always doing the work for them.\"</p><p><em><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/mailchimp-set-clear-goals-key-managing-remote-teams-2020-8\">Mailchimp's chief product officer says clarifying priorities should be your number one focus when managing a 100% remote team ‚Äî here's how to start setting clear, actionable goals</a></em></p><h2><strong>3. State the facts (and leave emotion out of it)</strong></h2><p>If the problem persists even after you've talked to your colleague once or twice, you should make your manager aware of the situation.</p><p>\"Be sure to include the impact on you, such as missed deadlines, extra hours, using team resources on unscheduled projects,\" said Nancy Halpern, a coach at the New York-based executive coaching firm KNH Associates. \"But be careful of your emotions: Don't let anger or whining influence how you present. Just stick to the facts and ask your boss' advice on what else you should do to resolve it.\"</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

But my first response when I was asked to take part in the trial was, \"Hell yes,\" because I wanted a chance to get some protection from the coronavirus as soon as possible.</p><p>My participation in the trial came about because a couple of years ago I did a medical trial for an anthrax vaccine with a company called <a href=\"https://www.benchmarkresearch.net/\">Benchmark Research</a> when I was broke. I'd completely forgotten about it, but they called me in May to say that the study was over and that I'd been given the placebo.</p><p>The doctor on the phone told me that they were finalizing an agreement for an urgent trial of a vaccine for \"you know what.\" They couldn't release information at that time, but they needed to quickly vet and enroll 30,000 subjects across multiple sites in the United States.&#160;</p><p>I jumped at it.

Coming from a country with universal healthcare, an American hospital bill terrifies me as much as contracting the virus itself.</p><h2>The science behind the vaccine is interesting.</h2><p>The Moderna vaccine isn't a live virus, but <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/05/moderna-coronavirus-vaccine-how-it-works-cvd/#:~:text=Moderna's%20messenger%20RNA%20(mRNA)%20vaccine,it%20can%20establish%20an%20infection.\">replicates a similar immune response</a> in our bodies. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA), which is a molecule that instructs our bodies to make coronavirus spike proteins as though they'd been infected. In time, this produces antibodies in our system that look like the ones produced by people who've had the virus.</p><p>The aim of the trial is to determine whether the vaccine prevents people from catching COVID-19 or lessens the severity for people who do. The vaccine moved from the lab to human trials in a record 63 days. Early trials showed it was safe for human use, and that there were indications that it produced neutralizing antibodies in some of the patients.&#160;</p><p>I wasn't concerned about receiving an experimental drug. I knew that scientists had been researching this type of virus since the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/the-mysterious-disappearance-of-the-first-sars-virus-and-why-we-need-a-vaccine-for-the-current-one-but-didnt-for-the-other-137583\">SARS outbreak in 2002</a>, and had <a href=\"https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2020/feb/22/by-decoding-the-coronavirus-genome-scientists-seek/\">decoded the COVID-19 genome</a> in January. In spite of political and market pressure, I can't see pharmaceutical companies blowing up their reputations by pushing forward with a vaccine that's dangerous to humans.</p><h2>The medical trial process is quite strict.</h2><p>Before I got the jab, I had to go through a lot of checks to make sure I was in good health for an experimental (at this stage) treatment.

I had a 50/50 chance of getting the vaccine.&#160;<p>All told, the first vaccine process took three hours, and they paid me $150 for my time. Each day for the first week after the shot I had to fill out a check-up form on an app, measuring temperature and rating different symptoms, before receiving a phone call from the doctor at the end of each week to see if I was okay. If you do fall sick, they said they take care of you at their medical facility, but I haven't needed that.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f7e2c0cc655f6001969ece4?format=jpeg\" alt=\"The app Elle Hardy uses to check in during the vaccine trial\" height=\"1711\" width=\"828\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>The app Hardy uses to check in during the vaccine trial.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Elle Hardy</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><h2>The side effects were a little unpleasant, but nowhere near as bad as they could be getting COVID-19.</h2><p>I didn't feel 100% for a few days after the first shot. It felt like that day or two when you're on the cusp of getting the flu, but it didn't interfere with my work or life. My upper left arm where the shot was put into was swollen and incredibly sore for days. I couldn't lie on it or even pick up a cup of coffee with that hand. I had a similar reaction to the MMR vaccine in high school, so I began to think that I'd definitely received the mRNA shot and not the placebo.</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f7cb97c282c500018c78eed?format=jpeg\" alt=\"medical coronavirus flu virus covid19 hospital doctor nurse tools stethoscope blood pressure pills vitamins medicine pharmacy pharmaceutical lab vaccine cox 25\" height=\"1666\" width=\"2222\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>&#34;I had a similar reaction to the MMR vaccine in high school, so I began to think that I&#39;d definitely received the mRNA shot and not the placebo.&#34;\n<p class=\"copyright\">Crystal Cox/Business Insider</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>After about four days, all of the symptoms disappeared. The booster shot 28 days later had similar effects, but they went away more quickly, within about 48 hours.</p><p>My curiosity got the better of me, and I decided to get an antibody test to see if my suspicions were correct. I'd had one earlier in the summer and it came back negative. This time, it came back positive. Of course, I can't be certain that it was from the vaccine, but I haven't had any COVID-19 symptoms and neither has anyone in my social bubble.</p><h2>It's good news, but I'm not changing the way I act.</h2><p>I was thrilled to know that I have antibodies, but I'm still taking all of the usual precautions, especially around wearing a mask and avoiding unventilated spaces. It's just a basic decency to be considerate to others around you.&#160;</p><p>Furthermore, the presence of antibodies doesn't mean that you're bulletproof ‚Äî the whole point of the vaccine trial is to figure out whether the shot works to prevent the coronavirus. Plus, antibodies may recede over time or not be an absolute barrier to infection. Still, it's given me hope that there's an end in sight for all of us.</p><p>My concern is that some media outlets will sensationalize any problems with the vaccine, such as what we saw in England recently when a subject in the Oxford vaccine trial became ill and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/12/oxford-university-resumes-covid-19-vaccine-trials\">trial was briefly paused</a>. People should be informed, but I suspect that any stories to do with vaccine timing will get a lot of clicks, and we live in a time where misinformation spreads as fast as coronavirus.</p><h2>I hope that my experience gives people hope that we can get through this.</h2><p>There's research that indicates that <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/poll-third-of-americans-wont-take-a-coronavirus-vaccine-2020-9\">one third of Americans</a> don't want to take the vaccine. I've had friends who aren't anti-vaxxers tell me this ‚Äî they're concerned that a cure is being rushed out to help with the election or get people back to work.</p><p>What worries me more than any side effects of the vaccine is that, given how much more we know about the virus and the ways it spreads now, we still aren't being particularly targeted and effective when it comes to testing and tracing.&#160;</p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5e94c9f9c023200c2f766295?format=jpeg\" alt=\"Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel\" height=\"1500\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel attends a meeting with President Donald Trump, members of the Coronavirus Task Force, and pharmaceutical executives in the Cabinet Room of the White House on March 2, 2020.\n<p class=\"copyright\">Andrew Harnik/AP Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Nor have the best ways to stay safe been well communicated.

We can only hope that governments and agencies can come together to administer the vaccine quickly and give people the confidence to get the shot when it comes ‚Äî which may be widely available <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/10/01/health/moderna-coronavirus-vaccine-bancel-bn/index.html\">as soon as March 2021</a>, according to the Moderna CEO.</p><p><em>This article was originally published on Business Insider October 13, 2020.

Even worse, you may end up putting yourself in debt.</p><p>For instance, if you work 60 hours per week, that means you won't have as much downtime. That means you're going to sacrifice quality time with your nearest and dearest. You may even be putting your health and well-being in jeopardy.</p><p>In short,&#160;<a href=\"https://www.calendar.com/blog/how-to-create-a-time-budget-and-stick-to-it/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener nofollow sponsored\">a time budget</a>&#160;as defined by Amanda Abella in a Calendar article is \"a guideline that helps you spend your time the way you want to spend it.\" Obviously, this also includes the things that you aren't crazy about doing. But, the concept is that having a time budget will make it manage your time wisely and with more intention.</p><p>To get started, determine what matters to you in life. Often, this would be your relationships, health, and career. Knowing this, you would spend your workweek only on activities that push you closer to your goals. And during your downtime, you would work out or spend time with your family.</p><p>How can you stick to your budget? A calendar app and boundaries are important because if you have an activity scheduled, it makes it easier to enforce boundaries.</p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/8-ways-to-make-yourself-job-indispensable-post-covid-19-2020-5\">8 ways to make yourself indispensable at work during COVID-19, according to an executive coach</a></em></p><h2>2. You're looking for control</h2><p>\"When we say that someone 'has more time' than someone else, we do not mean that she has literally a twenty-fifth hour in her day,\"&#160;<a href=\"https://press.uchicago.edu/books/excerpt/2015/Wajcman_Pressed_for_Time.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">noted</a> Robert E. Goodin in \"Discretionary Time: A New Measure of Freedom.\" \"Rather, we mean to say that she has fewer constraints and more choices in how she can choose to spend her time. She has more 'autonomous control' over her time,\" he explained.&#160;</p><p>Why's this the case? Psychologist and behavioral scientist Susan Weinschenk believes it's because <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/brain-wise/201301/why-having-choices-makes-us-feel-powerful\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">\"we equate having choices with having control.\"</a></p><p>\"Our survival instincts tell us that we'll survive if we have control,\" clarified Weinschenk. \"So it's our powerful unconscious that keeps us seeking control, and it's the desire for control that keeps us seeking choices.\"</p><h2>3. You believe in the myth of multitasking</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.calendar.com/blog/the-myth-of-multitasking/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">When I talk about multitasking</a>, I'm not referring to mindless or mundane tasks that are taking place in the background. For example, you can fold your laundry or wash dishes while listening to a podcast. Another example would be going for a walk while talking on the phone.</p><p>Instead, the type of multitasking I'm referring to here tasks that require your complete attention. Case in point, it's not effective to work on your taxes while simultaneously writing tomorrow's meeting agenda. The reason for this is because the brain is set up to handle only one thing at a time.</p><p>It's also been found that multitasking can slow you down, and&#160;because you're more likely to make mistakes, multitasking can take you longer to complete tasks.</p><p>The solution? It's pretty simple, actually. Do one thing at a time, aka single-tasking.</p><h2>4. Fueling conflicts, not passion</h2><p>Research shows that those who are passionate and doing activities that matter aren't as rushed and harried. The reason? It prevents inner conflicts.</p><p>\"Employees lacking in passion said that their goals were competing with each other, fighting for time and attention,\" explained Kira M. Newman, managing editor of <a href=\"https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/why_you_never_seem_to_have_enough_time\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Greater Good</a>. However, passionate employees were different, viewing their goals as supporting each other.&#160;</p><p>\"Time pressure isn't just about how enjoyable our activities are, but also how well they fit together in our heads,\" added Newman.&#160;</p><p>How can you resolve this in your own life? Well, there's no right or wrong way. But, you should definitely let go of the \"have it all mentality.\" Instead, schedule your priorities and activities that you enjoy and find fulfilling.</p><p>If you still feel overwhelmed,&#160;<a href=\"https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/jennifer-aaker-why-we-pay-save-time\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Stanford GSB professor Jennifer Aaker&#160;</a>and her team found that there are two simple interventions that can help. The first is \"to breathe so that each complete breath (inhale plus exhale) lasts 11 counts.\" The second was reappraising anxiety as excitement, like saying \"I am excited!\"</p><h2>5. You aren't heading for the hills</h2><p>Have you ever run a marathon? If so, you definitely had to do some training, and you may have used something called the Fartlek approach.</p><p>It's a Swedish term that means \"speed play.\" It's a type of interval training where you alternate between fast segments and slow jogs in order to improve your speed and endurance. But, it's also recommended that you&#160;<a href=\"https://www.runnersworld.com/advanced/a20823905/maximize-your-training-time/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">add hills to your run</a>.</p><p>What does this have to do with&#160;<a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/time-management\" data-ga-category=\"autotag-linking\" data-ga-label=\"ent-tags\" data-ga-action=\"/topic/time-management\">time management</a>? Well, just like increasing your speed and strength, you also need to challenge yourself. For example,&#160;<a href=\"https://www.calendar.com/blog/learn-how-to-concentrate-your-focus/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">learning how to concentrate your focus</a>&#160;of block out distractions. Both require discipline, practice, and a balance between sprints and breaks.</p><p>Of course, don't just attack these hills. Gradually work your way up. After all, you don't want to burn yourself out before entering the race, right?</p><p><em><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tips-help-small-business-owners-entrepreneurs-have-good-mental-health\">7 ways entrepreneurs and business owners can better manage their mental health and wellbeing</a></em></p><h2>6. Ask if you'd do it tomorrow</h2><p>Have you read Laura Vanderkam's time management book \"Juliet's School of Possibilities\"? If not, you should. It's a solid read full of excellent advice. But, this is probably my favorite nugget of wisdom: The lead character informs a young consultant, Riley, that she only says \"yes\" to what she wants to do. \"Most people, however, have a very vague sense of opportunity cost,\" <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90317324/how-to-feel-like-you-have-enough-time\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">wrote</a>&#160;Vanderkam. \"When someone asks you to do something far in the future, you might look at your calendar and see that it seems pretty open.\"</p><p>But, she adds, this is actually a fallacy. The reason? Your future self is going to be just as busy as you currently are. \"You'll feel just as swamped, only now you'll also have this other commitment competing for your time and energy (that you didn't want to do in the first place).\"</p><p>He suggests that you should ask yourself whether you'd be willing to do something tomorrow, knowing how busy you are now. If the answer is yes, then say yes.&#160;And&#160;if the answer is no, well, \"that's the best response for the future too. When you're more judicious with your 'yes,' you can free up all kinds of space.\"</p><h2>7. You're focused too much on the money</h2><p>You obviously need money to survive. And&#160;you kind of need it to engage in hobbies. At the same time,&#160;<a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1694704\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">research</a>&#160;from Sanford DeVoe of the University of Toronto and Jeffrey Pfeffer of Stanford found that those with higher-incomes feel more time-crunched.</p><p>As explained in&#160;<a href=\"https://www.economist.com/christmas-specials/2014/12/20/why-is-everyone-so-busy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">The Economist</a>; \"Once hours are financially quantified, people worry more about wasting, saving, or using them profitably. When economies grow and incomes rise, everyone's time becomes more valuable. And the more valuable something becomes, the scarcer it seems.\"</p><p>Moreover, DeVoe and Pfeffer found that just the perception of affluence can make you feel like you don't have enough time. So, while you should certainly make a comfortable living, you also don't need to be obsessed about it.</p><h2>8. Being busy is a status symbol</h2><p>Via&#160;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Overwhelmed-Work-Love-Play-When/dp/0374228442\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Overwhelmed: Work, Love, and Play When No One Has the Time</a>: \"Psychologists write of treating burned-out clients who can't shake the notion that the busier you are, the more you are thought of as competent, smart, successful, admired, and even envied.\"</p><p>The fix here is to&#160;<a href=\"https://www.calendar.com/blog/stop-worrying-about-being-productive/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">stop worrying about being productive</a>&#160;24/7. For some, that may be a strange concept. But, the fact is that you don't need to maximize every moment of your day.</p><p>Instead, spend your valuable time on the people and projects that matter. Additionally, avoid falling into the busyness trap and just enjoy yourself. Remember, life is too short to work around the clock. Sometimes you just need to slow down and have a little fun.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a

But imagine jumping off something even higher, like the International Space Station.</p><p>Unless you have a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/the-iron-man-suit-missing-and-its-worth-320000-2018-5\">supersuit</a> like Tony Stark, it's not gonna end well. But let's pretend Iron Man lends you one.</p><p>Ok, ready? 3 ‚Ä¶ 2 ‚Ä¶ 1 ‚Ä¶ Jump! Wait ‚Ä¶ what?</p><p>That's right, you wouldn't fall straight down. In fact, it'll take you at least 2.5 years before you reach the surface. So what's going on?</p><p>Height isn't the main reason your fall takes so long. In fact, if you fell like a normal <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/luke-aikins-skydived-without-a-parachute-net-california-2016-8\">skydiver</a>, it would only take about 2 hours.</p><p>But the thing is, you don't fall straight down. You fall into orbit. The reason is speed. You see, the <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/solar-eclipse-space-station-nasa-photos-video-2017-8\">ISS</a> might be called a station, but it's hardly stationary.&#160; It's actually moving 12 times faster than a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/fighter-jets-us-air-force-2018-4\">jet fighter</a>.</p><p>If you shot anything at that speed on Earth, by the time it was about to hit the ground, it would miss! In the same way, the ISS isn't floating in space, it's falling towards Earth and missing!</p><p>And when you jump off the ISS, you're initially moving at that same speed. So you end up in orbit, too ‚Äî at least for a while.</p><p>Now, even though it's so high up, the ISS is pushing through a very thin atmosphere. And that friction slows it down. So the station fires engines to maintain speed and keep from crashing into the Earth.</p><p>But sadly your supersuit doesn't come with engines strapped to your feet. This has two consequences:</p><p>First, it means you can't maneuver and have to hope that any of those 13,000 chunks of <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/space-debris-around-earth-2016-1\">space debris</a> don't impale you. Second, without rockets to maintain your speed, you'll slow down and spiral toward Earth.</p><p>But it won't be quick. The Chinese space station <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/chinese-space-station-crash-tiangong-1-south-pacific-2018-4\">Tiangong 1</a>, for example, about 2 years to fall out of orbit. On the ISS, you're higher up, so you'll take roughly 2.5 years. But once you strike the atmosphere, your long wait is over. And it's go time.</p><p>As you re-enter, you have one goal: slow down. You're traveling at hypersonic speeds. So, if you deployed a parachute now, it'll shred to pieces.</p><p>And that's not the only problem. Falling through the atmosphere at such break-neck speeds generates a lot of pressure on your suit ‚Äî at least 8Gs of force ‚Äî that's 8 times the gravity you feel at sea level.</p><p>And if you're falling feet first, that'll push the blood away from your brain and toward your feet. So you'll probably pass out unless you're one of those fighter pilots who train to withstand up to 5Gs.</p><p>Now, if you don't pass out, you may worry about the freezing temperatures up here.&#160; But, it turns out, your suit's more likely to melt than freeze. You know how you can warm your hands by rubbing them together?</p><p>Now imagine your supersuit rubbing against air molecules in the atmosphere at least 6 times the speed of sound. You'll heat up to about 1,650 ¬∫C ‚Äî hot enough to melt iron!</p><p>In fact, the heat is so intense, it strips electrons from their atoms forming a pink plasma around you that will ultimately destroy suit.</p><p>If that's not enough of a problem, the drag will rip off your limbs. But thankfully, Tony Stark has your back, and somehow, your supersuit holds with you intact.</p><p>At 41 km up you've now reached the world record for highest skydive. In 2014, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/alan-eustace-highest-altitude-jump-world-record-2014-10\">Alan Eustace</a> wore a pressurized space suit as he rode a balloon up to this height. He broke the sound barrier on his way down before deploying his parachute and landed about 15 minutes after the drop.</p><p>But you'll be falling much faster than Eustace ‚Äî about 3 times the speed of sound. So, in reality, you're not going to slow down enough to safely deploy your chute. That's where Iron Man can help us one last time. By 1 km up you've reached the territory of ordinary skydivers who don't need fancy suits to survive.</p><p>And at this point, your parachute can do its thing.&#160; And it's finally time to land softly.</p><p>Whew, what a ride! What sort of daring feat would you want us to try next? Let us know in the comments below. And thanks for watching.</p><p>A special thanks to <a href=\"https://wmich.edu/mechanical-aerospace/directory/brueshaber\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Shawn R Brueshaber</a>&#160;at Western

Growing up in a predominately white suburban town, I had yet to add the term \"person of color\" to my vocabulary.</p><p>I had yet to realize that I, a daughter of Korean-American immigrants, belong in such a group ‚Äì it would take me another seven years to finally realize that Asian Americans are, indeed, considered people of color. Nonetheless, even as a na√≠ve teenager, I could still recognize the magnitude of President Obama's achievement.</p><p>Not only was I one of the few Asian Americans in my K-12 school, I was also the only kid with a physical disability in my classes. I have <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/cp/facts.html\">cerebral palsy</a>, which affects my speech and mobility; I've used a wheelchair for most of my life. So, I truly resonated with the significance of then-newly elected President Obama being in a position where no one who looked like him had been before.</p><p>However, it would take another 12 years for me to feel seen by the highest office in the land. On November 7, President-elect <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/joe-biden-disability-advocates-express-joy_n_5fa83941c5b66009569bb896\">Joe Biden mentioned the word \"disability\"</a> in his victory speech, which was only the second time in modern history (with available transcripts of election night speeches) that a president or president-elect has acknowledged this community specifically in a victory speech (apart from President Obama in both <a href=\"https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/presidential-speeches/november-4-2008-remarks-election-night\">2008</a> and <a href=\"https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/presidential-speeches/november-6-2012-2012-election-night-victory-speech\">2012</a>):</p><p><em>\"We must make the promise of the country real for everybody, no matter their race, their ethnicity, their faith, their identity, or their disability.\"</em></p><p>Even <a href=\"https://twitter.com/i/status/1325279155521527808\">CNN host Jake Tapper acknowledged</a> Biden's inclusion of the word. But this moment did not come easily or quickly, and credit is due to all the people on the ground who made it happen.</p><h2>It's been a hard four years for the disability community</h2><p>In 2016, like millions of others, I watched as President Donald Trump won the presidency. I was an aspiring journalist at that time, and after <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/trump-s-worst-offense-mocking-disabled-reporter-poll-finds-n627736\">witnessing Trump openly mock</a> a broadcast reporter with a disability, my outlook on the four years to come was grim.</p><p>Nevertheless, I forged ahead ‚Äì I completed my master's program at Columbia Journalism School and never looked back. In my nearly three years of being a diversity and inclusion journalist, I experienced firsthand the vast underrepresentation of the disability community both in media and inside the industry itself. And I've made it my lifelong goal to amplify their voices through my work.</p><p>People with disabilities constitute the nation's largest minority group, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/infographic-disability-impacts-all.html\">making up nearly 26%</a> ‚Äì or 61 million ‚Äì Americans ages 18 and older. And unlike any other minority group, disability transcends across all identities: gender, race, socioeconomic class, religion, nationality, and sexuality. So, every issue and policy affects people with disabilities often to greater extents than other minority groups. Especially in 2020, the problems at center stage are disproportionately affecting people with disabilities: from<a href=\"https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/politics/524973-regardless-of-party-the-next-congress-must-prioritize-disability\"> healthcare</a> to<a href=\"https://news.vanderbilt.edu/2020/11/04/new-research-documents-how-covid-19-multiplies-stress-and-trauma-for-people-with-disabilities/\"> coronavirus</a> to<a href=\"https://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/2020/11/covid-19-amplifies-challenges-for-those-with-disabilities-chronic-illnesses\"> access to education</a> and<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewpulrang/2020/10/30/10-questions-disabled-americans-should-ask-themselves-before-voting/?sh=7bae5c393419\"> unemployment</a>.</p><p>Frustrated with the lack of representation, disability rights advocates Gregg Beratan, Andrew Pulrang, and Alice Wong founded the <a href=\"http://cripthevote.blogspot.com/\">#CripTheVote</a> social media movement. The movement aims to activate and engage disabled people on policies and practices essential to the disability community. It is grounded in online conversations encouraging individual and collective action in the face of inequality, ableism, and oppression in all forms.</p><p>Over the four years of Trump's presidency, he seems to take every opportunity to harm the disability community. For example, his administration made the already-tumultuous Social Security Disability Insurance <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahkim/2019/12/17/trump-administrations-proposed-ssdi-policy-change/?sh=508dd7934abe\">application even more complicated</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/a35d8a/trump-is-now-going-to-make-life-hell-for-immigrants-with-disabilities\">denied visas and green cards to immigrants with disabilities</a> who need government assistance, and attempted to <a href=\"https://www.disabilityscoop.com/2019/05/10/trump-administration-appeal-special-ed-ruling/26606/\">cut budgets for special education</a>. Not to mention that repealing the Affordable Care Act, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/supreme-court-affordable-care-act/2020/11/09/d7adbbf4-22a1-11eb-a688-5298ad5d580a_story.html\">which the Trump administration has attempted</a>, would make millions of Americans with <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/disability/news/2020/10/09/491428/repealing-aca-create-chaos-disability-community-pandemic/\">disabilities lose access to affordable health insurance</a>. Needless to say, it's been a fearful and stressful couple of years for the disability community.</p><p>Which is why Biden's inclusion of our community in his victory speech was the light at the end of the tunnel we desperately needed. While the acknowledgment lasted for a split second in his whole speech, it made Americans with disabilities ‚Äî including myself ‚Äî feel seen in such a significant way. Throughout history, especially for the past four years, people with disabilities have been forced to set the bar very low. However, Biden's inclusion of our community in his speech has offered us a glimmer of hope and recognition that we have been looking for all along. He has even designated a <a href=\"https://joebiden.com/covid19-disabilities/\">specific disability-inclusion component</a> in his COVID-19 relief plans and laid out a detailed plan to ensure the <a href=\"https://joebiden.com/disabilities/\">advancement of people with disabilities in all sectors of life</a>.</p><p>Throughout his presidential campaign, Biden has been open about his<a href=\"https://www.health.com/mind-body/joe-biden-stutter\"> own speech disability</a> and shamelessly embraced and accepted <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/article/hunter-biden-struggles-with-addiction-remind-me-of-my-own\">his son Hunter's addiction and mental health issues</a>. President Franklin D. Roosevelt was the <a href=\"https://www.fdrlibrary.org/polio\">only US president who used a wheelchair</a>, but he <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-fdr-hid-his-paralysis-from-american-public-even-while-campaigning-2019-4\">deliberately hid his disability</a> ‚Äì paralysis from polio ‚Äì from the public. It took until 2020, but it is so refreshing to finally have a president who both acknowledges the disability community and is honest with his own disability.

before your eyes over the next few weeks.&#160;</p><p>\"Look at the process that we're following,\" Dr. Peter Marks, the leader of the Food and Drug Administration's biologics center, said in a Friday phone interview with Business insider. \"We're going to have a very open process.\"</p><p>While the coronavirus pandemic rages across the country as it never has before, the hopes for a vaccine that can pull society out of this crisis have strengthened in recent days.</p><p>The pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech said on November 9 its vaccine candidate <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/pfizer-coronavirus-vaccine-success-plans-for-emergency-approval-fda-2020-9\">was more than 90% effective</a> at preventing COVID-19 in an interim analysis of a massive clinical study. The upstart Massachusetts biotech Moderna <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/moderna-coronavirus-vaccine-works-to-prevent-covid-19-company-says-2020-11\">said Monday its two-dose regimen was 94.5% effective</a>, according to preliminary results from a late-stage trial.</p><p>But the intense effort to develop a COVID-19 shot in record time has left many Americans feeling uneasy about the quick timeline. <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/pharmalot/2020/11/10/harris-poll-covid19-vaccine-masks-distancing/\">Recent</a> <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/vaccines/covid-19-vaccine-answers-start-to-arrive-but-americans-still-have-concerns/\">surveys</a> have shown an increasing number of Americans are hesitant to get a COVID-19 shot.&#160;</p><p>It's ultimately up to the FDA to decide whether it will authorize the experimental coronavirus vaccines, and the vetting process is expected to take weeks, Marks said. By taking time rather than rushing to an authorization, the hope is to build up more conviction in the final products.</p><p>\"What we need here is confidence,\" Marks said. \"Everything that we are trying to do here, this is all about ensuring the public re-develops the kind of trust they once had in vaccines.\"</p><p><em><strong>Read more: <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/moderna-coronavirus-vaccine-development-inside-the-lab-ceo-interview-2020-3\">'</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/moderna-coronavirus-vaccine-development-inside-the-lab-ceo-interview-2020-3\">Crazy hours, short nights': The inside story of how a buzzy biotech upstart developed a potential coronavirus vaccine in record time</a></em></p><h2>'We have to take the amount of time that we need to take'</h2><p>Despite the encouraging reports, the data still has to be scrutinized before any shot is rolled out to the public.</p><p>That's where Marks comes in as the director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. He'll be overseeing the coronavirus vaccine review process, and said he is intent on running a transparent process to build trust.</p><p>Even amid a surging pandemic with rising levels of infections, hospitalizations, and deaths in the US, Marks is sticking to the steps.</p><p>That is, don't hold your breath for an overnight FDA approval or emergency OK for Pfizer or Moderna. </p><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fb29d8b402d49001924f1a5?format=jpeg\" alt=\"FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research Director Dr. Peter Marks\" height=\"2737\" width=\"3650\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA&#39;s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research\n<p class=\"copyright\">FDA</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Marks said said it would take \"weeks\" to review any vaccine application.</p><p>\"We have to take the amount of time that we need to take,\" Marks said. \"The caveat here with saying this word 'weeks' is there are situations whereby the quality of what comes in and the complexity of what comes in will determine how long it will take to do a review that we can feel very confident in.\"</p><p>If that vetting process isn't followed, Marks said he would resign from the agency.&#160;</p><p>\"You will see me leave if somebody said 'we're not going to look at the data, just get the thing approved,'\" he said.&#160;</p><p><em><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/insider-pfizer-biontech-historic-coronavirus-vaccine-program-2020-11\">How the pharma giant Pfizer teamed up with a little-known biotech to develop an effective coronavirus vaccine in record time</a></em></p><h2>A long regulatory road ahead, with the goal of building public trust</h2><figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5f3adc16a3eafa001de068d8?format=jpeg\" alt=\"vaccine\" height=\"600\" width=\"1200\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Steve Parsons-WPA Pool/Getty Images</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><p>Before a vaccine is approved, companies have to submit it to the FDA for review.&#160;</p><p>Neither Moderna or Pfizer have even submitted an application for emergency use authorization (EUA) to regulators yet. Both companies are still collecting the required safety information from trial participants and anticipate submitting to the FDA in the next couple weeks.</p><p>From there, the FDA has its own process to follow. Career scientists will pore over the data and ultimately make a recommendation to authorize a vaccine. The agency will also consult a group of independent experts to share their advice.&#160;</p><p>This expert panel, known as an advisory committee, will take some time to set up, Marks said. The FDA needs time to prepare briefing documents that summarize the data and set the agenda for the panel's meeting.&#160;</p><p>\"I can't give you an exact timing, but it's going to be a matter of weeks between when we get a submission and having an AdComm,\" Marks said.</p><p>This isn't bureaucratic red tape ‚Äî the advisory committee meeting is one of the public's best views into the review process. The group will pick apart the data in a publicly broadcasted meeting and ultimately vote on whether or not to authorize the shot.&#160;</p><p>\"They'll hear some of the warts, as well as some of the benefits,\" Marks said on what the public could expect. \"I think that is actually what truth looks like. I think actually people are better than we think at seeing what the truth really is and recognizing that.\"</p><p>The FDA's own review will then carry on, taking into consideration the expert panel's perspective. The agency isn't required to follow the expert panels' recommendations, but often does so.&#160;</p><p>Now that the vaccine frontrunners appear to be highly effective, all eyes will soon turn to the FDA for the next steps. Marks said the agency is ready for the challenge that lies ahead.</p><p>\"We feel motivated ourselves to move as quickly as we possibly can,\" Marks said. \"This is not coming from anyone outside of the agency or inside of the agency except ourselves, because we understand how important this is.\"</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/fdas-peter-marks-on-the-coronavirus-vaccine-review-process-2020-11'>Business Insider</a></div><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=M_9lDlmaXeM:k2Ql3zIisbE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=M_9lDlmaXeM:k2Ql3zIisbE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=M_9lDlmaXeM:k2Ql3zIisbE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=M_9lDlmaXeM:k2Ql3zIisbE:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=M_9lDlmaXeM:k2Ql3zIisbE:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=M_9lDlmaXeM:k2Ql3zIisbE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?a=M_9lDlmaXeM:k2Ql3zIisbE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=M_9lDlmaXeM:k2Ql3zIisbE:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/M_9lDlmaXeM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 16:43:55 +0000","feedId":22,"bgimg":"https://i.insider.com/5faeef0a402d49001924eec1?format=jpeg","linkMd5":"5d9bcd8b24d8510f390a48ec349e9814","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx27/cdn12@2020_6/2020/11/16/16-46-20-170_b69dcc2239476344.webp","destWidth":910,"destHeight":682,"sourceBytes":33494,"destBytes":33494,"author":"adunn@businessinsider.com (Andrew Dunn)","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://i.insider.com/5f3fcfc042f43f001ddfe41b?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx16/cdn16@2020_5/2020/11/16/16-46-25-007_c7713d0d9e7a6fd2.webp","https://i.insider.com/5fb29d8b402d49001924f1a5?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx11/cdn95@2020_1/2020/11/16/16-46-27-927_06e048b0a7fdb14e.webp","https://i.insider.com/5f3adc16a3eafa001de068d8?format=jpeg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx10/cdn23@2020_2/2020/11/16/16-46-28-784_1f67ed7b39c39aaf.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=yIl2AUoC8zA":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx21/cdn55@2020_4/2020/11/16/16-46-27-479_cc3ef43fc8ff5801.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=M_9lDlmaXeM:k2Ql3zIisbE:F7zBnMyn0Lo":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx15/cdn24@2020_2/2020/11/16/16-46-27-916_9fe11a6edc258f15.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=M_9lDlmaXeM:k2Ql3zIisbE:V_sGLiPBpWU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx13/cdn19@2020_6/2020/11/16/16-46-27-281_f0f1e03f91b17574.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?d=qj6IDK7rITs":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn36@2020_4/2020/11/16/16-46-24-391_740defb435ea442b.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/businessinsider?i=M_9lDlmaXeM:k2Ql3zIisbE:gIN9vFwOqvQ":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx5oss/cdn59@2020_6/2020/11/16/16-46-22-352_6542c59620515c08.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/businessinsider/~4/M_9lDlmaXeM":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx12/cdn57@2020_2/2020/11/16/16-46-20-016_12b47e7b873dbc3e.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1605545138320},{"createdTime":"2020-11-17 00:45:38","updatedTime":"2020-11-17 00:45:38","title":"Dow soars 450 points to new record as Moderna's vaccine update boosts investor optimism","link":"https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-news-today-sp500-near-records-moderna-vaccine-data-2020-11","description":"<figure>\n\t<img src=\"https://i.insider.com/5fb280e41c741f0019ac9ed2?format=jpeg\" alt=\"NYSE Traders\" height=\"2618\" width=\"5237\" charset=\"\">\n<figcaption>\n<p class=\"copyright\">Brendan McDermid/Reuters</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure><ul><li><strong>US equities soared on Monday after <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/moderna-coronavirus-vaccine-works-to-prevent-covid-19-company-says-2020-11\">Moderna's encouraging vaccine update</a> lifted hopes for a complete economic recovery.</strong></li><li><strong>Moderna announced Monday that its experimental coronavirus vaccine was 94.5% effective at preventing COVID-19 in trial patients.

The Post also reported that the Maricopa County attorney's office said no ballots were rejected and that if they are, voters have an opportunity to cast another one. A Republican-aligned group <a href=\"https://www.democracydocket.com/2020/11/right-wing-group-bails-on-sharpiegate/\">abandoned the legal fight</a> after Maricopa County officials challenged the factual basis for the lawsuit, and the Trump campaign <a href=\"https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2020/11/CV2020-014248-Complaint.pdf\">lost the fight soon afterward</a>.</li><li>The Trump campaign <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-election-lawsuit-arizona/trump-campaign-files-lawsuit-over-rejected-vote-claims-in-arizona-idUKKBN27O02I\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">filed a lawsuit</a> in state court alleging that Maricopa County was improperly rejecting ballots cast by some voters. The case remains <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/11/10/arizona-ballot-curing/\">pending</a>.</li></ul><h2>Key cases and Supreme Court rulings before Election Day</h2><h3>Pennsylvania</h3><p>In Pennsylvania, the state Supreme Court ruled that election officials could receive mail-in ballots until November 6 as long as they are postmarked by Election Day. Republicans requested an immediate stay from the US Supreme Court that would have blocked the state Supreme Court's ruling.</p><p>But the US Supreme Court was <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/supreme-court-allows-3-day-extension-pennsylvania-ballot-counting-n1243949\">deadlocked at 4-4</a>, leaving the lower court's ruling in place. Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito voted to grant Republicans' request, while Chief Justice John Roberts, and Justices Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan, and Sonia Sotomayor dissented.</p><p>Justice Amy Coney Barrett declined to participate in the case \"because of the need for a prompt resolution of it and because she has not had time to fully review the parties' filings,\" the court said in a statement. However, Barrett has not recused herself, meaning she could cast a decisive fifth vote when the Supreme Court takes up the case again.</p><h3>North Carolina</h3><p>In a similar case brought by Republicans in <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/supreme-court-pennsylvania-north-carolina-ballots\">North Carolina</a>, the Supreme Court ruled that ballots received up to nine days after November 3 could be counted as long as they are postmarked by Election Day.</p><p>The decision came after the Trump campaign and Republicans asked in two separate cases for the high court to put back in place a June statute from the state's Republican-controlled Legislature that would have allowed ballots to be counted only if they were received up to three days ‚Äî not nine ‚Äî after Election Day.</p><p>Five justices ‚Äî Roberts, Kavanaugh, Breyer, Kagan, and Sotomayor ‚Äî ruled against reinstating the statute. Gorsuch, Alito, and Thomas dissented, while Barrett did not participate in the North Carolina case.</p><h3>Wisconsin</h3><p>Republicans notched a victory in a case involving the deadline to receive ballots in Wisconsin. The US Supreme Court ruled against reviving an <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/20/20A64/157562/20201013163056082_Swenson%20v%20Bostelmann%20Appendix.pdf\">appeals court decision</a> that would have allowed election officials to receive absentee ballots up to six days after Election Day.</p><p>The court's five conservative justices ‚Äî Roberts, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, Thomas, and Alito ‚Äî ruled against reviving the lower court's ruling, while the three liberals ‚Äî Breyer, Kagan, and Sotomayor ‚Äî dissented.</p><p>The Wisconsin case made headlines because of Kavanaugh's and Kagan's <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/26/politics/read-supreme-court-wisconsin-ballot-deadline-roberts-kagan/index.html\">dueling opinions</a>.</p><p>Kavanaugh, a Trump-appointed justice who was confirmed to the high court in 2018, wrote in a concurring opinion that all ballots should be received by Election Day.</p><p>\"Those States want to avoid the chaos and suspicions of impropriety that can ensue if thousands of absentee ballots flow in after election day and potentially flip the results of an election,\" he wrote. \"And those States also want to be able to definitively announce the results of the election on election night, or as soon as possible thereafter.\"</p><p>Kagan fired back in a sharp dissent, taking issue with Kavanaugh's assertion that the arrival of absentee ballots after Election Day could \"flip\" the results of the race.</p><p>\"Justice Kavanaugh alleges that 'suspicions of impropriety' will result if 'absentee ballots flow in after election day and potentially flip the results of an election,'\" she wrote. \"But there are no results to 'flip' until all valid votes are counted. And nothing could be more 'suspicio[us]' or 'improp[er]' than refusing to tally votes once the clock strikes 12 on election night. To suggest otherwise, especially in these fractious times, is to disserve the electoral process.\"</p><h3>Texas</h3><p>A federal court in Texas and the state's Supreme Court denied two Republican requests to throw out nearly 130,000 ballots that were cast via drive-thru polling sites in Harris County, one of Texas' most heavily Democratic areas.</p><p>The Texas Supreme Court <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2020/11/01/texas-drive-thru-votes-harris-county/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">rejected a request from Republican candidates and activists</a> to toss the ballots. US District Judge Andrew Hanen, appointed by President George W. Bush, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/texas-drive-thru-ballots-case-ruling-federal-judge-throws-out-2020-11\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reached the same conclusion</a> and denied the second request from GOP candidates and a right-wing radio host.</p><p>Hanen ruled that the plaintiffs did not have the standing to sue and ask that ballots that were legally cast be discounted. However, he ordered the county to set aside the 127,000 ballots in case an appeals court disagreed with him and ultimately threw those votes out.</p><p><em>This article has been updated with new information.</em></p><ul class=\"read-more-links\"><li>Read more:</li><li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/late-mail-ballots-supreme-court-case-wont-help-trump-2020-11\">Ballots arriving late in the mail won't save Trump</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/texas-drive-thru-ballots-case-ruling-federal-judge-throws-out-2020-11\" data-read-more-link=\"\" data-e2e-name=\"read-more-link\">A federal judge threw out a Republican effort to invalidate 127,000 ballots cast at drive-thru voting locations in Texas</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/why-pennsylvania-texas-minnesota-segregating-ballots-in-case-thrown-out-2020-11\" data-read-more-link=\"\" data-e2e-name=\"read-more-link\">Pennsylvania, Texas, and Minnesota are setting aside some of their ballots in case a judge throws out the votes.
