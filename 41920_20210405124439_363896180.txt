Whether you’re the first to innovate, the first to build, or the first to address a problem, going from zero to one is no simple task. There are so many open questions to answer, so many unknown variables to consider.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2009, Alex Shevchenko, Dima Lider, and I started an English writing assistance company. From the beginning, we were trying to define a new technological space. We knew it would be a long road, but our mission was clear early on: We wanted to improve lives by improving communication. </span></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-41846\" src=\"https://contenthub-static.grammarly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12-Year-GIFS_Style-Frames_EN_WhiteBG_GIF-1.gif\" alt=\"Grammarly's Founding in 2009\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With our previous company, MyDropBox, we had built a product to help keep </span><a href=\"https://www.grammarly.com/blog/plagiarism-checker/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">plagiarism</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> out of students’ writing. This led us to ask a serious underlying question: Why do people choose to plagiarize in the first place? Could it be that they were finding it difficult to communicate what they meant in their own voice?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><div class=\"tool__product\" onclick=\"window.Grammarly.follow('https://www.grammarly.com/jobs/openings?utm_medium=engContent&#38;utm_source=chMidButton&#38;utm_medium=engContent&#38;utm_source=chMidButton');\">\n  <div class=\"tool__product-icon\"></div>\n  <div class=\"tool__product-copy-container\">\n    <div class=\"tool__product-copy\">\n      <div class=\"tool__product-headline\">Join us!</div>\n      <div class=\"tool__product-note\">Shape the way millions of people communicate</div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"tool__product-button\">Open Roles</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Turning an idea into reality</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We first tested our theory by launching an online editor as a paid subscription product. The company quickly became cash-flow positive, and we found a new name for our venture: Grammarly. In these early days, we focused primarily on grammatical error correction (GEC) to help students with their writing. We felt that if we could assist with the basic building blocks of the English language—with the mechanics of writing—maybe we could help people have more confidence in their work and not feel the need to lift text from other sources.</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-41847\" src=\"https://contenthub-static.grammarly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12-Year-GIFS_Style-Frames_EN_WhiteBG_GIF-2.gif\" alt=\"Launch of the Grammarly Editor\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We were thrilled that our early product attracted the attention of Brad Hoover, who joined as our CEO in 2011. Our company was growing, and we took care to formally distill our </span><a href=\"https://www.grammarly.com/jobs/life\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">values</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> into a framework that would inform everything we did. Grammarly was driven by being ethical, adaptable, gritty, empathetic, and remarkable. This turned out to spell EAGER—and that also fit us very well.</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-41848\" src=\"https://contenthub-static.grammarly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12-Year-GIFS_Style-Frames_EN_WhiteBG_GIF-3.gif\" alt=\"Grammarly's EAGER Values\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we grew, we learned more every day about how we could improve and expand. People around the world told us that they were using our product for all different kinds of communication—from </span><a href=\"https://www.grammarly.com/blog/email-writing-tips/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">personal emails</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to </span><a href=\"https://www.grammarly.com/blog/college-essay-tips/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">student essays</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to high-stakes </span><a href=\"https://www.grammarly.com/blog/reader-center-professional-communication/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">professional </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">writing</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

This new business model unlocked major new opportunities for us, and we followed up by further releasing the Grammarly browser extension—for </span><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/grammarly-for-safari/id1462114288?mt=12\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Safari</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/grammarly-1/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Firefox</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and </span><a href=\"https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/cnlefmmeadmemmdciolhbnfeacpdfbkd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Edge</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—to offer support wherever people were typing. </span></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-41849\" src=\"https://contenthub-static.grammarly.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12-Year-GIFS_Style-Frames_EN_WhiteBG_GIF-4.gif\" alt=\"Grammarly Releases Browser Extension in 2015\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Grammarly team was on its way to making a large-scale positive impact on communication—even beyond what Alex, Dima, and I could have dreamed about.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Building a digital writing assistant for everyone</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I think about the global company we are today, I take great pride in how far we’ve come.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We sharpened support on sites where people have a lot of important writing to do, such as </span><a href=\"https://www.grammarly.com/blog/grammarly-google-docs-sidebar/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google Docs</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or </span><a href=\"https://www.grammarly.com/blog/linkedin-business-goals/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LinkedIn</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.
