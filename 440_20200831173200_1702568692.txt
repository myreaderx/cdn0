When it initially launched last November, Stadia boasted a modest amount of playable games, but things have changed pretty quickly, with a ton of games being made available in the months that have come, and many more on the horizon.</p>\n\n<ul class=\"end jumplist\">\n<li>Get a jumpstart on things: <a href=\"https://store.google.com/product/stadia?srp=/product/stadia_founders_edition\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Stadia Premiere Edition</a> ($100 at the Google Store)</li>\n<li>If you want to buy separately: <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2Fc%2F221109%2F615614%2F10014%3FsubId1%3DUUacUdUnU75620YYr%26subId2%3Ddac%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.bestbuy.com%252Fsite%252Fgoogle-chromecast-ultra-4k-streaming-media-player-black%252F5578628.p%253FskuId%253D5578628&#38;token=ORI4sWgL\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Chromecast Ultra</a> ($70 at Best Buy)</li>\n<li>Control with assistant: <a href=\"https://store.google.com/product/stadia_controller\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Stadia controller</a> ($70 at the Google Store)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 class=\"tabs tab\">Full Google Stadia game list</h2>\n\n<ul class=\"col3\">\n<li>Assassin's Creed Odyssey</li>\n<li>Attack on Titan 2: Final Battle</li>\n<li>Borderlands 3</li>\n<li>Celeste</li>\n<li>Crayta</li>\n<li>Cris Tales</li>\n<li>DOOM</li>\n<li>Darksiders Genesis</li>\n<li>Destiny 2</li>\n<li>Doom 64</li>\n<li>DOOM Eternal</li>\n<li>Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2</li>\n<li>Embr</li>\n<li>F1 2020</li>\n<li>Farming Simulator 2019</li>\n<li>Final Fantasy XV</li>\n<li>Football Manager 2020</li>\n<li>Get Packed</li>\n<li>Ghost Recon Breakpoint</li>\n<li>Grid</li>\n<li>Gylt</li>\n<li>Hello Neighbor</li>\n<li>Jotun: Valhalla Edition</li>\n<li>Just Dance 2020</li>\n<li>Just Shapes &#38; Beats</li>\n<li>KONA</li>\n<li>Kine</li>\n<li>Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris</li>\n<li>Little Nightmares</li>\n<li>Lost Words: Beyond the Page</li>\n<li>Metro 2033 Redux</li>\n<li>Metro Exodus</li>\n<li>Metro: Last Light Redux</li>\n<li>Monopoly</li>\n<li>Monster Boy and the Cursed Kingdom</li>\n<li>Monster Energy Supercross 3</li>\n<li>Mortal Kombat 11</li>\n<li>MotoGP20</li>\n<li>NBA 2K20</li>\n<li>Octopath Traveler</li>\n<li>One Hand Clapping</li>\n<li>Orcs Must Die! 3</li>\n<li>PGA Tour 2K21</li>\n<li>Panzer Dragoon: Remake</li>\n<li>PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds</li>\n<li>Power Rangers: Battle For the Grid</li>\n<li>Rage 2</li>\n<li>Red Dead Redemption 2</li>\n<li>Rise of the Tomb Raider</li>\n<li>Rock of Ages 3: Make &#38; Break</li>\n<li>Samurai Shodown</li>\n<li>Serious Sam Collection</li>\n<li>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</li>\n<li>Spitlings</li>\n<li>Stacks on Stacks (On Stacks)</li>\n<li>SteamWorld Dig</li>\n<li>SteamWorld Dig 2</li>\n<li>SteamWorld Heist</li>\n<li>SteamWorld Quest</li>\n<li>Strange Brigade</li>\n<li>Sundered: Eldritch Edition</li>\n<li>Superhot</li>\n<li>Superhot: Mind Control Delete</li>\n<li>The Crew 2</li>\n<li>Tom Clancy's The Division 2</li>\n<li>The Elder Scrolls Online</li>\n<li>The Turing Test</li>\n<li>Thumper</li>\n<li>Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition</li>\n<li>Trials Rising</li>\n<li>Wave Break</li>\n<li>West of Loathing</li>\n<li>Windbound</li>\n<li>Wolfenstein: Youngblood</li>\n<li>Zombie Army 4</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 class=\"tab\">List of games coming to Google Stadia in the future</h2>\n\n<ul class=\"col2\">\n<li>Assassin's Creed Valhalla</li>\n<li>Baldur's Gate III </li>\n<li>CHORUS</li>\n<li>Cyberpunk 2077</li>\n<li>DIRT 5</li>\n<li>Dead by Daylight</li>\n<li>Destroy All Humans (Remastered)</li>\n<li>El Hijo - A Wild West Tale</li>\n<li>FIFA</li>\n<li>Far Cry 6</li>\n<li>Gods &#38; Monsters</li>\n<li>Hello Neighbor: Hide &#38; Seek</li>\n<li>Hitman </li>\n<li>Hitman 2</li>\n<li>Hitman 3</li>\n<li>Just Dance 2021</li>\n<li>Madden NFL </li>\n<li>Mafia 2 Remastered</li>\n<li>Mafia 3 Remastered</li>\n<li>Marvel's Avengers</li>\n<li>Monster Jam Steel Titans</li>\n<li>NBA 2K21</li>\n<li>Outcasters</li>\n<li>Outriders</li>\n<li>Rainbow Six Quarantine</li>\n<li>Relicta</li>\n<li>Republique</li>\n<li>Serious Sam 4</li>\n<li>Sniper Elite 4</li>\n<li>Spiritfarer</li>\n<li>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</li>\n<li>Super Bomberman R Online</li>\n<li>WWE 2K Battlegrounds</li>\n<li>Watch Dogs: Legion</li>\n<li>Windjammers 2</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"end\">Some of these games are scheduled to release later this year, and some are scheduled to launch later in the future.

As of March 6, all three phones are <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/best-places-buy-galaxy-s20-less\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">available for purchase</a>.</p> \n   <p>You can pick up the S20 at most major carriers and retailers in the U.S., with many of them offering generous promotions and discounts to help you save some cash. Right now, Samsung is offering up to a $500 instant credit when you trade-in an eligible device.</p> \n   <p>Outside of Samsung, you'll also find deals from Amazon, Verizon, T-Mobile, and plenty more. The S20 lineup is undoubtedly expensive, but if you know where to look, it's fairly easy to save a <em>lot</em> of money.</p> \n   <h2 id=\"handson\">First thing's first, check out our Galaxy S20 reviews!</h2> \n   <div class=\"article-body__video\">\n    <div class=\"video_iframe\">\n     <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SRkK6lKu3cw?modestbranding=0&amp;html5=1&amp;rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;wmode=opaque&amp;loop=0&amp;controls=1&amp;autohide=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;theme=dark&amp;color=red&amp;enablejsapi=1\" width=\"682\" height=\"400\" class=\"video-filter video-youtube vf-srkk6lku3cw\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </div> \n   <!--/video--> \n   <p>Before you dive too deep into this guide, a good place to start is by checking out our full reviews of the S20 lineup.</p> \n   <p>As you'd probably expect, the <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s20-ultra-review\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">S20 Ultra</a> is a <em>really</em> good phone. Its 120Hz AMOLED display is a thing of beauty, Samsung's build quality is as good as ever, and the upgraded camera system is a lot of fun to shoot with. Samsung went all out with the phone, and the end result is a device that packs in just about every feature imaginable.</p> \n   <p>We don't blame you for wanting an S20 Ultra of your own this very second, but keep in mind that it is not a perfect phone. The 120Hz refresh rate is a massive drain on battery life, Samsung's in-screen fingerprint sensor is a pain to use, and there's no getting around the $1,400 asking price.</p> \n   <div class=\"article-body__video\">\n    <div class=\"video_iframe\">\n     <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/s5QWeYVQxD8?modestbranding=0&amp;html5=1&amp;rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;wmode=opaque&amp;loop=0&amp;controls=1&amp;autohide=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;theme=dark&amp;color=red&amp;enablejsapi=1\" width=\"682\" height=\"400\" class=\"video-filter video-youtube vf-s5qweyvqxd8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </div> \n   <!--/video--> \n   <p>Alternatively, you could just get the <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s20-plus-review\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Galaxy S20+</a> . It's $200 less than the S20 Ultra while being every bit as good. The digital zooming isn't <em>quite</em> as impressive and the battery is smaller, but it's also much easier to handle thanks to its smaller size and puts a significantly lesser dent in your wallet.</p> \n   <p>Then, there's the baby <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s20-review\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Galaxy S20</a>. You might be inclined to think that the baseline S20 is the least exciting on the bunch, but it's actually the one we'd recommend to most people. It has the smallest price tag, is easy to use in one hand, and offers basically all of the same features of the more expensive S20+.</p> \n   <h2 id=\"models\">Which Galaxy S20 model should you buy?</h2> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s20\" title=\"Samsung Galaxy S20: Everything you need to know!\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/article_images/2020/02/galaxy-s20-all-models-grey-4.jpg?itok=KO_DzWuY\" /></a></p> \n   <p>Speaking of the different models, let's take a closer look at what each one is bringing to the table.</p> \n   <p>At their core, the S20, S20+, and S20 Ultra are very similar. All three phones have 120Hz displays, Qualcomm's Snapdragon 865 processor, expandable storage, water resistance, and wireless charging. However, similar to what we saw last year with the S10e, S10, and S10+, there are also clear differences between them.</p> \n   <p>While the S20 isn't cheap with a starting price of $1000, it is <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s20-plus-vs-s20\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">the lesser phone of the trio</a>. It has the fewest cameras, smallest battery, and doesn't connect to mmWave 5G networks. Then again, it's the S20 version that'll put the smallest dent in your wallet and is a good choice if you prefer phones with smaller screen sizes.</p> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s20-ultra-vs-s20-plus\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">In the middle of the bunch is the S20+</a>, offering modest improvements in all of the areas where it differs from the regular S20. If you step all the way up to the S20 Ultra, you're getting the biggest and baddest S20 experience possible — though it is going to cost you.</p> \n   <h2 id=\"specs\">These are all of the specs</h2> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s20\" title=\"Samsung Galaxy S20: Everything you need to know!\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/article_images/2020/02/galaxy-s20-vs-s20-plus-grey-1.jpg?itok=dlNgje5M\" /></a></p> \n   <p>Samsung doesn't mess around with specs for its Galaxy S phones, and that idea has carried over to the S20 lineup.</p> \n   <p>Whether we're talking about the S20, S20+, or S20 Ultra, these are flagship phones through and through.

The Galaxy S9 and S10 had fine cameras, but compared to what's been offered by the rest of the competition, Samsung's efforts in this department have felt lukewarm.</p> \n   <p>That changes with the S20 lineup, and it all starts with the S20 and S20+. Both phones still have a 12MP lens for the primary camera, but the big improvement is that the pixels are about 30% larger so that substantially more light can be let into a shot. The telephoto camera has also been upgraded, now featuring a 64MP sensor with 3x lossless zoom. If ultra-wide is more your thing, this year's sensor brings 40% larger pixels which should help in low-light scenarios.</p> \n   <div class=\"media-gallery-wrap\">\n    <div class=\"media-gallery-flat\">\n     <div data-title=\"Galaxy S20 Ultra main camera sample\" data-big=\"/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/xlarge/public/article_images/2020/02/20200220_162205.jpg?itok=H0pffdTE\" data-source=\"Android Central\" class=\"flat-img \" style=\"background-image:url(/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/w800h450crop/public/article_images/2020/02/20200220_162205.jpg?itok=H0pffdTE);\"></div>\n     <div data-title=\"Galaxy S20 Ultra main camera sample\" data-big=\"/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/xlarge/public/article_images/2020/02/20200220_185508.jpg?itok=bazvKbyp\" data-source=\"Android Central\" class=\"flat-img \" style=\"background-image:url(/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/w800h450crop/public/article_images/2020/02/20200220_185508.jpg?itok=bazvKbyp);\"></div>\n     <div data-title=\"Galaxy S20 Ultra main camera sample\" data-big=\"/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/xlarge/public/article_images/2020/02/20200220_161645.jpg?itok=MlA6BIiU\" data-source=\"Android Central\" class=\"flat-img \" style=\"background-image:url(/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/w800h450crop/public/article_images/2020/02/20200220_161645.jpg?itok=MlA6BIiU);\"></div>\n     <div data-title=\"Galaxy S20 Ultra ultra-wide camera sample\" data-big=\"/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/xlarge/public/article_images/2020/02/20200221_090859.jpg?itok=oR7u271V\" data-source=\"Android Central\" class=\"flat-img \" style=\"background-image:url(/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/w800h450crop/public/article_images/2020/02/20200221_090859.jpg?itok=oR7u271V);\"></div>\n     <div data-title=\"Galaxy S20 Ultra ultra-wide camera sample\" data-big=\"/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/xlarge/public/article_images/2020/02/20200220_160447.jpg?itok=mKPbT1Du\" data-source=\"Android Central\" class=\"flat-img \" style=\"background-image:url(/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/w800h450crop/public/article_images/2020/02/20200220_160447.jpg?itok=mKPbT1Du);\"></div>\n    </div> \n    <!--/media-gallery-flat-->\n   </div> \n   <p>Those are all worthwhile improvements, but where things get really interesting is when you look at the Galaxy S20 Ultra.</p> \n   <p>It offers a massive 108MP primary camera, using pixel binning to take pictures that come out as 12MP shots.

We could go on and on about getting into the specifics, but the tl;dr is that photos look really, really good. With the main sensor, specifically, we're seeing significant improvements with detail and natural bokeh thanks to the huge sensor size.

Thankfully, it doesn't have to be. We've spent a lot of quality time with all models of the S20, ensuring we can keep you in the loop on how to get the most out of the phones.</p> \n   <p>For starters, you'll want to know how to do all of the basics on the S20 — whether that's <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/how-quickly-access-notifications-galaxy-s20\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">accessing your notifications</a>, <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/how-enable-dark-mode-galaxy-s20\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">enabling dark mode</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/how-change-and-edit-camera-modes-galaxy-s20\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">customizing the various camera modes</a>. These are all small things on their own, but once you learn to master them all, you'll be able to have the S20 work for you rather than against you.</p> \n   <p>There are also some more specific features to play around with, such as <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/how-change-galaxy-s20-refresh-rate-120hz-or-60hz\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">changing the Galaxy S20's refresh rate</a>. The 120Hz mode looks absolutely gorgeous, but because it's refreshing at twice the speed of 60Hz, it also uses a lot more battery. By switching back and forth between these two modes, you can choose to favor performance or battery life whenever you please.</p> \n   <p>Another great feature is <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/how-turn-live-caption-galaxy-s20\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Live Caption</a>, which uses on-device tech to display captions for any audio or video that's playing from your Galaxy S20. Not only is it great from an accessibility standpoint, but it can also be really convenient if you're trying to watch a YouTube video in private and don't want to rely on YouTube's generally awful closed captioning.</p> \n   <h2 id=\"upgrade\">Should you upgrade from an older Galaxy phone?</h2> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s20\" title=\"Samsung Galaxy S20: Everything you need to know!\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/article_images/2019/02/galaxy-s10-s10-plus-s10e-all-white.jpg?itok=7GhO4guC\" /></a></p> \n   <p>There's no denying that the S20 lineup is mighty impressive, but if you already have an older Galaxy phone, do you really need to upgrade? Samsung builds its phones to last, so if you have an <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s20-vs-galaxy-s10\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">S10</a> or <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s20-vs-galaxy-s9\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">S9</a>, chances are you can probably hold onto it for a little while longer and be just fine.</p> \n   <p>On the flip side, when you take into consideration all of the upgrades offered by the S20, there's also an argument to be made as to why you should upgrade. The 120Hz display is a big deal, the camera improvements are nothing to scoff at, and you get ample future-proofing with the Snapdragon 865, minimum of 12GB of RAM, etc.</p> \n   <p>Ultimately, it comes down to whether or not you're happy with your current Galaxy handset and how much you value the upgrades offered by the Galaxy S20.</p> \n   <h2 id=\"compare\">How the S20 lineup compares to other handsets</h2> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s20\" title=\"Samsung Galaxy S20: Everything you need to know!\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/article_images/2020/05/galaxy-s20-plus-oneplus-8.jpg\" /></a></p> \n   <p>In that same breath, it's also worth pitting the Galaxy S20 up against phones from other manufacturers. Samsung is far from the only company making quality smartphones, meaning the S20 needs to make an argument as to why you should buy it over everything else being offered.</p> \n   <p>Looking at the regular S20, it has some stiff competition <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-8-vs-galaxy-s20\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">coming from the OnePlus 8</a>. While you do give up on some features like wireless charging and water resistance with OnePlus's phone, you end up with a very similar experience for hundreds of dollars less. Especially in a market that's incredibly price-conscious right now, that's a big deal. There's a similar argument to be made when <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-8-pro-vs-galaxy-s20-plus\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">comparing the Galaxy S20+ and OnePlus 8 Pro</a>, as you still have a sizeable price difference even with the Pro's added features and improved cameras over the regular OnePlus 8.</p> \n   <p>And, of course, we have to talk about how the Galaxy S20 Ultra compares against <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-vs-galaxy-s20-ultra\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Samsung's own Note 20 Ultra</a>. Both phones brandish the Ultra name and have two of the highest price tags around, though it's pretty clear to us which of them is the better buy.</p> \n   <h2 id=\"colors\">Five colors are up for grabs this year</h2> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s20\" title=\"Samsung Galaxy S20: Everything you need to know!\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/article_images/2020/02/galaxy-s20-group-three-colors-1.jpg?itok=do4DJYn5\" /></a></p> \n   <p>Samsung has been known to offer some truly great colors for its smartphones, and that's <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/which-color-galaxy-s20-should-i-buy\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">something we're seeing yet again with the S20</a>.</p> \n   <p>There are five available colors this time around, including Cloud Blue, Cloud Pink, Cosmic Grey, Cosmic Black, and a Best Buy exclusive in the form of Aura Blue. There's nothing as extravagant as the Galaxy Note 10's Aura Glow, but the colors that are offered all look great.</p> \n   <p>Cloud Blue and Cloud Pink are have a pleasing pastel feeling that allows them to stand out without being overbearing, with Cosmic Grey and Cosmic Black existing for folks that like to keep things as simple as possible. Aura Blue is also a sight to behold, but it's not the easiest to get your hands on.</p> \n   <h2 id=\"accessories\">You'll want some accessories, and these are the best ones</h2> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s20\" title=\"Samsung Galaxy S20: Everything you need to know!\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/article_images/2020/02/samsung-galaxy-s20-cases-9.jpg?itok=FjjeBm9u\" /></a></p> \n   <p>The Galaxy S20 is a phenomenal phone on its own, but it's not something that should be used naked. A screen protector is a must to keep its jaw-dropping display intact, while a case will ensure the phone doesn't get ruined during a drop/fall.</p> \n   <p>There are also other types of accessories to consider for your shiny new phone, such as microSD cards, wireless chargers, and more.</p> \n   <p>If you want to make sure you get the most out of your S20, check out our roundups of the very best accessories below.</p> \n   <h3>Galaxy S20</h3> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-galaxy-s20-screen-protectors\" title=\"\" class=\"cta norewrite\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">Best Samsung Galaxy S20 Screen Protectors in 2020</a> <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-galaxy-s20-cases\" title=\"\" class=\"cta norewrite\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">Best Samsung Galaxy S20 Cases in 2020</a></p> \n   <h3>Galaxy S20+</h3> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-galaxy-s20-plus-screen-protectors\" title=\"\" class=\"cta norewrite\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">Best Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus Screen Protectors in 2020</a> <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-galaxy-s20-plus-cases\" title=\"\" class=\"cta norewrite\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">Best Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus Cases in 2020</a></p> \n   <h3>Galaxy S20 Ultra</h3> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-galaxy-s20-ultra-screen-protectors\" title=\"\" class=\"cta norewrite\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">Best Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra Screen Protectors in 2020</a> <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-galaxy-s20-ultra-cases\" title=\"\" class=\"cta norewrite\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">Best Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra Cases in 2020</a></p> \n   <!-- BEGIN RECO-BLOCK --> \n   <h2 class=\"category reco-block\">Galaxy 2020</h2> \n   <h3 class=\"product\">Samsung Galaxy S20</h3> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s20\" title=\"Samsung Galaxy S20: Everything you need to know!\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2020/02/samsung-galaxy-s20-cropped.png?itok=JnhnPMXj\" /></a></p> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Unlocked-Fingerprint-Recognition-Long-Lasting/dp/B082XY23D5?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU77243YYr\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">$850 at Amazon</a> <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2Fc%2F221109%2F615614%2F10014%3FsubId1%3DUUacUdUnU77243YYr%26subId2%3Ddac%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.bestbuy.com%252Fsite%252Fsamsung-galaxy-s20-5g-enabled-128gb-unlocked-cloud-blue%252F6395747.p%253FskuId%253D6395747&amp;token=N0WuOpfZ\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">$850 at Best Buy</a> <a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1543089-REG/samsung_sm_g981uzaaxaa_galaxy_s20_sm_g981u_128gb.html/BI/20079/KBID/13844/SID/UUacUdUnU77243YYr\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">$1000 at B&amp;H</a></p> \n   <p class=\"subtitle\">Samsung's latest flagships have it all</p> \n   <p class=\"end\">Hoping to dominate the smartphone market in 2020, Samsung is doing so with three phones — the Galaxy S20, S20+, and S20 Ultra.

news-summary\">What you need to know</h2>\n\n<ul class=\"end\">\n<li>OnePlus is moving OxygenOS away from a stock Android design to one that hews more closely towards Samsung's OneUI.</li>\n<li>The company says the move is part of a desire to improve stock Android.</li>\n<li>OxygenOS's redesign is intended to improve one-hand usability on large devices, a space the company says Google's own software isn't good at.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>OxygenOS is getting a redesign with version 11, and it has proved to be controversial with fans. The software is moving away from what one could see as a system inspired by Google's stock Android to one that more closely resembles other Android OEMs.</p>\n\n<p>OnePlus today shared the reasoning behind that, <a href=\"https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/a-peek-inside-oxygenos-11.1291271/\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">writing on their official forums</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As screens increase in size, so does the unused white space. We wanted to make the most of that space while keeping the interface easy to use. We conducted A/B testing with our users to determine the best size of the headline, and found that 65% prefer slightly smaller headlines. Also, 80% of users tested preferred titles with subtitles rather than without. The result is a new headline-body hierarchy that streamlines information delivery in OxygenOS 11.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The company further noted that the changes were also being done to adapt Android to one-handed mobile use:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We also know that stock Android hasn't been optimized for one-handed usage on a larger display, so we set out to make it easier for you to use. We analyzed how people use phones and looked at anthropometric data to design a UI for more comfortable one-handed use.</p>\n  \n  <p>Since people hold their phones at the bottom, it's naturally more difficult to reach the top of the phone.

As phones grow bigger, Google's stock Android indeed lacks many of the adaptions that OEMs have made to accommodate them — including features Apple's more restricted iOS offers.</p>\n\n<p>Despite all that, OnePlus stands to disappoint fans, many of whom have chosen it for its stock Android-like looks and even affectionately refer it as stock+. While OnePlus has never been shy about trying to improve on stock Android, some forum users have expressed that they find a visual change like this a bridge too far.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"category reco-block\">Get More OnePlus 8</h3>\n\n<h4 class=\"product\">OnePlus 8 &#38; 8 Pro</h4>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/article_images/2020/04/oneplus-8-pro-render-official.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"1705\" alt=\"\" class=\"image-large  image-portrait\"></p>\n\n<p>\n<span itemprop=\"reviewRating\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Rating\" class=\"article-rating article-rating--inline app-none\">\n  <span class=\"article-rating-stars\">\n                  \n    <span class=\"article-rating-star fa fa-customstar\"></span>\n                    \n    <span class=\"article-rating-star fa fa-customstar\"></span>\n                    \n    <span class=\"article-rating-star fa fa-customstar\"></span>\n                    \n    <span class=\"article-rating-star fa fa-customstar\"></span>\n                    \n    <span class=\"article-rating-star fa fa-customstar-half\"></span>\n      </span>  <meta itemprop=\"bestRating\" content=\"5.0\">\n  <meta itemprop=\"worstRating\" content=\"0.0\">\n  <meta itemprop=\"ratingValue\" content=\"4.5\">\n</span>\n\n</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Flinks%2F100048248%2Ftype%2Fdlg%2Fsid%2FUUacUdUtUoneplus8YYr%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2F8&#38;token=gM7L2JDv\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">OnePlus 8 from $699</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Flinks%2F100048248%2Ftype%2Fdlg%2Fsid%2FUUacUdUtUoneplus8YYr%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2F8-pro&#38;token=0f5e6Unq\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">OnePlus 8 Pro from $899</a></p>\n\n<ul class=\"end\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-8-pro-review\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">OnePlus 8 Pro review</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-8-review\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">OnePlus 8 review</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-8-pro-vs-oneplus-8\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">OnePlus 8 Pro vs. OnePlus 8: Which should you buy?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-8-pro-cases\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Best OnePlus 8 Pro Cases</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-8-cases\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Best OnePlus 8 Cases</a></li>\n</ul></div></div></div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/androidcentral/~4/TdMxNDF0mgU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","descriptionType":"html","publishedDate":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 16:35:54 +0000","feedId":440,"bgimg":"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2020/08/oxygenos11.jpg","linkMd5":"d946654871ab7cb2190e96dccd615d7d","bgimgJsdelivr":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn23@2020_3/2020/08/31/17-31-29-386_7912b76ae807629b.webp","destWidth":800,"destHeight":409,"sourceBytes":21634,"destBytes":21634,"author":"Michael Allison","articleImgCdnMap":{"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2020/08/oxygenos11.jpg":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx1/cdn23@2020_3/2020/08/31/17-31-29-386_7912b76ae807629b.webp","https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/article_images/2020/04/oneplus-8-pro-render-official.png":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx6/cdn34@2020_2/2020/08/31/17-31-36-980_75b042d2c94ba331.webp","http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/androidcentral/~4/TdMxNDF0mgU":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/myreaderx/cdn37@2020_2/2020/08/31/17-31-38-313_0987afdaab5a1b3d.webp"},"publishedOrCreatedDate":1598895089203},{"createdTime":"2020-09-01 01:31:29","updatedTime":"2020-09-01 01:31:29","title":"Get these smart doorbells and make Alexa your butler","link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/androidcentral/~3/Xg9K7nft5Wk/best-smart-doorbells-support-alexa","description":"<div class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"><div class=\"field-items\"><div class=\"field-item even\"><p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-doorbells-support-alexa\" title=\"Best Smart Doorbells That Support Alexa 2020\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_blw/public/article_images/2019/05/ring-doorbell-2-hayato-2.jpg?itok=4zcbwfPF\"></a></p>\n\n<p>I started researching the best smart doorbells that were compatible with Alexa because I'm an introvert by nature. Indeed, one of the things I love most about smart doorbells is the ability for me not to have to get off of my keister and answer every knock or ring at the front door. We've compiled a great here, but my favorite is the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Staging-Product-Not-Retail-Sale/dp/B0849J7W5X/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?tag=androidcentralb-20&#38;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU82037YYr\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Ring Video Doorbell 3</a>.

Once again, the company took what was popular and successful from the previous generation device (the Ring Video Doorbell 2), and made some tweaks to make it even better.</p>\n\n<p>The Ring Video Doorbell 3 brings 5.0 GHz Wi-Fi support, advanced motion detection, and custom motion and audio privacy zones. It comes in two colors, but you can also purchase a lot of first and third-party faceplates to change up your doorbell look.</p>\n\n<p>This device was introduced alongside the <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/ring-video-doorbell-3-vs-ring-video-doorbell-3-plus\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Ring Video Doorbell 3 Plus</a>, and for the most part, shares all of the same features as its more expensive sibling, except pre-roll video. Pre-roll video is footage that is shot a few seconds before the button on the doorbell is pressed and can give you a bit of context about your visitor(s). If that's something you're interested in, you'll need to fork over extra cash just to get it. If it doesn't matter that much to you, save your money for the Ring Protect subscription!</p>\n\n<p>Speaking of subscriptions, Ring's Protect plans are some of the most affordable and comprehensive around. Starting at $30 per year on up to $100 per year, they offer video history for 60 days, video saving and sharing, extended device warranties, and the ability to connect with Ring Alarm monitoring.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"pros\">Pros:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>HD quality video</li>\n<li>Can power with a battery or wired connection</li>\n<li>Uses infrared night vision</li>\n<li>Interchangeable faceplates to customize the appearance</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"cons\">Cons:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>No Pre-Roll video</li>\n<li>Requires subscription to access recordings</li>\n</ul>\n\n<!-- BEGIN RECO-BLOCK -->\n\n<h2 class=\"category reco-block\">Best Overall For Alexa</h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"product\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ring Video Doorbell 3</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-doorbells-support-alexa\" title=\"Best Smart Doorbells That Support Alexa 2020\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2019/11/ring-videodoorbell-official-render.jpg?itok=EpOzJxB2\"></a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Staging-Product-Not-Retail-Sale/dp/B0849J7W5X/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?tag=androidcentralb-20&#38;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU82037YYr\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">$150 at Amazon</a> </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2Fc%2F221109%2F615614%2F10014%3FsubId1%3DUUacUdUnU82037YYr%26subId2%3Ddac%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.bestbuy.com%252Fsite%252Fring-video-doorbell-3-satin-nickel-venetian-bronze%252F6402552.p%253FskuId%253D6402552%26ourl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.bestbuy.com%252Fsite%252Fring-video-doorbell-3-satin-nickel-venetian-bronze%252F6402552.p&#38;token=02837p8Q\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">$150 at Best Buy</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DkXQk6%252AivFEQ%26mid%3D44583%26u1%3DUUacUdUnU82037YYr%26murl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.newegg.com%252Fp%252F0XZ-01KP-00031&#38;token=m-w1uJ7o\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">$150 at Newegg</a> </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"subtitle\">A premium Alexa doorbell for a mid-range price</p>\n\n<p class=\"end\">The Ring Video Doorbell 3 comes in battery or wired versions and even works on 5GHz Wi-Fi bands.</p>\n\n<!-- END RECO-BLOCK -->\n\n<h2 class=\"separator\">Best Budget Doorbell: <em>Ring Video Doorbell (2nd Gen)</em></h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-doorbells-support-alexa\" title=\"Best Smart Doorbells That Support Alexa 2020\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2019/11/ring-videodoorbell.jpg?itok=Y71oeOCB\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Once you install your Ring Video Doorbell (2nd Gen) and ask Alexa to discover new devices, you can start checking on who is at the door on the Fire TV from the comfort of your couch. Interacting with people at the door while you are elsewhere is undoubtedly a great convenience feature, but it's also a safety feature as well. Having that heads up that a camera and microphone provide can offer protection if you're by yourself and are unsure of your mysterious visitor.</p>\n\n<p>This second-generation video doorbell now records in 1080p with night vision, so you get a much better viewing experience. As with its more premium models, Ring brought privacy zones and audio privacy capabilities to this entry-level device. It is motion-activated, so even if someone doesn't \"ring\" the doorbell, you can still see if they were snooping around your front stoop.</p>\n\n<p>While it is true that Ring requires a subscription to view and access video recordings and your archive, the Ring plans start as low as $3 a month. The field of view is slightly smaller than on the Ring Video Doorbell 3, but that shouldn't make too much of a difference when it comes to most front porch spaces. While this device works on the 2.4GHz spectrum that is good for devices further from your router, you won't be able to take advantage of the faster speeds of your 5GHz network.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"pros\">Pros:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Most affordable Ring doorbell</li>\n<li>1080p recording and night vision</li>\n<li>Improved privacy zones and audio privacy</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"cons\">Cons:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>No infrared night vision</li>\n<li>Requires subscription to access recordings</li>\n</ul>\n\n<!-- BEGIN RECO-BLOCK -->\n\n<h2 class=\"category reco-block\">Best Budget Doorbell</h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"product\">Ring Video Doorbell (2nd Gen)</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-doorbells-support-alexa\" title=\"Best Smart Doorbells That Support Alexa 2020\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2019/11/ring-videodoorbell-official-render.jpg?itok=nhyRcsJQ\"></a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Wi-Fi-Enabled-Doorbell-Nickel/dp/B00N2ZDXW2?tag=androidcentralb-20&#38;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU82037YYr\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">$100 at Amazon</a> </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2Fc%2F221109%2F615614%2F10014%3FsubId1%3DUUacUdUnU82037YYr%26subId2%3Ddac%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.bestbuy.com%252Fsite%252Fring-video-doorbell-2nd-gen-satin-nickel%252F6396004.p%253FskuId%253D6396004&#38;token=K65lEMV9\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">$80 at Best Buy</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"subtitle\">An inexpensive smart doorbell</p>\n\n<p class=\"end\">Ring makes a whole line of newer doorbells with more premium features, but this entry-level device still does the job quite well.</p>\n\n<!-- END RECO-BLOCK -->\n\n<h2 class=\"separator\">Best View: <em>Arlo Video Doorbell</em></h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-doorbells-support-alexa\" title=\"Best Smart Doorbells That Support Alexa 2020\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2020/02/arlo-video-doorbell-lifestyle.jpg?itok=vmy0hRMf\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Arlo devices typically do well in our security camera roundups because they are feature-packed for a fair price. The Arlo Video Doorbell brings a lot of the same great capabilities as some of the others on this list and bests them in one key area: field of view.</p>\n\n<p>The Arlo Video Doorbell has a 180-degree field of view and records at a 1:1 aspect ratio instead of 16:9 like most video doorbells. This means that you get to see more above and below your subject, while still seeing a lot of the side to side.</p>\n\n<p>Arlo takes that concept of seeing more even further by building in what it calls Foresight, or pre-roll recording to the device. This lets you see what happens from the moment motion is detected up to the point where the button is pressed, and the video is recorded.</p>\n\n<p>While it's unfortunate that you can't record locally, like with other Arlo cameras, you do get the benefit of three months of Arlo's Smart cloud storage.

The August smart locks are some of the most advanced and highest-rated around, so it should come as no surprise that it offers one of my favorite smart doorbell devices: the August Doorbell Cam Pro.</p>\n\n<p>A major reason that you might elect to go with this doorbell over others is its integration with August's smart locks. You can easily let friends or family into your home remotely through the app or via Alexa. Installing this device might present some headaches for the non-technical, as it only comes in a wired version, and its unusual shape (square vs. rectangle) might present some mounting challenges. This thing just looks cool. While some of the doorbells from Ring, Nest, and others have a very utilitarian look and feel to them, this beauty from August looks like a doorbell from the future.</p>\n\n<p>The 960x1280 camera has the convenience of a built-in, motion-activated floodlight so that it can record full-color HD footage, even at night. It has a narrower field of view than some of the competition, which might not make it ideal for wide porches or for viewing your full front yard. August generously offers up to 24 hours of free video storage with its basic subscription, which comes included with the purchase of your Doorbell cam. However, to get more storage, you'll need to sign up for its <a href=\"https://support.august.com/about-august-video-recording-subscriptions-H1MvUkR_G\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Premium or Premium Plus options</a>, which are still a good bargain.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"pros\">Pros:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Full HD camera with built-in floodlight</li>\n<li>Free video storage for 24 hours</li>\n<li>Pairs with August smart locks for remote entry</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"cons\">Cons:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Only wired option available</li>\n<li>Additional storage requires premium plans</li>\n<li>The odd shape may present installation challenges</li>\n</ul>\n\n<!-- BEGIN RECO-BLOCK -->\n\n<h2 class=\"category reco-block\">Best Style</h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"product\">August Doorbell Cam Pro</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-doorbells-support-alexa\" title=\"Best Smart Doorbells That Support Alexa 2020\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2019/11/august-doorbell-cam-pro-official-render.png?itok=VQeeuUye\"></a></p>\n\n<ul class=\"cta shop\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1943169%2F612734%2F9383%3Fsharedid%3D159229%26subId1%3DUUacUdUnU82037YYr%26subId2%3Ddac%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.walmart.com%252Fip%252FAugust-Doorbell-Cam-Pro-2nd-generation-Wired-Smart-Doorbell%252F260214670&#38;token=hrLROUl_\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">$174 at Walmart</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"subtitle\">Gorgeous doorbell</p>\n\n<p class=\"end\">This futuristic-looking doorbell camera works with your August smart lock to provide security and convenience to your entryway.</p>\n\n<!-- END RECO-BLOCK -->\n\n<h2 class=\"separator\">Best Value: <em>eufy Video Doorbell</em></h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-doorbells-support-alexa\" title=\"Best Smart Doorbells That Support Alexa 2020\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2019/11/eufy-video-doorbell-official-lifestyle.jpg?itok=vY6bECG0\"></a></p>\n\n<p>The eufy brand may not be familiar to you, but you probably know its parent company, Anker, which also makes products that work with Alexa. The eufy Video Doorbell is a great value for many reasons, including its quality hardware specs and its great storage solution.</p>\n\n<p>This doorbell has a wide-angle field of view, a motion-activated camera that can record five seconds before the initial alert you receive, and it can record 2K HD video for clearer playback. Speaking of video playback, the eufy Video Doorbell comes with 4GB of local storage secured with 256-bit military-grade encryption, so your footage stays on-site and secure. Eufy does not charge any monthly or annual fees to access that storage. The device is also IP65 water-resistant and has a 180-day battery life.</p>\n\n<p>As with most of these smart cameras, the eufy Video Doorbell allows you to interact with visitors through the app or via Alexa, but perhaps the coolest feature is that you can set up pre-recorded responses for when you're unavailable or \"unavailable.\" You can program the doorbell to tell the delivery person to \"just leave it on the porch, please.\"</p>\n\n<p>Since this doorbell requires a wired connection and may not work with existing chimes, professional installation may be recommended for some folks who might not be handy. It's also worth noting that many have called into question the accuracy of eufy's person/motion detection features, saying that they get more false positives than expected. If you have shrubs or trees near the front door, this is something you may want to keep in mind.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"pros\">Pros:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Wireless chime included</li>\n<li>Free storage with no subscription fees</li>\n<li>HD resolution, HDR, and Distortion Correction</li>\n<li>Water-resistant</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"cons\">Cons:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Wired connection only</li>\n<li>Professional installation may be required</li>\n<li>Person identification and motion detection is buggy</li>\n</ul>\n\n<!-- BEGIN RECO-BLOCK -->\n\n<h2 class=\"category reco-block\">Best Value</h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"product\">eufy Video Doorbell</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-doorbells-support-alexa\" title=\"Best Smart Doorbells That Support Alexa 2020\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2019/11/eufy-video-doorbell-official-render.jpg?itok=Km8o0Qad\"></a></p>\n\n<ul class=\"cta shop\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Security-Doorbell-Resolution-Real-Time-Response/dp/B07R3WY95C/ref=sr_1_10?tag=androidcentralb-20&#38;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU82037YYr\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">$160 at Amazon</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2Fc%2F221109%2F615614%2F10014%3FsubId1%3DUUacUdUnU82037YYr%26subId2%3Ddac%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.bestbuy.com%252Fsite%252Feufy-smart-wi-fi-video-doorbell-wired-and-battery-black%252F6404967.p%253FskuId%253D6404967%26ourl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.bestbuy.com%252Fsite%252Feufy-smart-wi-fi-video-doorbell-wired-and-battery-black%252F6404967.p&#38;token=7bkcuEOR\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">$170 at Best Buy</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1943169%2F612734%2F9383%3Fsharedid%3D159229%26subId1%3DUUacUdUnU82037YYr%26subId2%3Ddac%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.walmart.com%252Fip%252FEufy-Security-Anker-Wi-Fi-Video-Doorbell-2K-Resolution-Real-Time-Response-No-Monthly-Fees-Secure-Local-Storage-Free-Wireless-Chime-Requires-Existing-%252F606113061&#38;token=JapF5U0l\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">$160 at Walmart</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"subtitle\">No hidden strangers or fees</p>\n\n<p class=\"end\">The eufy Video Doorbell is a great value because it offers quality smart features without hidden fees or subscriptions.</p>\n\n<!-- END RECO-BLOCK -->\n\n<h2 class=\"separator\">Best for Renters: <em>Ring Peephole Cam</em></h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-doorbells-support-alexa\" title=\"Best Smart Doorbells That Support Alexa 2020\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2019/11/ring-peephole-cam-official-lifestyle.jpg?itok=w8V18bOZ\"></a></p>\n\n<p>I say this doorbell is best for renters, but really it's great for anyone who has a solid door with a peephole in it (or space for a peephole). With minimal installation, you get three products in one device — a doorbell, a peephole, and a camera. Now that's value!</p>\n\n<p>Ring has done a great job in creating a product that even a layperson like me can install easily (and without wires!), and it included most of its best tech smarts in the process. That being said, if your door doesn't already have a peephole, you'll have to physically drill one. If that describes your situation, then this may not be the best option for you.</p>\n\n<p>This doorbell features a 1080p HD video camera that allows you to interact with people at your doorstep through your Alexa device or in the Ring app. The camera doesn't record HDR video, and while the field of view is still better than most, it's slightly lower than the Ring Video Doorbell 2. Recordings are triggered by a motion sensor that you can customize to set motion zones and only receive notifications if those areas are activated.</p>\n\n<p>One cool feature that the Peephole Cam offers that no other Ring Doorbell can claim is Knock Detection. Because this device is located where the peephole is and not where a traditional doorbell would be, some visitors may not know that you do have a doorbell. So if they simply knock on the door out of habit, you'll still get a notification that you have a guest just like you would if they press the doorbell button. <em>Insert your knock-knock jokes here Alexa.</em></p>\n\n<h3 class=\"pros\">Pros:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>HD video recording</li>\n<li>Passthrough peephole </li>\n<li>Knock detection feature</li>\n<li>Same great smart features as found on other Ring doorbells</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"cons\">Cons:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Requires subscription to access recordings</li>\n<li>Need a peephole to use</li>\n<li>Doesn't support HDR video</li>\n</ul>\n\n<!-- BEGIN RECO-BLOCK -->\n\n<h2 class=\"category reco-block\">Best for Renters</h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"product\">Ring Peephole Cam</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-doorbells-support-alexa\" title=\"Best Smart Doorbells That Support Alexa 2020\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2019/11/ring-peephole-cam-official-render.jpg?itok=DGRAqOuM\"></a></p>\n\n<ul class=\"cta shop\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Peephole-Cam-doorbell-installation/dp/B07WHMQNPC/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?tag=androidcentralb-20&#38;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU82037YYr\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">$80 at Amazon</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2Fc%2F221109%2F615614%2F10014%3FsubId1%3DUUacUdUnU82037YYr%26subId2%3Ddac%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.bestbuy.com%252Fsite%252Fring-peephole-cam-video-doorbell-battery-satin-nickel%252F6379205.p%253FskuId%253D6379205%26ourl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.bestbuy.com%252Fsite%252Fring-peephole-cam-video-doorbell-battery-satin-nickel%252F6379205.p&#38;token=N3yRhyvL\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">$80 at Best Buy</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1543338-REG/ring_8spps9_0en0_hd_wireless_peephole_cam.html/BI/20079/KBID/13844/SID/UUacUdUnU82037YYr\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">$100 at B&#38;H</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"subtitle\">Eye spy people through the peephole</p>\n\n<p class=\"end\">With a peephole viewer and knock detection, this doorbell combines the best of the old with the smarts of the new.</p>\n\n<!-- END RECO-BLOCK -->\n\n<h2 class=\"separator\">Best Without a Camera: <em>Arlo Audio Doorbell</em></h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-doorbells-support-alexa\" title=\"Best Smart Doorbells That Support Alexa 2020\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2019/11/arlo-audio-doorbell-official-lifestyle.jpg?itok=sABNHl6v\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Perhaps you aren't looking to spend a lot of money, but you still want some smart functionality for your doorbell. Maybe you don't have an Echo Show or Fire TV and can't easily look at the video feeds without opening an app on your phone <em>like an animal</em>. Whatever the case, we have a solution for you in the Arlo Audio Doorbell.</p>\n\n<p>With the Arlo Audio Doorbell, you can still utilize Alexa's services to interact with visitors through your Echo or Echo Dot by using your voice. Perhaps, even more interesting is how visitors can record messages for you through the device, which you can listen to remotely or at your leisure.</p>\n\n<p>As mentioned above, this doorbell does not feature a camera. Still, you can connect it to an existing Arlo smart camera to get the same benefits as some of the more premium video doorbells. Alternatively, you can start with just the Audio Doorbell and pick up an Arlo smart camera at a later date to save money in the near term. Another potential drawback to this device is that it requires a smart hub, which you'll have to purchase separately if you want it to work with Alexa.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"pros\">Pros:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Inexpensive</li>\n<li>Can add-on video cameras later if you wish</li>\n<li>Visitor messaging feature</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class=\"cons\">Cons:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>No camera or video recording</li>\n<li>Requires a hub to work with Alexa</li>\n</ul>\n\n<!-- BEGIN RECO-BLOCK -->\n\n<h2 class=\"category reco-block\">Best without a Camera</h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"product\">Arlo Audio Doorbell</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-doorbells-support-alexa\" title=\"Best Smart Doorbells That Support Alexa 2020\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2019/11/arlo-audio-doorbell-official-render.png?itok=i0Tojo9W\"></a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Arlo-Audio-Doorbell-Wire-free-Weather-resistant/dp/B07HXNPJLJ/ref=sr_1_5?tag=androidcentralb-20&#38;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU82037YYr\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">$57 at Amazon</a> </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2Fc%2F221109%2F615614%2F10014%3FsubId1%3DUUacUdUnU82037YYr%26subId2%3Ddac%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.bestbuy.com%252Fsite%252Farlo-audio-doorbell%252F6293664.p&#38;token=LF9bbRbo\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop cta-auto-inserted cta-auto-inserted--bestbuy norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">$58 at Best Buy</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"subtitle\">Just the basics</p>\n\n<p class=\"end\">The Arlo Audio Doorbell gets you halfway toward a fully smart interactive doorbell for about half the price of its competitors.</p>\n\n<!-- END RECO-BLOCK -->\n\n<h2 class=\"separator\">Alexa, who's at the door?</h2>\n\n<p>I'm on record as saying that a smart doorbell is one of the most useful smart home devices that you can get for your home.

Based in the British Virgin Islands, the company started back in 2009 and prides itself on operating a no logging policy meaning data is kept super secure.</p>\n\n<p>In 2017, one of the company's servers was used to delete information related to a Russian ambassador assasination. Despite the server being seized and searched, no information was found. The company used this as an example to show that its level of privacy was superb. It did recognise that it can be used negatively but also stated it still stands for our right to privacy and freedom online.</p>\n\n<p>At the time of publishing ExpressVPN sports an impressive 3,000 servers that span 94 countries and 160 locations across the planet.</p>\n\n<h2>Pricing and plans</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xvtelink.com%2Foffer%2Fandroidcentral%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.expressvpn.com%252Ftechradar%26offer%3D3monthsfree%26a_fid%3D744%26data1%3DUUacUdUnU87106YYr&#38;token=yavJwLhL\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"></a><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/expressvpn-review\" title=\"ExpressVPN Review\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2020/03/expressvpn-pricing.png\"></a></p>\n\n<p>ExpressVPN keeps pricing pretty easy to understand with <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xvtelink.com%2Foffer%2Fandroidcentral%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.expressvpn.com%252Forder%26offer%3D3monthsfree%26a_fid%3D744%26data1%3DUUacUdUnU87106YYr&#38;token=fzmBTIqq\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">three tiers</a>. It starts out with a month-to-month rate of $12.95 which requires no commitments. If you want to make a saving and are willing to commit to a longer term contract then you can pay for six months at $9.99 per month. This is billed every six months at $59.94.</p>\n\n<p>The best savings comes from purchasing the annual plan, which comes in at $99.95 for the period. It's a one-time fee that gives you full access for the year, and using <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xvtelink.com%2Foffer%2Fandroidcentral%3Foffer%3D3monthsfree%26a_fid%3D744%26data1%3DUUacUdUnU87106YYr&#38;token=M8ydVl16\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">our special link</a> you can actually drop that price down to just $6.67 per month and get three free months of access.</p>\n\n<p>If you're not sure which to go for and that one month is too much then you can download the iOS or <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/best-vpn-apps-android\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Android client</a> and give it a seven day free trial. Of course if you do want to try that month even that's technically free as you have a 30-day money-back guarantee. You don't need a reason to cancel, there isn't any smallprint and all you need to do is tell ExpressVPN and you'll get your money back.</p>\n\n<h2>Testing and performance</h2>\n\n<p>One of the best ways to test a VPN is on performance, which means speed. This is easily done using a speed test site – even Google has one right there on its search site now. We used this and other speed test sites to assess just how fast the servers are running.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/expressvpn-review\" title=\"ExpressVPN Review\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2020/03/expressvpn-speed-tests.jpg\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Our tests initially run across two locations – the U.S. and the UK. We then test other locations, like Asia, Australia and Africa, with benchmarking sites to see how fast they run over longer distances.</p>\n\n<p>For the US we used a 400MB line and ran multiple tests using different locations. To start, we ran a speed test with no VPN enabled. That's the top result shown on the right. The second one is using the \"Smart Server\" location, and the third one was a server based in Singapore. As you can see, the speeds do drop off the further away the connections are, but they are still reasonable, and are actually some of the best we've experienced in our testing.</p>\n\n<p>In the UK the testing line was a 75Mbps connection. The results were 60 to 65Mbps which was very impressive when you consider how near the top-end of that line's capacity this reached.</p>\n\n<p>From the UK as a base, connecting to the likes of Hong Kong, India or Australia we were getting speeds of a decent 60Mbps. Go to Brazil or Kenya and the results suffered with the top-end hitting nearer to the 20Mbps mark.</p>\n\n<h2>Features</h2>\n\n<p>The mighty 3,000 servers of ExpressVPN, spanning those 94 countries and 160 locations worldwide mean you can appear to be from virtually anywhere you need. The key with this many server locations is that you should always be relatively close to one so you can enjoy a fast and consistent connection speed.</p>\n\n<p>This VPN masking applies to lots of devices as well as locations. This is thanks to the clients available which span the likes of Mac, Windows, iOS, Linux, Android Chromebooks, Kindle Fire, PlayStation, Apple TV, Fire TV and more. You can also setup the VPN on a router using custom firmware. So, despite ExpressVPN limiting you to five devices used at one time, if one of them is a router that means you can connect as many devices to that as you need.</p>\n\n<p>Getting the apps up and running is super easy. It takes just a few minutes to <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/how-download-and-install-expressvpn-android\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">install ExpressVPN on your Android</a> device. The interface is very simple to understand and makes it something you'll actually want to use regularly instead of something you uninstall quickly.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/expressvpn-review\" title=\"ExpressVPN Review\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2020/03/expressvpn-dashboard.jpg\"></a></p>\n\n<p>ExpressVPN uses all its own secure servers meaning you can enjoy that no-logging as well as encryption storage so your data is safe in transit too. The company's relatively new TrustedServer Technology uses RAM to process information meaning none of your data is stored on hard drives at any time, making it even more difficult to get hold of. Also, everytime you connect to a new network, that's not trusted, ExpressVPN will fire up automatically to offer protection. Connect to a secure network again and ExpressVPN will close down so you can get top speeds as your priority.</p>\n\n<p>One of the most stand out ExpressVPN features is the 24/7 live chat support. This means you can get help with literally any issues you have – presuming it's ExpressVPN related, of course. Say you're trying to connect to Netflix while abroad but can't, the experts are there to help you find the best server so you not only get access but can enjoy the fastest speeds for what you're doing too.</p>\n\n<p>Since you can access most locations, that means you can get to most content too. For streaming the likes of Netflix, Hulu or even BBC iPlayer, this is a really decent VPN. We even got the chance to test this while in China. Initially we struggled to get access to US Netflix so we got on the 24/7 live chat. We were told exactly what server to connect to and right away we were up and running at great speed.</p>\n\n<h2>Privacy and security</h2>\n\n<p>ExpressVPN runs an encryption service across its offerings meaning 4096-bit SHA-512 RAS certificate level cover. This uses AES-256-CBC to encrypt and HMAC protection too. There's also support for Perfect Forward Secrecy meaning you get a new secret key every time you connect.</p>\n\n<p>All that is complicated tech-speak for a super encryption. It's as good as, if not better than most other VPN options out there with a few exceptions that offer double hop encryption for yet another layer of protection.</p>\n\n<p>Another highlight is DNS support in the form of DNS leak protection to stop information leaking from the tunnel while in transit. Lots of VPNs offer this but ExpressVPN goes further by running its own zero-knowledge, 256-bit encrypted DNS on all of its servers too. That essentially means you don't have to worry about attackers getting to you or your data.</p>\n\n<p>You also get a kill switch so, should you lose connection, you'll automatically be protected and hidden then too.</p>\n\n<p>The clear lack of logging is also a great way to leave your mind at ease. The company clearly states on its site: \"ExpressVPN does not and will never log traffic data, DNS queries, or anything that could be used to identify you.\"</p>\n\n<p>The British Virgin Island location helps since, despite its small size, the country regulates its own affairs. That means the UK and US don't have jurisdiction to automatically compel ExpressVPN to release any data.</p>\n\n<h2>Should you sign up?</h2>\n\n<p>ExpressVPN has a lot to like. Beyond the wide spread servers across the world there are the layers and layers of security and encryption backed by a clear no logging policy which combine to give you peace of mind security, anonymity and safety when online.</p>\n\n<p>The pricing is competitive, support is superb and performance speeds are excellent. The only downside is that you're limited to five devices, but with the ability to install this on routers that can be worked around.</p>\n\n<p>This is a tough VPN to fault. If you want even more security there are other double hop options out there and some with more servers but it's hard to find a service with a track record like ExpressVPN.

A device by the name of \"OnePlus Watch\" <a href=\"https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/oneplus-watch-revealed-by-imda-certification-may-launch-soon/\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">went through Indonesia's IMDA</a> on that date, which is the country's equivalent of the FCC here in the United States.</p> \n   <p>That suggests that the OnePlus Watch is getting very close to its eventual launch date, and when you add that together with <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/oneplus-watch-name-leaks-as-ex-employee-reveals-its-been-in-the-works-for-a-while\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">another report from <em>TechRadar</em></a> that OnePlus has \"actively been looking into a smartwatch for the last year,\" the time is right for the wearable to finally drop.</p> \n   <h2 id=\"price\">How much is the OnePlus Watch going to cost?</h2> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-watch\" title=\"OnePlus Watch: News, Leaks, Release Date, Specs, and Rumors!\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/article_images/2018/09/oneplus-logo.jpg\" /></a></p> \n   <p>If you don't know by now, OnePlus has a very close relationship with OPPO in the sense that both brands are owned and operated by BBK Electronics in China. New OnePlus smartphones are often slight deviations of OPPO handsets that come out before them, and in the case of the OnePlus Watch, we're expecting it to be a lot like the recently-released <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/oppos-wear-os-powered-smartwatch-launching-july-31\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">OPPO Watch</a>.</p> \n   <p>The OPPO Watch goes for ₹14,990 in India, which is about $205 USD. This means we should be able to look forward to a relatively low price when the OnePlus Watch launches in the United States, hopefully around that $200 marker.</p> \n   <p>Samsung's <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-3-review\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Galaxy Watch 3</a>, by comparison, starts at $400 at the lowest and goes up to $480 for the most expensive model. Even if the OnePlus Watch hits $250 or $300, it'll still have that price advantage in its favor.</p> \n   <h2 id=\"design\">What does the OnePlus Watch look like?</h2> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-watch\" title=\"OnePlus Watch: News, Leaks, Release Date, Specs, and Rumors!\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/article_images/2020/08/oppo-watch-17_0.jpg\" /></a></p> \n   <p>Not only does OnePlus's close relationship with OPPO give us a good idea of what the Watch could cost, it also provides a pretty clear picture as to what the OnePlus Watch is going to look like.</p> \n   <p>The OPPO Watch (pictured above) has a design that takes a lot of inspiration from the Apple Watch. It has a square body with rounded corners, minimal bezels around the screen, and watch bands that flow perfectly into the frame with no visible lugs.</p> \n   <p>Mock or make fun of it if you want, but it's an effective design that works well for both form and functionality. You can fit more text on a square display than you can on a circular one, and thanks to the minimal aesthetics, the OPPO Watch fits the part of a fitness accessory or something you wear to a nice dinner.</p> \n   <p>OnePlus could take some liberties with the case and watchband colors to make the design more of its own, but don't expect anything drastically different in this department.</p> \n   <h2 id=\"specs\">What specs will the OnePlus Watch have?</h2> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-watch\" title=\"OnePlus Watch: News, Leaks, Release Date, Specs, and Rumors!\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/article_images/2020/08/oppo-watch-13.jpg\" /></a></p> \n   <p>Just like the price and design, specs for the OnePlus Watch should also be virtually identical compared to the OPPO Watch. To put things into perspective, here are a few key specs of what OPPO is offering.</p> \n   <table class=\"spec-table\"> \n    <thead> \n     <tr> \n      <th>Category</th> \n      <th>OPPO Watch</th> \n     </tr> \n    </thead> \n    <tbody> \n     <tr> \n      <td>Operating System</td> \n      <td>Wear OS</td> \n     </tr> \n     <tr> \n      <td>Case Sizes</td> \n      <td>41mm <br> 46mm</br></td> \n     </tr> \n     <tr> \n      <td>Display</td> \n      <td>1.91-inch <br> AMOLED <br> 476 x 402</br></br></td> \n     </tr> \n     <tr> \n      <td>Processor</td> \n      <td>Snapdragon Wear 3100</td> \n     </tr> \n     <tr> \n      <td>Memory</td> \n      <td>1GB RAM</td> \n     </tr> \n     <tr> \n      <td>Storage</td> \n      <td>8GB</td> \n     </tr> \n     <tr> \n      <td>Water Resistance</td> \n      <td>3ATM (41mm model) <br> 5ATM (46mm model)</br></td> \n     </tr> \n     <tr> \n      <td>Battery</td> \n      <td>430 mAh</td> \n     </tr> \n    </tbody> \n   </table> \n   <p>We'd certainly love to see OnePlus opt for the newer Snapdragon Wear 4100 chipset over the outdated Wear 3100, but as of right now, it doesn't seem very likely that will happen. That could prove to be a potential deal-breaker for the OnePlus Watch, but only time will tell once we get our hands on it.</p> \n   <h2 id=\"alternative\">What should I get if I can't wait for the OnePlus Watch?</h2> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-watch\" title=\"OnePlus Watch: News, Leaks, Release Date, Specs, and Rumors!\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/article_images/2020/07/fossil-gen-5-1-year-review-2.jpeg\" /></a></p> \n   <p>While we expect the OnePlus Watch to be released relatively soon, it's hard to say for sure when that'll happen. If you're in the market for a <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Wear OS watch</a> right now and don't feel like waiting, one of the better ones you can get in 2020 is the Fossil Gen 5.</p> \n   <p>The Fossil Gen 5 offers a solid Wear OS experience, giving you a classic round design with ample features to back it up. There's built-in GPS, NFC for Google Pay, 3ATM water resistance, and a speaker for taking hands-free phone calls directly on the watch.

You'll be able to select from three crust shades: light, medium, and dark. The device can accommodate a single loaf weighing 1, 1.5, or 2 pounds.</p>\n\n<p>Measuring 10.25-by-13. 25-by-11.25 inches and weighing 10.8 pounds, this space-saving vertical baking pan is ideal for small kitchens. The machine comes with a removable kneading paddle and bread pan, along with a viewing window on the lid and interior light so you can keep an eye on the bread's progress. The LED display shows a countdown timer, the current cycle, and selected options. It will also beep when it's time to remove the paddle and provide additional audible tones to advise when it's time to add mix-ins like fruits or nuts. When the device beeps 10 times in succession, the bake cycle is done.</p>\n\n<p>The machine adds some useful features like a 13-hour delay start so you can add ingredients at night and have fresh toast with jam for breakfast. It also has a 60-minute keep-warm function, ensuring that the bread will still have that fresh-out-of-the-oven smell and temperature for an hour after it's done baking.</p>\n\n<p>This Cuisinart machine, as you can see, is packed full of features and is a great size.

This is great news for most of us because you can save some money. Plus, it opens up the market for choice.</p>\n\n<p>First, you'll need USB-C hub for your laptop, like the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AUKEY-Ethernet-Delivery-Charging-Chromebook/dp/B07Z7H3GJK/?tag=androidcentralb-20&#38;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU61031YYr\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">AUKEY Link PD Pro</a>. Chances are you can use it with your Note or Galaxy phone for DeX mode when you leave your laptop behind.

Players will be able to go back and forth between both countries.</p> \n   <p>Though Norway and England make up the core of the map, Ismail says the world still has some surprises in store that Ubisoft isn't getting into just yet.</p> \n   <h2 id=\"story\"><em>Assassin's Creed Valhalla</em> Story and characters</h2> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/assassins-creed-valhalla\" title=\"Assassin's Creed Valhalla on PS5: Setting, gameplay, release date, and everything you need to know\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/04/assassins-creed-valhalla-image-1-aum5.jpg?itok=AoZLIEdo\" /></a></p> \n   <p>As clan leader, <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/assassins-creed-valhalla-main-character-and-setting\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Eivor (male or female)</a> will lead their clan from the war-ravaged Norway to the shores of England and beyond. Their arrival is met with resistance from King Alfred of Wessex (also known as Alfred the Great) and the Saxons, who will do everything in their power to drive you from the land. Eventually Eivor comes in contact with the Assassins during their journey, thus kicking off the age-old Assassin vs. Templar conflict the series is known for.</p> \n   <p>Ubisoft is taking inspiration from Norse mythology — much like the studio did with Egyptian and Greek mythology in Origins and Odyssey, respectively — but we don't know what role the gods will play just yet. Apparently, the lore will be more grounded than what we saw in Odyssey.</p> \n   <p>The present day story will again be playable and follow Layla Hassan from the previous two titles. Ubisoft apparently found a way to \"blend the present day into a new type of experience for players,\" but it's unclear what this means.</p> \n   <h2 id=\"gameplay\"><em>Assassin's Creed Valhalla</em> Gameplay</h2> \n   <div class=\"article-body__video\">\n    <div class=\"video_iframe\">\n     <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YdzcijLhQV8?modestbranding=0&amp;html5=1&amp;rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;wmode=opaque&amp;loop=0&amp;controls=1&amp;autohide=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;theme=dark&amp;color=red&amp;enablejsapi=1\" width=\"682\" height=\"400\" class=\"video-filter video-youtube vf-ydzcijlhqv8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </div> \n   <!--/video--> \n   <p>Like Assassin's Creed Odyssey before it, Valhalla will continue the series' jump into <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/assassins-creed-valhalla-rpg\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">RPG territory</a>. Players in Valhalla will be able to forge political alliances and choose dialogue options that will affect the story. A revamped combat system now allows players to dual-wield any combination of weapons (including two shields) against a \"greater variety of enemies than ever before.\" Whether you want to brutally decapitate them with a war axe or stealthily kill them in the shadows with your <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/will-hidden-blade-return-assassins-creed-valhalla\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">hidden blade (it's back!)</a>, the choice is yours. This is all about nailing that visceral feeling of being a Viking warrior.</p> \n   <p>It seems like Ubisoft heard complaints loud and clear, because some penchants from the earlier Assassin's Creed games are returning. Not only is the hidden blade back, but it can also be upgraded so that you can instakill just about anyone, just like the good old days. Social stealth is also making a return, though it's unclear just how our viking warrior will be blending into the crowds. And when a fan asked if there would be any tombs in Valhalla, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DarbyMcDevitt/status/1260582475396505600\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Lead Writer Darby McDevitt teased</a> that there are \"many buried secrets.\"</p> \n   <blockquote class=\"pull left\"> \n    <p>Not only is the hidden blade back, but it can also be upgraded so that you can instakill just about anyone.</p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>New features include raids, settlement growing, and the ability expand your power and influence. With raids, you can pillage enemy villages and fortresses across England for valuable resources. Settlement growing appears to be like what Assassin's Creed 2 and Brotherhood offered with Monteriggioni and Rome, but greatly expanded with more depth. Players can construct and upgrade barracks, blacksmiths, tattoo parlors, and more.</p> \n   <p>One such settlement will serve as a hub for the player. \"It's at the center of our quests and the center of the decisions you make. We want players to see the consequences of their actions,\" Lead Producer Julien Laferrière told <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-04-30-assassins-creed-valhalla-reshapes-the-series-rpg-storytelling-by-giving-you-a-viking-settlement\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Eurogamer</a>.</p> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/assassins-creed-valhalla\" title=\"Assassin's Creed Valhalla on PS5: Setting, gameplay, release date, and everything you need to know\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/04/assassins-creed-valhalla-image-2-dohv.jpg\" /></a></p> \n   <p>\"It really changed the shape of the game we were making,\" Laferrière said. \"Instead of exploring one territory, then moving on to another and having no real opportunity or reason to return, the settlement changes the structure. So you'll go on an adventure and then be encouraged to come back to your settlement. It changes the way we're playing the game we're making - at least, that's the bet we're making.\"</p> \n   <p>In a first for the series, players can create customize a unique Viking raider and share it online with friends who can then use it during their own raids (though there is so co-op or multiplayer in Valhalla). Players will also be able to customize hair, tattoos, war paint and gear of their own character. Gear can be upgraded throughout the game so that a set of weapons or armor you begin the game with will still feel formidable as you progress.</p> \n   <div class=\"article-body__video\">\n    <div class=\"video_iframe\">\n     <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sGyM5Xh7Jf0?modestbranding=0&amp;html5=1&amp;rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;wmode=opaque&amp;loop=0&amp;controls=1&amp;autohide=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;theme=dark&amp;color=red&amp;enablejsapi=1\" width=\"682\" height=\"400\" class=\"video-filter video-youtube vf-sgym5xh7jf0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </div> \n   <!--/video--> \n   <blockquote class=\"pull right\"> \n    <p>Ravens are largely associated with the Norse god Odin.</p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>Instead of your trusty pet eagle to help guide you along your journey and act as some eyes in the sky, a raven will be filling that role in Assassin's Creed Valhalla. After all, ravens are largely associated with the Norse god Odin.</p> \n   <p>\"We have a bunch of new abilities for the raven,\" Laferrière said. \"We used it as a reason to re-explore the way players can explore the world so it is less reliant on UI. If you notice a distraction somewhere it's probably because there's some content there.\"</p> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/does-assassins-creed-valhalla-have-naval-combat\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Naval gameplay</a> will be a major element as well, but don't expect to be fighting on the sea often. Vikings are known for being fearsome warriors, and many battles were won because of their skills as sailors, but they didn't partake in naval combat like you'd expect. The Vikings longship will play a crucial role in traversing the map and bringing your raiding party where it needs to go. Ismail teases a lot of surprises in store with the longship, but he did not go into detail.</p> \n   <p>The company revealed that for the first time ever, players will be able to <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-valhalla-gender-eivor-animus?sf125224448=1\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">switch between male and female Eivor</a> whenever they'd like in the menu, meaning both genders are canonical to the story, though the reasoning for why this is possible was not explained. Players will also be able to play as Layla in the open-world of England. Previously, modern day characters could not be played in the historical simulation.</p> \n   <h2 id=\"release\"><em>Assassin's Creed Valhalla</em> Release date and platforms</h2> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/assassins-creed-valhalla\" title=\"Assassin's Creed Valhalla on PS5: Setting, gameplay, release date, and everything you need to know\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/field/image/2020/04/assassins_creed_valhalla_7-1vozr.jpg?itok=6PR2-Ffu\" /></a></p> \n   <p>Assassin's Creed Valhalla will release November 17, 2020 for Xbox One, Xbox Series X, PlayStation 4, <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/playstation-5\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">PS5</a>, PC (Epic Games Store and Uplay), and Stadia.

Here's everything you need to know.</p> \n   <h2 id=\"es6\">What is <em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em>?</h2> \n   <div class=\"article-body__video\">\n    <div class=\"video_iframe\">\n     <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OkFdqqyI8y4?modestbranding=0&amp;html5=1&amp;rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;wmode=opaque&amp;loop=0&amp;controls=1&amp;autohide=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;theme=dark&amp;color=red&amp;enablejsapi=1\" width=\"682\" height=\"400\" class=\"video-filter video-youtube vf-okfdqqyi8y4\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </div> \n   <!--/video--> \n   <p>The Elder Scrolls 6 would be, you guessed it, the sixth mainline game in the Elder Scrolls universe. For the uninitiated, Elder Scrolls games tend to be open-world RPGs that feature the classic Bethesda formula: critical decision making, rich and deep lore, massive breathtaking open worlds, memorable characters, and some of the most fun sidequests you'll find.</p> \n   <p>Elder Scrolls followed this formula even in the earliest days when technology wasn't fully supportive of such ambitions. It wasn't until the third entry — Morrowind — that the games began to take on the form that we've become used to, with each game being progressively more impressive than the ones before it.</p> \n   <p>Bethesda's biggest deviation came in 2014 when they released The Elder Scrolls Online, an MMORPG that would feature many of Tamriel's iconic locales in one massive world.</p> \n   <h2 id=\"story\"><em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em> What's the story so far?</h2> \n   <p>Despite The Elder Scrolls being a long-running series, the games aren't necessarily connected. With the exception of the first two titles, each Elder Scrolls game has its own storyline. They're all set in the world of Tamriel and they all feed off the same lore, but the stories are intentionally self-contained so as to allow new players to jump in wherever they want and not feel lost.</p> \n   <p>For that reason, we can't really draw any conclusions about what will happen in The Elder Scrolls 6 based on previous titles. Oblivion was all about fighting demons at the doorsteps of hell, while Skyrim was about you finding a dragon within yourself and shouting at people very loudly and violently. The Elder Scrolls 6 could be about, well, anything. Time travel? Aliens? Sweet rolls? We don't know. But you know we'll be clawing for any details we can as the months move on.</p> \n   <h2 id=\"location\"><em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em> Where will it take place?</h2> \n   <p>No one knows! To date, we've seen locales such as Morrowind, Skyrim, Cyrodiil, High Rock, and Hammerfell represented in one form or another, not including places like Elsweyr in Elder Scrolls Online.</p> \n   <p>If we assume Bethesda wants to take us to a new location, we can guess that Elder Scrolls might take place in either Elsweyr (Home of the Khajit race), Black Marsh (home of the Argonians), or Valenwood (home of the wood elves). These locations are heavily referenced throughout Elder Scrolls lore as some of the game's most prominent races come from these lands.</p> \n   <blockquote class=\"pull right\"> \n    <p>In the teaser, you can note a strange collection of peninsulas on the coast of the ocean area.</p> \n   </blockquote> \n   <p>There are theories that suggest some other lesser known locations could be featured. In the very short, uneventful, and seemingly random teaser trailer for the game, you can notice a strange collection of peninsulas on the coast of the ocean area. Interestingly enough, this terrain seems to match up with that of the lost islands of Yokuda, which was once home of the Redguards before a catastrophic event sunk much of the continent.</p> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I know the smart money's on The Elder Scrolls 6 being in High Rock, but I keep looking at these 3 peninsula in the trailer &amp; thinking about the lost island of Yokuda. That landscape does look a bit like a tidal wave scoured it flat. <a href=\"https://t.co/665lb6W4ij\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">pic.twitter.com/665lb6W4ij</a></p>— Leon Hurley (@LeonHurley) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LeonHurley/status/1006190026399547392?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">June 11, 2018</a>\n   </blockquote> \n   <p>Other guesses point to High Rock. High Rock — which is where prominent cities like Daggerfall and Shornhelm exist — was heavily featured in the first two Elder Scrolls games and in Elder Scrolls Online. The theory comes from the presence of mountainous terrain in the trailer, however, it's entirely possible that it's coincidental.</p> \n   <h2 id=\"dev\"><em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em> How far along is development?</h2> \n   <p>It's safe to say that The Elder Scrolls 6 is still largely in its planning phase. During E3 2019, Todd Howard <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPttE_fvjZM&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=4189\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">told IGN</a> that \"everyone should be very patient\" in regards to The Elder Scrolls 6, so it's likely that even if the game is currently in development, it isn't far enough along to show off in any way just yet.</p> \n   <p>On top of that, Bethesda's main studio is also working on <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/starfield\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Starfield</a> as well, which is an entirely new IP that is equally as secretive as The Elder Scrolls 6. Ahead of the company's E3 announcement, it was said that we might not even see work on The Elder Scrolls 6 begin until Starfield was close to finished, so it's truly unknown just how far along either game is.</p> \n   <p>Long story short, we still have a long wait ahead. It's an unusual move for Bethesda, who has historically preferred to announce games when they're pretty deep into development. Chalk it up to the restlessness of Elder Scrolls fans who were worried that Bethesda might be done with the series thanks to Elder Scrolls Online's existence, but they announced the game far sooner than we're used to and we'll just have to be patient.</p> \n   <h2 id=\"platforms\"><em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em> Is it coming to Xbox Series X and PS5?</h2> \n   <p>Bethesda has not announced any platforms for it, but The Elder Scrolls 6 is very likely coming to <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/playstation-5\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">PS5</a> and <a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/xbox-series-x\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\">Xbox Series X</a>. With The Elder Scrolls 6 still a few years out by most estimates and the lifecycles of the Xbox One and PS4 coming to an end, it's hard to imagine Bethesda releasing it on older hardware.</p> \n   <h2 id=\"release\"><em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em> When will it release?</h2> \n   <p>It's unknown when The Elder Scrolls 6 will release, but don't expect it for another few years. Bethesda still has to release Starfield first, and that also does not have a release date yet.</p> \n   <p>It's tough to say when we might be treated to the first details about The Elder Scrolls 6. Bethesda head Todd Howard has acknowledged the importance of keeping fans engaged with new expectations (that was the whole point of this early announcement), but he also knows it's sensible not to say too much, too fast. With the PS5 and Xbox Series X on the horizon, now might be the perfect time for Bethesda to show off more information, but the studio is focused on Starfield at the moment.</p> \n   <!-- BEGIN RECO-BLOCK --> \n   <h3 class=\"category reco-block\">Holiday 2020</h3> \n   <h4 class=\"product\">PlayStation 5</h4> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/elder-scrolls-6\" title=\"The Elder Scrolls 6: Release date, trailers, gameplay, and everything we know so far\" georiot-ignore=\"true\" class=\"norewrite\"><img src=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2020/06/ps5-regular-render-cropped-reco-box.jpg\" /></a></p> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/07A20468-F527-4562-8FB4-23F8ACBCD3A8?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU68606YYr\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">See at Amazon</a> <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2Fc%2F221109%2F615614%2F10014%3FsubId1%3DUUacUdUnU68606YYr%26subId2%3Ddac%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.bestbuy.com%252Fsite%252Fvideo-games%252Fplaystation-5%252Fpcmcat1572034351415.c%253Fid%253Dpcmcat1572034351415&amp;token=uStyzRQT\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">See at Best Buy</a> <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1943169%2F612734%2F9383%3Fsharedid%3D159229%26subId1%3DUUacUdUnU68606YYr%26subId2%3Ddac%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.walmart.com%252Fcp%252Fplaystation-5%252F3475115&amp;token=EAP_HI_G\" title=\"\" class=\"cta shop norewrite\" rel=\"nofollow\" georiot-ignore=\"true\">See at Walmart</a></p> \n   <p class=\"subtitle\">Get your hands on it before it sells out</p> \n   <p class=\"end\">The PS5 isn't available for preorder just yet, but a few retailers are letting fans sign up for notifications so they don't miss out.
